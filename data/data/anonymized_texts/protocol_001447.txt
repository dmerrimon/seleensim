 1. SYNOPSIS 
 
Name of Sponsor Company:  
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 Drug Under Study: Lasmiditan  (COL-144)  
Title of Protocol : A Study of Three Doses of Lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) Compared to 
Placebo in the Acute T ReaTment of Migr AiNe: A randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled 
parallel group study ( SPARTAN ) 
Protocol Number:  
COL MIG -302 
 Phase: 3 
 Indication: Migraine - Acute Treatment   
 
Primary Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy at 2 hours of lasmiditan 50 mg, of lasmiditan 100 mg and of 
lasmiditan 200 mg compared to placebo on migraine headache pain and the Most Bothersome Symptom (MBS ), 
as identified by the individual from the associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia and photophobia. 
 
Secondary Objectives:  To explore the time course and effect of lasmiditan 50 mg, of lasmiditan 100 mg and of 
lasmiditan 200 mg on relief of pain and on the MBS . 
 
Additional  Objectives:  To explore the effect and time course of a second dose of lasmiditan 50 mg, of 
lasmiditan 100 mg and of lasmiditan 200 mg compared to placebo on relief of pain and MBS wh en used for 
rescue and for recurrence of migraine.  To explore resource utilization during the study compared to pre- study in 
terms of cardiovascular events  and in terms of  migraine episodes.  
 
Safety Objective:  To explore the safety and tolerability  of lasmiditan 50 mg,  of lasmiditan 100 mg and  of 
lasmiditan 200 mg, as the first dose and as a second dose,  in terms of adverse events  (AEs) , physical 
examinations , vital signs,  clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead electrocardiograms ( ECGs ).  
 
Study Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoint: The proportion of subjects headache pain free at 2 hours  post dose ( defined as moderate or 
severe headache pain becoming non e)  
 
Key Secondary Endpoint: The proportion of subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours  post dose (defined as the 
associated symptom present and identified as MBS  prior to dosing  being absent  at 2 hours ).  
 
Study Design:  
This is a prospective randomized, double- blind,  placebo -controlled study in subjects with disabling migraine 
(Migraine Disability Assessment ( MIDAS) score  ≥ 11). Subject s will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.  
 
Subjec ts will be asked to treat a migraine attack with study drug on an outpatient basis.  Subjects will be provided 
with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence 
of migraine.   Each subject’s study participation will consist of a screening visit  (Visit 1) with a telephone contac t 
within 7 days to confirm eligibility , a Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks , and an End- of-Study ( EoS) visit (Visit 
2) within  one week ( 7 days ) of treating a single migraine attack.   The total time on study is approximately 11 
weeks.  
 
At the Screening visit (Visit 1)  subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA) . Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of medical history 
including migraine history , baseline physical examination (including height and weight) , vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests , 12-lead ECG and responses to the MIDAS questionnaire. Subjects will be asked about any 
concomitant medication use as well as any cardiovascular (CV) events in the last 6 months and/or related 
resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospitalizations, new treatments or treatment

 adjustments for CV disease.  A Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)  will be completed. Subjects  
will be given an electronic diary and be trained on its use to record information about their migraine, dosing their 
migraine and post -dose assessments.  Subjects will be randomized, dispensed study drug and instructed not to 
treat an attack until their e ligibility has b een confirmed by telephone once all screening evaluations are complete.  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of 7 treatment sequences to receive  lasmiditan 50 mg (L50 mg),  
lasmiditan 100 mg (L100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg (L2 00 mg) or placebo (P) for  the first dose (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio  
) and the second dose, if needed for rescue or recurrence of migraine a s follows:

Telephone Contact:  Within 7 days of Visit 1  a phone contact must be made by study staff to the subject 
confirming eligibility in the trial.  The subject will be reminded on the use of the diary and on dosing a migraine 
with study drug.   Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will begin the Treatment Period.  Subjects considered not 
eligible will be advised not to take the study drug and an appointment for an EoS/Visit 2  and the collection of 
study drug and the diary will be scheduled  within one week (7 days ) of the confirmation of eligibility phone call.  
• Treatment Period: Subjects will be asked to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing 
that the headache severity is at least moderate at that time and not improving. Subjects will record their 
response to the first dose over the next 48 hours using an electronic diary. Subjects will be asked not to use 
rescue medication until at least 2 hours after dosing with study drug and completing the 2 hour assessments.  
If the migraine does not respond at 2 hours, a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after 
the first dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used. If the migraine does respond within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs after 2 hours a second dose of study drug may be 
taken up to 24 hours after the first dose. Subjects will record their response to a second dose, taken for either 
rescue or recurrence, for 48 hours in the electronic diary. The total time for recording response to study drug 
is up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second dose is used.  Subjects are to contact the clinic to 
schedule EoS/Visit 2 within one week ( 7 days ) after 1 attack has been treated, or after 8 weeks have passed 
without treating an attack.  The total time on study is approximately 11 weeks.  
 
Subject Population: Adult  patients with a history of migraine with or without aura .  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 2968 subjects 
screened and randomized  (742 per treatment arm 
based on the first dose) to ensure that at least 2280  
subjects  (570 per treatment arm  based on the first 
dose ) complete  the Treatment P eriod   Number of Centers:  Up to 150 centers in the US  and 
rest of world (Western EU, )  
Test Product and Doses: lasmiditan 50 mg,  
lasmiditan  100 mg; lasmiditan 200 mg and matching

 Statistical Analysis:  
Efficacy:  
This multi- center, randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled clinical study is designed to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of lasmiditan 50 mg, of lasmiditan 100 mg and of  lasmiditan  200 mg vs . placebo 
in the acute treatment of migrain e based on the first dose.  Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of 
concomitant medications that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes.  
 
Efficacy will be assessed using the primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects headache pain free at 2 hours , 
defined as moderate or severe headache pain becoming none and the key secondary endpoint of the proportion 
of subjects MBS free at 2 hours  defined as the associated symptom s (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) 
present prior to dosing and identifie d by the subject to be MBS becoming absent.  
 
The primary analys es will compare the proportion of subjects who are headache pain free and the proportion of 
subjects who are MBS free  at 2 hour s in the lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo groups in the modified 
Intent -to-Treat (mITT) population.  Each of these two analyses  will be carried out using logistic regression Wald 
Chi-square test with region included in the model and will be conducted using a one-sided test at the 
alpha=0.025 level of significance . 
 
If both primary analys es are statistically significant ( one-sided, p<0.0 25), additional confirmatory hypotheses will

 be tested in the mITT  population in the following sequential order:  
 
• Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo group.  
• Proportion of subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo group.  
 
All of the above analyses will be completed using one-sided tests at the alpha=0.0 25 level of significance.  If an 
analys is is not statistically significant, then all subsequent analyses will be conducted but are designated as 
exploratory rather than confirmatory . 
  
Additional analyses will  explore the time course and effect of the first dose of lasmiditan 200 mg and of 
lasmiditan 100 mg and of lasmiditan 50 mg on features of migraine including: headache response (a reduction in 
headache pain from moderate or severe to mild or none) , vomiting, disability,  headache recurrence  and the use 
of recurrence medication, the use of rescue medication, patient global impression of change, time to headache 
relief, and time to headache pain free. Descriptive analys es will be performed on the proportion of subjects who 
are nausea free at 2 hours, the proportion who are phonophobia free 2 hours and the proportion who are photophobia free at 2 hours.  Exploratory second dose (for rescue or recurrence of migraine) comparisons 
between treatment groups will be performed. 
   
Sample Size Rationale   
This Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate that lasmiditan is effective in the treatment of acute migraine in 
adult patients  with and without aura.  The sample size was estimated based on the 2 hour headache pain free 
and associated symptoms (nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) free res ponse rates observed in the Phase 2 
study COL MIG -202. 
 
Dose Pain free  Nausea free  Phonophobia free  Photophobia free  
Placebo  7.4%  59.3%  51.9%  34.6% 
50 mg  13.9%  68.4% 58.2% 53.2%  
100 mg  13.6%  74.1%  75.3%  67.9%  
200 mg  18.8%  63.8%  59.4%  58.0%  
 For the primary endpoint of the proportion of patient s pain free at 2 hours a sample size of 570 evaluable 
subjects per arm provides power of >90% for the 50 mg dose, the 100 mg dose and the 200 mg dose.  
 In order to estimate sample size for the key secondary endpoint of proportion of patients MBS free at 2 hours , 
simulation was performed in SAS on the conditional probability of being free from any one symptom defined as 
MBS  under 4 different scenarios . For each symptom  or combination of symptoms, the likelihood of an individual 
symptom being the MBS was estimated. In the most conservative scenario (scenario 1) it was assumed that nausea would always be declared the MBS if it was present, regardless of the presence of other symptoms (phonophobia or photophobia).  The other 3 scenarios assumed lower likelihoods  of nausea to be considered 
the MBS and allowed for the other symptoms (either phonophobia or photophobia) to be considered the MBS at 
a higher rate.   This resulted in power estimates of > 95% f or MBS at a sample size of 570 for the lasmiditan 50 
mg  dose and >99% for MBS  at  sample sizes of 450 to 570 per arm for the 100 mg dose across all 4 scenarios . 
For the 200 mg dose, an average power of 71% was estimated across five seeds under the most conservative 
scenario 1. In contrast, the 3 scenarios that did  not declare nausea to be the default MBS if it was present  
estimated a greater average power of 82.6% to 91% .

 It is expected for a one-sided, two- sample comparison of proportions at the  2.5% level of significance, a sample 
size of 570 subjects per treatment arm (as defined by  the first dose)  provides >90% power to detect a difference 
in headache pain free response rates  for assumed true rates of 7.4% and 18.8% (placebo and 200 mg) , 7.4% 
and 13.6%  (placebo and 100 mg)  and 7.4% and 13.9% (placebo and 50 mg)  >90 % power for MBS for both the 
50 mg dose arm and the 100 mg dose arm and very near or higher than 80% power for MBS in the 200 mg dose arm. 
 
Safety :  
Adverse events will be summarized, and event rates will be presented by treatment arm and dose (initial dose 
and second dose for rescue or recurrence  or use of alternative rescue medication ).  Physical examinations, vital 
signs , ECG parameters  and clinical laboratory data, will be summarized by treatment arm and dose in terms of 
change from baseline status.   
 Resource Utilization:  
Resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, hospitalizations, new treatments or treatment 
adjustments for CV disease as well as visits to the emergenc y room or a physician’s office for the treatment of 
migraine will be summarized by treatment arm in terms of information reported at Screening/Visit 1 compared 
to information reported at EoS/Visit 2 . Concomitant medication use for migraine and/or pain and missed days of 
work and/or school will be summarized by treatment arm.

  Proprietary and Confidential  4. INTRODUCTION 
Migraine is a common neurological disorder and was ranked by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) in their 2010 Global Burden of Disease survey as one of 7 most debilitating conditions, 
and as the third most common disease in the world among both males  and females.[1]  
Although the introduction of triptans greatly improved the acute treatment of migraine, a large percentage of patients still lack adequate treatment. A recent study by the American Migraine 
Prevalence and Prevention (AMPP) concluded that 40% of episodic migraineurs have 
significant unmet needs; the most frequent complaints were headache- related disability (19%) 
and dissatisfaction with current medications (15% ).
[2]  In addition, concerns  about cardiovascular  
safety are believed to limit the prescription of triptans to less than 50% of migraineurs in the US. 
[3]   Hence, there is a significant unmet need for novel migraine therapies with a distinct 
mechanism of action from triptans. One such agent is lasmiditan (COL- 144). Unlike any 
approved treatment for acute migraine, lasmiditan selectively targets 5- HT 1F receptors on 
neurons in the central and peripheral trigeminal system to alleviate migraine, and lacks the 
vasoconstrictor activity inherent with triptans.   
 Lasmiditan is being developed as a novel acute therapy for migraine and to fulfill significant 
unmet  needs in migraine patients with risk factors for undiagnosed cardiovascular disease, and 
those who respond poorly to their  current prescription medication for acute migraine. The 
current mainstay migraine therapies  are chemical analogs of sumatriptan (‘triptans’), developed 
for their potent cranial vasoconstrictor  properties .
[4]  Triptans  are selective 5- HT 1B/1D receptor 
agonists and mediate their vasoconstrictor activity via 5- HT 1B receptors expressed on vascular 
smooth  muscle. [5]   As large numbers of patients were exposed to triptans, it was  established 
through post -marketing surveillance that their vasoconstrictor mechanism of action also 
conferred a risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events, some fatal. [3]  Consistent with their 
common pharmacology, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan and naratriptan all 
induced comparable dose- dependent contraction of isolated human coronary arteries .[5,6,7]   
Because of the liability of triptans to cause coronary vasospasm, they are contraindicated in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), and it is strongly recommended that they 
are not  prescribed to patients with risk factors for undiagnosed CAD (e.g., hypertension,  
hypercholesterolemia, smoker, obesity, diabetes, strong family history of CAD, female with surgical or physiological menopause, male over 40 years of age) without first undergoing a 
thorough cardiovascular  evaluation.  
 Treatment of migraineurs with known cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors is  
particularly challenging because the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, claudication,  
diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are all higher in individuals with migraine 
compared with the general population.
[8] Many migraineurs who were previously eligible for 
triptan therapy may become ineligible as they age and develop cardiovascular disease and/or 
associated risk factors. For thes e patients, there is a pressing  need for an effective migraine 
therapy with a non- vascular mechanism of action.  
 This study is a Phase 3 multicenter study in subjects with acute migraine. The study  is designed 
to determine the efficacy and safety of  lasmiditan 200 mg compared to placebo and lasmiditan 
100 mg compared to placebo given as a first dose for the treatment of a migraine attack .  A 
second dose of study drug is included in the study design to investigate the safety and efficacy 
of lasmiditan 200 mg compared to placebo and lasmiditan 100 mg compared to placebo when 
taken for rescue or when taken for recurrence  of migraine.   In addition to safety assessments, 
information will be obtained on the different dose levels of lasmiditan . Patients with  
cardiovascular risk factors will be eligible to participate in this clinical trial.  Data from this study

  Proprietary and Confidential  will be used to further investigate and confirm  the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan in the 
treatment of acute migraine in patients with risk factors for cardiovascular  disease.   
 
4.1 Background  
Lasmiditan is a highly selective and potent 5- HT 1F receptor agonist with > 470-fold higher affinity 
(Ki 2.21 nM) for the 5- HT 1F receptor than for 5- HT 1B/1D receptors in radioligand binding assays.  
Based on activation of G proteins, the agonist efficacy of lasmiditan  at the 5- HT 1F receptor was 
~80% that of 5- HT.  Lasmiditan is a pyridinoylpiperidine derivative, structurally unrelated to 
existing migraine therapies.  Lasmiditan (1 µM) was examined for its binding affinity at more 
than 50 other GPCRs, ion channels, and transporter sites, and had no significant affinities 
except at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA A channel (K i 0.29 µM).  Unlike  
diazepam,  lasmiditan  did not potentiate GABA currents in a human cloned GABA A channel 
functional assay, and hence this binding affinity was not considered to be biologically relevant.  
  
In rodent models of migraine, selective 5- HT 1F receptor agonists inhibited trigeminal nociceptive 
processing without affecting blood vessel tone .[9,10,11]  Unlike tr iptans, lasmiditan  did not constrict 
rabbit saphenous vein,[9] an assay predictive of human coronary artery constriction.[12]  
Lasmiditan is under development as a neurally acting treatment for migraine without the 
vasoconstrictor liability of triptans . 
 
4.2 Clinical Studies to Date  
Five Phase 1 studies have been completed in Europe using intravenous ( IV), sublingual, and 
oral formulations of lasmiditan .  Two European Phase 2 studies have been completed with 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine.  
 
Lasmiditan was well tolerated in healthy volunteers following 20 minute IV infusions at dose 
levels of 0.1 to 20 mg with few AEs reported (clinical study H8H- BD-LACA ).  There was a clear 
increase in the number of AEs reported following 20 minute IV infusions of 30 and 60 mg of 
lasmiditan, although most were rated as mild.  The number of AEs reported following 60 mg of lasmiditan decreased significantly when the rate of infusion was reduced from 3 to 1 mL/min 
and the infusion time was increased to 60 minutes , although the number of subjects reporting 
AEs was similar.  All subjects receiving 60 minute IV infusions of 120 and 180 mg of lasmiditan reported AEs with a similar overall frequency at each dose level.  The majority of AEs were mild 
in severity at all dose levels although there was a dose- related increase in the number of 
moderate AEs reported, with the highest incidence recorded at the two highest dose levels (120 and 180 mg of lasmiditan). The most frequently reported AEs considered to be related to t he 
study drug were somnolence, paresthesia, dizziness and hot flushes.  These occurred with rapid onset, generally within 10 minutes of the start of the infusion at all dose levels.  Adverse 
events typical for the triptans such as chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure, neck pain or 
stiffness were not reported, even after the highest dose of 180 mg was administered.  
 A Phase 2, placebo- controlled clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous 
lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine has been completed (clinical study COL MIG- 201).  
This study was blinded with regard to dose and treatment allocation and employed doses of lasmiditan from 2.5 to 45 mg IV infused over 20 minutes.  One hundred and thirty (130) patients 
were treated in the study and no serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported.  The only AE 
that was clearly dose related was paresthesia; however, most of these events were reported as

  Proprietary and Confidential  mild.  Lasmiditan given by the IV route was effective in the acute treatment of migraine in this 
study, showing a statistically significant dose -response relationship. 
 A Phase 1 placebo- controlled study assessed the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of sublingual and oral lasmiditan (clinical study COL MIG- 102).  The sublingual 
route of administration was investigated using ascending single doses from 1 to 32 mg lasmiditan versus placebo in healthy subjects in one study arm.  In a second study arm, single 
ascending oral doses of a solution formulation from 25 to 400 mg lasmiditan or placebo were 
administered to healthy subjects.  In a third arm of the study, the safety and tolerability of 100 
mg and 400 mg of the oral solution formulation were evaluated in an additional cohort of 
subjects.  The tolerability of both the oral and sublingual route of administration was good.  However, the sublingual route did not show any advantage in comparison to the oral route of 
administration since there was no evidence of enhanced bioavailability in terms of exposure 
(C
max, AUC 0–t) or time to peak concentration (t max).  The oral route of administration was 
therefore selected for further study.  Oral doses of the solution formulation were generally well tolerated up to the maximum dose tested of 400 mg lasmiditan.  There were no clinically 
significant changes in safety parameters or clinical laboratory results.  
 
The assessment of bioequivalence of the oral solution and tablet formulations of 200 mg 
lasmiditan and of dose linearity of ascending doses of 50, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan of a tablet 
formulation were investigated in a further clinical Phase 1 study (clinical study COL MIG- 103), 
including also the assessment of safety and tolerability.  In general, lasmiditan was well tolerated across all doses.  The most common AEs across all doses with a dose- related 
increase in frequency were fatigue and dizziness followed by somnolence and paresthesia.  
 In the Thorough QT study (clinical study COL MIG- 105) which was designed, performed and 
analyzed in accordance with the ICH E14  guidance,
[13] the primary objective was to assess the 
effect of 100 mg lasmiditan and 400 mg lasmiditan on cardiac de - and re- polarization. The 
statistical evaluation of the primary variable revealed that lasmiditan caused no significant QT 
prolongation either at 100 mg or at 400 mg.  The results met the criteria for a negative thor ough 
QT/QTc study according to ICH E14 . [13] 
 
The bioavailability of lasmiditan 200 mg administered orally as a tablet formulation under fed 
and fasted conditions was investigated (clinical study COL MIG-104). A slight delay in the time 
to reach maximum plasma concentration was observed in the fed state. As in other Phase 1 studies, lasmiditan was well tolerated. The most common AEs across both conditions were 
somnolence, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension (with and without dizziness) and paresthesia.  
 The efficacy of oral lasmiditan in the acute treatment of migraine was evaluated in a Phase 2 
double- blind, placebo- controlled, parallel- group dose- ranging study conducted in five European 
countries (clinical study COL MIG- 202).  A total of 391 subjec ts treated a single migraine attack 
at home using one of four doses of lasmiditan (50, 100, 200 or 400 mg) or placebo.  The 
proportion of patients with headache relief (moderate or severe headache becoming mild or none) or who were pain free showed statistically significant dose responses at 2 hours after 
treatment. Associated symptoms such as nausea, phonophobia and photophobia also responded to lasmiditan.  There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory 
parameters, ECGs or vital signs . 
 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 22% of the subject s receiving 
placebo and by 65, 73, 86 and 84% of subject s receiving 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg lasmiditan,

  Proprietary and Confidential  respectively.  The most common adverse events seen in the lasmiditan groups were related to 
the nervous system.  These included dizziness, fatigue, vertigo, somnolence and paresthesia.  
Chest symptoms characteristic of triptan use were rare and occurred with a similar frequency in the placebo and active groups. 
 
During the clinical development of lasmiditan there were no deaths and no subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events.  One serious adverse event ( SAE) of moderate dizziness 
leading to overnight hospitalization was reported in the oral dose- ranging study.  This occurr ed 
in a female patient given 200 mg lasmiditan, and  resolved without sequelae.  
 More details on the preclinical and clinical experience with lasmiditan are given in the Clinical 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
[14] 
 
4.3 Minimization of Risk   
The dose levels of lasmiditan (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) have previously been tested and 
shown to be safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects and in patient s with acute migraine. 
 
Lasmiditan given orally at doses up to 400 mg has been well tolerated, with no clinically 
significant effects on vital signs, ECG or  clinical laboratory parameters.  The most frequent  
adverse events have been somnolence, dizziness,  fatigue, and paresthesia. These were 
transient and usually of mild or moderate severity . 
 Since somnolence, dizziness and fatigue have been seen, patients  participating in this study will 
be advised not to drive or operate machinery for 12 h ours after treatment.  
 
Rescue medication will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments if the migraine does not respond (subject is not headache pain free).  A second dose of randomized study drug 
may be taken  up to 24 hours after the first dose as long as no other rescue medication has been 
used.  
 If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then recurs  after 2 
hours , a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first 
dose.  
 
To insure standardization, all adverse events will be assessed usi ng WHO Toxicity Criteria 
(Appendix 1).  
 
4.4 Potential Benefit  
Migraine is a common disorder with a prevalence of 11.7% (17.1% of women and 5.4% of men)  
based on a large population survey of US households. Nearly a third of sufferers experience 
three  or more migraine attacks a month, and over half report that the attacks cause severe  
disability or require bed  rest. [15] Despite the substantial functional impairment  caused by the 
disease, it is estimated that less than half of all migraineu rs use prescription medication to 
manage their disease, indicating a substantial unmet medical need . [16] 
 In the completed Phase 2 studies, lasmiditan  was effective in alleviating migraine attacks when 
given by the IV or oral routes of administration. This study will recruit patients meeting the 
internationally recognized diagnostic criteria for migraine set by the International Headache

  Proprietary and Confidential  Society (IHS) .  Patients that complete COL MIG -302 will be eligible to be enrolled and 
randomized into the open- label, long -term, safety study of lasmiditan 100 mg and lasmiditan 
200 mg ( COL MIG -305).  
 
4.5 Dose Rationale  
The dose levels of lasmiditan  to be used in this study (50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg) have been 
tested and shown to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy subjects and in patients with 
acute migraine. In a Phase 2 study , both doses were effective in alleviating the symptoms of 
migrain e. In preclinical toxicology studies, adequate margins of safety have been established for 
lasmiditan  50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg and its major human metabolites.  This study will further 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg with the primary 
analysis performed on the first dose taken for treatment of a new acute migraine attack.   
 
The inclusion of a second dose of either lasmiditan 50 mg or 100 mg or 200 mg or placebo as 
randomly assigned for treatment of rescue or recurrenc e of migraine is to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of a second dose of lasmiditan and further establish the dosing profile for the use of 
lasmiditan in the treatment of acute migraine. 
 
4.6 Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted according to the protocol and in compliance with current principles of Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). Further 
information on the ethical conduct of the study is in Section 13.

5.5 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a prospective randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study in patients  with 
disabling migraine (MIDAS score ≥11).  Approximately 2968 subjects will be screened and 
randomized (742 per treatment arm based on the first dose) to ensure that approximately 2280 
subjects (570 per treatment arm based on the first dose ) treat a migraine attack and complete 
the Treatment Period.   Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of concomitant medications 
that reduce the frequency of migraine episodes. 
 
Subjects will be asked to treat a migraine attack with study drug on an outpatient basis. 
Subjects will be provided with a dosing card containing a dose for initial treatment and a second dose to be used for rescue or recurrence of migraine.  Each subject’s study participation will 
consist of a screening visit ( Visit 1 ) with a telephone contact within 7 days to confirm eligibility, a 
Treatment Period of up to 8 weeks, and an EoS visit ( Visit 2 ) within two week s (14 days ) of 
treating a migraine attack.  The total time on study is approximately 12 weeks.  
 
At the Screening visit (Visit 1)  subjects will provide written informed consent and authorize 
HIPAA . Study eligibility will be assessed on the basis of medical history including migraine 
history, baseline physical ex amination (including height and weight) , vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, 12- lead ECG and responses to the MIDAS questionnaire. Subjects will be 
asked about any concomitant medication use as well as any cardiovascular (CV) events in the 
last 6 months and/or related resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, 
hospitalizations, new treatments or treatment adjustments for CV disease.  A C- SSRS will be 
completed. Subjects will be giv en an electronic diary and be trained on its use to record 
information about their migraine, dosing  of their migraine and post -dose assessments . Subjects 
will be randomized, dispensed study drug and instructed not to treat an attack until their 
eligibility  has been confirmed by phone once all screening evaluations are complete.  Subjects 
will be randomly assigned treatment as described in Section 5.5.1.   
 
Telephone contact . Within 7 days of Visit 1  a phone contact must be made by study staff to 
the subject confirming eligibility in the trial. At this point, ineligible subjects are instructed to 
return to the clinic to be discontinued and eligible subjects begin the Treatment Period. During 
the call, the subject will be reminded on the use of the diary and on dosing a migraine with study 
drug. 
 
Treatment Period:  Subjects will be asked to treat their next migraine attack within 4 hours of 
onset providing that the headache severity is at least moderate at that time and not improving. 
Subjects will record their  response to the first dose over the next 48 hours using an electronic 
diary. Subjects will be asked not to use rescue medication until at least 2 hours after dosing with 
study drug and completing the 2 hour assessments.  If the migraine does not respond at 2 
hours, a second dose of study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose as long as 
no other rescue medication has been used . If the migraine  does  respond within 2 hours

be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose.  Subjects will record their response to a second 
dose, taken for either rescue or recurrence, for 48 hours in the electronic diary.  The total time 
for recording response to study drug is up to 72 hours depending on whether or not a second 
dose is used.  Subjects are to contact the clinic to schedule EoS/Visit 2 within  one week ( 7 
days) after 1 attack has been treated, or after 8 weeks have passed without treating an attack . 
The total time on study is approximately 11 weeks.  
 
5.5.1 Treatment Arms 
Subjects will be centrally random ized to one of 7 treatment sequences to receive lasmiditan 50 
mg (L50 mg), lasmiditan 100 mg (L 100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg (L2 00 mg) or placebo (P) for  
the initial dose (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio)   and the second dose, if needed  for rescue or recurrence of

the reason in the subject’s study records. 
 
Premature withdrawal may occur for any of the following reasons:  
• Non-compliance with the protocol requirements  
• Pregnancy  
• Death 
• Adverse event (AE)  
• Subject request  
• Investigator request  
• Sponsor request  
 
For subjects who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those subjects whose status is unclear because they 
fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdraw), the Investigator should 
show “due diligence” by documenting in the source documents all steps taken to contact the subject, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.  All subjects prematurely discontinuing from the trial (prior to  EoS/Visit 2), regardles s of cause, 
must be seen for EoS/ Visit 2.  Subjects that withdraw from the study prior to dosing a single 
attack should return to the clinic for EoS/Visit 2  to return all unused study drug and the e- diary .  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study for any reason will not be replaced
.

  Proprietary and Confidential  7. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
7.1 Subject numbering and enrollment status  
At screening, each subject will be assigned a unique seven- digit subject number.  The first three 
characters will be numbers that identify the study site, and will be assigned by the Sponsor.  
The remaining four characters identify the subject.  The latter four numbers will be assigned by 
the study site personnel in ascending sequential order to each unique subject screened at that 
site.  For example, the subject number for the first subject screened at Study Site 001 would be 001-2 001.  If a subject is rescreened, the reason for rescreening will be noted and the subject 
will keep the same number assigned at initial screening.   If a subject fails to be randomized, the 
reason for not being randomized should be documented in the source documents.  The subject 
will be considered a screen failure.  If a subject is randomized but is  then deemed ineligible at 
the telephone confirmation the subject will be considered a randomization failure. This subject 
will return to the clinic to be discontinued.  Study drug and the patient e- diary will be collected.  A 
subject deemed to be a randomization failure may be rescreened if the reason for ineligibility is 
thought to represent a laboratory error, a reversible, clinically insignificant intermittent condition, 
or is not consistent with the subject’s historical values.  The subject will be given a new 
screeni ng number.  In this case the subject should not be re- randomized until eligibility is 
confirmed.   If the subject is not re -randomized he/she will be considered a screen failure. 
 
7.2 Description of Study Drug  
For study purposes  lasmiditan  and matching placebo are all referred to as study drug.  
 
7.3 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant  medications (including devices), for migraine or pain during the 90 days (3 months) 
prior to study enrollment and concomitant medication used to treat other  medical conditions 
during the 30 days (1 month) prior to study enrollment will be recorded during Screening/Visit 
1.  
 Any changes in dosage or new medications added as a result of intercurrent illness during the 
subject’s time on study must be recorded i n the CRFs .  
 
7.3.1  Rescue Medication  
Rescue medication will be permitted after completion of the 2 hour assessments  if the migraine 
does not respond (subject is not headache pain free) . If the migraine does not respond within 2 
hours a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first dose 
as long as no other rescue medication has been used.  The Investigator may advise each 
subject as to an alternative suitable rescue medication.  Triptans , ergots , opioids and 
barbiturates  MUST NOT be used for rescue medication within 24 hours of study drug 
administration.   The use of rescue medication will be recorded in the subject diary.  
 7.3.2  Recurrence Medication  
If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but  then recurs after 2 
hours , a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after the first 
dose.

  Proprietary and Confidential  7.4 Prohibited Medications  
Use of the following medications is prohibited for the duration of a subject’s participation in the 
study from Screening  /Visit 1  through EoS/ Visit 2:  
• Any investigational treatment other than lasmiditan . 
• All other symptom modifying treatments  (e.g. antiemetics ) for migraine except rescue or 
recur rence medication as detailed in Section 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 . 
• If a patient  requires the initiation of migraine prophylaxis  (concomitant medication to 
reduce the frequency of migraine episodes) or a change in ongoing migraine prophylaxis 
after the Screening/Visit 1  they should be withdrawn from the study.  
 
7.5 Treatment Complianc e 
Study drug  will be taken by the subject at home throughout the study .  Prior to discharge from  
Screening/ Visit 1  subjects will be given study drug to treat a single migraine attack  and a 
second dose for rescue or recurrence .   Information on the time and  date of each  dose (initial 
treatment along with the use of rescue medication or treatment of recurrence) will be recorded by the subject in the electronic  diary .  Subjects will be instructed to return all unused study drug  
to the clinic at EoS/ Visit 2 .   
 
7.6 Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized through a central randomization process  by IRT during 
Screening/Visit 1.  A randomization number and study drug card number will be assigned for 
dosing.  Lasmi ditan and matching placebo will be provided in double- blinded treatment packs . 
 
7.7 Unblinding Procedures  
7.7.1  Emergency unblinding of treatment assignment  
Emergency unblinding should only be performed when necessary in order to treat the subject.  
There is no known antidote to lasmidit an, so symptomatic and supportive management  of any 
suspected  and treatment  related  adverse event, if necessary, is clinically indicated.  
Unblinding will result in the subject being discontinued from the study, irrespective of whether 
the Investigator ultimately agrees with the event being related to study drug (lasmiditan) .  Most 
often, study drug discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. The Inv estigator 
will have the ability to break the blind for any subject through the centralized randomization system ( IRT). However,  the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor or their designee to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to 
unblind prior to unblinding any subject , but must contact the Sponsor or designee within one 
working day after the event occurs. The Sponsor’s medical monitor or their designee will also 
have the ability to break the blind for the Investigator while remaining blinded via the centralized 
randomization system  if the treating Investigator requests this   The blind may be broken in the 
case of a pregnancy should the subject desire this information. Any subject for whom the blind 
is broken is to be discontinued from future study treatment .  The date, time and reason for 
breaking the blind are to be recorded in the subject’s source documents.  
 
7.7.2 Unblinding for Regulatory Authorities  
In cases where unblinding is required for the purposes of reporting expedited safety events to 
country specific re gulatory agencies or Ethics Committees, the unblinding will be performed by

No preparation will be required.  
 
8.5 Administration  
Subjects will be screened outside a migraine attack .  The study drug will be dispensed to the 
subject  during Screening/ Visit 1  with instructions to treat an acute migraine attack only after 
their eligibility has been confirmed by the site. Each subject will be informed of their eligibility via 
a telephone call within 7 days of the screening visit.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to take both tablets with approximately 4 ounces of water as the 
FIRST  treatment  for a new migraine attack providing that : any aura symptoms have resolved 
• the headache is either moderate or severe and has been so for less than 4 hours 
• no prior analgesic or acute migraine treatment has been taken to treat the current 
migraine attack.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to take the second dose (two tablets) if needed with approximately 4 
ounces of water for rescue or for recurrence of migraine . 
 
8.6 Study Drug Accountability  
Under supervision of the Investigator, the study pharmacist or designee will be responsible for 
drug accountability. The pharmacist  or designee  will keep an accurate inventory of test article(s) 
and dispensing using a drug dispensing log. The pharmacist  or designee must keep study drug 
inventory available for inspection by the Sponsor, an agent for the Sponsor, and regulator y 
authorities.  
 Subjects will be required to return all unused study drug. If any unused material is remaining at 
the site at study completion, the pharmacy will be instructed how to dispose of or  return the 
material to the Sponsor after the Sponsor’s representative has performed accountability. The Sponsor’s representative will complete authorization forms for disposal or return with the 
responsible pharmacist or designee. Copies of these forms should be included with the returned 
material. The original f orm should be maintained in the pharmacy within the site study  files.

9.1 Efficacy and Safety Parameters  
Primary e fficacy will be evaluated using subjec t recorded response to relief  from pain and from 
the MBS  (nausea, phon ophobia or phot ophobia ) based on the first dose, as well as use of 
rescue medication and/or recurrence of headache and use of recurrence medication. Efficacy of 
a second dose will be evaluated using subject  recorded response to relief from pain and from 
the MBS  (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) by subjects who took a second dose for rescue 
or for recurrence. Safety will be monitored with physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical 
laboratory testing, and AE/SAE assessments.  
 
Standardization of data capture is provided in detail in the remainder of this section.  
Assessments should be performed in relation to dosing  as indicated . 
 9.1.1  Medical History  
General relevant medical history will be recorded on the CRF and will include information 
relating to any prior or existing medical conditions involving the following disease types or systems: infectious diseases,  allergic, metabolic/endocrine/nutritional, hematopoietic, 
musculoskeletal, dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose and throat ( HEENT ), breasts, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/hepatic, genitourinary/renal, neurological, and psychiatric/psychosocial.  
 The Investigator will exclude subjects with ongoing significant major organ disease.    
 
Smoking history and family history of cardiovascular disease will be recorded on the CRF.  
 Concomitant  medications  or devices, for migraine or pain during the 90 days (3 months ) prior to 
study enrollment and concomitant medication used to treat other  medical conditions during the 
30 days  (1 month)  prior to enrollment will be recorded on the CRF.   
 
In addition, information regarding the subject’s migraine history including prior treatment will be 
recorded
. 
 
9.1.1.1   Demographics  
During Screening /Visit 1 , subject initials, age, gender, race and ethnicity will be recorded on 
the CRF.   
 
9.1.1.2   MIDAS  
MIDAS is a 5 item questionnaire (Appendix 3) evaluating the impact of migraine on a patient’s 
life over the past 3 months. The questionnaire is to be completed by each subject at 
Screening/ Visit 1 .  A score of ≥ 11 is required for inclusion in the study. 
 Subjects should be given sufficient time to complete the questionnaire and it should be 
completed prior to any procedures (i.e. physical exam, blood draw).  The questionnaire is a 
self-reported measure and is to be reviewed with the subject for completeness only.  Subjects 
should not be questioned about any of the responses or given suggestions on how to answer any of the questions, however clarification of what a question is asking is allowed.

  Proprietary and Confidential  9.1.1.3   Resource Utilization  
During Screening/Visit 1 subjects will be asked specifically about any CV events in the last 6 
months and/or related resource utilization such as visits to cardiologists, procedures, 
hospitalizations, new treatments or treatment adjustments for CV disease. In addition 
information regarding any ER visits or visit to physician’s of fice for migraine treatment will be 
recorded.     At EoS/Visit 2  the subject will again be asked about resource utilization during their 
time on study.   
 
The subject will also be asked about the number of days missed from work and/or school during 
the migraine treated with study drug.  
 
9.1.2  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed during Screening/Visit  1.  A complete 
physical examination of all body systems will include the following: general appearance, skin, 
HEENT, he art, lymph nodes, lungs, abdomen, extremities/joints, neurological systems, and 
mental status. For EoS/ Visit 2, a brief symptom related physical examination will be performed 
if indicated by an AE. 
 
Height and weight will be measured at Screening/ Visit 1 . BMI will be calculated by the 
database.  
 
9.1.3  Vital Signs  
Vital signs , measured after at least 5 minutes rest, will include seated systolic blood pressure 
(SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  and heart rate (HR) . All vital sign measurements will be 
performed by appropriately qualified and authorized study personnel, using appropriate 
equipment.  
 Blood pressure (BP) will be measured after at least 5 minutes rest  and if possible in the same 
arm at each visit by using an automated sphygmomanometer. The results will be recorded in 
millimeters of mercury (mmHg). HR will be measured in the radial artery in the dominant arm for 
30 seconds and will be recorded as beats per minute (bpm).  
 
9.1.4  ECG  
A standard, digital 12 -lead ECG will be obtained after at least 5 min utes rest at Screening/ Visit  
1and EoS/Visit 2.   
 
A trained ECG technician will perform the ECGs and all ECG results must be reviewed at the 
site by the Investigator or a medically qualified designee for clinical management of the subject. 
Abnormal findings will be identified as either clinically significant (CS), or not clinically significant 
(NCS). CS findings are to be reported as AEs  by the Investigator.  ECGs will be sent to a central 
reader for further evaluation.    
 
ECG reports from the central reader will include: rhythm, rate, axis, PR , QRS, and corrected (by 
both Fridericia and Bazett) and uncorrected QT intervals.   
 
9.1.5  Clinical Laboratory  
Samples of blood and urine will be collected for clinical laboratory tests during Screening/ Visit  
1 and EoS/ Visit  2.  Tests will be conducted as designated below:

  Proprietary and Confidential  9.1.5.1  Clinical Laboratory tests conducted  
Clinical laboratory evaluations will include:  
Hematology:  white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, 
eosinophils, monocytes, basophils), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and red blood cell 
(RBC) count.   
 
Serum Chemistry Profile:  albumin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
creatinine, glucose, phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, total cholesterol, 
HDL, and triglycerides . 
 
Urinalysis:  protein, glucose, nitrite, ketones, blood (hemoglobin), pH, specific gravity, 
microscopic bacteria, RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals, and cells. Microscopic  examination of 
sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive.  
 
For WOCBP, a serum pregnancy test for β-HCG will be performed at the Screening/ Visit 1.  If 
a urine pregnancy test is positive during the study the subject will be discontinued from the 
study after confirmation with a positive serum  βHCG .   A subject with a positive urine βHCG 
must not be dosed unless a negative serum βHCG is obtained.  The confirmatory serum test 
may be performed at the local clinical laboratory.  At EoS/Visit 2 , a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed. If positive, a confirmatory serum pregnancy test will be done.  
 9.1.5.2  Abnormal and Clinically Significant Results  
The Investigator must categorize all abnormal hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis laboratory 
values as either CS or  NCS. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory 
parameters, which has medical consequences that result in an alteration in the subject’s 
medical care. The Investigator will use the WHO Toxicity Criteria (see Appendix 1) as a guide 
when evaluating the clinical significance of all abnormal clinical laboratory results.  In case of 
CS laboratory results, the Investigator will continue to monitor the subject with additional 
laboratory assessments until (1) values have reached normal range and/or baseline levels, or 
(2) the Investigator has judged that the abnormal values are not related to the administration of 
study drug or other protocol -specific procedures. 
 
9.1.6  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating scale  that rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation  
on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and 
intent”. The scale intends to prospectively identify and classify suicidal ideation and behavior 
based on a semi- structured interview by the Investigator or designee trained in administering 
the questionnaire.  Two versions of the C -SSRS will be used.  
 
• The screening version will be administered at Screening/ Visit 1  (Appendix 4). 
 
• The “since last visit” version will be administered at EoS/Visit 2  (Appendix 5). 
 If present, suicide ideation will be classified in  5 classes (1 -5), the intensity of suicidal ideation 
will be classified in 5 dimensions, and any suicidal behavior will be classified in 6 classes (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts towards and attempt,  suicidal 
behavior, suicide).

  Proprietary and Confidential  9.1.7  Dosing Instructions  
Study drug should be administered as the FIRST  treatment for an acute migraine attack. If the 
subject has already taken any prior analgesic or acute migraine treatment, he/she is no longer 
eligible t o treat the current migraine attack but may treat a later attack with the study drug. 
 
Subjects will be asked to treat their migraine attack within 4 hours of onset providing that the headache severity is at least moderate at that time and not improving. Subjects will record their 
response over the next 48 hours using an electronic diary. Subjects will be instructed not to use 
rescue medication until at least 2 hours after taking study drug. If the subject does not become 
headache pain free within 2 hours, rescue medication will be permitted after completion of the 2 
hour assessments.  A second dose of randomized study drug may be taken up to 24 hours after 
the first dose as long as no other rescue medication has been used.  The Investigator will 
advise each subject as to alternative suitable rescue medication. Triptans , ergots , opioids and 
barbi turates MUST NOT be used for rescue medication within 24 hours of study drug 
administration.  If the migraine responds within 2 hours (headache becomes pain free) but then 
recurs  after 2 hours  a second dose of randomized study drug may be taken for up to 24 hours 
from the first dose.
  
 
9.1.8  Subject  Diary  
Subjects will be trained on the use of the electronic diary at Screening/Visit 1. Efficacy data will 
be collected in an electronic diary for  an attack.   Subjects will record the date and time at which 
their migraine headache starts and when it first becomes moderate or severe.  They will also 
record the date and time of taking the first dose of study drug. 
 
Subjects will be asked to assess their headache severity at specified time points: 0 (pre dose), 
0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 24 and 48 hours post dose using the IHS four point headache severity 
rating scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, and 3 = severe pain). The need for 
rescue medication and second dosing of study drug or an alternative treatment will be assessed 
between 2 and 24 hour and at 48 hours .  Recurrence of  pain and second dosing of  study drug 
will be assessed between 2 and 24 hours and at 48 hours. 
 At the  same  time points, 0  (pre dose),  0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 24 and 48 hours,  subjects  will  
grade  the  degree  of interference  with  normal activities  and the  presence  or  absence  (yes 
or no) of accompanying symptoms: photophobia, phonophobia and nausea.  At time 0 (pre 
dose) subjects will select from the accompanying symptoms  present  (nausea,  phonophobia or 
photophobia) which one is the most bothersome to them . Subjects will be asked to record the 
presence or absence (yes or no) of vomiting. Subjects will also be asked to record the exact 
time at which headache relief became meaningful to them and the time at which they become 
headache pain free.  At 2 hours subjects will be asked to record their global impression of 
change using a 7- point scale (very much better, much better,  a little better,  no change,  a little 
worse,  much  worse, and very much worse).  
 
The diary will also be used to record any symptoms or side effects the subject is experiencing and the use of any concomitant medications  from Visit 1  through to EoS/Visit 2  
 9.1.8.1  Recording Use of Rescue Medication and Migraine Symptoms 
The use of rescue medication taken because headache pain freedom  is not achieved at 2 
hours  will be recorded.  Subjects will document the date and time of dosing for rescue and any 
migraine symptoms they are experienc ing  at time of dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 
hours post dosing.  Migraine pain will be graded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe

asked to record the presence or absence (yes or no) of vomiting.  Subjects will also be asked  
to record the exact  time at which  headache relief became meaningful to them and the time at 
which  they become headache pain free.   
  
9.1.8.2  Recording Recurrence and Migraine Symptoms 
If migraine recurs  within  48 hours of dosing, the subject  will note the exact  time when the  
headache  returns  to mild,  moderate,  or  severe  intensity  after being  pain  free. Subjects  
will document  the time they take the  second dose of study drug and any migraine  
symptoms  they are experienc ing at the time of dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours post 
dosing. Migraine  pain will be g raded as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3)  and 
other symptoms ( nausea,  phon ophobia, or photophobia) will be recorded as yes or no.   At time 
0 (pre dose) subjects will select from the  accompanying symptoms  present  (nausea,

9.2 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any undesirable physical, psychological, or behavioral effect experienced by a subject during his/her participation in an investigational study, in conjunction with the use of 
the drug, whether or not  product -related. During the treatment of a migraine with study drug 
subjects will be asked if they are feeling anything unusual that they have not felt with a migraine 
before. A ‘yes’ response will trigger an alert to the site to contact the subject and assess the AE 
in terms of what the subject is experiencing, how long the symptoms lasted and how much the 
symptom(s) impacted them.  During the time between dosing, subjects will be asked how they 
are feeling. A response of ‘not well’ will trigger an alert to the site to contact the subject and assess the AE similarly to the assessment of AEs reported during treatment.   The occurrence 
of AEs should be sought by non- directive questioning of the subject at each visit in the study.  
AEs may include, but are not  limited to : 
 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the subject and/or observed by 
the Investigator or medical staff, and  
• Changes  in laboratory abnormalities that are clinically relevant as assessed by the 
Investigator and for which a medical intervention was initiated.  
 Disease signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing prior to the use of 
the product are not considered AEs after treatment unless they reoccur after the subject has recovered from the pre -existing condition or, in the opinion of the Investigator;  they represent a 
clinically significant exacerbation in intensity or frequency.   AEs are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent form  until the completion of EoS/ Visit 2.  AEs reported prior 
to dosing will be captured and considered non- treatment emergent AEs. AE reported 48 hours 
after dosing until the completion of EoS/Visit 2  will be captured and considered non-treatment 
emergent AEs.    
 All AEs must be recorded in the site’s study records and the AE CRF with the following 
information:  
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                                      IND 103,420

38 of 74 
  Proprietary and Confidential   
1. Relationship to Study Drug :  The Investigator must assess whether they  consider  an AE to 
be drug- related. In assessing this relationship, the Investigator must use information about 
the drug as outlined in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), the subject’s pre- existent medical 
conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug administration. The following definitions will be used: 
 
• Reasonably or possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the Investigator (or 
other qualified physician) to have at least a possible relationship to study drug.  
 
• Not reasonably or not possibly related applies to those AEs that, after careful 
medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the 
Investigator (or other qualified physician) to have no relationship, or no reasonable 
possibility of a rela tionship, to study drug.  
 
2. Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the 
WHO Toxicity Criteria, as shown in Appendix 1.  The WHO criteria assign a grade of 1 
through 4 to indicate the severity of AEs. For AEs that are not listed in the WHO criteria, the 
Investigator will use medical judgment to assess the severity of the AE.   
 
The following are guidelines to be used by the Investigator to judge the event severity of an AE that is not in the WHO Toxicity Criteria:  
• Mild - awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
•    Moderate - discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
•    Severe - incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
•    Life Threatening 
 3. Duration: Start and end dates  and times,  or if continuing.  
 4. Action taken.  
 5. Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below.  
 6. Outcome: resolved, resolved/ with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (only for subjects that are lost to follow -up). 
 
 The investigator (or designee) should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on the 
sign, symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, and not the individual signs/symptoms or laboratory abnormalities should be documents  in the subject’s 
source documentation and the CRF unless the etiology of the event is unknown.  An 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to study drug, the interventions required to treat it and the 
outcome.  
9.2.2  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)  
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that 
was present prior to dosing and exacerbates after the first dose of st udy drug.   
 
9.2.3  Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                                      IND 103,420

  Proprietary and Confidential  • Death: This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. car accident).  If a subject dies 
during the study and an autopsy is performed, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor.  
• Life-threatening experience 
• Required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization: Exceptions will be hospitalizations for a) 
elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug or b) treatment on an 
emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE and not 
resulting in hospital admission  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  
 
9.2.4  Unexpected Adverse Event   
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure for lasmiditan . 
 
9.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causal ity, to the Sponsor 
or their designated representative by entering the information into the eCRF within 24 hours of 
learning of the occurrence.  The reporting timeframe starts when the subject signs the informed 
consent form and ends following the last dose of study treatment at EoS/Visit 2.  At a minimum, 
a description of the event and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be provided at the 
time of the initial report.  These preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions that 
will include copies of de-identified hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents 
when requested and applicable.  
 Complications or progression of an initial SAE must be reported as a follow -up SAE Report to 
the original SAE, regardless of  when the follow -up information is received by the Investigator .  A 
follow -up SAE Report must be submitted within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the 
follow -up information.  An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported 
one should be reported separately as a new SAE.  
 Follow -up information should be communicated by updating the data in the SAE eCRF . The 
follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it 
was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation.  
 If the SAE was not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgently require further information 
from the Investigator for regulatory authority reporting. The Sponsor may need to issue an 
Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  
 The Investigator and study personnel should institute any supplemental investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This may include clinical laboratory tests not specified in the protocol, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with 
CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.                                      IND 103,420

  Proprietary and Confidential  specialists. The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct 
supplemental assessments.  
 
The Investigator should notify  Quintiles  Pharmacovigilance of any death or SAE occurring after 
a subject has withdrawn from the study when such a death or SAE may reasonably be related to the study drug. However, the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek adverse events in 
former study participants.  
 
9.4 Follow -up of adverse events  
All SAEs and any non- serious adverse events or laboratory abnormalities resulting in premature 
discontinuation will be followed until they have resolved, returned to baseline, or are determined to be chronic or stable by the Investigator .  Other non- serious adverse events should be 
followed through the EoS/Visit  2.   
 
9.5 Reporting safety information to the IRB/EC  
The Investigator is responsible for following all local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the reporting of SAEs to the IRB/ EC. 
The Investigator must promptly report to his or her IRB /EC all unanticipated problems involving 
risks to  subjects.  This includes death from any cause and all serious adverse events 
reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug.  It is recommended that all SAEs 
occurring at a site, regardless of causality, be reported to the site’s IRB/EC in accordance with 
the IRB/EC’s requirements.  
Lasmiditan has been filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  An SAE may require safety reports to be filed to regulatory agencies if the SAE is related 
to the study drug and is unexpected based upon the current Investigator’s Brochure.  In this 
case, the Investigator will receive a copy of the safety report as submitted to the regulatory 
agencies.  The Investigator is responsible for submitting the safety report (initial and follow- up) 
or other safety information (e.g., revised Investigator’s Brochure) to the IRB/EC in accordance with the IRB/EC’s requirements and keep a copy in their files.  
 
9.6 Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study drug must be reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
 Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s source documents and a Pregnancy Notification 
and Outcome Form and reported by the Investigator to Quintiles Pharmacovigilance using the 
same procedure for reporting SAEs in Section 9.3. A pregnancy, by itself, i s not a SAE.   
Pregnancy follow -up should also be recorded and should include an assessment of the possible 
relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy -related SAE (e.g. 
spontaneous abortion) or any other SAE experienced during pregnancy must be recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and reported per SAE reporting procedures in Section 9.3 .

  Proprietary and Confidential  10. STATISTICS  
Prior to locking and unblinding the database, a detailed statistical analysis plan will be 
developed before any  receipt of study data and decisions will be made regarding the integrity of 
subject data for inclusion in the statistical analysis.  The efficacy analyses and baseline 
characteristics will be based on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) and mITT population.  The pr imary 
analysis will be tested in the mITT population.   All safety analyses will be based on the Safety 
Population.  The Per Protocol Population will be used to support the ITT analyses.  
 All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a one-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy  of lasmiditan versus placebo at 2 
hours on migraine headache pain and the MBS as identified by the individual  subject  based on 
the first dose.  
 
Summary analysis of the efficacy and safety of the use of a second dose of lasmiditan versus 
placebo for either rescue or recurrence will be performed only in the subjects that actually took a 
second dose of study drug within 24 hours of the first dose.   Analysis will be performed on the 
subset of subjects that dosed for rescue and on the subset that dosed for recurrence of migraine.  
 
Data from all investigative sites will be pooled for all planned analyses.  Analysis of individual 
site findings will be considered if necessary.  For  those measures that are analyzed using 
change from baseline scores, observed scores may also be presented descriptively.  
 
Any changes in the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol.  Any other changes to the data analysis methods described in the protocol and the justification for making the change will be described 
in the statistical analysis plan as well as the clinical study report.  Additional exploratory 
analyses will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  All data listings, summaries and analyses 
will be performed by Quintiles.  
  
10.1 Sample Size  
This Phase 3 study is designed to demonstrate that lasmiditan is effective in the treatment of acute migraine in adult patients with and without aura. The sample size was estimated based on 
the 2 hour headache pain free and associated symptoms (nausea, phonophobia, and 
photophobia) free response rates observed in the Phase 2 study COL MIG-202. 
  
Dose  Pain free  Nausea free  Phonophobia 
free Photophobia 
free 
Placebo  7.4%  59.3%  51.9%  34.6%  
50 mg  13.9%  68.4%  58.2%  53.2%  
100 mg  13.6%  74.1%  75.3%  67.9%  
200 mg  18.8%  63.8%  59.4%  58.0%  
 For the primary endpoint of the proportion of patients pain free at 2 hours a sample size of  570 
evaluable subjects per arm provides power of >90% for the 50 mg dose, the 100 mg dose and the 200 mg dose.

  Proprietary and Confidential  In order to estimate sample size for the key secondary endpoint of proportion of patients MBS 
free at 2 hours, simulation was performed in SAS on the conditional probability of being free 
from any one symptom defined as MBS under 4 different scenarios. For each symptom or 
combination of symptoms, the likelihood of an individual symptom being the MBS was 
estimated. In the most conservative scenario (scenario 1) it was assumed that nausea would 
always be declared the MBS if it was present, regardless of the presence of other symptoms (phonophobia or photophobia).  The other 3 scenarios assumed lower likelihoods of nausea to 
be considered the MBS and allowed for the other symptoms (either phonophobia or 
photophobia) to be considered the MBS at a higher rate.  This resulted in power estimates of > 95% for MBS at a sample size of 570 for the lasmiditan 50 mg  dose and >99% for MBS at  
sample sizes of 450 to 570 per arm for the 100 mg dose across all 4 scenarios. For the 200 mg dose, an average power of 71% was estimated across five seeds under the most conservative 
scenario 1. In contrast, the 3 scenarios that did not declare nausea to be the default MBS  if it 
was present estimated a greater average power of 82.6% to 91%.

10.2 Randomization  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled parallel group study.   
Subjects will be centrally randomized to one of 7 treatment sequences to receive lasmiditan 50 
mg,  lasmiditan 100 mg (L 100 mg) or lasmiditan 200 mg (L2 00 mg) or placebo (P) for  the first 
dose (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio ) and the second dose for rescue or recurrence of migraine  (if needed) .  
Subjects will be stratified (yes or no) for use of concomitant medications that reduce the 
frequency of migraine episodes.   Study drug will be randomized and dispensed at Visit 1  as 
follows:

  Proprietary and Confidential  PP population  All ITT subjects will be considered per protocol (PP) if they dose 
a migraine attack  and do not deviate from the protocol.  
 
The following is a list of additional protocol violations which would exclude subjects from the PP 
population:    
• Subject received excluded rescue medications or used rescue medication before 2 hour 
time point.  
• Subject used recurrence medication before 2 hour time point.  
• Subject did not receive study drug as assigned . 
• Subject did not meet  all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
• Subject did not treat a migraine of at least moderate severity.  
 
10.3.2  Second Dose Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations for the second dose used for rescue or for recurrence will be as defined below . Subjects must  have taken the second dose and have been considered 
evaluable for the first dose and primary analysis to be included in the second dose analysis.  
 
Safety population  All randomized subjects who  were considered in the safety 
population after the first dose and used a second dose of study 
drug, regardless of whether or not they undergo any study

  Proprietary and Confidential  • Recurrence population : All randomized subjects who achieved headache pain free  at 2 
hours, but then experienced recurrence of mild, moderate or severe migraine pain and 
took a second dose of study drug up to 24 hours from the first dose.  
 
10.4 Accountabi lity and Background Characteristics  
10.4.1  Enrollment and Disposition  
The number of subjects enrolled, by study population and Investigative site, will be presented by 
treatment .  The primary reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by treatment and based 
on the safety population.  The number and percentage of  subjects  with protocol deviations 
leading to exclusion from the PP population will be presented by reason for exclusion, stratified 
by treatment.  All deviations will be listed.  
 10.4.2  Subject Characteristics  
Subject characteristics will be obtained at the Screening/Visit 1 prior to randomization and will 
be summarized by treatment and overall. Summaries will include descriptive statistics for continuous measures (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) and for categorical measures (sample size, frequency and percent ages ).  Treatments will be 
compared descriptively by using analysis of variance techniques  for continuous data and  
Pearson’s c hi-square or  Fisher’s exact test for categorical data.  
 The results of these tests will be used in a descriptive way to highlight potential imbalances 
between the treatment groups.  Subject characteristics may include, but are not limited to: age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, and migraine history . 
 Subject characteristics will be summarized on all study populations.  
 
10.4.3  Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed in terms of the actual dose.  Treatment compliance wil l 
be used to characterize the patients and determine clinical evaluability for some analyses.   
Treatment compliance will be summarized within each treatment group by means of descriptive 
statistics (n, mean,  SD, median, minimum and maximum).  
 
10.5 Efficacy Analyses  
All of the efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT  or mITT  population.  The primary 
analysis population is the mITT population.  The PP population will be used as supportive analyses.  
 10.5.1  Primary Analys is 
The treatment effect between lasmiditan and placebo will be tested first for  the primary endpoint 
of the proportion of subjects who are headache pain free and the key secondary endpoint of the 
proportion of subjects who are MBS  free at 2 hours in the mITT population between the 
lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo dose group  based on the first dose. The primary analysis will be 
completed using logistic regression Wald Chi- square  test with a basic model including treatment 
group and region , using a one-sided test at the alpha=0.025 level of significance.   
 If the primary analysis is statistically significant ( one-sided, p<0.0 25), additional confirmatory 
hypotheses will be tested on the proportion of subjects who are headache pain free and the 
proportion of subjects who are MBS  free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and placebo

  Proprietary and Confidential  groups  followed by the lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo groups.  
 
Headache pain free at 2 hours will be defined as a reduction in headache severity from 
moderate (2) or severe (3) at baseline to none (0) two hours after dosing with study drug.  MBS  
free at 2 hours will be defined as  a ‘no’ response to the presence of the symptom (either 
nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia)  that was identified as MBS at predose, 2 hours after 
dosing with study drug.  
 
A qualifying migraine is defined as a migraine treated with study drug within 4 hours of onset. 
 
Subjects taking rescue medication within the first two hours or who fail to record headache 
severity at 2 hours will be assumed to have no headache response in the mITT and the ITT 
analyses.   
 
A subject is defined to have used rescue medication within the fir st two hours  post dosing if at 
least one medication is documented in the rescue medication log in the subject electronic diary for which:  
0 (min) <  date/ time rescue medication (diary)  –  date/ time of dosing (diary) < 120 (min).  
  
Subjects who do not provide a headache pain severity rating at baseline or who use other 
medication prior to the study drug for the study migraine attack will be assumed to have no 
headache response for the ITT analysis . 
 
 
10.5.2  Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoi
 nts 
The primary endpoint of pain free at 2 hours and the key secondary endpoint of MBS free are 
defined as proportions.   The prespecified approach for handling missing data is to assume that 
subjects with missing data are nonresponders.   While this approach is appropriately 
conservative, a sensitivity analysis will be  incorporated to exclude subjects with missing data.  
 
10.5. 3 Multiplicity Adjustment for Hypothesis Testing 
The gatekeeping procedure will be implemented to prevent Type I error inflation for multiple 
comparisons among the primary and secondary analyses. The treatment effect between lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo will be tested first for the primary endpoint of t he proportion of 
subjects who are headache pain free and the key secondary endpoint of the proportion of 
subjects who are MBS free at 2 hours in the mITT population.   
 If the primary analysis is statistically significant ( one-sided, p<0.0 25), additional confirmatory 
hypotheses will be tested in the mITT population in the following sequential order:  
 
1. Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 
100 mg and placebo group. 
2. Proportion of subjects who are MBS  free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 100 mg and 
placebo group.  
3. Proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 
mg and placebo group. 
4. Proportion of subjects who are MBS  free at 2 hours in the lasmiditan 50 mg and 
placebo group.

  Proprietary and Confidential  All of the above analyses will be completed using one-sided tests at the alpha=0.02 5 level of 
significance.  If one of the analyses is not statistically significant, then all subsequent analyses 
will be exploratory rather than confirmatory . 
 
10.5.4  Other Efficacy Analyses 
 
10.5.4.1 Headache relief  
The proportion of subjects with headache relief (moderate or  severe headache at baseline, 
which became mild or none) at 2 hours post  dose will be evaluated.  The time course to 
headache relief will be explored up to 48 hours . Kaplan- Meier analysis will be performed to 
compare time course to headache relief between lasmiditan 200 mg and placebo, lasmiditan 
100 mg and placebo  and lasmiditan 50 mg and placebo.  
 
10.5.4 .2 Headache recurrence  
The proportion of subje cts with headache recurrence (moderate or  severe headache at 
baseline, which became pain free at 2 hours post -dose and worsened again up to 48 hours 
post-dose ) will be evaluated based on first dose.  The frequency of recurrence will be compared 
by the same logistic regression model used for the primary endpoint analysis.  The significance 
level of this exploratory analysis will be a nominal one- sided 0.05.  
 10.5. 4.3 Headache rescue  
The requirement for  rescue medication at 2 hours and between 2 and 24 hours and 24- 8 hours 
(yes or no) will be evaluated based on first dose. The information on rescue medication use will 
be presented descriptively by time of use and treatment group.  
 10.5. 4.4 Associated Sy mptoms of Migraine  
Descriptive analysis of t he associated symptoms of migraine, nausea, phon ophobia and 
photophobia,  will be performed at 2 hours. Free dom from  each symptom will  be defined as a 
‘no’ response to the presence of the symptom 2 hours after dosing with study drug.   
 10.5. 4.5 Additional analyses 
Summary statistics will be presented on presence of vomiting, disability (4 point scale: not at all  
(0), mil d interference (1), moderate  interference (2), completely, needs bed rest (3)), and patient 
global impression of change (7 point scale) . 
 
10.6 Analysis of Second dose  
All of the efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT -2nd dose  or mITT- 2nd dose population.  
The primary analysis population is the mITT -2nd dose population.  The PP -2nd dose population 
will be used as supportive analyses.  
 10.6.1  Analysis of second dose for rescue  
A second dose of study drug will be considered rescue medication if taken by a subject that did 
not achieve headache pain free at 2 hours  and completed the 2 hour assessments prior  to 
taking the second dose.  
 
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment sequence on relief of migraine symptoms 
(pain free and MBS free) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to 48 hours.  
Subjects that use an alternative rescue medication will not be included in the summary statistics of response to treatment for rescue.

  Proprietary and Confidential   
10.6.2  Analysis of second dose for recurrence  
A second dose of study drug will be considered treatment for recurrence if  taken by a subject 
that achieved headache pain free at 2 hours, completed the 2 hour assessments,  and then 
experienced documented recurrence of mild, moderate, or severe migraine pain prior to taking 
the second dose.   
 
Summary statistics will be presented by treatment sequence on the relief of migraine symptoms 
(pain free and MBS free) along with the time course to headache relief explored up to 48 hours. 
Only subjects that used a second dose of study drug for recurrence of migraine will be included 
in the summary stati stics of response to treatment for recurrence.  
 
10.7 Missing Values  
The primary  and key secondary endpoints are defined as proportions. If a subject has a missing 
value for a proportion endpoint, the subject will be classified as a nonresponder for this endpoint.  Subjects who have more than one symptom (nausea, phonophobia or photophobia) 
but do not select one as the MBS prior to dosing, will be considered inevaluable for the MBS endpoint as there is no MBS selected to evaluate.  In the case of subjects that have only one 
symptom (nausea, phonophobia, or photophobia) at predose but do not select a MBS, the one 
symptom will be considered the MBS for analysis. 
 
For subjects who do not record a symptom rating, that symptom (pain, photophobia, 
phonophobia or nausea) will be assumed to be present at all  time points where data are 
missing. Subjects who do not provide a headache severity rating at baseline will be assumed to 
have all four symptoms (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) at all  time points.  If 
recurrence medication is taken within 24 hours post dosing, or from 24 hours to 48 hours post 
dosing, even if no headache is reported, headache recurrence will be assumed for the first dose 
analysis.  
 
The sensitivity analysis for  handling missing data is described in detail in the SAP.  
 
10.8 Safety Analys es 
Values for all safety variables will be listed by subject and time point.  
 Where appropriate, safety variables will be summarized by using descriptive statistics, 
separated by treatm ent arm, and dose (the first  dose and the second dose for recurrence  or 
rescue or  use of alternative rescue medication),  and time of assessment. Descriptive statistics 
for quantitative variables will include: n, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Descriptive statistics for qualitative variables will include frequency counts and 
percent ages . 
 
10.8.1 Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms, 
and all summary tables for AEs will be organized by these categories. Frequency counts and 
percent ages  will be presented for subjects with AEs within each system organ class and 
preferred term, separated by treatment arm and treatment sequence and dose ( the first dose  
and the second dose for recurrence or rescue or alternative rescue medication).   Both subjects 
ever experiencing an event as well as total events will be presented.  Descriptive statistics will

dose for recurrence or rescue medication) for AE relationship and AE severity.  If multiple 
intensities are reported for a given AE for a subject, the most severe intensity will be counted. A 
separate, similar analysis will be conducted for TEAEs.  
 An AE with  the date of onset on or within 48 hours after a dose of study drug, or an event that 
worsens in intensity within 48 hours of a dose of study drug will be considered a TEAE.  An AE that occurs in the interval after 48 hours of dosing until EoS/Visit 2  will not be considered a 
TEAE.  
 SAEs and TEAEs that resulted in termination of the study drug and withdrawal from the study 
will be presented.  
 
10.8.2 Physical Examinations, Vital Signs, ECG  Parameters and Clinical Laboratory Test 
Values,  
By-subject listings of physical examinations, vital signs, ECG parameters  and clinical laboratory 
data will include indications of values that are outside the reference ranges, and values that are 
clinically significant.  Shift tables describing out -of-reference range shifts will be provided for 
vital signs, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results from the Screening /Visit 1 to EoS/Visit 2, 
as appropriate by treatment arm and dose . 
 
10.8.3 C-SSRS 
By-subject listings of any suicidal ideation or behavior will be listed.

The Investigator or the appointed persons agree to complete the subject's eCRFs , at each 
investigation. Only the Investigator or appointed persons in his /her team may fill out or correct 
the eCRFs. The eCRFs will display the subject number corresponding to the order of inclusion 
in the study ( 7 digits) and the initials of the subject ( 1 letter for forename, 1 letter for middle 
name and 1 letter for surname).  
 
The Sponsor or their designee will review the eCRFs entered by investigational site staff for 
completeness and accuracy and instruct the investigational site staff to make any required 
corrections or additions.  Queries will be sent to the investigational site using an electronic data 
query within the EDC system.  Designated investigational site staff will be required to respond to 
the query and make any necessary changes to the data.   
 All corrections and alterations of data on the eCRFs must be made by the Investigator or by the appointed persons as instructed in the eCRF guidelines. If corrections or alterations are 
required of paper source documents, corrections may be made in the following manner: strike 
through the datum to be corrected using a single line so that the original remains legible; 
correction fluid must never be used. The correction should be written to the side or above the 
original entry and must be initialed and dated by the Investigator or one of his designated team.  
 It is the responsibility of the monitor to make certain that all data are completed on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator and the monitor must sign and date the eCRF per the eCRF procedure in order 
to attest respectively to the:

 17. APPENDIX 2. INTERNATIONAL HEADACHE SOCIETY 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA  
 
1. MIGRAINE  
 
1.1. Migraine without aura   
 Description:  
Recurrent headache disorder manifesting in attacks lasting 4- 72 hours. Typical characteristics 
of the headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, aggravation by routine physical activity and association with nausea and/or photophobia and 
phonophobia 
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. At least 5 attacks
1 fulfilling criteria B -D 
B. Headache attacks lasting 4- 72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)2;3;4  
C. Headache has at least two of the following characteristics:  
1. unilateral location5;6  
2. pulsating quality7  
3. moderate or severe pain intensity  
4. aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity ( eg, walking or 
climbing stairs) 
D. During headache at least one of the following:  
1. nausea and/or vomiting 
2. photophobia and phonophobia8  
E. Not attributed to another disorder9  
 
Notes:  
1. Differentiating between 1.1 Migraine without aura  and 2.1 Infrequent episodic tension -type 
headache  may be difficult. Therefore at least 5 attacks are required. Individuals who otherwise meet 
criteria for 1.1 Migraine without aura  but have had fewer than 5 attacks should be coded 1.6.1 
Probable migraine without aura.  
2. When the patient falls asleep during migraine and wakes up without it, duration of the attack is 
reckoned until the time of awakening.  
3. In children, attacks may last 1- 72 hours (although the evidence for untreated durations of less than 2 
hours in children requires corroboration by prospective diary studies).  
4. When attacks occur on ≥15 days/month for >3 months, code as 1.1 Migraine without aura and as 
1.5.1 Chronic migraine.   
5. Migraine headache is commonly bilateral in young children; an adult pattern of unilateral pain 
usually emerges in late adolescence or early adult life.  
6. Migraine headache is usually frontal temporal . Occipital headache in children , whether unilateral or 
bilateral, is rare and calls for diagnostic caution; many cases are attributable to structural lesions.  
7. Pulsating me ans throbbing or varying with the heartbeat.

COL MIG -302 FINAL  v1.0 November 30, 2015   
 Proprietary and Confidential  63 of 74 
   
 
 8. In young children, photophobia and phonophobia may be inferred from their behavior . 
9. History and physical and neurological examinations do not suggest any of the disorders listed in 
groups 5- 12, or history and/or  physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder 
but it is ruled out by appropriate investigations, or such disorder is present but attacks do not occur for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.  
 
 
1.2  Migraine with aura 
 Description:  
Recurrent disorder manifesting in attacks of reversible focal neurological symptoms that usually develop gradually over 5- 20 minutes and last for less than 60 minutes. Headache with the 
features of migraine without aura usually follows the aura symptoms. Less commonly, headache 
lacks migrainous features or is completely absent.  
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. At least 2 attacks fulfilling criterion B  
B. Migraine aura fulfilling criteria B and C for one of the sub- forms 1.2.1 -1.2.6  
C. Not attributed to ano ther disorder
1  
 
 Notes: 
1. History and physical and neurological examinations do not suggest any of the disorders listed in 
groups 5- 12, or history and/or physical and/or neurological examinations do suggest such disorder 
but it is ruled out by appropriate investigations, or such disorder is present but attacks do not occur 
for the first time in close temporal relation to the disorder.

Medication Overuse Headache 
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. Headache1 present on ≥15 days/month fulfilling criteria C and D  
B. Regular overuse2 for ≥3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or 
symptomatic treatment of headache3  
C. Headache has developed or markedly worsened during medication overuse 
D. Headache resolves or reverts to its previous pattern within 2 m onths after discontinuation 
of overused medication4  
 
Notes:  
1. The headache associated with medication overuse is variable and often has a peculiar pattern with 
characteristics shifting, even within the same day, from migraine- like to those of tension- type 
headache.  
2. Overuse is defined in terms of duration and treatment days per week. What is crucial is that 
treatment occurs both frequently and regularly, ie, on 2 or more days each week. Bunching of 
treatment days with long periods without medication intake, practi ced by some patients, is much 
less likely to cause medication- overuse headache and does not fulfil criterion B.  
3. MOH can occur in headache- prone patients when acute headache medications are taken for other 
indications.  
4. A period of 2 months after cessation of overuse is stipulated in which improvement (resolution of 
headache, or reversion to its previous pattern) must occur if the diagnosis is to be definite. Prior to 
cessation, or pending improvement within 2 months after cessation, the diagnosis 8.2.8 Probable 
medication -overuse headache should be applied. If such improvement does not then occur within 
2 months, this diagnosis must be discarded.  
 
 
Medication overuse headache (MOH) as defined by ICHD II:  
o Opioids ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening 
o Combination medications ( e.g., Fiorinal®) ≥ 10 days a month  
o NSAIDS or other simple medications > 14 days a month during the 90 days prior to 
screening 
o Triptans or ergots ≥ 10 days a month during the 90 days prior to screening

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types)  Past X Years or  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:  
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part 
thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated 
with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or 
harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury 
results, this is considered an attempt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be 
inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but 
they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?  
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to 
relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)? (Self-Injurious 
Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:  
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for 
that, actual attempt would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting. Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an 
attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose 
around neck but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Behavio r was in part thou ght of as method to kill oneself. I ntent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire t o die associated w ith the act, then it

harm , just the potenti al for injury o r harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mo uth but gun 
is broken so no in jury results, this is considered an attempt. 
Inferring Intent: Eve n if an in dividual denies intent/wi sh to die, it m ay be inferred clinically 
from the behavio r or circumstance s. For example, a highly lethal act that i s clearly not an 
accident so no other intent but suic ide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpin g from 
window o f a high floor/story). Also, if someone de nies intent to die, but they thought th at

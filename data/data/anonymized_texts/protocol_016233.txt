Study Design:  
This is a two -part, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group  Phase 3 clinical trial with 
an in itial assessment of increasing BSA treatment (Part 1) .  After the completion of Part 1, a separate 
set of eligible subjects wil l be enrolled  to assess all areas affected by ichthyosis (Part 2).   
Part 1  Design :  
Part 1 will evaluate the safety, tolerability , and efficacy of treatment to the affected area of ichthyosis 
 
 
Qualified  subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ADX -102 1% or vehicle. Subjects or 
caregivers will apply study drug (i.e., ADX -102 1% or vehicle) once daily  to a treatment area identified 
by the Investigator  from Week 1 thr ough Week 12.  If the Investigator determines that there are no safety 
or tolerability issues  at the end of Week 12 , treatment will increase to all of the affected area s of ichthyosis 
on one -half of the body from Week 13 through Week 20.  If no safety or tolerability issues are identified  
at the end of Week 20  the treatment will increase to all affected areas of ichthyosis on the entire body 
from Week 21 through Week 24 .  
Subjects completing 24 weeks of study drug treatment will then be monitored for an ad ditional 4 weeks 
for safety.   
In total, s ubjects will be followed for up to 28 weeks and monitor ed for safety and efficacy at up to 
10 study visits: up to 6 site visits  and 4 home visits.  Apart from the Day 1 and Day 2 visits , each study 
visit has a ± 5-day window , and home visits have a ± 3 -day window . 
Study procedures are  outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 1 -1). 
Subjects who are randomized  in Part 1 will not be eligible to participate in  Part 2.  
Part 2  Design :  
Part 2 will evaluate the safety, tolerability , and efficacy of treatment to the affected area of ichthyosis on 
the body (approximately 80 -90% BSA in a typical SLS patient) over 24 weeks of exposure .   
Qualified  subjects will be randomized  in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ADX -102 1%  or vehicle. The 
appropriate sample size for Part 2 will be confirmed in Part 1 . Subjects will be followed for up to 28 weeks 
and monitored for safety and efficacy at up to 10 study visits : up to 7 clinic visits  and 3 telephone calls 
with the site .  Apart from  the Day 1  and Day 2 visits, each study v isit has a ± 5-day window , and telephone 
calls have a ± 3 -day window . 
Study procedures are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 and Table 2 -1). 
Subjects who complete  Part 1 or  Part 2 of the study will be eligible to continue into a separate open -label 
extension study.

Statistical Analysis:  
Part 1 and Part 2 will be analyzed in a similar fashion with the exception that the Part 1 analysis will 
include a sample size evaluation.  Part 1 analyses in some ins tances may be confined to the descriptive 
aspect of the evaluation (i.e., infer ential p -values may be omitted) due to the small sample size of 6 
treated and 3 control patients.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (VIIS scaling severity as assessed by the Investi gator in the target efficacy 
area) as well as all secondary efficacy variables that are captured on a continuous or semi -continuous 
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc.  Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
Proprietary and Confidential  6 of 55  scale  
 
 will be expressed as baseline to ending change  scores.  T wo-sided 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed and used descriptively for all variables bu t also to evaluate 
change relative to a standard for some variables (i.e., by determining whether the CI includes or excludes 
the standard).   
The two -sided 95% CI for VIIS scaling severity will be used to evaluate th e primary endpoint as follows. 
An efficacy claim from Part 2 will be made if: 1) the lower confidence interval is above zero, 2) the mid -
point of the confidence interval is at least 0.5 units is size, and 3) at least 50% of subjects have favorable 
change sc ores of one or greater.  
Response over time will be converted to one or more Area Under the Curve parameters and evaluated 
using a generalized linear model. VIIS outcome scores and other continuous or semi -continuous 
outcome variables will be evaluated using a Mixed Model Repeated  Measures (MMRM) analysis.  
Conversion of VIIS or other scales to indicate response (yes/no) will occur (e.g., 0.5 VIIS improvement, 
1 unit VIIS improvement) and be evaluated as secondary endpoints.  Logistic or Generalized Estimating 
Equation (GEE) modeli ng will be used to evaluate incidence of response overall and/or by time.  Time 
to Event analysis (e.g., Kaplan -Meier with log rank test, proportional hazards [PH] modeling) will be used 
to evaluate time to response.    
To increase statistical power, covar iates may be incorporated into the computation of 95% confidence 
intervals (e.g., through the use of a mean centered covariate in a regression model to predict the mean 
pre-treatment to post -treatment difference) and/or into logistic, GEE, PH, MMRM and gen eralized linear 
models.    
All analyses will be specified a priori  in an Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to be completed prior to 
database lock for Part 1.  The SAP will serve as the summative and definitive plan of analysis.  Analyses 
not described in the  SAP will be labeled as post-hoc.  The SAP will outline all analyses that will be 
performed in Part 1 and in Part 2 of this study.   
Sample Size Rationale:  
Part 1 will assess the effect size on the VIIS  scaling severity score , and will confirm the sample s ize 
needed for Part 2. Part 2 is expected to require approximately 30 subjects.  
Data Safety Monitoring Board : 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be established to review all available safety 
data after approximately 9 subjects have co mpleted Week 24 in Part 1 .  The assessment of safety will 
be determined from dermatological endpoints, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, 
hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, ECG readings, use of concomitant medications, and review 
of AEs.  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will provide recommendations about stopping or 
continuing the trial.  
The DSMB will be advisory to the Sponsor’s clinical trial leadership group Steering Committee  which will 
be blinded during P art 1 until  database lock . The Steering Committee will be responsible for promptly 
reviewing the DSMB recommendations, to decide whether to continue or terminate the trial, and to 
determine whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct are required .  
Additional DSMB reviews will occur approximately every 6 months throughout the trial , or as deemed 
necessary by the DSMB or Sponsor to ensure subject safety and well -being. Study enrollment and 
dosing will continue while the DSMB evaluates data. A DSMB ch arter will be prepared.  The charter will 
contain the required information for the formation, activities, and conduct of the DSMB.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Sjögren -Larsson Syndrome  
ADX-102 1% is being developed for the treatment of ichthyosis associated with  Sjögren -Larsson 
Syndrome (SLS).   SLS (ICD Q87.1) is a rare , chronically -debilitating , autosomal -recessive 
disorder characterized by generalized ichthyosis, cognitive deficit  in a majority of patients , and 
spastic diplegia or tetraplegia .  SLS is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2  gene that encodes 
fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of aliphatic 
aldehydes to fatty acids ( 3).  
In most patients, ichthyosis (dry, thickened, scaly, erythematous skin that is pruritic and, due to 
frequent excoriation, friable) is moderate or severe, particularly promi nent in flexure areas, and 
involves much of the body surface except the face and glabrous skin ( 3).  The dermal symptoms 
are generally recalcitrant  to therapy, and are associated with significant daily physical and 
emotional burden and social stigma for patients and caregivers .  The cutaneous symptoms are 
apparent at birth in almo st all patients; they become more established by several months of age 
and remain throughout life ( 2).  Developmental delay, spasticity, and other neurological symptoms 
become apparent over the first 2 years of life.  The onset of neurologic symptoms usually prompts 
recognition of a diagnosis of SLS rather than another type of ichthyotic disorder ( 2). 
SLS ichthyo sis pathophysiology is well understood; fatty aldehydes disrupt dermal function, 
particularly the epidermal fatty moisture barrier, resulting in pathologic water loss, cutaneous 
desiccation, and compensatory keratinocytic hypertrophy ( 1).  In epidermal cells, FALDH 
deficiency results in impaired oxidation of long -chain fatty aldehydes to fatty acids.  The 
consequent accumulation of aldehydes disrupts the normal function and secretion of lamellar 
bodies and leads to intercellular lipid deposits in the stratum corneum and a defective water barrier 
in the skin layer, resulting in the cutaneous symptoms of SLS ( 2). 
Ichthyosis related to SLS is a serious disease and there is  no currently approved treatment that 
targets the underlying disease.  Bathing several hours per day and over -the-counter moisturi zing 
creams are the main interventions used to attempt to treat the symptoms, but have only limited 
and variable results, lasting for no more than a few hours.   Keratolytic agents, salicylic acid, and 
urea are also considered for treatment.  Patients with severe ichthyosis who are unresponsive to 
topical agents typically receive treatment with systemic retinoids, which are associated with a 
variety of toxicities.  Patients are not  usually  maintained on retinoids due to concerns about 
toxicity, particularly in pediatric patients.   No clinical intervention has been well studied in SLS 
patients, and therapeutic efficacy is generally  variable.   There is considerable social stigma  in 
SLS since the skin appearance resembles disseminated cutaneous infectious disease and scales 
often emit a foul odor due to bacterial overgrowth and putrefaction .

1.3 Clinical Trials of ADX -102 
1.3.1  Sjögren -Larsson Syndrome  
Study NS-003 was a randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled , parallel group Phase 2 clinical 
trial evaluating the activity of ADX -102 1% topical dermal cream  at a dose of 8 mg/cm2 in subjects 
with ichthyosis associated with  SLS.  
A total of 12 male and female subjects  aged 6 years or older (range 8 to 25 years) with genetically 
confirmed SLS and active ichthyosis on the lower extremities that was determined to be of 
moderate severity or higher  were enrolled and randomized 1:1  to ADX-102 1% or vehicle. 
Subjects received study drug (ADX -102 1% or vehicle) once daily for 8 weeks.   
The target area for treatment was an area on the lateral aspe ct of the lower leg, up to 
approximately 10 inches in height by 4  inches wide.  In the cases where the lower leg did not 
have an ideal target area for treatment, the Investigator chose an area on another portion of the 
body as the target area.  The lower l eg was not utilized in only one subject whose right upper 
back was identified by the Investigator as the target treatment area.  
 
 
 
 
In this Phase 2 clinical trial, the reduction in the severity of the ichthyosis in ADX -102-treated 
subjects was statistically significant relative to baseline.  The most common reduction in the 
severity of the ichthyosis (assessed by the scaling ISS sub -score) in ADX -102-treated subjects 
over the duratio n of drug exposure (eight weeks) was one point from a median baseline severity 
of 3, representing an average change from moderate to mild disease.  In addition, the activity of 
drug was statistically superior to that of vehicle.  ADX -102-treated subjects s howed greater mean 
and percentage decreases from baseline, and a higher proportion of ADX -102-treated subjects 
exhibited favorable individual responses than that of the vehicle -treated subjects for all the ISS 
sub-scores, except for excoriations.  
ADX-102 1% w/w topical dermal formulation  was generally well -tolerated and there were no 
significant or  serious adverse e vents (SAE) , or treatment -emergent adverse e vents ( TEAE s) that 
led to treatment discontinuation.   
 
 
  No 
pattern of changes was observed  with ADX-102 for chemistry analytes , hematology parameters , 
or vital signs.   
Overall, the results of Study NS -003 demonstrated that the ADX-102 1% w/w topical dermal 
formulation  was safe and well -tolerated , and improved SLS  ichthyosis in a clinically and 
statistically significant manner superior to that of vehicle.

 1.3.2  Ocular Indications  
As a topical ocular formulation, ADX -102 was safe and well -tolerated in a Phase 1 cl inical trial 
and demonstrated efficacy and safety in Phase 2 clinical trials in allergic conjunctivitis and 
noninfectious anterior uveitis.   
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information.  
1.4 Minimization of Risk   
In the Phase 2 clini cal trial in SLS patients (NS -003), 8 weeks  of daily application of ADX -102 1% 
w/w topical dermal formulation  over ~3% body surface area ( BSA) has been shown to be safe 
and well-tolerated .  
ADX-102 has been well -tolerated in multiple nonclinical , single dose and repeat dose 
pharmacology and toxicology studies in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and non-human  primates, via 
topical dermal (TD), topical ocular (TO), oral (PO), intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC), and 
intravenous (IV) routes of administ ration. Of particular relevance to TD application, Good 
Laboratory Practice ( GLP) studies testing up to ADX -102 5% topical dermal cream have shown 
that TD administration of ADX -102 to Göttingen minipigs for 21 days and nine weeks was 
well-tolerated, with n o local or systemic adverse effects observed. In a standard battery of 
genotoxicity tests, ADX -102 was non -mutagenic and non -clastogenic. Furthermore, in vivo central 
nervous system (CNS), respiratory, and cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies showed no 
adverse effects with ADX -102. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
information.  
The Phase 3 study design  includes a n assessment of increasing BSA treatment  (Part 1) lasting  
24 week s in approximately 9  eligible subjects receiving ADX -102 1% or vehicle topical dermal 
cream  initially  over approximate ly 20% BSA then increasing to up to 90% BSA .  The assessment 
in Part 1 will allow for real -time evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of ADX -102 1% relative 
to vehicle treatment  dosed over longer durations and greater BSA than in the Phase 2  study . After 
completion of Part 1 of the Phase 3 study , a separate set of eligible subjects will be enrolled into 
Part 2 that allows for the assessment of the safety o f vehicle relative to ADX-102 1% treatment  
on all areas of ichthyosis . 
In addition, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established to review 
all available safety data after approximately 9 subjects have completed study Week 24 in Part 1 .  
Additional DSMB reviews will occur approximately every 6 months throughout the trial , or as 
deemed necessary by the DSMB or Sponsor to ensure subject safety and well -being . The 
assessment of safety will be determined from dermatological endpoints,  vital sign measurements, 
physical examinations, hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, cardiac monitoring , use of 
concomitant medications, and review of adverse events (AEs) .  Refer to Section  3.4.1 . 
1.5 Potential Benefit  
As described above, SLS ichthyosis is generally recalcitrant to therapy. Phase 2 clinical trial 
results in SLS patients treated over ~3% BSA with ADX -102 1% for 8 weeks  demonstrated that 
ADX-102 was effective  in treating the ichthyosis associated with SLS.   
The Phase 3 study will assess he activity of ADX -102 1% after 24-week s of dosing  over all skin 
area affected by ichthyosis (approximately 80 – 90% BSA in a typical SLS patient).

 1.6 Rationale for Dose Selection  
It has been shown that free aldehydes  are cytotoxic. In one study, free all -trans -retinal resulted 
dose -dependent cell death of ARPE19 cells, with complete or nearly complete cell death observed 
at 10 µM (5).  A similar phenomenon was observed in HEK293 cells.  S ince tissue necrosis is not 
evident in the skin of SLS patients, the theoretical maximum aldehyde concentration likely less 
than 10  µM. Because ADX-102 binds aldehydes with a 1:1 stoichiometr y, maximal drug target 
levels in skin are 10  µM. GLP nonclinical studies in Göttingen minipigs have shown that once -daily 
application of 1% w/w ADX-102 topical dermal cream results in ADX -102 skin concentrations that 
meet or exceed this target.  The Phase 2 clinical trial results confirmed the activity of once -daily 
ADX-102 1% administration.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan   
This is a two -part, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled , parallel -group  Phase 3 clinical 
trial with an initial assessment  of increasing BSA treatment  (Part 1) .  After the completion of Part  1, 
a separate set of eligible subjects wil l be enrolled into  Part 2.   
Part 1 Design:  
Part 1 will evaluate the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of treatment to the affected area of 
ichthyosis initially on approximately 20% BSA and then increasing  up to  90% BSA over 24 weeks 
of exposure  and will confirm an appropriate sample size for Part 2.  
Subjects will be consented and screened for eligibility.  A pproximately 9 subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive ADX -102 1% or vehicle.   
Subjects or caregivers will apply study drug (i.e. , ADX-102 1%  or vehicle)  to a treatment area  
identifi ed by the Investigator.   
The initial treatment area  will be defined as approximately 20% BSA  with Grade 2 or higher on 
the VIIS scaling severity score , as assessed by the Investigator, and will include one of the body 
sites as defined in the VIIS tool  (target efficacy area).1 From Week 1 through Week 12, subjects 
will receive treatment  once daily  in the initial treatment area only.   
If the Investigator determines that there are no safety or tolerability issues  at the end of Week 12 , 
the treatment area will increase to all of the affected area s of ichthyosis on one -half of the body 
(approximately 40 -45% BSA  in a typical SLS patient) . From Week 13 through Week 20, subjects 
will receive treatment once daily on the expanded treatment area . 
If there are still no safety or tolerability issues  at the end of Week 20 , the treatment area will further 
increase to all affected areas of ichthyosis on the entire body ( approximately, 80 -90% BSA  in a 
typical SLS patient). Subjects will receive treatment once daily treatme nt on all affected areas 
from Week 21 through Week 24.     
Subjects completing the 24 week s of study drug  treatment will then be monitored for an additional 
4 weeks for safety.   
Subjects who are randomized  in Part 1 will not be eligible to participate in Part 2.   
                                                
 
1 Dorsal foot cannot be selected as the target efficacy area.

 Part 2 Design : 
Part 2 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment to the affected area of 
ichthyosis on the body (approximately 80 -90% BSA in a typical SLS patient) over 24 weeks of 
exposure.   
Subjects will be consented and screened for eligibility.  Qualified  subjects will be randomized  in a 
2:1 ratio  to either ADX -102 1% or vehicle. The appropriate sample size for Part 2 will be con firmed 
in Part 1.  Subjects or caregivers will apply study dru g (i.e.,  ADX-102 1% or vehicle) once daily to 
all affected areas of ichthyosis on the body (approximately  80 – 90% of BSA in a typical SLS 
patient).  
The target efficacy area for all efficacy analys es at Week 24 will be one of the body sites as 
defined in the VIIS tool  with Grade 2 or higher on the VIIS scaling severity  as assessed by the 
Investigator .1 
3.2 Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
3.2.1  Subject Numbering  
Each  subject screened for the study will be assigned a unique  subject number that will be used 
to identify the subject throughout their participation in the study.  If a subject fail s to be randomized, 
the reason should be documented in the source documents  and case report form ( CRF). The 
subject will be considered a  screen failure.  
3.2.2  Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized 2:1 to receive ADX -102 1% or vehicle  through interactive response 
technology (IRT)  at Baseline Visit Day 1.   
3.3 Blinding and Unblinding  
3.3.1  Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized in a double -blind fashion . Investigators, qualified study personnel, 
subjects, and caregivers will be blinded to the study drug treatment administered.  The Sponsor 
will also be blinded to the study drug treatment administered until database lock (Part 1 and Part 
2). 
3.3.2  Emergency Unb linding  
Emergency unblinding should only be performed when necessary to treat the subject.  Most often, 
knowledge of the possible treatment assignments is sufficient to treat a study subject who 
presents with an emergency condition.  
Unblinding will result  in the subject being discontinued from the study, irrespective of whether the 
Investigator the event is deemed related to study drug.

 There is no known antidote to ADX -102, so symptomatic and supportive management of any 
suspected and treatment -related a dverse event, if necessary, is clinically indicated.  
The t reatment code for a subject may only be broken by the Inv estigator or Sponsor for reasons 
of subject  safety or in an emergency when knowledge of the study drug administered would be 
important fo r the treatment of the patient.  However, the Investigator should make every effort to 
contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the subject’s emergency and the need to unblind , prior to 
unblinding any subject.  
In situations in which the Investigator has tried b ut is unable to reach the Medical Monitor, the 
Investigator should use his/her best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical 
situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed 
the situation with th e Medical Monitor.  Once a subject's treatment assignment has been 
unblinded, the Medical Monitor should be notified within 24 hours of unblinding of the treatment, 
without revealing the study treatment.   
The blind may be broken in the case of a pregnancy  should the subject desire this information.  
The date, time and reason for breaking the blind are to be recorded in the subject’s CRF and 
source documents.  
In the event of a drug -related, serious, unexpected AE, the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department or designee will be provided with the treatment assignment for the subject for 
regulatory reporting.  
3.4 Safety Oversight  
During the study, subject safety will be monitored on a continuous basis by the Medical Monitor 
until the last subject  completes his or h er last scheduled study assessment.  
3.4.1  Data Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent DSMB will be established to review all available safety data after approximately 
9 subjects have completed Week 24 in Part 1 .  The assessment of safety will be determined from  
dermatological endpoints, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, hematology and 
chemistry laboratory testing, ECG readings, use of concomitant medications, and review of 
adverse events.  Based on the safety data provided, the DSMB will provide re commendations 
about stopping or continuing the trial.   
The DSMB will be advisory to the Sponsor’s clinical trial leadership group Steering Committee  
which will be blinded during P art 1 until database lock . The Steering Committee will be responsible 
for pro mptly reviewing the DSMB recommendations, to decide whether to continue or terminate 
the trial, and to determine whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct are 
required.  
Additional DSMB reviews will occur approximately every 6 months throughout the trial , or as 
deemed necessary by the DSMB or Sponsor to ensure subject safety and well -being. Study 
enrollment and dosing will continue while the DSMB evaluates data.  A DSMB charter will be 
prepared.  The charter will contain the required i nformation for the formation, activities, and 
conduct of the DSMB.

 5.4 Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator or designee  will maintain accurate records of receipt and condition of st udy drug , 
including dates of receip t. In addition, accurate records will be kept of the date dispensed, quantity 
dispensed, and the subject to whom study drug was dispensed. Any reasons for departure from 
the protocol -specified dispensing regimen must also be recorded.  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for monitoring the inventory of study drug and for the 
accountability of all used and u nused study drug.  Drug accountability will be verified  by the study 
monitor during site visits and at the completion of the trial.   
Refer to the  Pharmacy Manual for additional details.  
5.5 Study Drug Retention  
Study drug must be retained until  completion or termination of the study, and written authorization 
from the Sponsor  has been received. A ll unused and used study drug should be destroyed at the  
site or returned to the distributor, as specified by Sponsor. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure that the Sponsor has provided written authorization prior to return or destruction, and that 
appropriate records of the disposal are documented  and maintained. No used or unused study 
drug may be disposed until fully accounted for by the study monitor.  
5.6 Treatment Administration  
The target efficacy and treatment area s will be identified by the Investigator  as noted below .  The 
Investigator will apply the initial dose of study drug and at designated timepoints when  study drug 
will be applied to expanded treatment areas.  These applications will be observed by the subject 
and caregiver at the study center.  Thereafter, subjects o r caregivers will apply subsequent doses 
throughout the  duration of the study.   
A standard amount of study drug for the percent  
BSA under treatment will be measured and applied to the treatment area once daily  to achieve a 
dose of  approximately  8 mg/cm2, with each application administered approximately 24 hours 
apart.  Study drug should o nly be administered to the treatment area , as directed by the 
Investigator, during the study.   
Subjects or caregivers are required to wear protective gloves during applic ation and thoroughly 
wash their hands after application to prevent study drug exposure.   
At scheduled study visits at the site, s ubjects may not bath e or apply study drug  or as -needed 
topical symptom control therapy (emollients) to the treatment area  within 12 hours of examination 
or photographic assessment.  Subjects should refrain from applying as -needed topical symptom 
control therapy and bathing within 4 hours of  applying s tudy drug to the treatment area .  The 
treated area should be covered by loose clothing to minimize light exposure.   
Target Efficacy Area  used for the primary endpoint  assessment in Part 1 and Part 2  will be based 
on one of the body sites as defined in the VIIS tool (upper back, upper arm or lower leg/shin)1 that 
has a VIIS scaling s everity score of Grade 2 or higher  as assessed by the Investigator . The body 
                                                
 
1 Dorsal foot cannot be selected as the target efficacy area.

Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 28 of 55 
 site with the worse VIIS scaling  severity score should be selected , if applicable.  The target 
efficacy area will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
Treatment Area  will be determi ned by the Investigator as follows:  
In Part 1 , the initial treatment area will be defined as approximately 20% BSA with Grade 2 or 
higher on the VIIS scaling severity score , on one -half of the body, left or right side,  and will include 
the target efficacy area. From Week 1 through Week 12, study drug will be applied  in the initial 
treatment area.  
If the Investigator determines that there are no safety or tolerability issues  at the end of Week 12 , 
the treatment area will increase to all of the affected areas  of ichthyosis on one -half of the body  
(approximately 40 -45% BSA in a typical SLS patient ), left or right side .  From Week 13 through 
Week 2 0, the study drug will be applied to the extended treatment area affected by ichthyosis.  
If there are still no safet y or tolerability issues at the end of Week 20, the treatment area will further 
increase to all affected areas of ichthyosis on the entire body (approximately 80 -90% BSA in a 
typical SLS patient) .  From Week 21 through Week 24, the study drug will be appli ed to the entire 
body affected by ichthyosis.   
For example, if the left lower leg is determine d by the Investigator to be the target  efficacy area, 
then the entire left leg would likely be defined as the initial treatment area.  At the end of Week  12, 
if there are no safety or tolerability  issues, the treatment area would extend  to the entire l eft side 
of the body.  At the end of Week 20, if there are no safety or tolerability issues, the treatment area 
would include the entire body.  
In Part 2 , the treatm ent area will be defined as all affected areas of ichthyosis on the body 
(approximately 80 – 90% of BSA  in a typical SLS patient) .  Subjects will be treated  for 24 week s 
followed by a safety follow -up visit  4 weeks after the end of dosing .   
Refer to the P harmacy Manual for d etailed information regarding tre atment administration.

9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 
AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent form through 30 days 
after the last study drug administration . 
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a study drug  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug , 
whether or not it is considered related to the study drug.  
Abnormal laboratory and other abnormal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam) should not 
be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to trea tment 
discontinuation or are otherwise considered clinically relevant by the Investigator.  In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered 
as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fat ality, the cause of death is considered 
as the AE, and the death is conside red as its outcome.  
9.1.1.1  Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events  
Pre-existing medical  conditions/signs/symptoms present before the Screening Visit  that do not 
worsen in severity or  frequency during the study are defined as baseline medical conditions, and 
are not to be considered AEs.  
Pregnancies are not considered AEs but must be reported, see Section 9.1.8 . 
9.1.1.2  Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs must be recorded in the site’s study records and the AE CRF.  Investigators should use 
correct medical terminology when recording events and avoid abbreviati ons.   
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, symptoms 
and/or other clinical information.  The diagnosis, and not the individual signs/symptoms or 
laboratory abnormalities, should be documented in the subject’s s ource documents and the CRF 
unless the etiology of the event is unknown.   If signs/symptoms cannot be medically characterized 
as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be 
recorded as an AE.  If a diagnosis is  subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up 
information.  
An assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to study drug, the interventions required to trea t it, and the 
outcome.  
9.1.1.3  Assessment of Causality and Severity  
For each AE recorded, the Investigator will make an assessment of causality and severity as 
follows:  
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 43 of 55 
 1. Relationship to Study Drug:  The Investigator must assess whether they consider an AE 
to be dru g-related. In assessing this relationship, the Investigator must use information 
about the drug as outlined in the Investigator’s Brochure, the subject’s pre -existent 
medical conditions/concurrent medication, and chronology of the event relative to drug 
administration. The following definitions will be used:  
• Definitely or possibly related  applies to those AEs that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the Investigator (or 
other qualified physician) to have at  least a possible relationship to study drug.  
• Unlikely or not related  applies to those AEs that, after careful medical consideration 
at the time they are evaluated, are considered by the Investigator (or other qualified 
physician) to have no relationship, or an unlikely possibility of a relationship, to study 
drug.  
2. Event Severity:  The Investigator will be asked to use their medical judgment to assess 
the severity of the AE.  
The following are guidelines to be used by the Investigator to judge the event seve rity of 
an AE:  
• Mild - awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
• Moderate - discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
• Severe - incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
• Life-Threatening  
3. Duration: Start and end dates and times, or if continuing.  
4. Frequency: whether the event is a single episode, recurrent or continuous.  
5. Action taken.  
6. Whether it constitutes a SAE, per definition below.  
7. Outcome: resolved, resolved with sequelae, continuing, death, or unknown (on ly for 
subjects that are lost to follow -up). 
9.1.2  Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
A TEAE will be an AE that occurred during the study after the first dose of study drug or that was 
present prior to dosing and exacerbates after the first dose of study drug.  
9.1.3  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death: This includes death unrelated to the study drug (e.g. , car accident).  If some subject 
dies during the study and an autopsy is performed, autopsy results will become part of the 
subject’s study chart and a copy should be sent to the Sponsor.  
• Life-threatening experience: Life -threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form).  
• Required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization: Exceptions will be hospitalizations for a) 
elective or p replanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 44 of 55 
 indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug or b) treatment 
on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE  
and not resulting in hospital admission .  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Congenital anomaly . 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when,  based upon medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
9.1.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected adverse event is defined as an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consis tent 
with the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
9.1.5  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causality, to the Sponsor 
designee within 24 hours of learning of the occurrence.  SAEs should be sent to:  
 
 
(Local toll -free numbers will be provided on the SAE report form cover sheet.)    
The reporting timeframe starts when the  subject signs the informed consent or assent form 
through 30 days after the last study drug administration. At a minimum, a description of the event 
and the Investigator’s judgment of causality must be provided at the time of the initial report. 
These pre liminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions that will include copies of 
hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable.  
A follow -up SAE Report must be submitted within 24 hours of the Investigator r eceiving the 
follow -up information (such as information regarding complications, progression or resolution).   
An SAE that is considered completely unrelated to a previously reported event should be reported 
separately as a new SAE.  
The procedures for repo rting SAEs are as follows:  
• Complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form. ”  The Investigator may contact 
Pharmacovigilance  via the telephone hotline for assistance with SAE reporting.  
• Fax or email the SAE Form to the attention of Pharmacovigilance  within  24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet (or email) must be kept 
with the source documentation at the study site.  
Follow -up information should be communicated the same way, using a new SAE Report Form 
stating that it is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original 
report. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if 
and how it was treated, and  whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation.  
The Investigator and study personnel should institute any supplemental investigations of SAEs 
based on their clinical judgment of likely causative factors. This may include clinical labo ratory

 tests not specified in the protocol, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with specialists. 
The Sponsor or their designee may also request the Investigator to conduct supplemental 
assessments.  
If the SAE was not previously documented in t he Investigator’s Brochure and is thought to be 
related to study drug, the Sponsor or their designee may urgently require further information from 
the Investigator for regulatory authority reporting. The Sponsor may need to issue an Investigator 
Notificati on to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has 
been reported.  
The Investigator should notify Pharmacovigilance of any death or SAE occurring after a subject 
has withdrawn from the study when such a death occurs wi thin 30 days of the last dose of study 
drug and may reasonably be related to the study drug.  
9.1.6  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be followed until stabilization/resolution or until clinical database lock.   
All SAEs will undergo active follow -up until  resolved or the event becomes chronic or stable.  
Follow -up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be incorporated into the safety 
database.  
9.1.7  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Health Authorities/  Institutional 
Review Boards/ Research Ethics Boards/Independent Ethics Committees  
The Investigator is responsible for following all local regulations for the reporting of safety 
information, including the reporting of SAEs to their local IRB/REB/IEC . 
The Investigator must prom ptly report to his or her local IRB/REB/IEC  all unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subjects.  This includes death from any cause and all serious adverse events 
reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug.   
The Sponsor or their designee  is responsible for appropriate reporting of relevant AEs, suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction s (SUSARs ) involving study drug,  to all regulatory 
authorities.  
In addition, the Sponsor  or designee will be responsible for the submission of safety le tters 
(e.g., SUSARs)  to the central IRB/REB/IEC and to participating Investigators of all SUSARs 
involving study drug  according to applicable regulations.  
After termination of the clinical study (determined as  last subject, last visit ), any unexpected saf ety 
issue that changes the risk -benefit analysis and is likely to have an impact on the subjects who 
have participated in it, will be reported by the Sponsor  as soon as possible to the competent 
authority(ies) concerned together with proposed actions.  
9.1.8  Repo rting Pregnancies  
Pregnancies  will be reported from the time the subject signs the informed consent form through 
final study visit or 30 days after the last study drug administration , whichever is later.  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subjec t on study drug must be reported to 
Pharmacovigil ance within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  Subjects who become pregnant 
will be withdrawn from the study.  The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, 
including spontaneous or volunta ry termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence 
of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 46 of 55 
 Pregnancy should be recorded on a subject’s source documents and a Pregnancy Notification 
and Outcome Form and reported by the Investigator to Pharmacovigil ance using the same 
procedure for reporting SAEs detailed in Section 9.1.5 . A pregnanc y, by itself, is not a n SAE.   
Pregnancy follow -up should also be recorded and should include an assessment of the possible 
relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy -related SAE 
(e.g., spontaneous abortion , birth defect ) or any  other SAE experienced during pregnancy must 
be recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and reported per SAE rep orting procedures in 
Section 9.1.5 . 
10 STATISTICS  
Part 1 and Part 2 .  Safety data will be systematically reviewed throughout Part 1 and Part 2 of 
the study by the independent, unblinded DSMB. Statistical analyses for Part 1 and Part 2 will be 
described a priori  in a Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) generated pr ior to Part 1  database lock .  
Any post-hoc analyses in either of the Part 1 or Part 2 final reports will be clearly labeled as such.  
Because both Part 1 and Part 2 will evaluate active treatment and vehicle subjects randomly 
assigned under a 2:1 active to  vehicle schedule, it is anticipated that the Part 1 and Part 2 final 
reports will present a common set of analyses except for an additional sample size calculation in 
Part 1.  Efficacy and Safety parameters will be statistically evaluated under separate f inal reports 
for Part  1 and for Part 2 of the study.   
Part 1 . Statistical analyses for Part 1 will address both efficacy and safety.  Both safety and 
efficacy data obtained throughout the Part 1 period will be evaluated at the end of Part 1 by the 
sponsor  and/or a contracted statistical organization, both of whom will have remained blinded 
until Part 1 data lock .  The limited sample size of Part 1 may confine certain analyses to the 
descriptive aspect of the evaluation due to a limited sample size (i.e., i nferential p -values may be 
omitted). Unblinded  Part 1 safety and efficacy results will be available to the Sponsor for 
administrative consideration and use upon completion  of Part 1 .  Efficacy data will be used to 
generate a sample size estimation for Part  2 as well as to perform between groups and within 
group descriptive and inferential statistical analyses.  Baseline to ending Part 1 change scores for 
the primary efficacy endpoint (VIIS scaling severity) will be used to calculate a Part 2 samples 
size un der the assumption of a mean change score of .5 units, a standard deviation obtained 
during Part 1, an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 90%.  The sample size will be based on the initial 
target efficacy area that will have been selected at the beginning of Par t 1 and independently 
evaluated over the 24 -week cour se of the Part 1 study period.  Assuming the absence of a safety 
impairment, the existence of a mean active treatment change score near or greater than 0.5 units, 
and recruitment feasibility of the estim ated sample size, the Sponsor will instigate Part 2 of the 
trial.      
Part 2 .  Statistical analysis of all Part 2 data will be carried out at the end of Part 2 by the Sponsor 
and/or a contracted statistical organization, both of whom will have remained blinded until Part 2 
data lock .  Part 2 analyses will be independent of Part 1 analyses with respect to efficacy 
parameters and will be used exclusively to support the spo nsor’s claim.  However, at the end of 
Part 2, all available safety data will be stratified by Part 1 and Part 2 and presented in the Part 2 
final report by stratum and overall.

 10.1 Sample Size  
Part 1  of the study will assess the effect size on the VIIS scalin g severity score with ADX -102 1% 
topical dermal cream , and will confirm the sample size needed for Part 2. Part 2 is expected to 
require approximately 30 subjects.  
The approximate number of 30 subjects for Part 2 was based on the NS -003 Phase 2 study  which  
used  the ISS endpoint . The mean ISS Scaling sub -score change from baseline was -0.7 with a 
standard deviation of 0.52.  Conservatively, the change was set to -0.5 and the standard deviation 
to 0.6.  A sample size of 20 achieves 94% power to detect a diffe rence of 0.5 between the null 
hypothesis mean of 0.0 and the alternative hypothesis mean of -0.5 with an estimated standard 
deviation of 0.6 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two -sided one -sample t -test.  
If the above assumptions remain , except that the standard deviation is increased to 0.7, then a 
sample siz e of 20 achieves a power of 85%.  The sample size of 30 is therefore based on these 
estimates requiring 20 subjects to be treated with ADX -102 1%.  As subjects will be randomized 
in a 2:1 ratio, 10 subjects will be treated with vehicle.   
10.2 Analysis Populations  
The statistical analysis will be based on the analysis populations as defined below  
Safety Population  All randomized subjects who use at least one dose of study 
drug, regardless  of whether  they undergo any study 
assessments.  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  All randomized subjects who use at least one dose of study 
drug and have any post -dose assessments.  Subjects are 
evaluated according to  the study drug to which they are 
randomized.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population  All ITT subjects will be considered PP if they dose with study 
drug and do not deviate from the protocol.  
The following is a list of protocol violations which would exclude subjects  from the PP population:   
• Subject did not receive study drug as assigned.  
• Subject did not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
10.3 Accountability and Background Characteristics  
10.3.1  Enrollment and Disposition  
The number of subjects enrolled, by study population and Investigative site, will be presented by 
treatment group.  The primary reasons for discontinuation will be summarized by treatment and 
based on the safety population.  The number and percentage of subjects with protocol deviations 
or subjects requiring  rescue therapy leading to exclusion from the PP population will be presented 
by reason for exclusion, stratified by treatment.  All deviations and rescued subjects will be listed.  
10.3.2  Subject Characteristics  
Subject characteristics will be obtained at the Screening  prior to randomization and will be 
summarized by treatment group and overall.  Summaries will include descriptive statistics for 
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 48 of 55 
 continuous measures (sample size, mean, standard deviation  [SD], median, minimum, maximum) 
and for categorical measures (sample size, frequency and percent ages ).   
Subject characteristics will be summarized on all study populations.  
10.3.3  Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed in terms of the actual dose.  Treatment compliance will 
be used to characterize the  subjects and determine clinical evaluability for some analyses.  
Treatment compliance will be summarized within each treatment group by means of descriptive 
statistics ( sample size , mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum).  
10.4 Efficacy Analyses  
A conclusion co ncerning efficacy will be based on evaluation of data in Part 2.  A primary efficacy 
analysis will be conducted as well as a number of secondary efficacy analyses.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (VIIS scaling severity  as assessed by the Investigator in the target 
efficacy area ) as well as all secondary efficacy variables that are captured on a continuous or 
semi -continuous scale (e.g., VIIS erythema score, central reader assessed VI IS scales, 
EQ-5D-5L, clinical global impression of severity, Patient /Observer  impression scales, 
Patient -Reported Itching, CDLQI/DLQI, lipid biomarkers and TEWL) will be expressed as baseline 
to ending change scores.  Two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be computed and used 
descript ively for all variables but also to evaluate change relative to a standard for some variables 
(i.e., by determining whether the CI includes or excludes the standard).   
The two -sided 95% CI for VIIS scaling severity will serve as the primary analysis and w ill be used 
to evaluate this primary endpoint as follows. An efficacy claim will be made if: 1) the lower 
confidence interval is above zero, 2) the mid -point of the confidence interval is at least 0.5  units 
is size, and 3) at least 50% of subjects have fav orable change scores of one or greater.  
The primary and secondary scores measured on a continuous or semi -continuous scale also will 
be evaluated using Mixed Model Repeated Measures to assess the effects of treatment (active 
vs. vehicle), time (per collec tion schedule), and treatment x time.  In addition to descriptive 
statistics for the raw data used in each model, the LS means and standard errors will be reported 
for each main effect and interaction, as well as for treatment contrasts (i.e., active LS me an minus 
vehicle LS mean) at each data collection time point.  If informative, covariates may be added to 
one or more models.  Statistical significance unadjusted for multiplicity for main effects, 
interactions and contrasts will be reported.  However, nei ther the main effect of treatment nor the 
treatment contrasts at time points are expected to be statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) due to 
power restrictions at the between group level imposed by recruiting realities . 
Response over time will be converted to one or more A rea Under the Curve parameter s and 
evaluated using a generalized linear model. VIIS outcome scores and other continuous or semi -
continuous outcome variables will be evaluated using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) analysis.  Conversio n of VIIS or other scales to indicate response (yes/no) will occur 
(e.g., 0.5 VIIS improvement, 1 unit VIIS improvement) and will be evaluated as secondary 
endpoints.  Logistic or Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) modeling  will be used to evaluate 
incidence of response overall and/or by time.  Time to Event analysis (e.g., Kaplan -Meier with log 
rank test, proportional hazards [PH] modeling) will be used to evaluate time to response.  
To increase statistical power, cov ariates may be incorporated  into the computation of 95% 
confidence intervals (e.g., through the use of a mean centered covariate in a regression model to 
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 49 of 55 
 predict the mean pre -treatment to post -treatment difference) and/or incorporated into logistic, 
GEE, PH, MMRM and generalized lin ear models.   
Categorical variables  other than responder status  will be descriptively summarized in contingency 
tables .  Selective inferential analysis at each time point or across time points will be conducted  
using non -parametric or exact statistics with or without further stratification as described in the 
SAP.  
10.5 Safety Analyses  
10.5.1  Adverse Events  
The assessment of safety will be determined from dermatological endpoints, vital sign 
measurements, physical examinati ons, hematology and chemistry laboratory testing, ECG 
readings, use of concomitant medications, and review of adverse events.   
The SAP will contain mock tables for all safety relevant information which will be produced for 
each study part and over the ent ire study.   
Safety tables will contain by treatment and combined treatments information concerning AEs, 
TEAEs, SAEs , unexpected AEs and clinical safety laboratory values.  Treatment and vehicle 
group safety narratives will be written.  If required a safet y narrative will be written for selected 
subjects.  AEs, TEAEs, unexpected AEs and SAEs will be coded according to the Medical 
dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms.  Tables variously organized by 
preferred terms, system organ class , treatment emergence, treatment relationship, severity and 
study termination will be presented for AEs, TEAEs , unexpected AEs and SAEs.   
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment and time for safety laboratory values or in 
change tables for c ategorized lab variables (e.g., normal vs. abnormal, present vs. absent). Other 
safety information (e.g., normality of dermatological endpoints, normality of vital signs , normality 
of physical exami nations, normality of ECG outcomes, concomitant  medi cation  usage) will be 
summarized in tables and medically evaluated .  
If inferential analysis for any safety variable seems appropriate, the comparison will be made 
using an appropriate statistical test and designated as  post-hoc.  
11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASS URANCE  
The Sponsor and the Contract Research Organization (C RO) conducting trial management will 
implement a system of quality assurance that includes all elements described in this protocol. 
Within this system, standard operating procedures (SOPs ) from the Sponsor and CRO will be 
implemented to ensure that the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with regulatory 
requirements and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Quality control will be applied to each stage of 
data handling to ensure that data ar e accurate, reliable and processed correctly.

 implementation.  In addition, the IRB/REB/IEC must approve the written informed consent and 
assent forms, any consent or assent form updates, subject recruitment proced ures 
(e.g.,  advertise ments), and any written information to be provided to subjects prior to 
implementation.  
The Investigator must provide an annual report to the IRB/REB/IEC on the progress of the study 
including number of subjects enrolled, discontinued, and SAEs , unless ot herwise specified by the 
IRB/REB/IEC . It is required that a yearly review of the protocol by the IRB/REB/IEC be 
documented in a letter from the  IRB/REB/IEC. The Investigator must provide notification to the 
IRB/REB/IEC of the completion, termination or dis continuation of the study.  
The Investigator must supply the Sponsor with copies of all written correspondence with the 
IRB/REB/IEC.  
The Invest igator  will make all attempts to ensure that the IRB is constituted and operates in 
accordance with regulatory req uirements, ICH GCP and any local requirements.  
12.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The clinical study will be carried out in keeping with national and local legal requirements , 
including in  accordance with regulatory requirements outlined in Food and Drug Adminis tration 
(FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21  [Part 50, Part  54, Part 56, Part 312 and Part  11] 
as well as the ICH GCP E6 Guidelines. This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented 
and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized  Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical 
Practice, with applicable local regulations [including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US CFR 
Title 21 ], and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
12.3 Subject Informed Consent  / Assent  
The S ponsor will provide sample Informed Consent and Assent Forms for use in this trial.  Any 
changes to the proposed consent and assent forms suggested by the Investigator must be agreed 
to by the Sponsor before submission to the IRB/REB/EC.  The Investigator or designee will 
provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/REB/IEC -approved informed consent and assent 
forms prior to the start of the study.   
Before each subject is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating site. Subjects who are 
under the age of 18 (or lower if age of consent is less than 18 in a specific country) and whose 
legal guardian or caretaker has provided written informed consent will provide their assent to 
participate.  
The subjects should sign the cu rrent final IRB/REC/EC approved consent form.  The process of 
obtaining informed consent and assent should be documented in the subject source documents.  
Each Investigator must retain the original signed and dated informed consent and assent forms.  
A cop y of the signed and dated informed consent and assent forms will be given to the subject.  
No subject can enter the study, or have study specific assessments performed before his/her 
informed consent has been obtained.  
The Informed Consent and Assent Forms should be revised whenever there are substantial 
changes to procedures or when new information becomes available that may affect the 
willingness of the patient to participate.  Revisions to the consent forms required d uring the study 
must be approved by the Sponsor, and a copy of the revised consent forms  provided to the 
Sponsor. For any updated or revised forms, the subjects must be re -consented for continued 
participation in the study.

 12.4 Confidentiality  
All study findin gs and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The Investigator and qualified  
study personnel must not disclose such information without prior written approval from t he 
Sponsor.  The Investigator agrees not to use or disclose protecte d health informati on other than 
as permitted or required by the subject authorization or as required by law.  
Subject confidentiality will be strictly maintained to the extent possible under the law.  Subject 
names must not be disclosed.  Subjects will be identified on the C RFs and other documents 
submitted to the Spon sor by their initials  (if locally permissible)  and/or  assigned subject number ; 
not by name .  Documents that identify the subject (e.g., the signed informed consent form ) must 
be maintained in confidence by the I nvestigator. All study documents are provided by the Sponsor 
in confidence to the Investigator and his/her qualified study personnel.  None of this material may 
be disclosed to any party not directly involved in the study without Sponsor’s written permissi on. 
The Investigator must assure that subjects ’ anonymity will be maintained.  The Investigator will 
maintain this for the longest period of time allowed by his/her own institution and, in any case, 
until further communication from the Sponsor.  
12.5 Protection of Subject Data  
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be limited 
to those data that are necessary to investigate the safety, quality, and utility of the investigational 
study drug(s) used in this study  and to support the development and interpretation of the trials 
clinical outcomes assessments . 
These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality 
and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regul ations. Appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized 
disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be 
put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibi lities require access to personal data agree to 
keep the identity of study subjects confidential.  
The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the collection and 
processing of personal data and for the Investigator to allow direct access to his or her original 
medical records for study -related monitoring, audit (s), IRB/REB/EC review, and regulatory 
inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other 
countries.  
12.6 Study Monitoring  
Prior  to initiation of the study at a study site , the Study Monitor , who is an authorized individual 
designated by the Sponsor , will visit the study site to verify the qualifications of the Investigator 
and study team, inspect the adequacy of the facilities and inform the study team of their 
responsibilities and the procedures to ensure proper conduct of the study. During the conduct of  
the study the Study Monitor will visit the sites to verify adherence to the protocol , assess drug 
accountability, data integrity and subject safety. The monitors will conduct 100% source document 
verification  of subject data  by comparing the CRFs with the  source documents to ensure accuracy 
and consistency.  
All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored with respect to GCP and SOPs for compliance 
with applicable government regulations. The Study Monitor will have access to all records 
necessary to e nsure integrity of the data and safety of the subject, and will periodically review the 
progress of the study with the Investigator.

Proprietary and Confidential  Page 52 of 55 
 Frequent communication between the clinical site and the Sponsor is essential to ensure that the 
safety of the study is mon itored adequately.  
12.7 Case Report Forms and Source Documents  
An electronic data capture (EDC) system will serve as the data management system for this study .  
The Investigator will be responsible for the accuracy o f the data entered in the EDC system and 
ensure that the data collected are a ccurate and complete.  Data will be monitored within the EDC 
system by the study monitor who has only reading rights. Any changes required following 
monitoring will be made by  the Investigator or  qualified study  personnel a nd will be documented 
with a full audit trail within the EDC system.  The responsible study monitor will check data at the 
monitoring vis its to the clinical study site.   
The Investigator or qualified study personnel will prepare and maintain adequate and a ccurate 
study documents (e.g. , medical records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, source 
data collection forms, etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each 
subject.  It is recommended that th e author of an entry in the source documents be identifiable.  
Source data may be directly captured from devices, transferred from third parties (e .g., laboratory 
data), or entered manually into the EDC system in use at the clinical center. In such case, many 
of the source data  will only be available electronically. The remainder of the data, captured initially 
on paper, may be entered retrospectively into the EDC system.  
For each subject, CRF and corresponding source records will be maintained at each clinical site.  
CRFs shoul d be completed in a timely manner, and every effort should be made to have forms 
completed and current in anticipation of a visit by the Sponsor or designee.  Upon study 
completion, the monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files, after whic h the file should 
be secured by storage for the appropriate period as specified in Section 13.  
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor  or designee(s), contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the IRB/REB/IEC to have direct access to all documents pertaining  to 
the study.  
12.8 Access to Source Documents and Audits  
Regulatory agencies may request access to all study records, including source documents, for 
inspection and copying, in keeping with country regulations. The Investigator should immediately 
notify the S ponsor of any announced or unannounced regulatory agency inspections. An auditing 
inspection may also be conducted by the Sponsor representative or designee. Any aspect of the 
trial may be subject to audit by the Sponsor and/or inspection by regulatory aut horities or the 
IRB/REB/IEC. Such audits/inspections may take place at the Sponsor’s site(s), the CRO, or at 
the clinical sites, including laboratories, pharmacies and any other facilities used for the study.  
The Investigator will permit the designated Sp onsor representatives and regulatory bodies to have 
direct access to the source documents to verify data represented in the EDC system.   
12.9 Protocol Deviations and Violations  
Exceptions to the eligibility criteria will not be granted. It is expected that sub jects will meet all 
eligibility criteria.  Departures from the protocol should be avoided, unless required for the safety 
of the subject.  Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require deviation from 
protocol -specific procedures, the Invest igator should contact the Sponsor to discuss the 
appropriate course of action.   
Aldeyra Therapeutics , Inc. Protocol ADX-102-SLS-006 
Final  Protocol  V1.0 17OCT2 017           
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 53 of 55 
 The Investigator should document all protocol deviations/violations in the subject’s CRF and 
source documents or the Investigator Site File, if appropriate. Protocol deviation s will be 
documented by the study monitor and will be included in the final clinical study report. Protocol 
deviations should be submitted to IRB/REB/IEC , in accordance with the site’s IRB/REB/IEC  
requirements . 
12.10  Amendments to the  Protocol  
To alter the proto col, amendments must be written by the Sponsor and approvals must be 
received from all parties that approved the original protocol (IRB/REB/IEC, and if applicable, the 
local regulatory authorities) before implementation.  Notwithstanding  the need for appro val of 
formal protocol amendments, the Investigator is expected to take any immediate action required 
for the safety of any subject included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from 
the protocol.   
The Sponsor may make administrative changes (i.e., changes that do not significantly affect 
subject safety, the study’s scope or scientific quality) without a formal protocol amendment.  
12.11  Discontinuation of the Study  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study under the conditions  specified in the 
clinical trial agreement.  
12.12  Investigator Responsibilities  
The Investigator(s) should be qualified by education, training, and experience to assume 
responsibility for the proper conduct of the study, should meet all the qualifications specif ied by 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should provide evidence of such qualifications 
through up -to-date curriculum vitae and/or other relevant documentation requested by the 
Sponsor, the IEC /REB /IRB, and/or the regulatory authority(ies).  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance with 
the protocol, current ICH guidelines on GCP, and applicable regulatory and local requirements.  
GCP  is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for designing, conducting, recording, 
and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this 
standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects are 
protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that the

5 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954   1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 Disease  Overview  
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of legal blindness in Americans aged 55 - 
74, accounting for 8% of all legal blindness and 12% of the newly blind (Llein and 
Klein, 1995). Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of Type 1 and Type 2 
diabetes,  as well as for women with gestational diabetes, affecting more than 2.5% 
of the U.S. population, or more than 5.3 million Americans aged 18 or older 
(Friedman, et al., 2007).  
 
Age and race appear to play a role in the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy 
(Friedman, et al., 2007). Caucasians are the most commonly affected in the age 
group less than 40, as are Hispanics in the older than 40 population. The longer the 
duration of diabetes, the greater the risk there is of developing diabetic retinopathy.  
 
Three  forms of retinopathy are commonly recognized in association with all forms of 
diabetes mellitus: 1) non -proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR}, 2) proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and 3) diabetic macular edema (DME).  
NPDR is characterized by o phthalmoscopically visible abnormalities that include 
microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, exudates, retinal nerve fiber layer 
infarcts called cotton wool spots, and, in more severe cases, venous beading and 
intraretinal microvascular abnormalities.  
 
Over time, NPDR may progress to more severe PDR, the hallmark of which is 
neovascularization on the surface of the retina, optic disc, iris, or anterior chamber 
angle. PDR is associated with a high risk of visual morbidity arising from vitreous 
hemorrhage,  traction retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma (Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study [DRS] Research Group, 1979).  
 
DME, the third form of diabetic retinopathy, is characterized by swelling of the 
central part of the retina that mediates high -resolution visio n. DME frequently 
coexists with, and is superimposed upon NPDR or PDR. When the area of swelling  
DAVE/ML27954  7 10 JUNE 2014   1.2 Treatment of Diabetic Macular  Edema  
The current standard of care for DME is suboptimal. Although focal las er 
photocoagulation plays a significant role in the management of patients with DME, 
its effect is often transient and inadequate. Fewer than 15% of patients gain more 
than three lines of best -corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 years, whereas> 15% 
sustain  moderate vision loss of more than three lines. Focal laser is less effective in 
cases of diffuse macular edema. Photocoagulation is a destructive therapy and 
often causes symptomatic Paracentral scotomas, which can become disabling after 
multiple treatmen ts. Vitrectomy is often reserved for the most refractory cases of 
DME and is associated with vitreous traction and bleeding. It also carries surgical 
risks (cataract formation, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis) and has not 
been validated in large, r andomized studies.  
 
1.2.1   Glucose Control  
Although glucose control does not have a direct treatment effect on macular edema, it 
plays a role in the management of diabetic retinopathy as a primary and secondary 
prevention strategy. In the time frame of 3 or more years, improving blood pressure 
slows progression of retinopathy (DCCT Research Group, 1993; UKPDS Research 
Group, 1998a, 1998b). The cumulative incidence and progression of retinopathy, 
defined as a change of three or more steps on fundus photography (FP) sustained over 
a 6-month period, wa s similar in the two treatment groups (conventional and intensive 
glucose control) until approximately 3 years. By 5 years of follow -up, there was a 
significant reduction in the risk of sustained progression of retinopathy by 78% in the 
intensive therapy g roup compared with the conventional therapy group in the primary 
prevention cohort. In the secondary intervention cohort, the progression of retinopathy 
In the secondary intervention cohort, the progression of retinopathy was reduced by 
54% in the intensiv e therapy group during the entire study period compared with those 
assigned to the conventional therapy group, while the need for laser treatment was 
reduced by 56%. This suggests that glycemic control is not necessarily efficacious in 
reducing the progres sion of retinopathy. There was a reduction in the incidence and 
progression of retinopathy for those receiving intensive treatment earlier in the course  
DAVE/ML27954  9 10 JUNE 2014   likely to lose 15 or more letters on the ETDRS visual chart at 3 years than those who were 
not (12% vs. 25%). For the CSME -CI subgroup of CSME, subjects assigned to receive 
early macular laser photocoagulation were also less likely to lose 15 or more lette rs at 3 
years than those who were not (13% vs. 33%) (ETDRS Research Group 1987). In a more 
recent study comparing laser photocoagulation with intravitreal corticosteroids for DME 
involving the fovea, laser -treated patients gained a mean of+ 1 ETDRS letter from baseline 
to 2 years, and+ 5 ETDRS letters from baseline to 3 years. At 2 years, 14% of laser­ 
treated patients had lost 15 or more ETDRS letters, and 18% had gained 15 or more 
ETDRS letters. Among patients who completed 3 years from study baseline, 30 % of 
patients treated with laser photocoagulation improved by 15 or more ETDRS letters, and 
9% lost 15 or more ETDRS letters (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Network, 2008 and 2009). 
Although photocoagulation for CSME -CI is a significant achievement in the m anagement of 
diabetic retinopathy, laser treatment still leaves 9% -13% of patients losing more than 15 
letters of vision at the end of 3 years. Moreover, given that 69% of subjects with CSME in 
the ETDRS group had center involvement at presentation (ETDRS Research Group 1987), 
the unmet  clinical  need  for better  treatment  of CSME -CI is significant.  
 
1.2.3   lntravitreal Corticosteroids  
Limited clinical experience from non -randomized case series provided early evidence of 
therapeutic effect from intravitreal corticosteroids for the management of focal and diffuse 
DME. The biologic basis for the suggested beneficial effect most likely deri ves from the 
ability of corticosteroids to inhibit VEGF gene expression (Nauck et al., 1998). In a study of 
26 eyes of 20 subjects by Jonas et al. (2006), a single 25 mg intravitreal injection of 
triamcinolone acetonide (TA; Kenalog \) was associated with a  significant mean VA 
improvement (p < 0.001) from 20/165 at baseline to 20/105 at the end of a 6 -month follow­ 
up. In comparison, 16 subjects observed in a "control group" that received grid laser 
photocoagulation showed no improvement in VA. In a separate  uncontrolled study of 16 
eyes with CSME that did not respond to laser photocoagulation, a 4 -mg intravitreal injection 
of TA resulted in mean VA improvement of 2.4, 2.4, and 1.3 Snellen lines and reduction of 
central macular thickness by 55%, 57%, and 38% measured at the 1, 3, and 6 -month  
follow -up intervals, respectively (Martidis et al. 2002). In a third study of 12 subjects (24  
10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954  11  anatomy. These "pulling" vector forces on the retina may cause and exacerba te macular 
edema. Cases such as these, in which a mechanical traction complicates the pathology of 
macular edema, are less responsive to laser therapy, and presumably, intravitreal 
corticosteroids. Vitrectomy may play a role in this setting to prevent seve re vision loss.  
Some studies of subjects with DME have reported DME resolution in 45% -82% of eyes, 
and VA improved by two or more lines in 49% -86% of subjects (van Effenterre et al., 1993; 
Tachi and Ogino 1996; Pendergast et al. 2000).  
 
1.2.5   Pegaptanib Sodium Injection  
Results from an experimental anti -VEGF therapy, pegaptanib sodium injection 
(Macugen®), showed evidence of biologic effect in DME. Pegaptanib is an inhibitory 
aptamer, currently approved for the treatment of neovascular (wet) age -related macular 
degenerati on (AMO). It is delivered as an intravitreal injection every 6 weeks.  
 
In a Phase II, double -masked, sham -controlled study of 172 subjects with DME, 73% of 
those receiving 0.3 mg pegaptanib experienced stable or improved vision (defined as < 15- 
letter los s) at Week 36 compared with 51 % of those who received a sham injection (p = 
0.023) (Cunningham et al. 2005). Among subjects treated with 0.3 mg pegaptanib, 59% 
reported a vision gain of at least one line (5 letters) versus 34% of those given sham 
injection s (p = 0.01O); 34% reported a vision gain of at least two lines (10 letters) versus  
10% of those given sham injections (p = 0.003); and 18% reported vision gain of at least  
three lines (15 letters) versus 7% of sham (p = 0.12). In addition, 42% of subjects  receiving  
0.3 mg pegaptanib showed a decrease of at least 100 µm in mean retinal thickness 
compared with 16% of those receiving sham injections. Additionally, at the end of the study, 
only half as many subjects who received pegaptanib needed additional la ser therapy 
compared with those receiving usual care (25% vs. 48%) (Cunningham et al. 2005). The 
study adds further evidence that intravitreal anti -VEGF therapy for DME is tolerated and 
could provide benefit in this disease process.  
 
1.2.6  Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab (marked under the trade name Avastin®) is an anti -VEGF monoclonal  
10 JUNE  2014  DAVE/ML27954  13  showed that three monthly injections of 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab were tolerated by 
subjects with CSME -CI. At 3 months, 4 of 10 subjects gained;;;: 15 letters, 5 of 10 subjects  
gained  ;;;: 1 O letters,  and 8 of 10 subjects  gained  ;;;: 1 letters.  At Month  3, the 0.5 mg and 0.3 
mg ranibizumab groups demonstrated a change of+ 7.8 (A} 8.1) and+ 12 (A} 20) letters in 
mean BCVA. The mean decrease in retinal thickness of the center point of the central 
subfield was 45.3 A} 196.3 µm for the low -dose group an d 197.8 A} 85.9 µm for the high­ 
dose group. Although subjects in both dose arms showed improved BCVA from baseline to 
6 months on average, the anatomic and functional outcomes were better for the high -dose 
group.  
 
In another Phase I, Genentech -supported 1 ST, results are available on 10 subjectswith 
CSME -CI who received the higher dose (0.5 mg) of ranibizumab with three initial monthly 
injections followed by retreatment every 2 months. Mean BCVA increased significantly to+  
12.3 letters at 7 months, with a c orresponding decrease of - 246 µmin mean foveal 
thickness. This effect was seen despite prior multiple laser treatments in 8 of the 10 
subjects and prior intravitreal triamcinolone treatment in 3 subjects. Similar to data from 
Genentech's AMO clinical trial s of ranibizumab, the onset of effect occurred after the first 
dose and was sustained with monthly injections. A slight attenuation of anatomic outcome 
was seen with the 2 -month retreatment interval but a return of benefit was evident after re­ 
injection ( Nguyen et al. 2006).  
 
1.4  Nonclinical Experience with Ranibizumab  
1.4.1   Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of ranibizumab have been investigated in rabbits and cynomolgus 
monkeys following intravitreal and intravenous administration. In b oth species, following 
intravitreal administration, ranibizumab was cleared from the vitreous humor with a half -life 
of 2-3 days. Following single intravitreal administration to cynomolgus monkeys, retinal 
concentrations of ranibizumab were approximately o ne third of vitreous concentrations and 
declined in parallel with vitreous concentrations. In humans, the intravitreal half -life of 
ranibizumab is estimated to be 7 -8 days. Repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 
can lead to detectable antibodies i n serum in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys.  
15 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954    
Although there was a low rate (<4%) of arterial thromboembolic events  (ATEs)  observed  in 
the ranibizumab clinical trials there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal  use  of 
inhibitors  of VEGF.   The rate of ATEs  in three  studies  (FVF25 98g,  FVF2587g,  and 
FVF3192g) in the first year was1.9% of subjects in the combined  group  of subjects  treated 
with 0.3 mg or  0.5 mg ranibizumab  compared  with  1.1% of  subjects  in the control  arms  of 
the studies.  In the second  year  of Study  F VF2598g  and FVF2587g,  the rate of ATEs was 
2.6% of subjects in the combined group of those treated with 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg ranibizumab 
compared with 2.9% of subjects in the control arm. The most common non -ocular adverse 
reactions observed in.'.".. 15% of ranibizumab -treated subjects that occurred  more frequently 
than in control subjects included, nasopharyngitis, headache, and upper  respiratory  tract 
infection.  
 
The Sailor study (FVF3689g) evaluated the safety of intravitreal ranibizumab in a large 
popu lation of subjects with CNV secondary to AMO. Subjects in Cohort 1 (N=2378) were 
randomized (1:1) to receive ranibizumab at a dose level of 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg; subjects were 
masked to these dose levels. Treatment was administered monthly for three initial do ses 
(Day 0, Month 1, and Month 2), with scheduled follow -up visits on Months 3,6,9, and 12.  
Retreatment after the first three injections was performed as needed, on the basis of 
predefined criteria with injections no more frequently than every 30 days.  
 
Cohort 2 (N=1992) consisted of subjects enrolled after the majority of Cohort 1 subjects 
had been enrolled, with enrollment continuing until ranibizumab was approved or denied by 
the FDA for US marketing, and if approved, until commercially available or 30 S eptember 
2006, whichever was earlier. Subjects in Cohort 2 received open -label ranibizumab at the  
0.5 mg dose level, with an initial injection on Day O followed by retreatment at the 
physician's discretion, no more frequently than every 30 days. Subjects were monitored for 
safety for a total of 12 months; safety information, including both serious and nonserious 
adverse events, was collected at every clin ic visit, with two formal safety visits scheduled at 
Months 6 and 12.

1) Assess  number  of ranibizumab  injections  in each  of the two cohorts required 
through Month  36. 
2) Evaluate  the mean  change  over time in ETDRS  BCVA  through  Month  36 
3) Incidence  and severity  of ocular  and non-ocular  adverse  events  (AE's)  through 
Month  36. 
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The following secondary outcome measures will be evaluated:  
1) Percentage  of patients  who experience  a loss of 15 or more  letters  from 
Baseline to Month 12, 24, and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
2) Determine  percentage  of patients  who experience  a gain of 15 or more  letters 
from Baseline to Month 12, 24, and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
3) Evaluate mean change in central retinal thickness over time  through Month 12, 
24, and 36 as assessed by high resolution  OCT's.  
4) Percentage  of patients  with persistent  macular  edema  post-intravitreal  injection.  
5) Mean change in peripheral visual field as measured by Goldmann visual  field at 
screen and Months 12, 24, and  36. 
 
3. STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1 Description of the  Study  
This study  is a Phase  1/11,  multicenter,  randomized,  study  of the efficacy  and safety 
of 0.3 mg ranibizumab injection monotherapy verses a duel therapy of 0.3 mg 
ranibizumab combined with ultra wide 200° field angiography guided pan retinal 
photocoagulation  in patients  with CSME -CI secondary  to diabetes  mellitus  (Type  1 
or 2). 
19 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954   C). After the first session of PRP, subject's will have ultra wide 200° field 
angiography performed every 3 months to indicate areas of peripheral ischemia, 
which will be selectively treated at V9 (Month 6), V21 (Month 18), and V28 (Month 
25), preserving a reas of more perfused retina. This will minimize any visual field 
loss secondary to nonselective pan -retinal photocoagulation.  
 
3.2 Rationale for Study  Design  
Ranibizumab is a Fab antibody with a high affinity and specificity for VEGF -A. VEGF -A 
plays a critical role in DME as a driving factor for retinal vascular permeability, which is the 
main cause of visual impairment in patients with center -involving CSME. B ased on 
nonclinical data and clinical experience in AMO and DME, the 0.5 mg and 0.3 mg 
ranibizumab doses were selected to characterize the safety and efficacy of intravitreal 
ranibizumab injections in subjects with CSME -CI. Both doses have established safe ty and 
efficacy profiles in subjects with neovascular AMO. The primary efficacy endpoint, the 
percentage of subjects gaining 2: 15 letters at 12 months, was chosen to demonstrate 
benefit to visual function and has been used as a functional endpoint in prio r studies of 
ranibizumab in AMO.  
 
The RISE/RIDE protocol determined that only 30% of all subjects getting monthly 
intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab were completely dry on OCT measurement. 
The rationale of the DAVE study is the addition of utra wide 200° field angiogram guided 
pan-retinal photocoagulation will reduce the VEGF drive and increase visual function and 
decrease the total number of intravitreal injections needed in a 12 -month period.  
 
Compared with prior therapies, ranibizumab is highl y effective in preventing or reducing 
vision loss. In the pivotal Phase Ill clinical studies of ranibizumab for neovascular AMO, 
MARINA and ANCHOR, approximately 95% of treated patients achieved the primary visual 
acuity (VA) endpoint of losing :s; 15 lett ers in the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study (ETDRS) best corrected VA (BCVA), compared with 53% of sham -injected patients 
and 66% of patients treated with Visudyne® -photodynamic therapy (PDT). A significant 
number of patients treated with rani bizumab experienced durable improvement in VA. In  
10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954  21  3.3 Outcome  measures  
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
The primary outcome measures for safety and tolerability are the following:  
1) Mean change over time in EDTRS BCVA through Month  36 
2) The comparative  difference  of total number  of intravitreal  injections  between Cohort 
1 versus Cohort  2. 
3) Incidence and severity of  ocular and non -ocular adverse events (AEs) through 
Month  36 
 
3.3.2   Secondary Outcome Measures  
1) Percentage of subjects who experience a loss of 15 or more letters from Baseline to 
Months 12, 24 and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
2) Percentage of subjects who experience a gain of 15 or more letters from Baseline to 
Months 12, 24 and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
3) Mean change in central retinal thickness over time through Months 12, 24 and 36  as 
assessed by high resolution  OCT.  
4) Mean change in perip heral visual field as measured by Goldmann Visual  Field  
assessed through Month 36.  
 
 
3.4  Safety Plan  
The safety and tolerability of intravitreal ranibizumab injections have been investigated in 
previous Phase I, 1/11, 111, and lllb studies in AMD. Potential safety issues associated with 
the route of administration or the pharmacology of ranibizumab in the study population 
include decreased BCVA, intraocular inflammation intraocular infection, transient and/or 
sustained eleva tion of intraocular pressure (IOP), cataract development or progression, 
retinal or intravitreal hemorrhage, macular edema, retinal break or detachment, and arterial 
thromboembolic events (ATEs). Safety will be assessed by visual acuity, ophthalmic 
examina tions including intraocular measurements, fluorescein angiograms, adverse events 
and vital signs.  
 
To minimize the risks of intraocular injections, all injections will be performed employing  
23 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954   • BCVA  score  in the study  eye of 20/32  to 20/320  approximate  snellen  equivalent  using

investigator.  
• High Definition  OCT (Spectralis)  central  retinal thickness  measurement  of ,a: 300 µm 
• Decrease  in visual  acuity  is determined  to be primarily  the result of  DME  and not to 
other  cause.  
• Ability  and willingness  to return  for all scheduled visits  and assessments.  
• Clear  ocular  media  and adequate  pupillary  dilatation  to permit  good  quality fundus 
photography.

discontinuing the subject from  the study.  
 
4.7 Study  Discontinuation  
Retina Consultants of Houston or Genentech may terminate this study at any time.  
 
 
Reasons for terminating the study may include the following:  
1) The incidence or severity of adverse events in  this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to  subjects 
2) Subject enrollment is  unsatisfactory  
3) Data  recording  is inaccurate  or incomplete  
 
 
4.8 Statistical  Methods  
4.8.1  Analysis of the Conduct of the  Study  
The analysis of data from the 36 -month treatment period will be performed when all 
patients have either completed the visit at Month 36 or discontinued early from the study. 
Treatment assignment will be unmasked to the personnel performing the analysis whe n all 
data collected through Month 36 are in the database and the data have been cleaned and 
verified.  
 
The analysis of complete data (36 -month treatment period) for the study will be performed 
when all patients have either completed the visit at Month 36 or discontinued early from the 
study, all data collected from the study are in the database, and the dat abase is locked.  
Aggregate results of the 36 -month analysis, summarized by treatment group, may be 
reported to the public before completion of the study.  
10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954  31  This is a phase 1/2 study with 40 subjects, desc riptive summaries will be provided for the 
specified co -primary endpoints, comparisons will be performed for hypothesis generating 
purposes only and no definitive inference will be made. Thus, multiplicity adjustments are 
not planned.  
A. Primary  Endpoints  
1) Mean change in  number of intravitreal injections through Month 36.  
2) Mean change over time in ETDRS BCVA from  Baseline through Month 36.  
3) Incidence  and severity  of ocular  and non-ocular  adverse  events  (AEs) 
through Month  36. 
B. Secondary  Endpoints  
1) Percentage of subjects who experience a loss of 15 or  more letters from 
Baseline  to Month  12, 24, and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
2) Percentage  of subjects  who experience a  gain of 15 or more  letters  from 
Baseline  to Month  12, 24, and 36 in ETDRS  BCVA.  
3) Mean change in central retinal thickness over time through Month 12, 24,  and 
36 as assessed by high resolution  OCT.  
4) Mean change in peripheral visual acuity as measured by Goldmann  Visual 
Field assessed through Month  36. 
 
4.8.6  Missing  Data  
Analyses of efficacy and safety will be based on available cases, without imputation for 
missing values.  
 
4.8.7  Interim  Analyses  
No formal schedule of interim analyses is planned. Reports of adverse events from the 
study may be reviewed and summarized periodical ly while the study is ongoing to ensure 
the safety of subjects.  
 
 
 
 
4.9  Data Quality Assurance  
33 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954   3) It requires or  prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
4) It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial  disruption  of the subject's  ability  to conduct  normal  life functions).  
5) It results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  in a neonate/infant  born to a mother 
exposed to the  IMP.  
6) It is considered  a significant  medical  event  by the Investigator  based  on medical 
judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical 
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  above).  
 
5.3 Methods and Timing for Assessing and Recording Safety  Events  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and 
Genentech, Inc. in  accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 
AEs of Special Interest are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result of 
safety monitoring of the Product by either Genentech, Inc. or a Regulatory Authority, 
including:  
• Lack of  Effect  
• Endophthalmitis  
• lntraocular  Inflammation  (including  vitritis  and uveitis)  
• Cataract  (traumatic)  
• Increased  IOP 
• ATE's including stroke  
• Retinal Pigment  Tear  
• Retinal  Detachment  
 
 
Reconciliation of Single Case Reports  
The Parties will ensure that Genentech, Inc., has adequately received all Single Case 
Reports via the exchange of a line listing documenting Single Case Reports sent by site in 
the preceding time period (e.g. monthly). Confirmation of receipt should be rec eived within 
the time period mutually agreed upon.  
35 10 JUNE 2014  DAVE/ML27954    
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.1.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (1.8.) or not identified. This includes a dverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or 1.8. For example, 
under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or 1.8. only referred to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or  hepatit is. 
 
5.4 Evaluations  
Ophthalmologic evaluations will include slit lamp examination, dilated binocular indirect 
high magnification ophthalmoscopy,  measurements of BCVA and intraocular pressure, and 
indirect ophthalmoscopy. (See Section 4.5 for a detailed description of the study 
assessments).  
 
5.5 Vital  Signs  
Pulse and blood pressure will be measured at protocol specified study visits (See Section 
4.5).  
 
5.6 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse  Events  
5.6.1  Eliciting Adverse  Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AE's at all subject evaluation time points should be 
adopted. Examples or non -directive questions include:  
• "How have you felt  since your last clinical  visit?"  
• "Have  you had any new or changed  health  problems  since  you were  last here?"  
 
 
5.6.2  Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse  Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a) Diagnosis vs. Signs and  Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than 
individual sign s and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than 
jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs  
DAVE/ML27954  37 10 JUNE 2014   • Hospitalization  or prolonged  hospitalization  for scheduled  therapy  of the 
target disease of the  study  
e) Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or 
within 90 days after the last dose of study drug, a report should be completed and 
expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow -up to obtain the outcome of 
the pregnan cy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or 
spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as 
an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female 
subject exposed to the  {study drug} should be reported as an SAE.  
f) Post-Study Adverse  Events  
The Investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior {study drug} 
exposure. If the inve stigator should become aware of the development of cancer or 
a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who 
participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE.  
g) SAE Reporting  
Investigators must report all SAEs t o Genentech within the timelines described 
below. The completed Medwatch/case report should be faxed immediately upon 
completion to Genentech Drug Safety at:  
(650) 225 -4682  
OR 
(650) 225 -5288  
 
• Relevant follow -up information should be submitted to Genentech Drug Safety as 
soon as it becomes  available  
• Serious AE reports that are related to the ranibizumab will be transmitted  to 
Genentech within fifteen (15) calendar days of the  Awareness Date.  
• Serious AE reports  that are unrelated  to the ranibizumab  will be transmitted  to 
Genentech within thirty (30) calendar days of the Awareness  Date.  
39 DAVE/ML27954  10 JUNE 2014   ( •    For questions  regarding SAE  reporting,  you may contact the  Genentech  Drug  Safety  
representative noted above  or the  MSL assigned to  the  study . 
• Relevant  follow -up information  should  be submitted  to Genentech  Drug  Safety  as soon 
as it becomes  available  and/or  upon  request.  
 
MedWatch 3500A (Mandatory Reporting) form is available at: 
http://www .fda.gov/Safety/MedW  atch /HowToReport /defau lt.htm  
 
5.6.5  Additional Reporting Requirements for IND Holders  
For Investigator -Sponsored IND Studies, some additional reporting requirements for the 
FDA apply in accordance with the guidance set forth in CFR § 600.80  
 
Events meeting the following criteria need to be submitted to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as expedited IND Safety Reports according to the following guidance 
and timelines:  
( •  The Investigator  is required  to notify  the FDA  of and fatal or life-threatening  adverse  
event that is unexpect ed and assessed by the investigator to be possibly related to the 
use of ranibizumab. An unexpected adverse event is one that is not already described 
in the ranibizumab  Investigator  Brochure.  Such  reports  are to be telephoned  or faxed  to 
the FDA  and Genentech  within  7 calendar  days  of first learning  of the event.  
• The Investigator  is also required  to notify  the FDA  and all participating  investigators,  in a 
written IND Safety Report (see Appendix D), of any serious, unexpected AE that is 
considered reasonably or possibly related to the use of ranibizum ab . An unexpected 
adverse event is one that is not already described in the ranibizumab Investigator 
Broch ure. 
• Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in 
accordance  with regulation  21 CFR  § 312.32.  All safety  reports  previously  filed 
by the investigator with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed 
and the significan ce of the new report in light of the previous , similar reports 
commented  on.

1. Introduction 12 
You have been asked to allow your child to take part in a research study.  The study is being conducted 13 
by the Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group.  Your child’s eye doctor is a member of this group. 14 
The Jaeb Center for Health Research is the coordinating center which is organizing the study.  The 15 
National Eye Institute, which is part of the federal government, is providing the funding for the study. 16 
This form is part of the process to inform you about the research study.  We want to make sure that you 17 
understand that the study involves research.  Research is a scientific way to learn about medical 18 
conditions and/or treatments. 19 
 20 
First, we want you to know that participation is voluntary.  Refusal to take part or changing your mind 21 
later will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which your child is otherwise entitled.  Before you 22 
decide whether to have your child take part in the study, please take as much time as you need to ask any 23 
questions.  You may discuss this study with your child’s doctor, the medical staff, your child’s primary 24 
physician, family, and/or friends.  For your child to be in the study, you will need to sign this form.   25 
 26 
2. Information about the Study  27 
Your child has hyperopia.  Hyperopia is also called farsightedness.  Almost all children 1 to 6 years old 28 
are farsighted and most do not have any problems seeing clearly.  Sometimes farsighted children may 29 
have a harder time focusing up close or even get headaches. Sometimes, high levels of hyperopia may 30 
cause the vision in one eye to not develop properly.  This is a condition called amblyopia (also known as 31 
lazy eye).  High levels of hyperopia could also cause the eyes to cross, which is called strabismus.   32 
 33 
Some doctors feel that a child with hyperopia should have glasses before any potential vision problems 34 
develop.  Other doctors feel that children should not be given glasses unless vision problems occur.  It is 35 
not known if hyperopia should be treated right away or only if other problems occur.  This is the reason 36 
this study is being done. 37 
 38 
You are being asked to have your child take part in the study because he/she has hyperopia and does not 39 
wear glasses.  The study will include about 700 children who, like your child, have hyperopia.  Your 40 
child will be in the study for 3 years.  To take part in the study, your child needs to be at least 12 months 41 
of age and less than 6 years of age and must not have ever worn glasses or contact lenses before.   42 
 43 
You should not have your child in the study if you are planning to move out of this area in the next 44 
3 years. 45 
 46 
3. Study Procedures 47 
If your child is in the study, you must be willing to follow the procedures described in this section.   48 
 49 
Treatment Groups/Procedures: Your child’s eye doctor will describe the two groups in the study.   50 
 51 
The two study groups are:  52

   1. Glasses are prescribed at the start of the study  54 
2. No Glasses at the start of the study.  Glasses will be prescribed if your child develops one of the 55 
vision problems listed below. 56 
 57 
You should not have your child take part in the study unless you are willing to have your child be 58 
in either of the two study groups.  59 
 60 
If you decide to have your child take part in the study, a computer program will be used to decide 61 
whether or not your child will be given glasses at the start of the study.  This is similar to flipping a coin 62 
to decide which approach will be followed.  One group will be given glasses to wear at the start of the 63 
study.  The other group will not get glasses at the start of the study.  Neither you nor the doctor can 64 
choose which group your child will be in.   65 
 66 
Children who do not get glasses at the start of the study will be prescribed glasses during the study if any 67 
of the vision problems listed below happen.  Children who are given glasses at the start of the study may 68 
have their glasses changed for the same reasons.  Reasons for giving new glasses to children not wearing 69 
glasses in the study (or changing glasses for children given glasses at the start of the study) include: 70 
 Crossing of the eyes 71 
 Distance vision becomes worse than what is normal for their age  72 
 A large difference in vision develops between eyes 73 
 Depth perception becomes worse than what is normal for their age 74 
 You have concerns about your child’s vision or ability to see well close up  75 
 76 
If your child gets glasses during the study, the glasses may need to be updated as your child’s eyes 77 
change.  Your child’s eye doctor will not change your child’s glasses if they think it is better not to make 78 
the change.  Your child’s eye doctor may also decide that your child needs other treatments in addition 79 
to glasses, just as if your child were not part of the study.   80 
 81 
If your child gets glasses at the start of the study, you will receive a phone call within 2 weeks from the 82 
eye doctor’s office to make sure there are no problems getting the glasses and answer any questions.  83 
 84 
Follow-up Visits:  85 
Your child will need to return to the eye doctor for follow-up visits every 6 months for 3 years.  The 86 
visits occur at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after enrollment.  Some children will need to come back 87 
for another visit within 2 weeks after the 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 month visits depending on your child’s 88 
condition.  Some children will need to come back 4 weeks after the 36-month visit if their glasses need 89 
to be changed.  90 
 91 
Visits at 6, 18, and 30 months after enrollment are considered study related and will be paid for by the 92 
study.  If your child needs to come back within 2 weeks after the 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 month visits or 4 93 
weeks after the 36-month visit, these visits will also be paid for by the study. 94

   Your child’s eye doctor may decide that more follow -up visits are needed for your child, just as if your 96 
child were not part of the study. 97 
 98 
Your child’s eyes will be tested at each visit to see if they turn in or out, and also see how well your 99 
child sees objects at distance and close up.  Your child will have his/her eyes dilated with eye drops at 100 
least one time per year, and maybe more often if your child has more vision problems.  These tests 101 
would be done even if your child was not part of the study.  All children in the study will receive 102 
dilating eye drops during the 30- and 36 -month exams. 103 
 104 
4. Risks 105 
Eye Exams: The risks and discomforts for the examinations will be the same whether or not your child is 106 
taking part in the study. 107 
 108 
Glasses:  The risks associated with glasses are the same whether your child receives glasses as part of 109 
the study or not.  Some children experience temporary discomfort or blurred vision when adjusting to 110 
new glasses.  There are no known serious or long-lasting risks. 111 
 112 
Amblyopia or Strabismus: Some children with hyperopia may develop amblyopia (decreased vision in 113 
one or both eyes) or strabismus (crossing of eyes).  Amblyopia or strabismus may develop even if a 114 
child is already wearing glasses.  Some doctors think there may be a higher risk of developing 115 
amblyopia or strabismus in children with hyperopia who are not wearing glasses.  Other doctors do not 116 
think that there is greater risk of developing amblyopia or strabismus in children with hyperopia who are 117 
not prescribed glasses right away.  If amblyopia or strabismus develops, additional treatment may be 118 
needed.  Treatment will start with prescribing new glasses or changing the glasses the child is currently 119 
wearing.  Many cases of amblyopia and strabismus can be corrected with glasses alone.  If needed, 120 
amblyopia may be treated with patching one eye, putting drops in one eye to blur vision, or by wearing a 121 
blurring filter over the good eye.  If needed, strabismus may be treated several different ways, including 122 
prism, bifocals, vision therapy or surgery.   123 
 124 
Unknown Risks: Although we have tried to list all possible risks and discomforts, there may be others 125 
that we do not know about at this time.  However, these unknown risks would be the same whether your 126 
child received treatment as part of this study or not. 127 
 128 
5. Benefits of Participation  129 
If the study requires that your child needs to wear glasses or a lens change during the study, those 130 
glasses or new lenses will be provided at no cost.   131 
 132 
Your child may not directly benefit from taking part in this study.  However, the results of this study 133 
will be very important for doctors treating children with hyperopia in the future. 134

6. Alternative Procedures or Treatments 137 
You do not have to allow your child to take part in this research study in order to receive treatment.  138 
Your child may receive treatment for hyperopia outside of this study if you want.  Your child could 139 
receive other treatments not offered by the study.   140 
 141 
7. Costs and Compensation  142 
The National Eye Institute will provide funds for services specific to the research study, but will not 143 
cover patient services considered to be routine patient care.   144 
 145 
Visits at 6, 18, and 30 months are considered study-related visits and will be paid for by the study.  If 146 
your child needs to come back within 2 weeks after the 6, 12, 18, 24, or 30 month visits or 4 weeks after 147 
the 36-month visit, these visits will also be paid for by the study. 148 
 149 
All glasses prescribed or changed as part of the study will be paid for by the study.  Glasses needing 150 
replacement because of damage will also be paid for by the study.  If your doctor makes changes to your 151 
glasses that are not required by the study, the cost of changing will not be paid for by the study. The 152 
additional cost of prisms or bifocals will not be paid for by the study if your doctor prescribes them. 153 
 154 
Visits at 12, 24, and 36 months are considered part of usual care.  Because these visits would be needed 155 
whether your child was in the study or not, their cost will be your or your insurance company’s 156 
responsibility.  157 
 158 
In addition, you will be given $40 (by check or by merchandise or money-card) after completing each 159 
study visit (not including enrollment) for a possible total of $480  if all 6 visits are completed and you r 160 
child is required to come back within 2 weeks of every visit.  This payment is meant to compensate for 161 
your time and for any travel expenses involved with coming to the study visits.  If your child is required 162 
to come back for any additional study visits, you will be given an additional $40 each visit.  You will 163 
receive payment for completed study visits even if your child leaves before the end of the study.  If your 164 
expenses exceed $40 per study visit and you will be unable to complete a study visit without additional 165 
funds, please discuss this with the study staff.  Additional funds may be available. 166 
 167 
8. Research-Related Injuries 168 
It is not likely that some physical injury might happen because your child is part of this research study.  169 
However, if this were to happen, medical treatment is available, but you or your insurance company 170 
must pay for the treatment.  There are no payments for lost wages and/or direct or indirect losses.  If 171 
your child suffers an injury related to this study, the medical care will not be covered.    You can get 172 
more information about research-related injuries from the Jaeb Center Institutional Review Board (toll- 173 
free at 888-797 -3344).   174 
 175 
Further information about research- related injuries is available from your child’s eye doctor (see contact 176 
information on the last page) or from the coordinating center staff at the Jaeb Center (toll-free at 888- 177 
797-3344). 178

9. Withdrawal from the Study 180 
It is up to you whether your child takes part in this study.  You can withdraw your child from the study 181 
at any time by contacting your child’s eye doctor and by letting him/her kn ow in writing that you are 182 
withdrawing your child (see contact information on the last page). 183 
 184 
During the study, you will be told of any new scientific findings that might affect your willingness to 185 
have your child stay in this study. 186 
Your child’s doctor or persons in charge of this study may stop your child’s participation in the study for 187 
reasons such as: 188 
 It is determined that your child was not eligible for the study.  189 
 Your child’s doctor decides that continued participation would be harmful to your chil d. 190 
 The study is stopped. 191 
 There are unanticipated circumstances. 192 
 193 
If your child leaves the study early for any reason, those data which were already collected will still be 194 
used in evaluation of the study results. 195 
 196 
If you have any questions about the study at any time, you should speak with your child’s eye doctor  or 197 
one of his/her staff.  If you have questions about your child’s rights as a research subject, you should 198 
contact the Institutional Review Board office at 888-797-3344 .  You may also call the coordinating 199 
center staff toll-free at 888-797 -3344 should you have any questions at any time. 200

   There are other people in the study.  They are from th is doctor’s office and/or from other doctors’ 222 
offices.  Their study results will also be given to the Jaeb Center.  A code number will go with the study 223 
results instead of the study participant name, address, telephone number, or social security number.  224 
 225 
This doctor’s office will not disclose study results that have a direct personal identifier except as 226 
explained later in this authorization or when required by law.  Name, address, telephone number, and 227 
social security number are examples of direct personal  identifiers.  The Jaeb Center and this doctor’s 228 
office will guard the privacy of your study PHI.   229 
 230 
Study results may appear in medical journals and be shared at scientific meetings.  No one will disclose 231 
the identity of a study participant in a medical j ournal or at a scientific meeting.  Your records will be 232 
confidential.  They will be kept according to the requirements of federal and state law.   233 
 234 
It is very important that your study doctor’s office has your current contact information.  You will be 235 
informed of the study results when they are made public.   236 
 237 
C. Authorized Recipients and Users 238 
The following people may receive, see, use, and disclose your study PHI:   239 
1. The people who work for this doctor’s office  240 
2. The people who work for the Jaeb Center 241 
3. The scientific investigators who help run the study 242 
4. Any review board that oversees human investigations rules for your doctor’s office  243 
5. Any federal agency that oversees clinical trials 244 
 245 
In most cases the information will have a code number with it instead of your name, address, telephone 246 
number, or social security number.  247 
 248 
There are some situations where the information will not have a code number with it and the above 249 
persons or people outside the doctor’s office who assist in your care may have access to your  study PHI. 250 
For example, they may need to see it if you have an adverse (unfavorable) event that is related to the 251 
study. If it is reviewed by any of these people, they may need to review your whole medical record.   252 
 253 
 254 
Other Considerations  255 
We will send the information about your child’s eyes to a central computer.  The computer is located at 256 
the Jaeb Center for Health Research in Tampa, Florida.  The Jaeb Center for Health Research is the 257 
coordinating center which is organizing the study.  258 
 259 
In addition, sep arately from your child’s research data, the Jaeb Center for Health Research will be 260 
provided with information on how to contact you. 261 
 262 
 If your child receives glasses you will receive a call from the eye doctor’s office within 2 weeks to ask 263

    During the study, you may receive calls from the coordinating center to help schedule an office visit for 265 
your child.  If we are not able to reach you when we try to schedule your child’s fo llow-up visit, we will 266 
try to contact you through the other information you have given us.  If this is not successful, we may use 267 
the information you have given us to try to locate you through the use of a third-party search service. 268 
 You can call the coordinating center toll-free at 888-797 -3344 if you have any questions at any time. 269 
 You may also receive updates and information about the study in the mail. 270 
 The data collected in the study may be put in public domain in a format that will have no identifying 271 
information.  272 
 273 
Your child may receive a pair of glasses as part of the study.  LensCrafters has agreed to provide the study 274 
with a discount on eyeglasses.  Your child’s eye doctor may send you to LensCrafters or another 275 
contracted optician to get new eyeglasses. In order to provide your child with new eyeglasses, the 276 
optician or LensCrafters will receive information on your child.  Your child’s name, birth date, and study 277 
identification number will be given to the optician who is making the eyeglasses.  If your child is to receive 278 
study-paid eyeglasses through LensCrafters, this information will be given to LensCrafters by the Jaeb 279 
Center, via the EyeMed/Eye Care Plan of America website, to help process the making of your child’s 280 
eyeglasses.   281 
 282 
 283 
D. Reasons for Access and Use 284 
The people named above (see section C) may receive, see, use, and disclose your study PHI.  They need 285 
it to help run the study and to analyze the results.  They may also need it to meet the requirements of 286 
federal or state law. 287 
 288 
This doctor’s office will provide the study PHI to the Jaeb Center and to the other people named above 289 
as needed and/or requested by them.  The study PHI will typically be provided to them via the Jaeb 290 
Center, because it is the coordinating center. 291 
 292 
E. Potential for Redisclosure  293 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule may not require the people named above (see section C) to guard the privacy 294 
of your study PHI.  It is possible that they may give it out again.   295 
 296 
F. Cancellation of authorization 297 
You may stop your permission for the use and disclosure of your study PHI at any time.  You need to 298 
contact your study doctor and give him/her a notice of cancellation in writing.   299 
 300 
When you cancel your permission or when you withdraw from the study directly, you are no  longer part 301 
of the study.  No new information about you will be gathered for the study except when it is on an 302 
adverse (unfavorable) event that is related or potentially related to the study.  If one happens, your entire 303 
medical record may need to be reviewed.   304

G. 50 Year Expiration Date and Indefinite Expiration Date 310 
Some of your study PHI does not have a code number with it.  Your permission for the use and 311 
disclosure of this PHI lasts 50 years from the date of your signature or until the end of the study, 312 
whichever is sooner.  The end of the study is when no one has to monitor the study anymore, the funding 313 
agency data analyses are done, and the primary articles are accepted for publication.   314 
 315 
The rest of your study PHI does have a code number with it.  When it is collected, it becomes a research 316 
report.  Your permission for the use and disclosure of these coded data will never end.  These coded data 317 
do not have your name, address, telephone number, or social security number. 318

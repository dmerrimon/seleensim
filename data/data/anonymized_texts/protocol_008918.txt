Placebo on Stable Conventional Synthetic Disease -Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drugs (csDMARDs) in 
Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis with Inadequate R esponse or 
Intolerance to Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)
Objectives:
Period 1
To compare the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (QD) and 15 mg QD versus 
placebo on a background of csDMARD(s) for the treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumato id 
arthritis (RA) in bDMARD -inadequate response (bDMARD -IR) or bDMARD -intolerant subjects w ith 
moderately to severely active RA.
Period 2
To evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD in 
subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 300
Study Population:   
Adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months 
who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria 
for RA.  Subjects who have been treated ≥ 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug with 
≥ 1bDMARD therapy for RA in the past and failed at least 1 bDMARD therapy may be enrolled.  
Eligible study subjects must have ≥ 6 sw ollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints 
(based on 68 joint count s) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and high -sensitivity C -reactive protein 
(hsCRP) ≥ 3 mg/L (central lab) at Screening.  Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD 
therapy (restricted to methotrexate [MTX], chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, sulfa salazine, or

Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3, multicenter study that includes two periods.  Period 1 is the 24 -week randomized, 
doubl e-blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled treatment period designed to compare the safety and 
efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD versus placebo for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of subjects w ith moderately to severely active RA who have an inadequate response to or 
intolerance to bDMARD therapy and are currently on a stable dose of csDMARDs.  Period 2 is a blinded 
long-term extension to evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
and 15 mg QD in sub jects w ith RA who have completed Period 1.  Starting with Amendment 4, all 
subjects will  receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currently on upadacitinib 30 
mg QD.
The study duration will include a 35 -day maximum screening period; a 24-week randomized, 
double -blind, parallel -group, placebo controlled treatment period (Period 1); a blinded extension period 
(236 weeks) (Period 2); and a 30 -day follow -up period.
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria w ill be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment 
groups:  
Group 1:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD, N = 150 (Day 1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
Group 2:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 150 (Day 1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
Group 3:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day 1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Week 12 and 
thereafter)
Group 4:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day 1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Week 12 and 
thereafter)
Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 w eeks p rior to the first dose of study 
drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for 
safety reasons.  Subjects who do not achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at Week 24 should have background 
medication(s) adjusted or initiated aft er assessments for Week 24 have been completed.  Starting at 
Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in corticosteroids, 
non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses f or up to 
2 csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX and 
leflunomide) is allowed as per local label.
Subjects who complete the Week 24 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the blinded long term extension 
portion of the study , Period 2 (236 w eeks).  Subjects who are assigned to upadacitinib treatment groups 
in Period 1 w ill continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD per original randomization 
assignment in a blinded manner.  Subjects w ho are assigned to placebo for the first 12 weeks of Period 1 
and subsequently switched to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD per their pre -specified 
randomization assignments at Week 12, w ill continue to receive the same dose of upadacitinib per 
original randomization assignment in a blinded manner.  Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects w ill 
receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  
An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 24) for the 
purpose of regulatory submission.  Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the 
study (Periods 1 and 2).

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Period 1 Efficacy
Analysis of the Prim ary and Key Secondary Endpoints:
Com parisons of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be made between each 
upadacitinib group and the combined placebo groups.  The overall type I error rate of the primary and 
key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled.
For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  Pairw ise 
comparison s between each upadacitinib group and the combined placebo groups w ill be conducted using 
the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors.  
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be report ed for each 
treatment group.  Pairw ise comparisons betw een each of the upadacitinib treatment groups and the 
combined placebo groups w ill be carried out using the analysis of covariance model with treatment 
group as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the 
covariates.
Non-responder imputation approach w ill serve as the primary analysis approach for binary endpoints and 
multiple imputations will serve as the primary analysis approach for continuous end points.  Sensitivity 
analyses based on observed cases approach and w ill also be conducted for key endpoints.   
Long -Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined
Long -term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
Pharm acokinetic:
A non-linear mixed -effects modeling approach w ill be used to estimate the population central values and 
the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and 
volume of distribution (V/F).  Addi tional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of 
the data.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive 
at least one dose of study drug.  Analyses will be conducted for Period 1 alone, as well as for Period 1 
and Period 2 combined.  Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, 
ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency tables and lists of subjects w ith treatment -emergent AEs by preferred 
term a s in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary, by system organ class, by 
severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator w ill be provided.  The 
changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination re sults, and clinical laboratory values will be 
analyzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be 
tabulated.

3.0 Introduction
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease of unknown 
etiology .  The hallmark feature of RA is an inflammatory  process manifested by  persistent 
symmetric pol yarthritis of sy novial joints which can ultimately  lead to bone erosions, 
deformity , and disability .  Left untreated, or inadequately  treated, progressive functional 
impairment with increasing disability  occurs leading to a reduction in quality  of life.  The 
prevalence of RA in the general population is approximately  1%, and increases with age 
in both genders, with women being more prone to developing RA than men.  Earl y 
therap y with disease -modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is the standard of care, 
inclu
ding conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) (e.g., methotrexate [MTX], 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, and leflunomide), and biologic DMARDs 
(bDMARDs) (e.g., anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and non- anti-TNF biologics).
The European League Against Rhe umatism (EULAR) recommends a Treat -to-Target 
(T2T) approach to initiate therap y immediatel y after diagnosis of RA with a goal of 
achieving clinical remission (CR) or low disease activity  (LDA), as these are associated 
with improved long -term outcomes.1-3  Also, in line with recent advances in earl y 
diagnosis, new classification criteria have been developed.  The 2010 American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)/EULAR classification criteria redefined the paradigm of RA b y 
focusing on features at earlier stages of disease th at are associated with persistent and/or 
erosive disease, rather than defining the disease by its late -stage features.4
Despite major progress in the treatment of RA, there still remains a large unmet medical 
need, as onl y a small percentage of RA patients reach or maintain a status of LDA or CR 
over time or need to discontinue due to safet y or tolerabilit y issues.5,6  Novel therapies are 
therefore needed to complement the available interventions to address the unmet need.5-7

JAK Inhibitor
Evidence suggests that inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -mediated pathway s is a 
promising approach for the treatment of patients with this chronic disease.8  AbbVie is 
developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current 
needs.
The JAK family  is composed of 4 famil y members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and Tyrosine kinase 2 
(Tyk2).  These cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine 
receptors such as common gamma -chain receptors and the gly coprotein 130 
transmembrane proteins.9  Activation of JAK pathway s initiates expression of survival 
factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular 
trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to inflammatory  and autoimmune 
disorders.
Hence, the JAK family  has evoked considerable interest in the area of inflammatory 
diseases leading to the development of various JAK inhibitors with different selectivity 
profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and T yk2 which have demonstrated efficacy  in 
individuals with RA.10-14  Tofacitinib, the first in this class, has been approved in the 
United States and in other countri es for treating moderatel y to severel y active RA 
patients.  Although tofacitinib, a non -selective JAK inhibitor, improves the clinical signs 
and sy mptoms, and inhibits structural progression in RA patients, questions regarding the 
safet y profile remain, in cluding serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, 
malignancies, and hematologic adverse events (AEs).
The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity  profiles against JAK1, 
JAK2, JAK3, and Ty k2, are in development.8  Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 
inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with moderatel y to severel y 
active RA.  In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 activity, but to a 
lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3.  The enhanced selectivity of 
upadacitinib against JAK1 may  offer an improved benefit -risk pr ofile in patients with RA.  
The clinical h ypothesis is that upadacitinib should be effective in decreasing joint

28
inflammation and damage associated with RA by  interfering with JAK1 -mediated 
signaling pathway s (i.e., interleukin -6) without causing excessive anemia due to its 
reduced activity  against JAK2 (IC 50120 nM), which is essential for ery thropoietin 
signaling.  Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important 
component of ly mphocy te activation and function.  As such, treatment with upadacitinib, 
a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could result in a decreased risk 
for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to a pan JAK 
inhibitor or less selective JAK inhibitors.
Phase 2 Studies w ith Upadacitinib
The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 
both on stable background MTX therap y, in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active 
RA and one open -label extension (OL E) stud y (Study M13 -538; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those 
subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  Study  M13 -550 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti -TNF therap y and 
Study M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate 
response t o MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once dail y (QD) dose regimens of 
upadacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, 
and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all doses of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).  In addition, numerically higher proportions of subjects achieve d ACR50 and 
ACR70 responses and LDA (based on Disease Activity  Score [DAS]28 C -Reactive 
Protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib dose 
groups versus placebo.
In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
29
of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportions of subjects achieved L DA and CR at Week 12.
Safety  data from these two studies (N = 575) showed that the ty pes and frequencies of 
AEs during upadacitinib treatment were consistent with subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory  therapy .  The incid ences of AEs were 
numericall y higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with a trend toward higher rates with 
higher doses of upadacitinib.  The most frequentl y reported AEs ( ≥ 5%) in the 
upadacitinib treated subjects were urinary  tract infection, headache, upper respiratory  tract 
infection, and nausea.  There were 6 subjects (1.3% of total combined populations) with 
herpes zoster reactivation distributed across the upadacitinib dose groups, and 2 subjects 
(1.9%) in the placebo groups.  I n these two 12 week s tudies, a total of 2 subjects in the 
upadacitinib treatment groups reported malignancies.  One subject reported non -
melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) and 1 subject 
was diagnosed with lung cancer after the final scheduled visit, and subsequently  died 
14weeks after stud y completion.  These events were reported b y the Investigators as not 
possibly  related to study  drug.  Elevations of liver function tests were sporadic with no 
clear dose -response relationship observed.  As observed with other JAK inhibitors, 
treatment with upadacitinib resulted in an increase in lipids (low -density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol [L DL-C] and high- densit y lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL -C]).  Among subjects 
with laboratory  evidence of sy stemic inflammat ion (as evidenced b y high -sensitivity  C-
reactive protein [hsCRP] > upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment with lower doses of 
upadacitinib (3 mg BID and 6 mg BID) was associated with improvements in mean 
hemoglobin relative to placebo.  At higher doses, t here was a reduction in mean 
hemoglobin; however, the mean hemoglobin levels remained within normal range 
throughout the treatment period.
3.1 Differences Statement
Study  M13 -542 differs from other upadacitinib studies as it is the first study to evaluate 
the safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib in subjects with inadequate response to or 
intolerance to an y bDMARDs.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despite the availabilit y of various RA therapies, including csDMARDs and bDMARDs, 
many  patients still do not respond adequatel y tothese treatments, or gradually  lose 
response over time.  Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability to 
decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by  JAK1 signaling while having 
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially  minimize some of 
the reported safet y concerns with non -selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be 
mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  The Phase 2 program 
with upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvem ent in signs and s ymptoms of RA 
and the safety  results were consistent with those known to be associated with JAK 
inhibition.13-21  Taken together, the safet y and efficacy data from the Phase 2 program 
support further development of upadacitinib in Phase 3 in subjects with RA.  For a 
detailed summary  of upadacitinib benefit and safety , see the Investigator's Brochure.
In view of the COVID -19 pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory  therapies on COVID -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects 
of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3, multicenter study that includes two periods.  Period 1 is the 24 -week 
randomized, double -blind , parallel -group, placebo- controlled period designed to compare 
the safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD versus placebo for the 
treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderatel y to severel y active RA who 
have an inadequate re sponse to or intolerance to bDMARD therap y and are currentl y on a 
stable dose of csDMARDs.  Period 2 is a blinded long -term extension to evaluate the 
long-term safet y, tolerability , and efficacy  of upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD in 
subjects with RA who have completed Period 1.  Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects 
will  receive open- label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, including those currentl y on upadacitinib 
30 mg QD.
The study  is designed to enroll approximately  450 subjects at approximately  300 study  
centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue 
number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target 
number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subje cts in

(Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 4:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
Subjects must have been on a stable dose of csDMARD(s) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the 
firstdose of study  drug and must remain on a stable dose until Week 24; the csDMARD 
dose may  be decreased only  for safet y reasons.  Subjects who do not achieve CDAI ≤ 10 
at Week 24 should have background medication(s) adjusted or initiated after assessments 
for Week 24 have been completed.  Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have 
been performed), initiation of or cha nge in corticosteroids, non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or adding or increasing doses in up to 
2csDMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 csDMARDs except the combination of MTX 
and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label.  Sub jects on a combination of MTX and 
leflunomide therap y should discontinue either MTX or leflunomide (see washout periods 
defined in Section 5.2.3) pr ior to first dose of study  drug administration.
Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH SJC AND TJC compared to 
baseline is required to remain on study  drug.  An yone who does not fulfill this criterion at 
2 consecutive visits (starting at Wee k 24) must be discontinued from study  drug.
Subjects who complete the Week 24 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the blinded 
long-term extension portion of the study , Period 2 (236 weeks).  Subjects who are 
assigned to upadacitinib treatment groups in Peri od 1 will continue to receive upadacitinib 
15mg QD or 30 mg QD per original randomization assignment in a blinded manner.  
Subjects who are assigned to placebo for the first 12 weeks of Period 1 and subsequently  
switched to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD per their pre -specified 
randomization assignments at Week 12, will continue to receive the same dose of 
upadacitinib per original randomization assignment in a blinded manner.

Screening Period
Within 35 day s prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the 
study  design and stud y procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures outlined in Appendix D.  Lab values can be re -tested once during 
the screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusio nary, the subject will 
be considered a screen failure with no additional re -screening possible.  Redrawing 
samples if previous samples were unable to be analy zed would not count as a retest since 
previous result was never obtained.

Subjects that initially  screen fail for the study  are permitted to re -screen once following 
re-consent.  Lab values can be re -tested once during the re -screening period.  For 
additional re -screenings, AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director approval is required.  
All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during 
re-screening.  The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at 
the time of re -screening in order to qualify  for the study .  There is no minimum period of 
time a subject must wait to re -screen for the stud y.  If the subject had a complete initial 
screening evaluation including the assessment of an I nterferon -Gamma Release Assay  
(IGRA; QuantiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold I n Tube test) and/or a purified prot ein 
derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), or chest 
x-ray and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for 
re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.2are met, there are no changes in 
the subject's medical history that would warrant re -testing, and no more than 90 day s have 
passed.
Period 1 (24 -Week Randomized, D ouble -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 24 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period of the stud y, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.  A ± 3 day  window is permitted 
around scheduled study  visits.  The last dose of study  drug in Period 1 is taken the day  
prior to the Week 24 visit.  Subjects who complete Period 1, but decide not to continue in 
Period 2 should complete a 30 day  follow -up visit after the last dose of study  drug.
Period 2 (Long- Term Extension Period [236 Weeks])
Period 2 will begin at the Week 24 Visit after all assessments have been completed.  
During Period 2, subjects will have a study  visit at Weeks 36, 48, every  12 weeks through 
Week 240, and Week 260/PD.  A ± 7 day window is permitted around scheduled study  
visits.

Starting at Week 24, at least 20% improvement in BOTH TJC AND SJC is required to 
remain on study  drug.  Any one who does not fulfill this criterion at 2 consecutive visits 
(starting at Week 24) despite optimization of background RA therapies (see 
Section 5.2.3.1 ) must be discontinued from study  drug.
Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
Discontinuati on of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may  discontinue study  drug treatment but may  choose to continue to participate 
in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as 
soon as possible, preferably  within 2 weeks, and preferabl y prior to initiation of another 
therap y.  To minimize missing data for efficacy  and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all 
regularl y scheduled visits as outlined in the Activity Sc hedule ( Appendix Dand 
Appendix F), unless subjects have decided to dis continue study  participation entirely  
(withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific 
importance of their data even if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.  
Following discontinuation of study  drug, the subject should be treated in accordance with 
the investigator's best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to 
continue participation in the study .  As the subject has discontinued study  drug, all rescue 
and efficacy  driven disconti nuation criteria no longer appl y (e.g., CDAI calculation at 
Week 24, 20% TJC/SJC calculation for PD).  If at any point a subject no longer wants to 
provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study 
drug, a second (PD visit) is not required.

Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  If a subject 
prematurel y discontinues study drug treatment AND study participation (withdrawal of 
informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD 
visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks of study  drug 
discontinuation, and preferably prior to initiation of another therap y.  In addition, if the 
subject is willing, a 30-day follow- up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) may  
occur to determine the status of an y ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of an y new 
AEs/SAEs.
Follow -Up Visit
A Follow -Up Visit will occur approximately  30 day s after the last dose of st udy drug to 
obtain information on any new or ongoing AE/SAEs, and to collect vital signs and clinical 
laboratory  tests.
Subjects will complete the Follow -Up Visit when they  have either
●Completed the last visit of Period 1 (Week 24), but decided not to part icipate 
in the extension Period 2; OR
●Completed the last visit of Period 2; OR
●Prematurel y discontinued study drug and/or study participation and have 
completed a PD visit.  I n this case the 30 day  Follow -Up visit may  be a 
telephone call if a site visit is not possible.  Vital signs and laboratory test may 
not be required.  The Follow -Up visit is not applicable for subjects who 
discontinued study  drug and continued study participation and completed at 
least one study  visit at least 30 day s after last dose o f study  drug.

5.2.3.1 Permitted Background RA  Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable ( ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study  drug) 
background csDMARD therap y (restricted to o ral or parenteral MTX, [7.5 to 
25mg/week], sulfasalazine [ ≤ 3000 mg/day ], hydroxy chloroquine, [≤ 400 mg/day ], 
chloroquine [ ≤ 250 mg/day ], and leflunomide [≤ 20 mg/day ]) up to Week 24.  At any  
time, the csDMARD dose may  be decreased onl y for safety  reasons.  Subjects taking 
MTX should take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent, such as folinic 
acid) throughout study  participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be 
followed according to Investigator's instructions.  AbbVie w ill not provide the 
csDMARDs (or folic acid, if taking MTX).  
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, 
oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ), or inhaled corticosteroids.
●If taking an y of th e above on a scheduled basis at baseline, they  should 
continue to take them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or 
frequency , including on study  visit day s;
●If not taking an y of the above at baseline, these must not be initiated except 
where permitted by  protocol (After Week 24 assessments have been 
performed);
●If taking an y of the above including low potency analgesics, i.e., tramadol, 
codeine, h ydrocodone, or propox yphene at baseline on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  should continue to use t hem for the same reason and same dose 
each time but they  should not be taken within 24 hours prior to an y stud y visit 
to avoid bias in outcome measurements.
In the event of tolerability (or other safet y) issues, the doses of these medications may be 
decre ased or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that

class (see Section 5.2.3.2 for prohibited therapies).  PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is 
permitted at an y time.
Subjects who do not achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at Week 24 should have background 
medication(s) adjusted or initiated (see below) after assessments for Week 24 have been 
completed.
Starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, 
intra-articular, intramuscular, intravenous, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, and 
intra-tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage and frequency  per standard of 
care, are allowed.  To avo id confounding effects of sy stemic absorption of intra -articular 
corticosteroids, joint injections should be avoided, if possible, within 21 days prior to the 
next scheduled study  visit.  For the analy sis of the TJC and SJC, injected joints will be 
conside red "not assessable" for 3 months from the time of the intra -articular injection.  
In addition, in Period 2, starting at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been 
performed) and thereafter, initiation of or change in corticosteroids, NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol or csDMARDs (restricted to oral or parenteral MTX, 
sulfasalazine, hy droxy chloroquine, chloroquine, and leflunomide, and restricted to

Investigational Drugs
Subjects who have been treated with an y investigational drug within 30 days or 
fivehalf-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study  drug are 
excluded from participation in this study .  Investigational drugs are also prohibited during 
the study .
Vaccines
Although not mandated by the protocol, vaccines recommended b y local guidel ines 
should be considered.  If the subject and investigator choose to administer live vaccines, 
these vaccinations must be completed (per local label) at least 4 weeks before first dose of 
study  drug with appropriate precautions.  L ive vaccinations are pro hibited during 
Period 1, including at least 30 day s (or longer if required locall y) after the last dose of 
study  drug.  
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
●Monovalent live influenza A (H1N1) (intranasal);
●Seasonal trivalent live influenza (intranasal); 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
50
●Zostavax (herpes zoster, live attenuated);
●Rotavirus;
●Varicella (chicken pox);
●Measles -mumps -rubella or measles mumps rubella varicella;
●Oral polio vaccine;
●Smallpox;
●Yellow fever;
●Bacille Calmette -Guérin (BCG);
●Typhoid.
In Period 2, if a live vaccine must be administered during stud y participation, study drug 
must be held for at least 30 days prior to the vaccination and at least 30 days after the 
vaccination (or longer if required locally).
If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered and there is no known history  of 
primary  varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity  to varicella should be confirmed 
with antibody  testing prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If varicella 
antibody  testin g is negative, the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.
Administration of inactivated (non -live) vaccines is permitted during the study  according 
to local practice guidelines.  Examples of common vaccines that are inactivated, toxoid or 
biosynthetic, include but are not limited to:  injectable influenza vaccine, pneumococcal, 
Shingrix (zoster vaccine, recombinant, adjuvanted), and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines.
Traditional Chinese Medicine
Oral traditional Chinese medicine is not permitted dur ing the stud y, and subjects must 
have discontinued traditional Chinese medicine at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of 
study  drug.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no me nses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is r equired.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
52
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile i s considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Stud y Day 1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectab le, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.
●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner verbally confirms 
receipt of the medical assessment of the surgical success and is the onl y sexual 
partner.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence:  (if acceptable per local requirements):  Applies to women of 
childbearing potential who do not have male partner s and are not engaging in 
heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods] 
and withdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence).
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically  sterile or post -menopausal 
(defined above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as 
defined above are no longer required.

53
It is important to note that contraception requirements described above are specificall y 
intended to prevent pregnancy  during exposure to the investigational therapy  upadacitinib.  
The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed 
per standard of care prior to study  entry  and are allowed to be continued during the stud y.  
Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and 
that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD(s) should be based 
on the local label.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements for 
Canada, German y, and Korea.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
There are no contraception requirements for upadacitinib for male subjects or their female 
partner(s).
Contraception requirements related to the use of background csDMARDS including 
MTX, as well as concomitant therapies prescribed per standard of care, should be based 
on the local label.

and the collection of AE information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data will be 
recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study  specific, IEC/IRB approved, 
informed consent form for the study  (i.e., includes both Periods 1 and 2) before an y stud y 
procedures are performed or any medications are withheld from the subject in order to 
participate in this study .  Separate writte n consent will be required for each subject in 
order to participate in the optional exploratory  research and validation studies.  The 
separate written consent may  be part of the main consent form.  Subjects can withdraw 
informed consent at an y time.
Detail s regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in 
Section 9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they  meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits.
Medical and Surgical History
A complete non -RA-related medical and surgical history , including history  of alcohol and 
nicotine use, will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit.  Additionally , a 
list of each subject's specific RA -related medical and surgical history will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical 
history  will be obtained prior to study  drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the 
subject is still eligible for enrollment.

*Paper; all other patient -reported outcomes (PROs) collected electronically .
The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any  clinical 
assess ments and before any  interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing 
the subject's response.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, questionnaires will be 
completed b y the subject at the next feasible visit .
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the 
subject's epidemiology , history , exam findings, etc., and it i s the responsibility  of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB.  Expert 
consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may be considered per 
Investigator discretion.
At screening, all subjects will be assesse d for evidence of increased risk for TB by  a risk 
assessment form ( Appendix I) and tested for TB infection b y QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test.  The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is 
not possible for an y reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site 
staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate 
eCRF. 
Ifa subject had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or PPD) test (or IGRA 
equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test) within 90 day s prior to Screening and source 
documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has 
changed in the subject's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may  be 
discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) .  The results of 
the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
59
For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB re -test will be performed.  The TB test(s) to be performed depends on local 
guidelines and whether or not the site has capacit y to perform QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
testing (see below).  If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x -ray 
(CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus 
latent TB.  An y positive TB screen after the patient has started the stud y, should be 
reporte d as an adverse event (AE) of latent or active TB (as applicable).
For subjects with seroconversion on anannual TB test, if a CXR cannot be done due to
state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, the Investigator should contact 
the AbbVie TA M D to determine if the subject may  continue on study  drug.  CXR should 
be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility.
TB test:
●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both 
will be performe d.  A positive TB test is defined by  local guidelines (for 
example, in some countries, both PPD and QuantiFERON- TB Gold are 
performed, and if either one is positive, the TB test is considered positive).
●In the absence of local guidelines defining a positiv e result when both PPD 
and QuantiFERON -TB Gold tests are performed, then the QuantiFERON -TB 
Gold test result will be the TB test result (QuantiFERON -TB Gold supersedes 
PPD).
●If a site has the capacit y to perform both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold
tests, and local guidelines require onl y one test to be performed, then the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold is the preferred test.  At a site with capacit y to 
perform both tests, whatever TB test method (i.e. ,PPD or QuantiFERON TB 
Gold or other IGRA) was performed at screening, then the subject should have 
their annual TB test performed with the same test method.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold Test and the PPD Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines):  the PPD Skin Test (a lso known as a TB Skin Test) will be 
performed according to standard clinical practice.  The TB Skin Test should be  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
60
read b y a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after 
administration.  A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be 
rescheduled for another skin test.  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm for RA subjects is considered a 
positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not 
"negative."  Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test 
in the past should not be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be 
considered positive with no requirement for subsequent testing with either 
PPD or Quanti -FERON- TB Gold Plus.
●If the QuantiF ERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator 
should perform a local QuantiFERON- TB Gold test (or through the central 
laboratory  if not locall y available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing 
remains indeterminate or is positive, the n the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpose of this study .  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
●Interpretation of a positive annual TB test in low risk subjects:  I n cases where 
the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus test by  the central laboratory  is positive and 
the Investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB and has no clinical 
suspicion of TB, t he Investigator may  perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
Plus test (or repeat testing through the cent ral laboratory  if not locall y 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  I f the repeat testing result is 
negative, the Investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or i ndeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Plus.
Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x -ray (CXR) not suggestive of activ e TB or 
prior TB exposure may  be enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and sy mptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
61
CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophy laxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
TB proph ylaxis:
At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (positive TB test and the 
subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), prophy lactic treatment must be initiated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study  drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is 
longer); the proph ylaxis needs to be completed; however, the full course of proph ylaxis 
does not need to b e completed prior to the first dose of study  drug.  If the Investigator 
deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert could be considered. 
Of note:  Rifampicin or Rifapentine are not allowed for TB prophylaxis.
Subjects with a prior history  oflatent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti -TB therapy  within 1 y ear prior to first study  drug administration will be 
allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history  to 
warrant repeat treatme nt.
Obtain a CXR every  48 weeks for subjects with newly  identified TB risk factors as 
determined b y the TB risk assessment form (Appendix I) or for subjects living in areas 
endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD or QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.
Subjects with documented completion of a full course of anti -TB therapy  greater than 
1year prior to first study  drug administration may  be allowe d to enter the study  only after 
consultation with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Newl y initiated proph ylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
During the stu dy, subjects with new evidence of latent TB should initiate prophylactic 
treatment immediatel y per local guidelines.  Study drug(s) should not be withheld and 
Isoniazid should be initiated and 2 to 4 weeks later (per local guidelines), subject should  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
62
be re -evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory  
assessment of toxicity  to TB proph ylaxis.
If the subject is experiencing signs or s ymptoms suspicious for TB or something has 
changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled 
annual TB re -test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
Chest X- Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required:
●For all subje cts at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically  
relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous 
normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within 90 day s of 
Screening, provided all source documentat ion is available at the site, as 
outlined below and provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical 
history  to warrant a repeat test.
●Every  48 weeks for subjects with newly  identified TB risk factors as 
determined by the TB risk assessment form ( Appendix I), or for subjects living 
in areas endemic for TB or for subjects with newly positive PPD and/or 
QuantiFERON- TB Gold test.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of a CXR , the CXR will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit , unless 
the Investiga tor has determined, based on clinical judgement, that a CXR is required to 
ensure that it is safe to continue study drug administration .  In this case, CXR should be 
performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local hospital/facility.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the stud y as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
63
A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal 
Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of an yfindings and will sign and date 
the report.  In the assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must 
indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural 
scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  If the CXR demonstrates changes 
suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural 
thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator 
should contact the AbbVie Medical Monitor before enrolling the subject.
12-Lead ECG
For all subjects, a resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening, Week 48 and every  
48 weeks thereafter, as specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  For subjects who do 
not enter Period 2 or prematurely  discontinue from study , an ECG will be performed at 
their final visit as indicated in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  A qualified physician will 
interpret the clinical significance of an y abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG.  ECG 
with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) 
should be reported (or c alculated) and documented in the source documents and later 
transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed.  A valid QTcF 
cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular 
conduction abnormali ties.  I n these cases, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into 
the appropriate eCRF for comparison as well.  I n addition, any  clinically  significant 
findings will be documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the 
appropriate eCRF .  Each signed original ECG will be monitored by  the responsible site 
monitor and kept with subject's source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at 
Screening will not be required, provided source documentation is available and provided 
nothing has changed in the subject's medical history  to warrant a repeat test.  If there are 
other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director before enrolling the subject.

Subjects can have a repeat ECG at an y time during the study as warranted, based on the 
opinion of the Investigator.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit requires 
completion of an ECG , the ECG will be performed at the next earliest feasible visit , 
unless the Investigator has determined, based on clinical judgement, that a n ECG is 
required to ensure that it is safe to continue stud y drug administration .  In this case, the 
ECG should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at the study site or local 
hospital/facility .
Height and Weight
Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off).  Body weight will be 
measured at all scheduled visits except Week 1, as specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F.  All measurements will be recorded in metric units where applicable.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, res piratory  rate, and body  temperature will be obtained at visits specified in 
Appendix Dand Appendix F.  Blood pressure, pulse rate, bod y temperature, and 
respiratory  rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as 
specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The physical examination at the Baseline Visit 
will serve as the baseline phy sical examination for the entire stud y.  Physical examination 
abnormalities noted b y the Investigator at Baseline prior to the first dose of s tudy drug 
will be recorded in the subject's medical history ; abnormalities noted after the first dose of 
study  drug will be evaluated and documented b y the Investigator as to whether or not the 
abnormality  is an AE (see Section 6.1.1.1 for AE definition).  All findings, whether  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
65
related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the 
appropriate eCRF page.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by phone or video 
conference occurs at one of the designated stud y visits specified tocomplete phy sical 
examina tion, the complete phy sical examination will be performed at the next feasible 
visit.
At any  time, a sy mptom -directed ph ysical examination can be performed as deemed 
necessary  by the Investigator.
Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS
At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the Phy sician will rate global 
assessment of subject's current disease activit y ranging from 0 to 100 independent of the 
subject's self -assessment using the VAS, which consists of a horizont al 100 mm line 
anchored at either end b y opposite adjectives reflecting the spectrum/severity of the 
parameters assessed ( Appendix G).
Due to a stat e of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the Phy sician Global 
Assessment of Disease Activity  will be completed by  the ph ysician at the next feasible 
visit.
TJC and SJC Assessment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints ( Appendix H) will be done for tenderness b y pressure 
manipulation on phy sical examinati on at visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  
Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no 
assessment ("NA"). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
66
SJC Assessment
An assessment of 66 joints ( Appendix H) will be done by directed phys ical examination at 
visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The joints to be examined for swelling 
are the same as those examined for tenderness, except the hip joints are excluded.  Joint 
swelling will be classified as present ("1"), absent ("0"), replaced ("9") or no assessment 
("NA").
Any injected joints will be considered as "not assessed" ("NA") for 3 months from the 
time of the intra -articular injection.
If possible, the TJC and SJC should be performed by  an indepe ndent and blinded joint 
assessor who should not perform an y other stud y related procedures.
In order to minimize variability , the same independent joint assessor should evaluate the 
subject at each visit for the duration of the trial as much as possible.  A back- up 
independent joint assessor should be identified.  The independent joint assessors should 
be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, physician).  An y 
other joint assessor must be trained and competent in performing su ch assessments.  I t is 
the responsibility  of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained 
to perform joint assessments.  If the independent assessor is not available, the pre-
identified back- up assessor should perform such assess ments.
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19, subject visits may  be 
conducted via phone or video conference.  In these situations, the TJC and SJC will be 
performed at the next feasible visit by the independent joint assessor, if possible.
CDAI
The CDAI calculation is required to determine if a subject fails to achieve low disease 
activity  and will be performed at the Week 24 visit.  An I nteractive Response Technology  
(IRT) will calculate CDAI with input from site personnel on joint counts and the subject's 
and phy sician's Global Assessment of RA Disease Activity  score. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
67
The calculation used to determine CDAI score at Week 24 is as follows:
CDAI  = TJC28 + SJC28 + PtGA (cm) + PhGA (cm)
NOTE:  Inv estigator should optimize background RA therapies in subjects who failed to 
achieve a CDAI ≤ 10.
Pregnancy Test
A serum pregnancy  test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential 
at the Screening Visit.  The serum pregnancy  test wil l be sent to and performed by  the 
central laboratory .  If the serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is considered a 
screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ 3 day s 
later to determine eligibility .  If the re peat serum pregnancy  test is:
●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
●Still borderline ≥ 3 day s later, this will be considered documentation of 
continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the 
study .
In Period 1, a urine pregnancy  test will be performed for all female subjects of 
childbearing potential at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of stud y drug and at all 
subsequent visits except Week 1.  More f requent pregnancy  tests will be performed 
throughout the study if required per local/country requirements.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begin.  
●If the baseline or post -baseline uri ne pregnancy  test performed at the site is 
positive, dosing with study  drug must be withheld and a serum pregnancy  test 
is required.  The serum pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed b y the 
central laboratory .  If the serum pregnancy  test is negative , study  drug may  be 
started or resumed.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study  drug must be 
permanentl y discontinued.  I n the event a serum pregnancy  test comes back  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
68
borderline, a repeat test is required ( ≥ 3 day s later) to document continued lack
of a positive result.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communicated to the site.   If a urine pregnancy test is 
positive, the subject must stop dosing, return to the study  site and have blood drawn for a 
serum pregnancy  test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory .
In the event a urine pregnancy  test may not be performed at the protocol specified visits
due to study  modifications related to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like 
COVID- 19, it can be performed b y subjects at a local laboratory or it is possible for the 
Investigator to arrange a shipment from the study  site directly to the subject's home to 
have the urine pregnancy test done at home (see Section 5.3.1.1 . -Sub-Section "Study  
Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance" for details).  Home urine pregnancy  test 
should be performed monthly , regardless of ability  to obtain other laboratory  samples.
At each visit, the study  staff should review the pregnancy  avoidance recommendations 
with each subject of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject's 
source records.
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy  testing 
is no longer required. 
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation in the study or 
continuation on study  drug.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples wil l be obtained for the clinical laboratory tests listed in Table 2.  Unscheduled 
clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time during the study if deemed ap propriate per 
Investigator's discretion.  A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
69
provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are 
considered clinically  significant by  the Investigator will b e followed to a satisfactory  
resolution.
The central laboratory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and shipping of these samples.
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations due to state o f emergency  or 
pandemic situation like COVID -19 prevent the subject from having blood drawn for 
laboratory  testing at the study  site, it is possible for the Investigator to arrange for subjects 
to have laboratory  work done at a local lab, hospital, or othe r facility  to ensure the safet y 
assessments are conducted per protocol. Local lab results should be obtained along with 
reference ranges and kept within the subjects' source documentation.  L ocal lab results 
should be reviewed b y the investigator or desig nee as soon as possible and documented in 
the eCRF.
If laboratory  samples cannot be obtained, study  drug administration may  be continued 
provided labs have been obtained within the prior 3 months, the investigator has reviewed 
the laboratory  results and co nfirmed and discussed with the subject that there is no safet y 
concern for the subject to continue use of the study drug in the absence of current lab 
results.  The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible and no 
later than the next scheduled visit in order to continue the study  drug administration.
If laboratory  results are not available within the prior 3 months, study  drug dispensation is 
not allowed until the required laboratory  tests are completed to ensure the safet y 
assessments are conducted per protocol .
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests at visits specified in Appendix D
and Appendix F.  Blood draws should be performed only  after all questionnaires 
(HAQ -DI, Patient's Assessment of Pain, etc.), clinical assessments, and vital sign 
determinations are obtained. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35

For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum 8 -hour fast) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in 
study  source documentation.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinal ysis testing at visits specified in Appendix Dand 
Appendix F.  The central laboratory  will be responsible for performing a macroscopic 
urinaly sis (urine dipstick) on the collected urin e specimens.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinal yses defined as leukocy tes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater 
than negative, or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic 
analysis at the central laboratory .
For an y laboratory  test value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to 
be clinically  significant, the Investigator should apply  the standard of care for medical 
evaluation and treatment per local guidelines:
●The Investigator will repeat the test to verify  the out -of-range value.
●The Investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory  clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from study  drug or 
requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.

Table 2. Clinical Laboratory Tests (Continued)
c. INR will only be measured with a separate blood sample at repeat testing if ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN.
d. A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the Screening Visit and if 
postbaseline urine pregnancy test turns positive.
e. At Screening only.
f. If PPD not performed.
g. In Period 1, the cen tral lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, 
Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results of hsCRP may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK 
inhibitor, thereby limiting its clinical utility in th e setting of a possible safety assessment or adverse event 
management.  Any local hsCRP or CRP tests should not be reported to the investigator until treatment allocation is 
unblinded or subject is known to be receiving upadacitinib.  In Period 2, the cent ral lab hsCRP results will remain 
blinded to Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Starting with Amendment 4, at a timepoint specified 
by the Sponsor in Period 2, central laboratory hsCRP results will be reported to the Investigator/study site 
personnel. After treatment assignment is unblinded, local hsCRP or CRP tests are allowed.
h. At screening for female subjects < 55 years old AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of 
permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Secti on 5.2.4 ) an FSH should be tested.
i. If needed to assess B cell counts in subjects who have discontinued rituximab, see Inclusion Criterion 7.
j. Aurine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential at the Baseline Visit prior 
to the first dose of study drug and all subsequent visits except Week 1.  If the baseline urine pregnancy test 
performed at the site is ne gative, then dosing with study drug may begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy test 
performed at the site is positive, dosing with study drug must be withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required.  
The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the serum pregnancy test is 
negative, study drug dosing may be started.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug must be 
permanently discontinued.  In the event a pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat tes t is required.  If a urine 
pregnancy test postbaseline is positive, study drug needs to be temporarily discontinued and a serum pregnancy test 
is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory.  If the serum 
pregnancy test is negative, study drug may be restarted.  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug must be 
permanently discontinued.
k. If required by country regulatory authorities to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested for antibodies to HIV at 
Screening, and it should be documented that the test has been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  
A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will 
not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
Hepatitis Screen
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening.
Hepatitis B:
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at screening using the foll owing tests:
●HBs Ag 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
73
●HBc Ab/anti -HBc
●HBs Ab/anti -HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody )
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary .
A negative result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodie s (HBs Ab).
●A negative test result for HBc Ab does notrequire HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 3, Scenarios A and B).  For a 
subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical 
history ), a positive test resul t for HBs Ab is expected and the subject may be 
enrolled ( Figure 3, Scenario B).*
●A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic 
reflex testing) ( Figure 3, Scenarios C and D).
○A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection 
sensitivity  will be exclusionary .
○A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.

Hepatitis C:
Blood samples for Hepatitis C serology will be obtained at the Screening Visit.  A subject 
will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C (HCV 
RNA detectable in an y subject with anti HCV Ab).
HIV
Subjects with a known history  of HIV infection a re excluded from study  participation.  If 
required b y country  regulatory  authorities to confirm eligibility , subjects will be tested for 
antibodies to HIV at Screening.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will 
not be eligible for study p articipation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection.  
AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of an y 
positive result.
Randomization/Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  results must be reviewed, signed, an d dated by the Principal 
Investigator or Sub -investigator prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the study  if laboratory  or other Screening result abnormalities are deemed clinically  
significant b y the Principal I nvestigator or Su b-investigator.
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and ar e willing to continue in the study .
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology (IRT) 
to receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to W eek 12) → 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 2:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to Week 12) → 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 3:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereaft er) 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6

75
●Group 4:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
Randomization will be stratified b y number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 
2 biologics with the same mechanism of action; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3biologics with the 
same mechanism of action and/or multiple mechanisms of action) and geographic region.  
Once approximately  35% of the total subjects have been randomized in stratum 2, further 
screening of subjects who meet stratum 2 criteria may be susp ended.
See Section 5.5.3 for details.
Study Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance
Study  drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline ( Day 1) and as specified in 
Appendix Dand Appendix F.  The first dose of study drug will be administered after all 
other Baseline (Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a dosing diary  
for all study  drug administered outside of the study  visit (i.e., at home) to capture dosing 
dates and ti mes.  At visits specified in Appendix Dand Appendix F, the site personnel 
will review and retain a copy  of the dosing diary , returned stud y drug kits, and empty 
study  drug packaging to verify  compliance.
All relevant dosing information will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.
Refer to Sec tion 5.5for additional information.
Study  drug may  be shipped from the stud y site directly to the stud y subject's home due to 
study  modifications r elated to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19 
if all the following criteria are met:
●Direct -to-patient (DTP) shipment of study  drug is allowed by  local regulations 
and the relevant ethics committee
●Study  drug can be administered by  thesubject (or subject's caregiver) at home
●Subject agrees to have the study  drug shipped directly  to their home 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
76
●Shipments may  also include other study  supplies (e.g., drug dosing diaries, in -
home urine pregnancy  test kits).  I nstructions will be provided b yAbbVie as to 
how a study  site can initiate a DTP shipment using Marken, a global vendor 
selected b y AbbVie to provide this service when necessary.  Shipments of 
study  drugs from the study  site to a subject's home will be appropriatel y 
temperature controll ed (qualified shipper or temperature monitoring) within 
the labeled storage conditions.  Signature is required upon delivery; due to 
COVID- 19 related social distancing, this may  be provided b y the courier after 
delivery .  Documentation of the shipment is t o be retained b y the clinical site.
●AbbVie will not receive subject identify ing information related to these 
shipments, as the site will work directl y with the courier.
The study  site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting requirements related to DTP 
shipments of study  drug, and for obtaining consent to provide delivery  information to the 
courier and documenting this consent in source documents.
Optional Home Healthcare Service Due to State of Emergency or Pandemic 
Situation like COVID- 19
Subjects may  be offered the option of home healthcare visits provided b y a study  nurse or 
third- party vendor.  Study procedures conducted in the home setting may include vital 
signs and bod y weight, physical exam, blood and urine samples collection, urine 
pregnancy test, adverse event and concomitant therap y assessment including compliance 
to contraception requirements if applicable, latent TB risk assessment form, review of 
subject dosing diary , TJC and SJC performed by  the same independent joint assessor, if 
possi ble, to minimize variability .
This option can only  be offered in countries and sites that comply  with local regulatory  
and I RB/IEC requirements for homecare.  An y pre-requisite submissions or notifications 
to the site I RB/IEC and local competent health aut hority  should be made, and approvals 
must be obtained prior to implementation.
The investigator should be available via phone call if a consultation is necessary.

It is recommended that medical personnel entering a subject's home adhere to local health 
regulations during the COVID- 19 pandemic, such as the use of Personal Protective 
Equipment (PPE), as required.
If the home visits will not be performed b y site personnel, the site may be responsible for 
selecting a vendor, contracting with a vendor, and for e nsuring continued compliance with 
the terms of the Clinical Study  Agreement.
Individuals performing home visits need to be added to the delegation log.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of In Vivo Pharmacodynamic 
Biomarker and Optional Samples for Exploratory  Resear ch 
and Validation Studies
5.3.1.2.1 In Vivo Pharmacody namic Biomarker Samples
Blood samples will be collected at the visits indicated in Appendix Dand Appendix Fand 
will be utilized to assess effects of upadacitinib inhibition on certain lymphocyte subsets, 
including but not limited to T (CD4+ and CD8+) cells, B (CD19+) cells, natural killer 
(NK) cells, and natural killer -T (NKT) cells.
The samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study -specific laboratory  
manual.
5.3.1.2.2 Optional Samples for Exploratory  Research and Validation 
Studies
In Period 1, subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and 
validation studies.  Subjects may  still participate in the study  even if they  decide not to 
participate in this optional exploratory  research/validation study .
Explorato ry research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability  to predict which subjects would benefit from receiving specific 
therapies.  In addition, exploratory  research may  help to improve our understanding of  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
78
how to diagnose and assess/monitor RA by  assessing associations between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data, and biomarkers of interest.
Validation studies, including those related to the development of potential in vitro 
diagnostic tests, may  be carried o ut retrospectively  in order to assess associations between 
events of interest (i.e., efficacy and/or safet y events) and candidate biomarkers.
AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the biomarker 
exploratory  research/validation studi es samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality .  The samples will be retained while research on 
upadacitinib (or drugs of this class) or RA and related conditions continues, but for no 
longer than 20 years after the completion of Period 1.
DNA Samples for Pharmacogenetic or Epigenetic Analyses
Whole blood samples for DNA isolation will be collected at the visits indicated in 
Appendix Efrom each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory/validation 
research.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent is discussed in 
Section 9.3.
Samples will be shipped frozen to AbbVie or a designated laboratory for DNA extraction

5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Plasma upadacitinib concentrations will be obtained at the times indicated in Appendix D.  
A non -linear mixed- effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population 
central values and the empirical Bay esian estimates of the individ ual values of 
upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional 
parameters may  be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 In Vivo Pharmacody namic Biomarker Samples and 
Exploratory  Research Variables and Validat ion Studies
5.3.6.1 In Vivo Pharmacody namic Biomarker Samples
Blood samples will be collected to assess the effects of upadacitinib inhibition on 
lymphocy te subsets including but not limited to:  T (CD4+ and CD8+) cells, B (CD19+) 
cells, NK cells, and NKT cells.
5.3.6.2 Exploratory  Research Variables and Validation Studies
Optional samples may  be collected to conduct exploratory  investigations into known and 
novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be anal yzed may  include, but are not 
limited to nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, or metabolites.
Biomarker assessments may  be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, 
pharmacod ynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures.  Theses assessments may  be 
explored in the context of RA or related conditions and/or upa dacitinib or drugs of similar 
classes.  The results from these anal yses are exploratory  in nature and may  not be 
included with the clinical study report (CSR).
The samples may  also be used to develop new therapies, research methods or 
technologies.  In addition, samples from this study may  be stored for future use.  Samples 
may then be used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a prospective 
study , leading to the development of diagnostic tests.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessme nt
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the stud y at any time for an y 
reason including but not limited to disease progression or lack of response to treatment.  
The Investigator may  discontinu e any subject's participation for an y reason, including an 
AE, safet y concerns, lack of efficacy, or failure to comply with the protocol.  See 
Section 6.1.7 for toxicity  management criteria.
Subjects will have study  drug discontinued immediately  if any  of the following occur:
●Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  results or AEs, which rule out safe 
continuation of the study  drug, as determined b ythe Investigator or the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequatel y controlled within 
2weeks b y anti -infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by  the Investigator.
●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
●Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuat ion of the study  drug would place the subject at risk 
as determined b y the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the 
study  drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by  theAbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject is non- compliant with TB proph ylaxis (if applicable) or develops 
active TB at any time during the stud y.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on stud y drug.
●Malignancy , except for localized NMSC or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix.
●Subject is significantl y non-compliant with study  procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial as determined b y the 
Investigator or the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
86
●Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation (other than due to appendicitis 
or mechanical injury ).
●Starting at Week 24 and thereafter, subject fails to show at least 20% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive 
visits, despite optimiz ation of background RA therapies.
●Confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non -
cardiac, non- neurologic arterial thrombosis.
In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinu e study  drug treatment should complete a Premature 
Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks.  
Afterwards, subjects should continue to be followed for all regularl y scheduled visits, 
unless they  have decided to discont inue the study  participation entirel y (withdrawal 
informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of 
their data even if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.
If a subject prematurely  discontinues study  drug treatment and study  participation 
(withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature 
Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferabl y 
within 2 weeks of stud y drug discontinuation.  In addition, if subject is willing, a 30- day 
follow -up phone call (or visit) after the last dose of study  drug may  be completed to 
ensure all treatment emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved or the occurrence of an y new 
AEs/SAEs.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prema turely after randomization will not 
be replaced.  
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study  drug dose and the 
primary  reason for discontinuation of study  drug or study  participation.  The information 
will be recorded on the appropr iate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere with the initiation of an y new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the 
Investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation 
of study  drug, the su bject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical 
judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.

During the COVID 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity of care. 
During a state of emergency  or pandemic situation like COVID -19,the investigator 
should contact the sponsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study
or study  drug for a reason other than "planned per protocol," to ensure all acceptable 
mitigation steps have been explored.
Additional local requirements may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Cfor local requirements for 
France.
Lost to Follow -Up
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must 
be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source 
documentation.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  terminate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately 
notify  the Investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.

5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Trea tments A dministered
Study  drug will be taken orally  once dail y, beginning on Day  1 (Baseline), and should be 
taken at approximately  the same time each day .  The study  drug can be taken with or 
without food.  Subjects will continue their weekly stable backg round therapy  of 
csDMARD(s).  AbbVie will not supply  csDMARD(s) (nor folic acid or equivalent, such 
as folinic acid, for subjects who are on MTX).
Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currently  on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
If a subject is unable to come to the study  site to pick up their study  drug due to state of 
emergency  or an y pandemic like COVID- 19, a direct -to-patient (DTP) study  drug 
shipment can be made from the study  site to the subject if allowed b y local regulations.  
AbbVie will submit any  required notifications to the regulatory  authority  as applicable.  
Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for details o n DTP shipment of study  drug.

5.5.2.1 Packaging and Labeling
Upadacitinib (ABT- 494) and matching placebo will be packaged in bottles with quantities 
sufficient to accommodate study  design.  Each kit label will contain a unique kit number.  
This kit number is assigned to a subject via IRT and e ncodes the appropriate study  drug to  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
89
be dispensed at the subject's corresponding stud y visit.  Each kit will be labeled as 
required per country  requirements.  Labels must remain affixed to the kits.  All blank 
spaces on the label will be completed b y the s ite staff prior to dispensing to the subjects.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Study  drugs must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).  
The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used onl y 
within the context of this study .  The study drug supplied for this study must be 
maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label 
until dispensed for subject use or destro yed as appropriate.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning S ubjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be randomized using I RT.  Before the study  is initiated, IRT directions 
will be provided to each site.
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number b y the IRT at the Screening 
Visit.  For subjec ts that re -screen, the Screening number assigned b y the IRT at the initial 
Screening visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested.  
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at Baseline and are willing to continue in the study .  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using interactive response technology  (IRT) 
to receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  upadacitinib (ABT -494) 30 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to Week 12) → 
upadacitinib (ABT- 494) 30 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 2:  upadacitinib (ABT -494) 15 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to Week 12) → 
upadacitinib (ABT- 494) 15 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 3:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib (ABT -494) 
30mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter) 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6

●Group 4:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadaciti nib (ABT- 494) 
15mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
Randomization will be stratified b y number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 
2 biologics with the same mechanism of action; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3 biologics with the 
same mechanism of action and/o r multiple mechanisms of action) and geographic region.  
Once approximately  35% of the total subjects have been randomized in stratum 2, further 
screening of subjects who meet stratum 2 criteria may be suspended.
The I RT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment 
group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated b y the Statistics 
Department at AbbVie.
IRT will provide the appropriate study drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject.  
Study  drug will be administered at the study  visits as summarized in Section 5.3.1.1 .  
Returned study  drug should not be re -dispensed to any  subject.
Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dos e for Each Subject
Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1.
On dosing day s that occur on study  visit day s, subjects should fol low the regular dosing 
schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 1 and Week 2 visits).
Each subject's dosing schedule should be closel y monitored by  the site at each study  visit 
by careful review of the subject's dosing diary .  This will ensure that all subjects enrolled 
into the study  maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of 
study  drug (Baseline/Day 1).
If a s ubject should forget to take their upadacitinib (ABT -494) (or matching placebo) dose 
at their regularly  scheduled dosing time, they  should take the forgotten dose as soon as  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
91
they remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next 
scheduled dose.  If a subject only remembers the missed dose within 10 hours before next 
scheduled dose, the subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the 
scheduled time.  If the subject experiences a study drug interruption > 7 co nsecutive day s 
during Weeks 1 through 24 (Period 1) or > 30 consecutive days after Week 24 (Period 2), 
they should notify  the Investigator, and the Investigator will determine if study drug 
should be restarted.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply  Management Team), the Investigator, study  
site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throug hout 
the study .  Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 
15 mg QD, including those currently  on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  
In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib (ABT -494) tablets and placebo tablets 
provided fo r the stud y will be identical in appearance.  The IRT will provide access to 
unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency .
In the event of a medical emergency  that requires unblinding of the stud y drug 
assignment, the Investigat or is requested to contact the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical 
Director prior to breaking the blind.  However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is 
necessary  which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie Therapeutic 
Area Medical Dire ctor, the Investigator can directly  access the IRT system to break the 
blind without AbbVie notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the I RT 
system via the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only  to the Investigator.  If 
the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may  occur by  contacting EndPoint technical 
support via either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com).  For 
country -specific phone numbers, please see the following website:
http://www.endpointclinical.com/help -desk/.  In the event that the blind is broken before  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
92
notification to the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director, we request that the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director be notified within 24 hours of the blind being 
broken.  The date and reas on that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
An unblinded anal ysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 1 
(Week 24) for the purpose of regulatory  submission.  Study  sites and subjects w ill remain 
blinded for the duration of the study.
Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currentl y on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.  Study sites and subjects will no 
longer be blinded after this point.
5.5.5.2 Blinding of Data for Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons independent of 
AbbVie and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety data from 
the ongoing stud y.  The primary responsibility  of the DMC will be to protect the safet y of 
the subjects participating in this study .
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the 
roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency  of data rev iews, and relevant 
safet y data to be assessed.
Communications from the DMC to the Study  Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially  unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.
As of September 2018, with all subjects having reached the end of Period 1, and after 
final review of unblinded safety data, the DMC concluded its oversight of this study .
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study  in accordance with  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
93
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary.  Subjects will be instructed to 
return all drug contai ners (even if empty ) to the study  site personnel at each clinic visit.  
The study  site personnel will document compliance in the study  source documents.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountability
The Investigator or his/her representative will verify that stud y drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by signing and dating the 
Proof of Receipt or similar document and b y registering the arrival of drug through the 
IRT.  The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in 
the site files as a record of what was received.
In addition, an I RT will be used to document investigational product accountability  
including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, 
subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug.
All empty /used study  drug packaging will be inventoried by  the site.  Empty /used study  
drug packaging should be returned b y the subject at each visit for accountability  and 
compliance purposes and n ew packaging issued as necessary .  Site staff will complete 
study  drug accountabilit y via I RT by  using source documents, subject dosing diaries, and 
by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible.  After drug accountability  and 
monitor reconciliati on has been completed, used packaging and unused study  drug will be 
destroy ed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the 
destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie's documentation requirements 
for on -site destru ction).  The use of a third party v endor for drug destruction must be pre -
approved b y AbbVie.  For sites performing on -site drug destruction or using a third part y 
vendor for drug destruction, a cop y of the destruction methodology and date of 
destruction s hould be maintained at the site's facility . 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35

Monitors will reconcile the site's processes, source documents, subject's dosing diaries, 
IRT or site accountability records, and destruction records to assure site compliance.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Stu dy Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This study  includes two periods:
Period 1 is a 24- week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled period to compare 
safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib versus placebo in subjects with moderately  to severel y 
active RA who have an inadequate response to or intolerance to bDMARD therap y and 
who are on a stable dose of csDMARDs.  Period 1 is designed to test superiority of 
upadacitinib versus placebo for achieving the primary endpoint (ACR2 0 for US/FDA 
regulatory  purposes or LDA for EU/EMA regulatory  purposes) at Week 12, and other 
secondary  efficacy  parameters, all on a stable background csDMARD therap y.
The purpose of Period 2 is to evaluate the long -term safet y, tolerability, and efficacy of 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD and 15 mg QD in a blinded fashion in subjects with RA who have 
completed Period 1.  Subjects will continue to receive upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg 
QD per original randomization assignment in a blinded manner.  Dose reduction or 
escalation of upadacitinib during Period 2 is not permitted to allow unbiased assessments 
of long -term safety  and efficacy  of upadacitinib 30 mg QD versus 15 mg QD.
Starting with Amendment 4, all subjects will receive open -label upadacitinib 15 mg QD, 
including those currently on upadacitinib 30 mg QD.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory  procedures will be utilized in this study .  All 
efficacy  measurements in this study  are standard for assessing disease activity  in subjects 
with RA.  All clinical and laboratory  procedures in this study  are standard and generally  
accepted.

5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
The intended stud y population is moderately to severel y active RA patients who have had 
an inadequate response to or intolerance to prior bDMARD treatment.  Key  entry  criteria 
are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a 
diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months who also fulfill the 2010 ACR/EUL AR classification 
criteria for RA.  Eligi ble study  subjects must have ≥ 6 swollen joints (based on 66 joint 
counts) and ≥ 6 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, 
and hsCRP level ≥ 3 mg/L (central lab) at Screening.  Subjects who have been treated 
≥ 3months pr ior to the screening visit with ≥ 1 bDMARD therap y for RA in the past and 
failed at least 1 bDMARD therap y ma y be enrolled.  Subjects must have been on a stable 
background of csDMARD therap y (restricted to MTX, chloroquine, h ydrox ychloroquine, 
sulfasalazine, or leflunomide) for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study  drug.  
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Two doses of the once -daily  formulation of upadacitinib will be evaluated:  upadacitinib 
15 mg QD and 30 mg QD.  The dose selection in this study  is based on extrapolation of 
pre-clinical efficacy  models and anal yses of PK, pharmacod ynamic, safety , and efficacy  
data from the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (single and multiple ascending dose 
studies, Studies M13- 401 and M13 -845, respectively ) and Phase 2 studies in RA subjects 
(Studies M13- 537 and M13 -550).  The doses selected for Study  M13 -542, upadacitinib 
15mg QD and 30 mg QD, dosed for up to 260 weeks, are expected to be efficacious with 
an acceptable safet y profile.
Doses of 15 mg QD and 30 m g QD using the once -daily formulation provide equivalent 
daily  AUC and comparable C maxand C minto 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID, respectively, of 
the immediate -release formulation tested in Phase 2 studies in subjects with RA.  I n 
Phase 2 studies, the 6 mg BID d ose was shown to achieve the near maximum efficacy  and 
the 12 mg BID dose was clearl y shown to achieve the plateau of efficacy.

6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any  written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical chara cteristics, identity , quality , purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
repor ted to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2).  For AEs, please refer to Section 6.1.  For product 
complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The Investigator will monitor each subj ect for clinical and laboratory  evidence of AEs on 
a routine basis throughout the study .  The Investigator will assess and record any AE in 
detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/s ymptom, severity , 
time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE to study drug, and 
any action(s) taken.  For SAEs considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of being 
associated with study  drug, the Investigator will provide other cause(s) of the event.  For 
AEs to be co nsidered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  AEs, 
whether in response to a query , observed b y site personnel, or reported spontaneously b y 
the subject will be recorded.
All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can there fore be any  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
97
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
the event is considered causally  related to the use of t he product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
study  drug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator 
considers them to be AEs.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study  will not be considered 
an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre-planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g., surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure 
is being d one will be considered an AE.
6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an AE meets an y of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as an SAE 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality  if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
98
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study  subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requirin g 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any  of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elec tive or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at 
home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study (see detailed 
toxicity  management in Section 6.1.7 ):
●Serious infections
● Op portunistic infections
● H erpes zoster

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will classify  adverse events according to the Rheumatology Common 
Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0 ( Appendix Q).22
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to 
the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consider ation of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship
For causality assessments, events assessed as having
a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."   
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
100
In addition, when the investigator has n ot reported a relationship or deemed it not 
assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the investigat or for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 day s following 
discontinuation of study  drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether 
solicited or spontane ously  reported by  the subject.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug 
treatment but continue to participate in the stud y will have SAEs and nonserious AEs 
collected for the remainder of study participation.  I n addition, SAEs and protocol -related 
nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signed the study -specific 
informed consent.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 4.

Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject or the partner of an 
enrolled subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  Pregnancies in study 
subject s and their partners will be identified from the date of the first dose through 
30days following the last dose of study  drug and the pregnancy  will be followed to 
outcome.
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an AE.  However, the medical outcome of 
an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomal y is considered an 
SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the 
event.
Subjects should avoid pregnancy  throughout the course of the study , star ting with the 
Screening Visit through 30 days after the last study drug administration.  Results of a 
positive pregnancy  test or confirmation of a pregnancy  will be assessed starting with the 
Screening Visit through the final study visit.
6.1.7 Toxicity  Manageme nt
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safet y 
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of stud y drug dosin g with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from 
study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is described 
below.
For subjects who discontinued study  drug but continued study  participat ion and are on 
standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply  
(including alerts from the central lab) and an y intolerability  to standard of care therapies 
should be managed b y the prescribing ph ysician.
Serious Infections: Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
105
subject w ho develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be closel y 
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infection has been 
successfull y treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be discontinued from study 
drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19.
Consider interrupting study  drug in subjects with signs and/or s ymptoms and suspicion of 
COVID- 19.  The COVID -19 eCRF must be completed.
Herpes Zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If a diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed 
(other than appendicitis or penetrating injury), the subject must be permanently 
discontinued from study  drug.
Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presen ting with potential cardiovascular 
events should be carefully monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated b y 
an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner.
Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thromb osis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary  
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must 
be discontinued from study  drug.
Malignancy:   Subjec ts who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recom mended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study  drug for an ECG change 
considered clinically  significant and with reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment following an y local guidelines .  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 4, and may  
require an appropriate supplemental eCRF to be completed.  All abnormal laboratory  tests 
that are considered clinically  significant b y the Investigator will be followed to a 
satisfactory  resolution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 4, the repeat testing must 
occur as soon as possible.
Table 4. Specific Toxicity Management Guidelines for Abnormal 
Laboratory Values
Laboratory Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing 
with a new sample
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative etiology is 
known, the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion.
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to 
normal reference rang e or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) If confirmed < 1000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its baseline 
value.
 Discontinue study drug if confirm ed < 500 cells/µL by repeat testing with new 
sample.
Absolute lymphocyte 
counts (ALC) If confirmed < 500 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Total whit e blood cell 
count  If confirmed < 2000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until white blood cell count returns to normal reference range or its 
baseline value.

Platelet count  If confirmed < 50,000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study 
drug dosing until platelet count returns to normal reference range or its baseline 
value.
AST or ALT  Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample and e ither a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international 
normalized ratio > 1.5.
o A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of INR is not needed for 
determination if above toxicity management criteria are met.
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample along with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eos inophilia (> 5%). 
 Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by repeat 
testing with new sample for more than 2 weeks.
 If ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, interrupt study drug immediately, confirm by repeat 
testing with a new sample and contac t the TA MD.
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative 
etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate.  If 
applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in the eCRF.  If ALT or AST 
values return to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be 
restarted.  If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge 
is expected to be safe.  If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alt ernative etiology 
for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is 
not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug.
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ULN, complete supplement al hepatic 
eCRF.
 Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at 
screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by PCR testing 
performed within 1 week:
o ALT > 5 × ULN OR
o ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require immediate 
interruption of study drug and a hepatologist consultation should occur within 1 week 
for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.

Serum Creatinine  If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the 
results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion then interrupt study drug and 
re-start stu dy drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and 
≤ULN.
 If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re -start study 
drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range or its baseline value. 
For the above s erum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete supplemental renal eCRF.
Creatine Phosphokinase  If confirmed CPK ≥ 4 × ULN, and there are no symptoms suggestive of myositis 
or rhabdomyolysis subjects may continue study drug at the investigator's 
discretion.
 If CPK ≥ 4 × ULN accompanied by symptoms suggestive of myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis, interrupt study drug and inform AbbVie Therapeutic Area 
Medical Director.
For the above CPK elevation scenarios, complete supplemental CPK eCRF.
For allowed study  drug in terruption, the following rules appl y:
Period 1
●Allow study  drug interruption up to 7 consecutive days for AEs and 
emergency  surgery .  Elective surgery  will not be allowed during this 24 -week

treatment group and overall, with frequencies and percentages b y reason for 
discontinuation.
8.1.2.3 Study Drug Exposure
Exposure to study  drug will be summarized for the Safet y Anal ysis Set for Period 1 alone 
as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.  The exposure to study  drug (day s) will be 
summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, and range for each treatment 
group.
Study  drug compliance will be summarized for each treatment group for Period 1.  The 
compliance is defined as t he number of tablets taken (i.e., the difference between the 
number of tablets dispensed and the number of tablets returned) during the subject's 
participation in Period 1 divided by the number of tablets a subject is supposed to take 
each day  times the le ngth of time that the subject was in the Treatment Phase of Period 1.
8.1.3 Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group and 
overall for the FAS.  For the purpose of this anal ysis, baseline data for each subject will 
be the data collected immediately  prior to the first dose of study  drug in Period 1.

8.1.4 Efficacy  Analyses
All efficacy  analy ses will be carried out using the FAS population, which includes all 
randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
8.1.4.1 Efficacy  Analysis for Period 1
For all efficacy  analy sis in Period 1, the two placebo groups (Groups 3 and 4) will be 
combined and treated as one placebo group for analy sis purposes.  Each upadacitinib dose 
will be compared with the combined placebo group.
8.1.4.1.1 Primary  Efficacy  Variable
The primary  endpoint (at Week 12) for US/FDA regulatory  purposes is listed in 
Section 5.3.3.1.1 .  The primary  endpoint (at Week 12) for EU/EMA regulatory  purposes 
is also listed in Section 5.3.3.1.1 .  Analy ses will be conducted separately for US/FDA 
regulatory  purposes and EU/EMA regulatory  purposes; for each set of analy sis, only  
oneprimary  endpoint is specified.
Analy sis of the primary  endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized.  Comparisons of the primary  endpoint will be made between each
upadacitinib dose and the combined placebo group using the Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel 
test adjusting for main stratification factors.  For the primary anal ysis, non -responder  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
115
imputation (NRI ) will be used.  The analy sis will be repeated using Observed Cases (OC).  
Supportive analy sis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol Anal ysis Set.
The primary  efficacy  analy ses will be performed in demographic subgroups including 
age, gender, weight, body mass index, race, and geographical region to assess the 
consist ency  of the treatment effect.  Additional subgroup anal yses based on baseline 
disease characteristics and stratification factors will also be conducted.
8.1.4.1.2 Key Secondary  Efficacy  Variables
Key secondary  endpoints (at Week 12):  Key  secondary  endpoints (at Week 12) for 
US/FDA regulatory  purposes are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.2 .  Key  secondary endpoints (at 
Week 12) for EU/EMA regulatory  purposes are also listed in Section 5.3.3.1.2 .
For binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment 
group.  Similar analy ses as for the primary  endpoint will be conducted.
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be 
reported for each treatment group.  Between -group comparisons for each upadacitinib 
treatment group and the combined placebo groups will be performed using the anal ysis of 
covariance model with treatment as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value 
and the main stratification factors as the covariates.
SeeSection 8.1.4.1.5 for imputation methods.
8.1.4.1.3 Other Efficacy  Variables
Additional efficacy  variables are listed in Section 5.3.3.1.3 and will be summarized for all 
visits, including visits beyond Week 12.  For binary endpoints, frequencies and 
percentages will be reported for each treatment group.  For continuous endpoints, the 
change from baseline mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for 
each treatment group.

8.1.4.1.4 Multiplicity  Control for Primary and Ranked Secondary  
Endpoints
The overall ty pe I error rate of the primary and key secondary  endpoints for the two doses 
will be strongl y controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure.23  Specificall y, 
the testing will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary endpoint followed by  key 
secondary  endpoints, and will begin with testing the primary  endpoint using α of 0.025 for 
each dose.  Continued testing will follow a pre -specified α transf er path which includes 
downstream transfer along the endpoint sequence within each dose as well as cross -dose 
transfer.  More details of the graphical procedure will be specified in the SAP.  
8.1.4.1.5 Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missi ng data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit. 
Multiple Imputation (MI ):  The M I anal ysis imputes missing data multiple times under 
appropriate random variation and thus generates multiple imputed "pseudo -complete" 
datasets.  Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming 
drawbacks of the single imputation methods.
Non
-Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study drug will be considered 
non-responders on or after discontinuation date.
The NRI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach for key binary endpoints.  
The MI approach will serve as the primary anal ysis approach for key continuous 
endpoints.  Sensitivity  analy ses based on OC will also be conducted for key  endpoints.

8.1.5.1 Gene ral Considerations
Safety  anal yses will be carried out using the Safety  Analy sis Set.  Anal yses will be 
conducted for Period 1 alone, as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined.
Safety  anal yses are based on treatments actually  received.  Safety  will be assessed by  
AEs, phy sical examination, laboratory  assessments, ECG, and vital signs.  Frequency  
tables and lists of subjects with treatment -emergent AEs by  preferred term as in the 
Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) dictionary , by system organ 
class, by  severit y, and b y relationship to the study drug as assessed b y the Investigator 
will be provided.  The changes from baseline in vital signs, ph ysical examination results, 
and clinical laboratory  values will be anal yzed in a descriptive manner.  Shift of 
laboratory  values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.

8.1.5.2.1 Treatment -Emergent A dverse Events (TE AE)
AEs will be coded using MedDRA.  A TEAE is defined as AE that began or worsened in 
severit y after initiation of study drug.
AEs starting more than 30 day s following the last dose of study  drug will not be included 
in summaries of TEAEs.  For subjects who continued into Period 2, AEs that are reported 
in Period 2 will be captured in the combined safety anal ysis of Period 1 and Period 2.
As a general safet y summ ary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs 
will be summarized for each treatment group for the following AE categories:
●All AEs;
●All severe AEs;
●All reasonabl y possibly related AEs;
●All SAEs;
●Frequent AEs (reported in 2% of subjects or more in any  treatment group);
●Frequent reasonabl y possibly  related AEs (reported in 5% of subjects or more 
in any  treatment group);
●Discontinuations due to AEs;
●Death.
Additional AEs may be considered for tabulation/summary based on recommendations 
from C linical and Safet y as deemed appropriate.
TEAEs will be summarized and presented b y system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred 
terms (PTs) using MedDRA.  The SOCs will be presented in alphabetical order, and the 
PTs will be presented in alphabetical order w ithin each SOC.
TEAE will also be summarized by  maximum severity  and b y maximum relationship.
The AEs of special interest (including but not limited to serious infection, opportunistic 
infection, herpes zoster, TB, gastrointestinal perforations, malignanci es, MACE, renal

summarized.  Event rate (per 100 patient years) for AEs of special interest will also be 
summarized for the combined safet y anal ysis of Period 1 and Period 2.
All AEs leading to discontinuation of study  drug will be presented in listing format.  A 
listing by  treatment group of TEAEs grouped b y SOC and MedDRA preferred term with 
subject identification numbers will be generated.
8.1.5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events and Death
Alltreatment -emergent SAEs and AEs leading to death will also be presented in listing 
format.  In addition, SAEs will be summarized by  SOC and MedDRA PT.
8.1.5.3 Analysis of Laboratory , Vital Sign, and ECG Data
Changes from baseline by visit, and changes from baseli ne to minimum value, maximum 
value, and final values in continuous laboratory  data, and vital signs will be summarized 
by treatment group.
Baseline values are defined as the last non -missing measurements recorded on or before 
the date of the first dose of study  drug in Period 1.  
The laboratory  data will be categorized as Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 
according to OMERACT criteria (Rheumatology  Common Toxicity  Criteria v.2.0).  For 
creatine phosphokinase and serum creatinine, NCI CTC criteria will be used.  The shift 
tables will tabulate the number and percentage of subjects with baseline and post -baseline 
values by  grade level.
Listings will be provided for potentially  clinically  significant laboratory  values and vital 
signs.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and E xposure -Response A nalyses
Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6

Data from this study  may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK 
and e xposure -response analy ses.  Population PK and exposure -response analy ses of onl y 
data from this study  may  not be conducted.  The following general methodology  will be 
used for the population PK and exposure -response anal yses.
Population PK analy ses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a non -linear mixed -effects modeling approach with 
NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The structure of the starting PK 
model will be based on the PK analysis of data from previous studies.  The CL /F and V/F 
of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the anal yses.  If necessary, 
other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be 
fixed if useful in the analy sis.
The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of 
different models.
1. The objective function of the best model is significantly  smaller than the alternative 
model(s).
2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more 
randomly  distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept and 
a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in 
inter-subject and intra -subject error.
Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter -and intra -subject error structure) is 
developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be 
calculated b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non- linear 
mixed -effects modeling.  The relationship between these conditional estimates CL /F and 
V/F values with onl y potentially ph ysiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful 
covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomit ant medications, laboratory  
markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
121
selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level 
of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covaria tes, a stepwise backward elimination of 
covariates from the full model will be employ ed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of 
each covariate in the full model.
Linear or non -linear relationships of primary  PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy 
variable) will be explored.  Exposure -response relationships for seco ndary  efficacy  
variables and/or some safety  measures of interest may  also be explored.  The relationship 
between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area 
under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model- predict ed PK profiles, or 
some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several 
classes of models (e.g., linear, log -linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationsh ip based on observed data.  
Results of the PK and exposure -response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate report 
prior to regulatory  filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of RA, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.1.7 Statistical A nalysis of Biomarker Data
Summary  statistics for the in vivo pharmacod ynamic biomarkers (including but not 
limited to NK, NKT, B cells, and T cells) at baseline and post -treatment time points 
(Weeks 8, 12, 16 and 24/PD in Peri od 1, and Weeks 36, 48 and every 24 weeks thereafter 
in Period 2), in addition to change from baseline at each time will be provided; this will 
include mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, and range for each group.  The 
pharmacod ynamic effect of ea ch biomarker between the placebo and upadacitinib 
treatment groups will be evaluated via a non -linear mixed -effects modeling approach with 
Change from Baseline of the biomarker as response variable, Treatment, Time, and  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
122
Treatment × Time interaction as fixe d-effects, the corresponding baseline biomarker score 
as a covariate, and "subjects nested within the treatment group" as a random -effect.  Other 
baseline variables such as age, weight, etc., may  be considered as appropriate.  For 
biomarkers identified to have significant overall treatment effect via the non- linear 
mixed -effects modeling analysis, dose -response models with the biomarker as a 
continuous response will be explored.  In addition to the above analyses of biomarkers 
individually , the effect of certain combination of biomarkers on the treatment groups may  
be explored.
If the optional exploratory research variables including an additional panel of prognostic, 
predictive, and pharmacody namic biomarkers are evaluated, then those data may  be 
analyzed as follows.  The association of biomarkers to the efficacy  and safety  endpoints 
may be explored for each biomarker one at a time, and also for combinations of 
biomarkers via some multivariate predictive modeling algorithms.  Optimal multivariate 
combination s of biomarkers that associate with efficacy endpoints, subject 
response/non -response (with respect to appropriate clinical endpoints), and also with 
safet y endpoints may be explored via a variety of statistical predictive modeling 
algorithms.  Also cut -points for individual biomarkers and optimal combinations of 
biomarkers that differentiate the subject response with respect to efficacy/safet y endpoints 
may be explored.  The significance of these multivariate combinations of biomarkers may  
be assessed via at least 20 iterations of 5 -fold cross -validation.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The planned total sample size of 450 can provide approximately  90% power to detect a 
20% difference in ACR20 rates (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of 27%), at 
two-sided α = 0.025 and accounting for 10% dropout rate.  This sample size also provides 
approximately  90% power for a 17% difference in DAS28 L DA response rate (assuming a 
placebo DAS28 LDA response rate of 12%), at two -sided α = 0.025 and accounting for 
10% dropo ut rate.  It can also provide at least 90% power for most key  secondary  
endpoints, at two -sided significance level of 0.025 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate.

8.3 Randomization Methods
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of the fou r treatment groups:  
●Group 1:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to Week 12) → 
upadacitinib 30 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 2:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD, N = 150 (Day  1 to Week 12) → 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD (Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 3:  Placeb o, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 30 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
●Group 4:  Placebo, N = 75 (Day  1 to Week 12) → upadacitinib 15 mg QD 
(Week 12 and thereafter)
Randomization will be stratified b y number of prior bDMARD use (stratum 1:  failed 1 or 
2 biologics with the same mechanism of action; stratum 2:  failed ≥ 3 biologics with the 
same mechanism of action and/or multiple mechanisms of action) and geographic region.  
Once approximately  35% of the total subjects have been randomized in stratu m 2, further 
screening of subjects who meet stratum 2 criteria may be suspended.
See Section 5.5.3 for details.
9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent, and all other forms of subject information 
related to the stud y (e.g., adverti sements used to recruit subjects) and an y other necessary 
documents be reviewed by an IEC/I RB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific 
and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the 
protocol, informed con sent, and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will 
be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study  site. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
124
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval and approval by  
Regulatory  Authority (ies), if required by local law regulations, prior to implementation of 
any changes made to the study  design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to International Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) GCP.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated b y local regulations, will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the I nvestigator should promptly  
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y additional reports required 
by local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission t o the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the c linical 
investigator are specified in Appendix A.
In the event a significant disaster/crisis (e.g., epidemic/pandemic, natural disaster, 
conflict/combat) occurs leading to difficulties in performing protocol -specified 
procedures, AbbVie may engage with stud y site personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y 
of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the stud y 
while try ing to best manage subject continuity  of care.  This may  include alternative 
methods for assessments (e.g., virtual site visits), alternative locations for data collection 
(e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), and shipping investigational product 
and/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity  of treatment where allowed.  In all 
cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by loca l regulations and permitted by  
IRB/IEC.  Investigators should notify  AbbVie if any  urgent safet y measures are taken to 
protect the subjects against any  immediate hazard.

9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explai n the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, t he person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the 
subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provision s for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory 
research/validation studies, approved b y an IRB/IEC, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be s igned before the exploratory research/validation studies samples 
are collected and testing is performed.  The separate written consent may be part of the 
main consent form.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation 
studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study , optional exploratory  
research/validation samples will continue to be stored and anal yzed unless the subject 
specificall y withdraws consent for the optional samples.  I f consent is withdrawn for the 
optional sampling, the subject must inform their study  doctor, and once AbbVie is 
informed, the optional samples will be destroy ed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples ha ve alread y been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.

The ePRO sy stem is in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11.  The documentation related 
to the sy stem validation of the ePRO sy stem is available through the vendor, CRF Health, 
while the user acceptance testing of the study -specific PRO desig n will be conducted and 
maintained at AbbVie.
The subject will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded 
to a server.  The data on the server will be considered source and will be maintained and 
managed b y CRF Health.
Intern et access to the ePRO data will be provided by  CRF Health for the duration of the 
trial.  This access will be available for the duration of the trial to the site investigator, as 
well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed from investigator s ites 
following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO system will be archived 
on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as 
a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible for the in vestigator to make 
paper print -outs from that media.
The ePRO data will be collected b y the following method:

●The instrument/scale will be collected electronically via a tablet device into 
which the subject will directly  enter the required pie ces of information.  The 
electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry for onl y the visits 
specified in the pr otocol and will not allow for subjects to complete more than 
one of the same assessment at any  one visit.  All data entered on the devi ce 
will be immediately  stored to the device itself and automatically uploaded to a 
central server administrated by CRF Health.  The Investigator and delegated 
staff will be able to access all uploaded subject entered data via a password 
protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the 
study  archive.
11.0 Data Quality  Assurance
Prior to the initiation of the study, a meeting will be held with AbbVie personnel, the 
investigators and appropriate site personnel.  This meeting will include a detailed 
discussion of the protocol, performance of stud y procedures, CRF, subject dosing diary , 
and specimen collection methods.  Another alternative of site training may include 
module training via a study  portal.
To ensure data integrit y and subject safet y, a stud y monitor will continuously and 
throughout the stud y, verify that all subjects sign the informed consent prior to any stud y 
specific procedures being conducted, that the protocol procedures are being followed 
appropriatel y, and that the infor mation provided in the eCRF is complete, accurate, and 
supported by  information in the source documents.
The AbbVie monitor will monitor each site throughout the study .  Source document 
review will be performed against entries on the CRF and a quality  assu rance check will be 
performed to ensure that the I nvestigator is comply ing with the protocol and regulations.
Data hand entered in the database will be verified at AbbVie.  An y discrepancies will be 
reviewed against the CRF and corrected on -line.  After completion of the entry  process, 
computer logic and manual checks will be created by  AbbVie to identify  items such as 
inconsistent study  dates.  Any  necessary  corrections will be made by  the site to the eCRF.

Routine hematology, serum chemistry  and serology ,and urinal ysis, and other tests such as 
rheumatoid factor, anti -CCP, and HBV/HCV testing, will be conducted using a central 
laboratory  (refer to Appendix Dand Appendix F).  The data from these analy ses will be 
electronically  transferred from the central laboratory  to the study  database.
Labor atory  tests including, but not limited to, urine pregnancy  testing and ESR, will be 
conducted locally  by each study  site (refer to Appendix Dand Appendix F).  Sites will 
provide AbbVie with laboratory  certifications and nor mal ranges for each local laboratory  
used.  The full name, address, phone number and fax number for each local laboratory 
will also be included.
12.0 Use of Information
Any research that may  be done using optional exploratory  research/validation samples 
from th is study  will be experimental in nature and the results will not be suitable for 
clinical decision making or patient management.  Hence, the subject will not be informed 
of individual results, should analyses be performed, nor will anyone not directly invo lved 
in this research.  Correspondingl y, researchers will have no access to subject identifiers.  
Individual results will not be reported to an yone not directly involved in this research 
other than for regulatory  purposes.  Aggregate data from optional exp loratory  
research/validation studies may be provided to investigators and used in scientific 
publications or presented at medical conventions.  Exploratory research/validation 
information will be published or presented onl y in a way that does not identify any 
individual subject.
13.0 Completion of the Study
The Investigator will conduct the study  in compliance with the protocol and complete the 
study  within the timeframe specified in the contract between the Investigator and AbbVie.  
Continuation of this study b eyond this date must be mutually  agreed upon in writing b y

Appendix C. Local Requirements
Canada
Section 5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria
10. If female of childbearing potential, subject must be practicing two forms of 
contraception (one highly  effective method combined with one effective method, 
refer to Contrac eption Recommendations for Females below) that are effective 
from Study  Day  1 through at least 150 day s after the last dose of stud y drug.
11. Male subjects who are sexually  active with female partner(s) of childbearing 
potential must agree from Study  Day  1 through 30 day s after the last dose of study  
drug to practice the protocol -specified contraception (refer to Contraception 
Recommendations for Males below).
Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 m IU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
140
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subject with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is re quired.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to use two forms of 
contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one effective 
method of contraception that are effective from Study  Day  1 (or earlier) through at least 
150 day s after the last dose of study  drug.
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal contraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estrogen and progestogen containing] oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and i mplants);
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS);
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.
●Effective methods: 
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge). 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
141
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrier method for 
contrace ption.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier" 
methods of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male 
condom with cervical cap) can be used as an effective alternative to the 
highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they can tear of become damaged.
It is important to note that contraception requirements described above are specificall y 
intended to prevent pregnancy  during exposure to the investigational therapy upadacitinib.  
The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed 
per standard of care prior to study  entry  and are allowed to be continued during the stud y.  
Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and 
that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD(s) should be based 
on the local label.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
For a male subject who has a female partner who is postmenopausal or permanently 
sterile, no contraception is required.
A male subject who is sexually  active with female partner(s) of childbearing potential 
must agree from Study  Day  1 through 30 day s after the last dose of stud y drug to practice 
contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the highly effective 
contraceptive methods as defined in the protocol for female stud y subjects of 
childbearing potential.
Additionally , male subjects must agree not to donate sperm from Study  Day  1 through 
30days after the last dose of study  drug.  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
142
Male subjects are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of becoming 
pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.  If a pregnancy  occurs, a 
partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information will be requested 
from the pregnant partner.
It is important to note that contraception and sperm donation recommendations described 
above are sp ecifically intended to prevent pregnancy during and after exposure to the 
investigational therap y upadacitinib.  The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed per standard of care prior to study entry and are 
allow ed to be continued during the stud y.  Contraception should continue while the 
subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and that duration of contraception and the 
requirement not to donate sperm after discontinuation of the csDMARD(s) should be 
based on the local label.

Section 5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the stud y at any time for an y 
reason including but not limited to disease progression or lack of response to treatment.  
The Investigator may  discontinue any  subject's participation for an y reason, including an 
AE, safet y concerns, lack of efficacy, or failure to comply with the prot ocol.  See 
Section 6.1.7 for toxicity  management criteria.
Subjects will have study  drug discontinued immediately  if any  of the following occur:
●Clinically  signific ant abnormal laboratory  results or AEs, which rule out 
continuation of the study  drug, as determined b y the Investigator or the 
AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequatel y controlled within 
2weeks by anti-infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for 
continued participation in the trial as determined by the Investigator.
●The Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject. 
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
143
●The subject requests withdrawal from the study.
● Inclusion or exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study  drug, when continuation of the study  drug would place the subject at risk 
as determined b y the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the 
study  drug would place the subject at risk, as determined by  the AbbVie 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject is non- compliant with TB proph ylaxis (if applicable) or develops 
active TB at any time during the stud y.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on stud y drug.
●Malignancy .
●Subject is significantl y non-compliant with study  procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial as determined b y the 
Investigator or the AbbVie Thera peutic Area Medical Director.
●Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation.
●Starting at Week 24 and thereafter, subject fails to show at least 20% 
improvement in both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 
2consecutive visits, despite optimization of back ground RA therapies.
In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safet y assessments, subjects who 
prematurel y discontinue study drug treatment should complete a Premature 
Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferabl y within 2 wee ks.  
Afterwards, subjects should continue to be followed for all regularl y scheduled visits, 
unless they  have decided to discontinue the study  participation entirel y (withdrawal 
informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific imp ortance of 
their data even if they  discontinue treatment with study  drug earl y.
If a subject prematurely  discontinues study  drug treatment and stud y participation 
(withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature 
Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferabl y 
within 2 weeks of stud y drug discontinuation.  In addition, if subject is willing, a 30 -day 
follow -up phone call (or visit) after the last dose of study  drug may  be completed to  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
144
ensure all treatment emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved or the occurrence of an y new 
AEs/SAEs.  Subjects who discontinue the study  prematurel y after randomization will not 
be replaced.  
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study  drug dose a nd the 
primary  reason for discontinuation of study  drug or study  participation.  The information 
will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not 
interfere with the initiation of an y new treatments or therapeutic modalit ies that the 
Investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation 
of study  drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical 
judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides t o continue participation in the study .
Section 6.1.7 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AEs of special interest consists of safet y 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safet y 
issues by  a safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of stud y drug dosing with 
appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from
study  drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is described 
below.
For subjects who discontinued study  drug but continued study  participation and are on 
standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply
(including alerts from the central lab) and an y intolerability  to standard of care therapies 
should be managed b y the prescribing ph ysician.
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection d uring and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A 
subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be closel y  
Upadacitinib
M13 -542 Protocol Amendment 6
EudraCT 2015 -003335 -35
145
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infection has been 
successfull y treated.  Subjec ts who develop active TB must be discontinued from study  
drug.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until the episode resolves.
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   If a diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed 
(other than appendicitis or penetrating injury), the subject must be permanently 
discontinued from study  drug.
Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular 
events should be carefully monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated b y 
an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner.
Thrombosis Events:   Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject 
should be discontinued from study  drug.  
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy must be discontinued from study  drug.  
Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of 
the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at 
increased ri sk for skin cancer.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 5and may  
require an appropriate supplemental eCRF to be completed.  All abnormal la boratory  tests 
that are considered clinically  significant b y the Investigator will be followed to a 
satisfactory  resolution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 5, the repeat testing must 
occur as soon as possible.

Hem oglobin If hemoglob in < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by 
repeat testing with a new sample.
If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline without an alternative 
etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with 
new sample. 
If hemogl obin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative 
etiology is known, the subject may remain on study drug at the 
investigator's discretion. 
If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value 
returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC)If confirmed < 1000 cells/µL by repeat testing with new sample, 
interrupt study drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference 
range or its baseline value.
Discontinue study drug if confirmed < 500 cells/µL by repeat testing

AST or ALT Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN 
by repeat testing with new sample and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
or an international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5.
oA separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure 
INR at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test of 
INR is not needed for determination if above toxicit y management 
critieria are met.
Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN 
by repeat testing with new sample along with appearance of fatigue, 
nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, 
and/or eosinophil ia (> 5%).
Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 8 × ULN 
by repeat testing with new sample.
Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN 
by repeat testing with new sample for more than 2 weeks.
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an 
alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically 
appropriate. If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in 
the eCRF.  If ALT or AST values return to the normal reference range or its 
Baseline value, study drug may be restarted.  If restarting study drug, 
documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe.  
If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT or 
AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is 
not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from 
study drug.
For subjects w ith HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative 
HBV DNA at screening who deve lop the following should have HBV 
DNA by PCR testing performed w ithin one week: 
oALT > 5 × ULN OR
oALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily 
identified.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will 
require immediate interruption of study drug and a hepatologist 
consultation should occur within 1 week for recommendation regarding 
subsequent treatment
For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ULN, complete supplemental 
hepatic eCRF.

Serum Creatinine If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat the 
test for serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm 
the results.  If the results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, 
then interrupt study drug and re- start study drug once serum creatinine 
returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and ≤ ULN.
If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re -
start study drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range 
or its baseline value.
For the above serum creatinine ele vation scenarios, complete supplemental 
renal eCRF.
Creatine Phosphokinase If confirmed CPK value ≥ 4 × ULN and there are no symptoms 
suggestive of myositis or rhabdomyolysis, the subjects may continue 
study drug at the investigator's discretion.
If CPK ≥4 × ULN accompanied by symptoms suggestive of myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis, interrupt study drug and inform AbbVie Therapeutic 
Area Medical Director.
For the above CPK elevation scenarios, complete supplemental CPK eCRF.

Section 5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectom y, bilateral salpi ngectomy  or hy sterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medic al cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL .
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:

AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent surgical 
sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not require d but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanen tly surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study  drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Stud y Day 1.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contr aception (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Study 
Day 1.
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation.

●Vasectomized partner(s), provided the vasectomized partner has received 
medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of 
the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD).
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True abstinence:  (if acceptable per local requirements): Applies to women of 
childbearing potential who do not have male partners and are not engaging in 
heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (periodic 
abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods] 
and wi thdrawal are not acceptable).
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the highly 
effective birth control methods listed above (exclu ding true abstinence).
If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
(defined above) and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as 
defined above are no longer required.  
It is important to not e that contraception requirements described above are specificall y 
intended to prevent pregnancy  during exposure to the investigational therapy  upadacitinib.  
The concomitant csDMARDs (i.e., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, etc.) have been prescribed 
per standard of care prior to study  entry  and are allowed to be continued during the stud y.  
Contraception should continue while the subject is on the concomitant csDMARD(s) and 
that duration of contraception after discontinuation of the csDMARD(s) should be based 
on the local label.

must agree from Study  Day  1 through 30 day s after the last dose of stud y drug to practice 
contraception with:
●Condom use and female partner(s) using at least one of the contraceptive 
measures as defined in the protocol for female study  subjects of childbearing 
potential.
Additionally , male subjects must agree not to donate sperm from Study  Day  1 through 
30days after the last dose of study  drug. 
Male subjects are responsible for informing his partner(s) of the risk of becoming 
pregnant and for reporting an y pregnancy  to the study  doctor.  If a pregnancy  occurs, a 
partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information will be requested 
from the pregnant partner.

a. If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug or prematurely discontinues study drug AND study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the proce dures outlined 
for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of stud y drug discontinuation.
b. The Baseline visit procedures will serve as the reference for all subsequent visits with the exception of the ECG, which will be obtained at Screening only and used as the 
baseline reference.
c. This visit is 30 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who complete Period 1 and do NOT enter Period 2.  A 30 -day follow -up phone call may o ccur for subjects 
who prematurely discontinue from study drug and study participation to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the oc currence of any new AEs/SAEs.
d. Informed consent should be obtained at Screening prior to performing any study related procedures.
e. Document herpes zoster and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.
f. Collect serious adverse events and protocol -related nonserious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent, prior to the first dose of study dru g.

g. At Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add concomitant use of up to 2 csD MARDs, except the combination of MTX 
and leflunomide, or may increase csDMARD dose(s).  Subjects who do not achieve CDAI ≤ 10 at Week 24 should have background medication(s) adjusted or initiated after 
assessments for Week 24 have been completed.
h. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, duration will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
i. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures TB Testing for specific requirements for TB testing and TB prophylaxis.
j. The chest x -ray will not be required if a subject had a previous n ormal chest -x-ray within 90 days of Screening, provided that all source documentation is available at the site 
(refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Chest X -Rayfor specific requirements).
k. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided al l source documentation is available.  Refer to 
Section 5.3.1.1 12-Lead ECG for additional details.
l. For subjects who do not enter Period 2 or prematurely discontinue from the study, an ECG will be performed.
m. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
n. A full physical exam is required at the visits indicated.  A symptom -directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect seru m for pregnancy test only at Screening.  If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary 
(pregnancy is an exclusion criterion).  If still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continue d lack of a posi tive result and the subject can be 
enrolled into the study.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
p. For all women of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits except Week 1 .  If urine pregnancy test (which is performed at 
the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine pregnancy test is posi tive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must permanently 
discontinue study drug.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
q. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day 1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results of 
hsCRP may unblind the treatment assignment, and the results may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting its clinical utility in the setting of a possible 
safety assessment or adverse event management.  Therefore, any local testing of hsCRP or CRP is strongly discouraged.  In Period 2, the central lab hsCRP results will remain 
blinded to Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.
r. Minimum 8 -hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting sta tus will be recorded in study source documentation.
s. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits.  A microscopic an alysis will be performed in the event the dipstick 
results show leukocytes, nit rite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.
t. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses ≥ 12 months AND has no his tory of permanent surgical sterilization 
(defined in Section 5.2.4 ).

u. If required by country regulatory authorities to confirm eligibility, subjects will be tested for antibodies to HIV at Scre ening, and it should be documented that the test has 
been performed.  This testing is to be done at a local lab.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test r esults indicate a positive HIV infection.  AbbVie will not 
receive results fro m the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
v. At Week 1 and Week 2 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood 
sample.  However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject shou ld follow the regular dosing 
schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit.
w. PK samples should be coll ected at any time during the visit.  Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule.
x. Samples only collected if subject provides written consent.
y. Refer to Section 5.2.3.1 .
z. CDAI calculation requires input of SJC + TJC (based on a 28 joint count) + PtGA + PhGA into IRT system.  At Week 24, investig ator should optimize background RA 
therapies in subjects who failed to achieve CDAI ≤ 10.
aa. Starting at Wee k 24 and thereafter, study drug should be discontinued for subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 
2consecutive visits, despite optimization of background RA therapies.  
bb. For subjects entering Period 2.
Note: Visit window is ± 3 days for Period 1.  Any of the procedures may be performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of t he Investigator.  Subjects who 
choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the study comple te a PD visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  
Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug, PK sample collection, and 
blood sample collection for optional exploratory research and validation studies.  As the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue and efficacy driven 
discontinuation criteria no longer apply (e.g., CDAI calculation at Week 24, 20%  TJC/SJC calculation for PD).

a. Every 12, 24, or 48 weeks from the Week 48 visit through Week 240 .
b. This visit is 30 days after last dose of study drug for those subjects who complete Period 2.  A 30 -day follow -up phone call may be allowed after 30 days from last dose of 
study drug for subjects who have completed PD visit to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
c. Prior to other procedures.  For morning stiffness, dura tion will be captured only if NRS rating is > 0.
d. TB testing should be performed every 48 weeks after Week 48 in subjects with previous negative TB test.  Subjects with new ev idence of latent TB should initiate 
prophylactic treatment immediately per local g uidelines.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis for additional details.
e. Obtain chest x -ray every 48 weeks after Week 48 for subjects with newly identified TB risk factors as determined by the TB risk assessment form, or for subjects living in 
areas endemic for TB, or for subjects with a newly positive TB test after baseline.

f. In addition to ECG assessments as indicated above, an ECG may be performed at any visit if deemed necessary by the Investigator.
g. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
h. A full physical exam is required every 24 weeks after Week 48.  A sy mptom -directed physical exam may be performed when necessary.
i. Starting at Week 24 and thereafter, study drug will be discontinued for subjects who fail to show at least 20% improvement in TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 
2consecutive visits, despite optimization of background RA therapies.
j. For all women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at all visits and monthly at home between s cheduled study visits.  The results of the monthly 
at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come in to the clinic and have blood drawn for a serum 
pregnancy test that will be analyzed at the central laboratory.  Pregnant subjects must permanently discontinue study drug. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures 
Pregnancy Test for additional details.
k. In Period 1, the central lab hsCRP results starting from Baseline (Day  1) will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Results of 
hsCRP may unblind the treatment assignment, and the results may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiti ng its clinical utility in the setting of a possible 
safety assessment or adverse event management.  Therefore, any local testing of hsCRP or CRP is strongly discouraged.  In Per iod 2, the central lab hsCRP results will remain 
blinded to Investigator, study site personnel, an d the subject.  Starting with Amendment 4, at a timepoint specified by the Sponsor in Period 2, central laboratory hsCRP 
results will be reported to the Investigator/study site personnel. After treatment assignment is unblinded, local hsCRP or CRP tests a re allowed.
l. Minimum 8 -hour fast.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
m. Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central lab at all requi red visits.  Specified abnormal macroscopic urinalyses defined as leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or 
blood greater than negative, or glucose greater than normal will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the central la boratory.
Note: Visit w indow  is ± 7 days for Period 2.  Any of the procedures may be performed at an unscheduled visit at the discretion of the Inve stigator.  Subjects who 
choose to discontinue study drug treatment, but continue to participate in the study, should complete a Pre mature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) as soon as 
possible, preferably within 2 weeks.  Refer to Section 5.1Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 and Period 2) for 
additional details .

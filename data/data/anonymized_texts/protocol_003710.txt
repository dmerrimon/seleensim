Novan, Inc.  
Name of Finished Product:  
SB204  
Name of Active Ingredient:  
NVN1000  
Title  A Phase 3 Multi -Center, Open Label Study Evaluating the Long Term 
Safety of SB204 Once Daily in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris  
Study Objectives  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the  safety  of SB204 4% 
in subjects with acne vulgaris for up to 40 weeks of treatment . 
Treatment 
Regimens  Eligible subjects at the Baseline visit will be assigned to SB204 QD and 
treated for up to 40 weeks to acne affected areas including the face, chest, 
back and upper shoulders .  
Formulation  Investigational Drug:   SB204, containing NVN1000 Gel and hydrogel  
Study Period  Subjects will be dosed in the study for up to 40 weeks.  
Study Design  This is a multi -center, open label long -term safety  (LTS)  study to be 
conducted in approximately 600 subjects with acne vulgaris. Subjects 
eligible to enroll in this study will have completed one of the Phase 3 
pivotal studies with SB204, NI -AC301 or NI -AC302 .  
Subjects who satisfy the entry criteria at the Base line visit will be 
enrolled to receive open -label SB204 . Investigational drug will be 
delivered from a double barrel single pump dispenser. The pump 
dispenses product (NVN1000 Gel and a hydrogel) from two chambers 
which will be mixed together quickly (abou t 5 seconds) by the subject 
and applied to the acne affected areas including the face, chest, back and 
upper shoulders once daily. No other acne treatments will be permitted 
during the study. Tolerability and safety assessments include cutaneous 
tolerabili ty evaluation, adverse event collection, physical exams 
including blood pressure and pulse rate, and urine pregnancy tests 
(UPTs). Subjects will return for post -baseline evaluation at Weeks 4, 1 2, 
24, 36 and 40.   
Diagnosis and 
Criteria for 
Inclusion /Exclusion  Male and female subjects who completed one of the two SB204 Phase 3 
pivotal studies will be eligible for participation in the study. The last visit 
in the Phase 3 pivotal study may serve as the first visit for the long -term 
safety study. Subject s must enroll in the LTS study within 7 days of 
completion of NI -AC301 or NI -AC302. Any subject who terminated 
early from one of these studies for any reason will not be eligible to enroll

Inclusion criteria:  
 Have no more t han two nodules on the face;  
 Completed 12 weeks of treatment in NI -AC301 or NI -AC302  
Exclusion Criteria:  
 Terminated early from an SB204 Phase 3 pivotal study for any 
reason;  
 Have any dermatological conditions on the face that could 
interfere with clinical  evaluations such as acne conglobata, acne 
fulminans, acne secondary to medications or other medical 
conditions, perioral dermatitis, clinically significant rosacea, or 
gram -negative folliculitis;  
 Have an on -going adverse event at the Week 12 visit for NI -
AC301 or NI -AC302 that warrants stopping study drug 
application ; 
 Have facial hair, tattoos or other facial markings that would 
interfere with efficacy and safety assessments ; 
 Have any underlying disease(s) or some other dermatological 
condition of the face  that requires the use of interfering topical or 
systemic therapy or makes evaluations and lesion count 
inconclusive;  
 Have used medications or vitamins during the 12 weeks 
immediately preceding Baseline which are reported to exacerbate 
acne (e.g. azathiopr ine, haloperidol, halogens such as iodides or 
bromides, lithium, anabolic steroids, systemic corticosteroids, 
phenytoin and phenobarbital). Daily use of a multi -vitamin is 
acceptable.  
Sample Size  Approximately 600 subjects will be entered  into the study .   
Safety and 
Tolerability  
Evaluation  Safety and tolerability assessments will be collected beginning at the 
Baseline visit for NI -AC303. The  subject must enroll in NI -AC303 
within 7 days of completion of NI -AC301 or NI -AC302 . Demographics 
and t he subject’ s Week 12 visit values from NI -AC301 or NI -AC302 for 
blood pressure, pulse, urine pregnancy test, physical exam findings, 
lesion counts and tolerability will be used as the Baseline values for NI -
AC303. Adverse events will be assessed and collected at each  evaluation 
beginning at Baseline. A brief physical exam will be collected at Week  
40/Early Termination (ET). Blood pressure and pulse will be collected 
at each visit through Week 40/ET.  Urine pregnancy tests in women of  
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  7  child -bearing potential (WOCBP) will be conducted at each visit.  
Subjects will be assessed at each visit through Week 40 for cutaneous 
tolerability on the face. Tolerability will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 
where 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe for erythema, scaling, 
dryne ss, pruritus, and burning/stinging.  
The body surface area  (BSA)  treated (based on locations) will be 
collected at each visit for each subject   Extent of exposure will be 
calculated for each subject based on the number of treatments  and 
treatment area .  Extent of exposure will also be summarized on a unit 
day which will be defined as total exposure divided by the total number 
of days enrolled.  
Endpoints  Safety endpoints will include adverse events, changes in physical 
examination and changes in vital sign measurements. Any clinically 
significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as from the 
vital sign measurements will be recorded as adverse events and 
included in the comparison. Urine pregnancy tests in women of child -
bearing potential will be  conducted at each visit.  
Tolerability  endpoin ts will include  the investigator’s assessment of 
erythema, scaling, dryness, and the subject ’s report of pruritus and 
burning/stinging based on the preceding 24 hours.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using statistical analysis 
software ( SAS®) unless otherwise stated. Safety analyses will be 
performed using the safety population.  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the 
basis of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities (MedDRA) 
terminology.  Descriptions of AEs will include the date of onset, the date 
the AE ended, the severity of the AE, the relationship to study 
medication, and th e outcome. All reported AEs that occurred on or after 
the Baseline date will be included in the summaries and analysis. 
Summaries will be presented to describe the characteristics of the 
adverse events reported and will include the number and percentage of  
subjects who report at least one AE and the number of events reported 
by severity, seriousness, and relationship to study medication. A 
summary of adverse event system organ class (SOC) and preferred terms 
(PTs) will also be presented. A subject will be c ounted only once under 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0

counted once for a specific SOC or PT under the worst severity. For the 
summary by relationship to study medication, subjects will only be 
counted once for a specifi c SOC or PT under the highest relationship.  
If multiple serious adverse events (SAEs) are reporte d, a table 
summarizing the SAEs  characteristics will be provided.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed 
by subject, detailing  verbatim given by the Investigator, preferred term, 
system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, seriousness, and 
relationship to study medication. The AE onset will also be shown 
relative (in number of days) to the day of initial dose of the open  label 
study medication. A summary of adverse events that lead to a subject’s 
discontinuation of study medication usage will also be provided.  
 
Physical Examinations  
Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as 
an AE.  
 
Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and pulse will be summarized from Baseline through 
Week 40. Additionally, change from Baseline in vital signs will be 
summarized at Weeks 4, 1 2, 24, 36 and 40.  Clinically significant changes 
from Baseline will be documented as an AE.

1.1 B ACKGROUND 
Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease characterized by open and closed comedones, papules, 
pustules, and cysts. Current acne therapies include oral and topical antibiotics, topical keratolytics, 
and oral contraceptives.  
Nitric oxide is a free radical gas naturally produced by the human body which has antimicrobial 
and anti-inflammatory activity. Novan, Inc. has developed a topical gel containing NVN1000, a 
drug which releases nitric oxide to the skin after topical application. SB204, an admixture of an 
alcoholic NVN1000 Gel with an aqueous hydrogel, is in development for the treatment of acne 
vulgaris. In randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, Phase 2 studies, treatment 
with SB204 decreased inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts and improved the 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) in subjects with acne and was well tolerated.  
To date, approximately 400 subjects have been treated with NVN1000 Gel, including SB204, and 
approximately 200 subjects have been treated with the Vehicle Gel.

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  15 1.3 NONCLINICAL STUDIES WITH NVN1000 GEL 
Novan has conducted over 30 nonclinical studies to evaluate the local safety and tolerance of 
NVN1000 (drug substance and formulated product) following dermal administration to support 
the acne development program. Repeat dose dermal toxicology studies have included 4-week and 
13-week GLP dermal toxicology studies in miniature swine, and a 13-week dermal toxicology 
stud
y in both rats and mice. A 39-week miniature swine study has completed the in-life portion; 
data from that study will be available prior to initiation of this long-term safety study. In completed 
studies in both the miniature swine and mice, doses of NVN1000 far in excess in both 
concentration and applied surface area of projected clinical doses have not demonstrated any 
significant toxicological effects. The most relevant and persistent finding has been a transient 
dermal erythema that is concentration dependent and believed to be a consequence of a vascular 
dilation, “flushing” effect. Additional safety studies in rabbits and guinea pigs showed no effects 
on acute dermal irritation or skin sensitization. As expected, due to the alcohol-based formulation, 
NVN1000 was found to be an ocular irritant. From a genotoxicity perspective, NVN1000 was 
positive in a standard in vitro AMES assay but negative in three in vivo mutagenicity assays. 
Additionally, in SEG I and II reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits, oral 
administration of NVN1000 resulting in high systemic levels of nitrate and hMAP3, a key 
structural component of NVN1000, showed the requisite maternal toxicological effects upon dose 
esc
alation as a complication of high methemoglobin concentrations, but minimal effects on fertility 
or fetal development. 
For additional information refer to the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.4 CLINICA L STUDIES WITH NVN1000 GEL 
The topical administration of NVN1000 Gel to healthy volunteers or subjects with acne vulgaris 
has generally been well-tolerated with no safety concerns identified. In nine completed clinical 
studies, approximately 400 subjects have been treated with NVN1000 Gel or SB204 and 
approximately 200 subjects have been treated with Vehicle Gel. One unrelated SAE has been 
reported and the systemic AE profile has been similar in subjects treated with active (NVN1000 
Gel or SB204) and vehicle in the acne development program. Asymptomatic, transient erythema 
has been observed in some subjects.  There have been no clinically significant changes in 
laboratory results including methemoglobin, or changes in physical examinations.  
A cross-over pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted in 18 subjects with moderate to severe 
acne. Subjects were randomized to treatment with SB204 8% or Vehicle Gel to the face, chest, 
upper back, and shoulders (~17% BSA) in two treatment periods. In this study, there was no 
detectable plasma hMAP3 (LLOQ 5 ng/ml), a component of NVN1000 and no difference in 
plasma nitrate levels in subjects treated with SB204 versus Vehicle Gel. One subject withdrew 
during
 the second dosing period due to contact dermatitis.  A 4 period, double-dummy, cross-over 
study in subjects with moderate to severe acne is ongoing to assess effects of therapeutic and 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0

n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  16 supratherapeutic doses of SB204 on ECG parameters. The thorough ECG study will be completed 
prior to dosing in the Phase 3 pivotal program.  
In the Phase 2 clinical development program, the topical application of SB204 in subjects with 
acne vulgaris resulted in significant decreases in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion 
counts and improvement in the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) when compared to vehicle. 
Once daily treatment was as effective as twice daily treatment. 
A summary of the clinical studies conducted to date in subjects with acne is in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
1.5 S UMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS 
The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris includes several mechanisms which are potential targets for 
nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has been demonstrated to inhibit several inflammatory pathways relevant 
in acne, decrease P. acnes,  and decrease sebum production. In two completed Phase 2 studies, 
SB204 4% administered in subjects with acne decreased inflammatory and non-inflammatory 
lesion counts at the end of treatment and improved IGA scores.  Once daily treatment was as 
effective as twice daily treatment. In the studies conducted to date, the systemic AE profile was 
similar between subjects treated with NVN1000 Gel, SB204, and subjects treated with Vehicle 
Gel. SB204 4% has been generally well tolerated and has not been associated with a safety or 
tolerability signal. In PK studies, there was no detectable systemic exposure to the parent 
compound, NVN1000, or changes in plasma nitrate. 
Dermal toxicology studies in mice and minipigs have demonstrated minimal evidence of toxicity 
with mild-moderate dermal changes most frequently reported. In reproductive toxicology studies, 
findings were limited to toxicities associated with high methemoglobinemia at supra-therapeutic 
doses. 
Based on the known mechanism of action of nitric oxide, theoretical risks from systemic exposure 
following topical administration of NVN1000 Gel or SB204 include hypotension and headache. 
Methemoglobin has been monitored in previous clinical studies with NVN1000 Gel and SB204 
and no significant changes in methemoglobin levels have been observed. 
Inadvertent administration to the eyes may result in ocular irritation due to the excipients and 
should be avoided. Should the product be accidently instilled in the eye(s), prompt flushing with 
copious amount of normal saline or water is recommended.  
A transient (approximately 5-10 minutes), asymptomatic erythema has been observed in some 
subjects shortly after application of NVN1000 Gel or SB204 which is a physiologic response 
(vasodilation) to local nitric oxide release. Topical application has been associated with local 
application-site reactions including erythema, scaling, dryness, and burning/stinging. These local

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  17 application-site reactions may occur due to the active agent (NVN1000) or the vehicle. In other 
development programs, local application-site reactions that led to treatment discontinuations were 
observed following application of alcoholic NVN1000 Gel or Vehicle Gel under occlusion in 
subjects with psoriasis or to the genital/perianal area in subjects with genital/perianal warts.  
Based on available data, Novan anticipates that the risks to subjects enrolling in this Phase 3 study 
a
t which the maximum strength of SB204 will be 4% once daily on up to 17% body surface area 
are minimal, and that appropriate monitoring is in place to assess safety. Some subjects may have 
a c
linical benefit in this long-term, open label study.  
2. RA TIONALE AND OBJECTIVES 
2.1 S TUDY RATIONALE 
Novan is conducting this study to evaluate the long term safety of SB204 4% administered once 
daily. Subjects will dose once daily for up to 40 weeks (280 days) with SB204 4% to acne affected 
areas. Based on the previous human safety data with SB204 at up to 8% and Vehicle Gel as well 
as the nonclinical safety data including dosing with and without hydrogel, this dose is expected to 
be safe and well tolerated. 
2.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate t he long term safety of SB204 4% once daily for 
up to 40 weeks in subjects with acne vulgaris.  
3. S TUDY DESIGN 
Figure 1 depicts the overall study design for this 40-week, open label study in subjects with acne 
vulg
aris dosed once daily with SB204 4%. Subjects must have completed participation in one of 
the 
pivotal acne trials (NI-AC301 or NI-AC302) to be eligible to participate in this long term safety 
trial. Subjects will be treated chronically or repeatedly as recommended by the Investigator for up 
to 40 weeks. The Investigator may stop treatment if the subject’s acne is in remission and re-initiate 
treatment if the subject’s acne recurs. Any subject who is determined to be clear will remain 
enrolled in the study until stud y completion or termination. The total time on study will be counted 
as the days from enrollment until the subject discontinues or the study terminates.

3.1.1 S AFETY ENDPOINTS 
Safety endpoints will include adverse events, changes in physical examination and changes in vital 
sign measurements. Any clinically significant changes noted during the physical exam as well as 
fr
om the vital sign measurements will be recorded as adverse events and included in the 
comparison. Urine pregnancy tests in women of child-bearing potential will be conducted at each 
visit. 
3.1.2 T OLERABILITY ENDPOIN TS 
The cutaneous tolerability assessments include the investigator’s assessment of erythema, scaling, 
dryness, and the subject’s report of pruritus and burning/stinging based on the preceding 24 hours. 
3.1.3 E XTENT OF EXPOSURE 
Extent of exposure will be calculated based on total number of days of study drug application 
and the body surface area treated (face, upper back, upper chest/shoulders ). 
3.1.4 E FFICACY ENDPOINTS 
Efficacy endpoints will include change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts from 
baseline at each study visit.  
3.2 S TRUCTURE 
This is a multi-center, open label study. Eligible subjects will have completed either NI-AC301 or 
NI-AC302, regardless of which treatment arm they were assigned to receive in the original study. 
3.3 DU RATION  
Subjects will be in the study for a maximum of 40 weeks; the Week 12 visit from the pivotal study 
will serve as the Baseline Visit for this study.  
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  19 3.4 DOSAGE/DOSE REGIMEN 
SB204 will be dispensed from a dual-chamber pump designed to deliver approximately equal 
amounts of NVN1000 Gel and hydrogel. NVN1000 Gel will be opaque and the hydrogel will be 
clear. The subject will instantly mix the two substances in the palm of the hand and then 
immediately massage a thin layer over the acne affected areas once daily after washing. The 
product should be mixed for about 5 seconds until thoroughly combined with a uniform opaque 
appearance then applied with the fingertips. Subjects should apply SB204 prior to bedtime.  
Up 
to 2.7 g of SB204 4% will be applied evenly over the acne affected area, including the face, 
chest, back, and upper shoulders once a day for a period of up to 40 weeks (280 days). The amount 
of 
SB204 per application will vary depending on the areas to be treated as shown in Table 1 below. 
One pump stroke (0.9 g) will be used for the face.  Application to the face, upper back and upper 
chest/shoulders will require up to 2.7 g (three (3) pump strokes).

3.5 VISI T SCHEDULE 
The Week 12 visit for the pivotal studies NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 will serve as the Baseline Visit 
for
 this long term safety study. Subjects must have completed the full 12 weeks of treatment in 
one
 of the pivotal studies to enroll in the long term safety study. Subjects may enter the long term 
safety study up to 7 calendar days after their Week 12 visit in the pivotal study. Study visits will 
take place after the first four weeks then at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 40.  
3.6 S TUDY POPULATION 
Approximately 600 healthy male and female subjects with acne vulgaris on the face, chest, 
shou
lders or back will be allowed to participate in the study if they have successfully completed 
12 weeks in either NI-AC301 or NI-AC302.   
A 
subject whose facial acne cleared during NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 is eligible to enroll if all other 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met.  If a subject enters the pivotal study at 
age 40 and is 41 at the time they complete participation in the pivotal study, they are eligible for 
the long term safety study as long as they meet all other study inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria.

ritten informed consent/assent will be obtained from all subjects before any study-related 
procedures are performed. The Investigator may discuss the study and the possibility for entry with 
a potential subject without first obtaining consent/assent. A subject wishing to participate must 
give written informed consent/assent prior to any study-related procedures being conducted.  The 
Investigator has both the ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being 
considered for inclusion in this study has been given a full explanation of the procedures and 
expectations for study participation. The Week 12 assessments for the pivotal study NI-AC301 or 
NI-AC302 should be done prior to consenting the subject for participation in this long term safety 
study.  
The site-specific informed consent and assent forms must be forwarded to Chiltern for approval 
prior to submission to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) as appropriate. Each subject will sign 
the consent form that has been approved by the same IRB responsible for protocol approval. Each 
informed consent document must adhere to the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of 
Helsinki and will include the elements required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulations in 21 CFR as well as the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable federal and local regulatory requirements. The 
consent form(s) must also include a statement that Novan, Chiltern (or their designees) and 
auditing regulatory agencies will have direct access to the subject’s records and medical history.  
Once the appropriate essential information has been provided to the subject and parent or legal 
guardian (where applicable) and fully explained by the Investigator (or a qualified designee) and 
it is felt that the subject understands the implications and risks of participating in the study, the 
IRB approved consent and assent (where applicable) document(s) shall be signed and dated by 
both the subject and parent or legal guardian (where applicable) and the person obtaining consent 
(Investigator or designee), and by any other parties required by the IRB or other regulatory 
authorities. A subject under 18 years of age (or the age of majority in their state) must sign a written 
informed assent and be accompanied by the parent or legal guardian at the time of consent/assent 
signing. If a subject becomes 18 years of age during the study, the subject must provide written 
informed consent at the next study visit to continue study participation. The subject will be given 
a copy of the signed informed consent document with the original kept on file by the Investigator.

4.1.4 DISCO NTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to determine the reason for 
discontinuation and record the reason in the subject’s study records and in the study database. If a 
subject is withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 40/Day 280 visit) and whenever possible, 
the subje
ct should be asked to return to the study center to complete the Week 40/ET evaluations. 
S
ubjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.

Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  27 If at any time during the study the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest of the 
subject to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation. The Investigator can 
discontinue a subject at any time if medically necessary. The Investigator may discontinue a 
subject’s participation if the subject has failed to follow study procedures or to keep follow-up 
appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and the study database 
regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study center for the Week 40/ET visit will be contacted by 
tele
phone to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreachable by telephone after a minimum of 
two documented attempts (one attempt on two different days), a certified letter will be sent 
requesting that the subject contact the Investigator. 
Reasons for an Investigator’s withdrawal of a subject may include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
 S afety (e.g., severe adverse reactions, pregnancy ); 
 L ack of efficacy as determined by the Investigator; 
 When the requirements of the protocol are not respected (e.g., significant issues with study 
visit compliance);  
 When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to interfere with the results of the study 
is reported, or required, by the subject (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
Chiltern, whether the subject is to be withdrawn); 
 W hen a subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator will try twice to reach the subject by 
telephone and will send a certified follow-up letter before considering that the subject is 
lost-to-follow-up. These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record and a copy 
of the follow-up letter maintained in the Investigator's file. 
Refer to Section 6.7 for a discussion of criteria for discontinuation of individual subjects from the 
study. 
All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by the Investigator 
on the subject’s study record and in the study database. In no case will a subject who has been 
assigned a study number and entered into the study be replaced by another. 
All 
Week 40/ET evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation. All 
da
ta gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to Chiltern.

4.2 T OLERABILITY ASSESSMENTS 
The evaluator will assess the subject’s face at baseline and each study visit. The cutaneous 
tolerability scores from Week 12 of NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 will be the subject’s baseline 
tolerability. The cutaneous tolerability assessment should be performed at least 30 minutes after 
study drug application. Cutaneous tolerability evaluations will include erythema, scaling, dryness, 
pruritus and burning/stinging. Pruritus and burning/stinging will be based on the subject’s report 
for the previous 24 hours. Cutaneous tolerability endpoints will not be reported as an AE unless 
they reach severe and/or result in subject’s discontinuation from the study. Subjects who develop 
intolerance to the product as defined by scores of 3 (severe) on two  or more categories of 
tolerability (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, burning/stinging) shall be discontinued from the 
study. Cutaneous tolerability assessments will be performed according to the following scales:

study will be reported as AEs at Baseline in this long-term safety study (NI-AC303) and 
followed.  The physical exam, vital signs and pregnancy test results from the Week 12 visit of 
NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 will be used as the subject’s Baseline assessments for this long term 
sa
fety study and be collected during the study. 
4.3.1 AD VERSE EVENTS 
AEs will be collected starting after the subject has signed the informed consent and completed 
any study assessment until the end of the final study visit. The date of onset, date ended, severity, 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  30 relationship to study drug, therapy required, and action taken regarding study drug and study 
participation will be reported for each AE.  
See Section 6 for additional information regarding the evaluation of adverse events. 
4.3.2 P HYSICAL EXAM 
A brief physical exam will be performed at Week 40/ET. If clinically significant changes in the 
ph
ysical examination from Baseline are noted at the Week 40/ET visit, these will be recorded as 
a
dverse events.  
4.3.3 VITAL  SIGNS  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be collected at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 40/ET. Any clinically 
sig
nificant changes in vital signs from Baseline will be recorded as adverse events whether or not 
drug related. 
4.3.4 P REGNANCY TESTING 
All WOCBP must have a UPT at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 40/ET and if the result is positive, the 
subj
ect will not be allowed to continue in the study. Refer to Section 6.4 for further information. 
4.4 E FFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
The same evaluator should perform lesion counting at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 40/ET. This should 
be
 the same evaluator that performed the Week 12 assessments for the NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 
study. In the event that this is not possible due to unforeseen circumstances, a different evaluator 
may evaluate the subject. However, the same evaluator should evaluate subjects at the Baseline 
and Week 40/ET evaluations. The subject’s Week 12 lesion counts from NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 
will
 be considered the Baseline value for this study. 
4.4.1 L ESION COUNTS 
The facial area lesion counts will be taken from the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and nose. 
The lesion count groups will be inflammatory and non-inflammatory. Facial inflammatory lesions 
(pustules, papules, nodules and cysts) will be counted and recorded. Non-inflammatory lesions 
(open and closed comedones) will be counted and recorded.   The following are definitions of each 
lesion type:  
Inflammatory lesions are defined as follows: 
 
Papule –A small, superficial, circumscribed, palpable lesion elevated above the skin surface, less 
than 10 mm i
n diameter

epidermis  
Nodu
le –A firm (indurated) lesion greater than 10 mm in diameter and that is thicker or deeper 
than the
 average papule  
Cyst  - Spherical swelling that contains fluid or semisolid material 
 
Non
-inflammatory lesions are defined as follows: 
 
Open comedones (blackhead) –Plugged  follicular units with brown/black central debris  
Close
d comedones  (whitehead) –Plugged follicular units with white central debris 
4.5 S CREEN FAILURES 
A screen failure subject will be a person from whom informed consent is obtained but who does 
not meet the study eligibility requirements. Subjects will not be allowed to rescreen. 
4.6 P ROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
This study will be conducted as described in this protocol, except for an emergency situation in 
which the protection, safety, and well-being of the subject requires immediate intervention, based 
on the judgment of the Investigator (or a responsible, appropriately trained professional designated 
by the Investigator). In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, 
accident, or mistake, the Investigator or designee must contac t Chiltern at the earliest possible time 
by telephone. 
5. P ROHIBITED THERAPIES AND MEDICATIONS 
Concomitant medications are any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) preparations. Use of 
concomitant medications will be recorded on the concomitant medications study record and study 
database beginning at the Baseline Visit until the final evaluation (Week 40/ET).  
S
ubjects will be permitted to apply non-comedogenic moisturizer or sunscreen on an as-needed 
basis. Moisturizer must not contain antibacterials and the subject must not change moisturizer 
and/or sunscreen used during the course of the study. If used, moisturizers and sunscreen must be 
applied at least 30 minutes after study drug application. 
Subjects must not have used anti-acne treatments including topical or systemic antibiotics or 
retinoids as described in Section 3.7.3 prior to Baseline. These medications are also prohibited 
during
 the trial. Short term courses of antibiotics (≤ 14 days) for non-acne related illnesses and 
inhaled or intranasal steroids are permitted during the trial.

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  32 Subjects may not be concurrently on drugs associated with exacerbating acne vulgaris (Appendix 
16.1). Subjects must not participate in a different interventional research study during the study 
pe
riod.  
An
y medication/therapy used by the subject following first application of study product will be 
considered a concomitant medication/therapy (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen, birth control pills, 
vitamins, etc.).  Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication/therapy dosing 
c
onstant during the study. Any change to concomitant medications/therapies should be noted on 
the 
subject’s study record and in the study database. When applicable, an AE should be completed 
for
 any subject starting a concomitant medication/therapy after enrollment into the study. 
6. E VALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.1 DEF INITIONS 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury or 
accident) whether or not considered drug related. Any AE that emerges or worsens following 
administration of the informed consent and until the end of study participation will be collected. 
A 
pre-existing condition is one that is present prior to the start of the study and is to be reported as 
part of the subject’s medical history unless it began as an AE in NI-AC301 or NI-AC302. Adverse 
events that began during NI-AC301 or NI-AC302 that are ongoing at the conclusion of either study 
will be reported as AEs at Baseline in this long-term safety study (NI-AC303) and followed.  Prior 
conditions should be reported as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study or if the condition persists. 
An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any event, if in the view of either the investigator or the 
Me
dical Monitor results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 Life-threatening event (i.e., the subject was, in the opinion of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe) 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in a substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions) 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization (i.e., the AE required at least 
a 24-hour in-patient hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  33 length of stay; hospitalizations for elective medical/surgical procedures, scheduled 
treatments, or routine check-ups are not SAEs by this criterion) 
 C ongenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to the molecule or investigational product before conception or during pregnancy) 
 Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is 
a significant or important medical event) 
6.1.1 AD VERSE EVENT SEVERITY GRADES 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determining the severity of the event.  
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions: 
 Mil d:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require intervention.  
 Moderate: Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance 
of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed. 
 Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed.  
The
 Investigator will follow all subjects who experience AEs until there is a return to the subject’s 
baseline condition or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved or the subject is lost to 
follow-up. 
6.1.2 INV ESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT CAUSALITY 
Relationship of an AE to investigational product will be assessed as follows: 
 De finite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of investigational product; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product and recurs with re-administration of investigational product. 
 P robable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of investigational product; the AE is unlikely to be caused by the 
concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures. 
 Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the 
onset of the AE and the application of investigational product and a cause cannot be ruled 
out. 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  34  Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by the subject's clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the Subject. 
 Unr elated:  This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
re
lated to study participation. 
6.2 REP ORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
For the purpose of AE reporting the trial period is defined as the period after the subject signs the 
informed consent/assent to the end of subject’s last visit. 
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs. In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non-leading question:  
“How have you felt since your last visit? ” All AEs (serious and non-serious) reported by the subject 
must be recorded on the subject’s study record and entered into the study database. 
In addition, Chiltern must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by telephone or email of any immediately reportable events according to the procedure outlined 
below. Special attention should be paid to recording hospitalizations and concomitant therapies 
and medications. 
6.3 IMMEDIATELY REPORTABLE EVENTS 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are considered immediately reportable events. Any SAE, whether 
de
emed drug-related or not, must be reported to Chiltern telephone, fax, or email as soon as 
possible after the Investigator or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence. The 
Investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Form and email it to 
Chiltern within 24 hours of notification of the event. When appropriate, Novan will notify the 
appropriate regulatory body of drug related Serious Adverse Events.

medical personnel who assisted in subject’s treatment and follow-up and document as 
appropriate. 
4. P rovide a more detailed report to both Chiltern and the IRB, if applicable, no later than 
se
ven days after the Investigator discovers the event as further information becomes 
available, and when necessary update the information with follow-up information 
including outcomes. This report should include a statement as to whether the event was 
or was not related to the use of investigational product. 
5. The  Investigator will notify the IRB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific IRB 
requirements. 
6. The Investigator will collect information on SAEs until the subject’s health has returned to 
baseline status, until all parameters have returned to normal, or remaining health issues 
have otherwise been explained. 
6.4 P REGNANCY 
Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective method of birth control during 
the course of the study and for 30 days following their final study visit. Allowable methods of birth 
control include stabilized on oral contraceptive for at least three months (90 days), IUD, condom 
with 
spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, implant, NuvaRing®, injection, transdermal patch 
or abstinence with a documented second acceptable method of birth control should the subject 
become sexually active. Females taking hormonal contraceptives must have taken the same type 
for at least three months (90 days) prior to entering the study and must not change type during the 
study. Those who have used birth control pills or hormonal contraception in the past and stopped 
must have discontinued usage at least three months (90 days) prior to the start of the study. 
A 
female is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is post-menopausal (no menses 
for 24 consecutive months), surgically sterilized, or without a uterus and/or both ovaries. 
Premenarchal females are considered to be of childbearing potential. 
 
Before enrolling any subject in this clinical trial, the Investigator must review guidelines about 
study participation including the topics below: 
 I nformed consent document 
 Pregnancy prevention information 
 Risks to unborn child(ren) 
 Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives 
 Contraceptives in current use 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  36  Guidelines for the follow-up of a reported pregnancy 
Prior to study enrollment, all subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent document stating that the above-mentioned 
risk factors and the consequences were discussed. 
During the study, WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately if they 
suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigator must 
immediately notify Chiltern of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time during study 
participation, record the information on the Pregnancy Notification Form and email/fax the form 
to Chiltern. Subjects found to be pregnant prior to Week 40 will be discontinued from the study. 
C
hiltern will ask the site to follow-up with the subject periodically during the pregnancy for 
ongoing health and safety information through term, as applicable. Protocol-required procedures 
for the Week 40/ET evaluation must be performed for the subject. 
6.5 F OLLOW-UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
6.5.1 F OLLOW-UP OF NON-SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
Non-serious AEs that are not resolved at the time of the last scheduled study visit (Week 40/ET) 
must
 be recorded in the study database as ongoing/not recovered/not resolved. 
6.5.2 F OLLOW-UP OF POST STUDY SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last scheduled contact (Week 40/ET) must be 
re
corded in the study database and reported to Chiltern according to the reporting procedures 
outlined in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new 
SAEs. The Investigator should follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is 
lost to follow-up. The Investigator should continue to report any significant follow-up information 
to Chiltern and the IRB up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject 
has returned to the baseline state of health, or the Investigator does not expect any further 
improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition. 
Any new SAEs reported by the subject to the Investigator that occur after the last scheduled contact 
and are determined by the Investigator to be reasonably associated with the application of 
investigational product should be reported to Chiltern and the IRB. 
6.6 OVE RDOSAGE 
There is no specific antidote for nitric oxide. In the event of an overdose, best supportive care 
should be utilized. Methylene blue may be used to treat subjects exhibiting methemoglobinemia.

7.5.1 AD VERSE EVENTS 
All AEs that occur during the study or continue after enrollment into this study will be recorded 
and classified on the basis of MedDRA terminology. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
are defined as AEs reported on or after the first day of enrollment in this long term safety study. 
All 
information pertaining to an AE noted during the study will be listed by subject, detailing 
verbatim term given by the PI or designee, preferred term, system organ class (SOC), onset date, 
resolution date, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset 
will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first dose in this study. 
Tr
eatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by the number of subjects reporting a TEAE, SOC, 
preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and seriousness. When 
summarizing AEs by severity and relationship, each subject will be counted only once within a 
system organ class or a preferred term by using the event with the highest severity and greatest 
relationship within each classification. 
Adverse events will also be summarized by windows of exposure to study drug.  The windows 
will include but are not limited to: 1) within the first 24 hours of exposure, 2) up to 1 month of 
exposure, 3) up to 3 months of exposure, 4) up to 6 months of exposure and 5) up to 12 months of 
exposure. 
AEs will also be summarized based on extent of exposure as described in Section 7.7 
Serious AEs will be summarized by severity, and relationship to study drug, and individual SAEs 
will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study 
due to an AE will be provided. 
7.5.2 P HYSICAL EXAMINATION 
Any clinically significant changes from Baseline will be documented as an AE.

Distribution and shift in cutaneous tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, 
burning/stinging) will be summarized from Baseline to Week 40. 
7.7 E XTENT OF EXPOSURE 
Extent of exposure will be based on days of treatment and the body surface area treated (face, 
upper back, and/or upper chest/shoulders ) as collected at each visit for each subject. AEs will also 
be summarized by extent of exposure to determine if there is a safety signal due to duration of 
e
xposure or total body area exposed. 
7.8 E FFICACY ANALYSIS  
Lesion counts will be summarized at each evaluation from Baseline through Week 40. Absolute 
and percent change in lesion counts will be summarized at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36 and 40. 
7.9 S AMPLE SIZE AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS 
Approximately 600 subjects who completed treatment in either the NI-AC301 or NI- AC302 will 
be enrolled into the study from approximately 100 sites in North America. The main objective of 
this study is to evaluate the long term safety of SB204, therefore, no sample size or power 
calculations were performed. 
8. INV ESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 
8.1 RECEI PT OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
Novan, or designee, will provide all investigational products to the study sites. 
8.2 S TORAGE OF INVESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT  
Upon receipt from Novan, or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study supplies 
in a temperature-controlled area. The pumps should be refrigerated (2-8 °C). Access to study 
supplies should be strictly limited to the study staff. Neither the Investigator nor any member of 
the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies to any person not participating in this study. 
If a study staff member becomes aware that the study supplies have not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt), the Chiltern CRA or designee 
must be contacted immediately. In such an event, study supplies should be quarantined and not be 
administered to any subject until Novan provides further direction. 
The investigational product will be dispensed at the discretion and by the direction of the 
Investigator in accordance with the conditions specified in this protocol. It is the Investigator’s 
Protocol NI- AC303  Version 1.0 
Nova
n, Inc.   09 November 2015 
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  40 responsibility to ensure that accurate records of investigational product issuance and return are 
maintained. 
It is expected that the site staff will maintain refrigerator temperature logs in the investigational 
product storage area, recording the temperature at least once each working day. Excursions in 
temperature during storage should be discussed with the Chiltern CRA or designee immediately 
and study supplies should be quarantined and not administered until Novan provides approval for 
use. Other supplies will be stored at room temperature. 
8.3 T REATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING 
Subjects will receive open label SB204 4%. The evaluator and subject will be not be blinded to 
the subject’s treatment.  
8.4 INV ESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY 
A trained study staff member will maintain an inventory of investigational product components.  
This will include: 
 Da tes and initials of person designated as responsible for the inventory of the 
investigational product 
 Amount received including date 
 Amount currently in refrigerator, 2-8 °C storage 
 P umps dispensed to each subject, identified at a minimum by a unique subject number 
 Amount transferred to another location within the study site or destroyed; this should not 
occur without prior notification to Chiltern 
 Non-study disposition (e.g., wasted, broken) 
 Amount returned to Novan ’s designee, if applicable 
 Amount destro yed, if applicable 
All investigational product accountability forms and treatment logs must be retained in the 
Investigator’s permanent study file. These records must be available for inspection by Novan and 
Chiltern, their designees, or regulatory agencies at any time. 
8.5 RET URNS AND DESTRUCTION 
Upon completion or termination of the study, the site will be instructed on return or destruction of 
clinical supplies.

9.1 DA TA COLLECTION 
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the data management plan. 
S
ource study records will be collected for each study subject and a study database will be 
maintained for all enrolled study subjects. Screen failures will not be entered in the electronic data 
c
apture (EDC) system. 
Novan requires that the study database be verifiable with the subject’s source study record. This 
requirement necessitates access to all original recordings and other records for each subject. The 
Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source data must be 
made available for all study data. Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also allow access 
to the subject’s medical records. Subjects will be informed of the importance of increased record 
access and permission granted by signature on the informed consent document prior to any study 
procedures being performed. 
Before the study database is formally submitted to Novan, the study monitor, Chiltern Medical 
Monitor or Novan staff may request copies of the subject’s source study record for preliminary 
medical review. 
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source documents for every subject participating 
in the clinical study. These records must includ e: 
 Na me Contact information 
 Da te of birth 
 Sex 
 Medical history 
 C oncomitant diseases 
 Concomitant therapies/medication 
 Study visit dates 
 Performed examinations, evaluations, and clinical findings 
 Investigational product administration 
 AE s, SAEs, or pregnancy (as applicable) 
Additionally, any other documents with source data must be included in the subject’s source 
documents and must include the subject’s initials, study number and the date of the evaluation.

Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent 
process in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements. Subjects who deny permission to 
use and disclose protected health information will not be eligible to participate in the study. The 
Investigator will ensure that the study records and any other documents forwarded to Chiltern 
contain no mention of subject names. 
Any amendments and corrections necessary will be undertaken in both the study records and the 
study database. 
Regulatory authorities, Investigational Review Boards, Novan, and Chiltern may request access to 
all study records and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection. The Investigator 
must guarantee direct access to these documents. The original set of study records will be kept by 
the site or an authorized designee in a secured area. Clinical data will be recorded in an electronic 
format for subsequent statistical analyses. Data files will be stored on electronic media with a final 
master data file kept by Novan after descriptive and statistical analyses and reports have been 
generated and are complete. 
9.2 F ILE MANAGEMENT AT THE STUDY SITE 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the study center file is maintained in 
accordance with Section 8 – Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial of the ICH 
Guidance for Industry E6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and 21 CFR Part 312. 
9.3 RECORD S RETENTION AT THE STUDY SITE 
It is a Novan requirement that all Investigators participating in clinical studies maintain detailed 
clinical data for one of the following periods, whichever is longest: 
 C ountry-specific requirements; or 
 A period of at least two years following the last approval of a marketing application 
approved by a Regulatory Authority in an ICH region or until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, 
 A period of two years after Novan notifies the Investigator that the data will not be 
submitted for review by any Regulatory Authority. 
The Investigator must not dispose of any records or essential documents relevant to this study 
without either (1) written permission from Novan, or (2) providing an opportunity for Novan to 
collect such records. The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and 
accurate electronic or hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during 
this study. Such documentation is subject to inspection by Novan or their designees and relevant

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  43 regulatory agencies. If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), all 
study-related records should be transferred to a mutually agreed-upon designee. Notice of such 
transfer will be provided to Novan in writing. 
10. M ONITORING, COMPLIANCE, AND QUALITY 
All aspects of the study will be monitored by Chiltern according to Good Clinical Practices and 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable government regulations, 
(i.e., informed consent regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and Institutional Review Board 
regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981)). Access to all records, both during the trial and after trial 
completion, should be made available to Chiltern at any time for review and audit to ensure the 
integrity of the data. The Investigator must notify Chiltern immediately if the responsible IRB has 
been disqualified or if proceedings leading to disqualification have begun. 
The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and in compliance 
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the 
protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times. If data 
is not recorded per protocol, the reason(s) must be clearly documented on the study records. 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a Novan or 
C
hiltern representative will review the protocol and study records with the Investigator(s) and their 
staff. During the study, the Chiltern study monitor will visit the site regularly to check the 
completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database, the adherence to 
the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, to ensure that consent is being sought and 
obtained in compliance with applicable regulations, and that the investigational product is being 
stored, dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The Investigator and key trial 
personnel must be available to assist the monitor during these visits. 
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospital or clinical records to confirm 
their consistency with the study database entries. No information in these records about the identity 
of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require full verification for the 
presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
SAEs and the recording of safety variables. A reduced source data verification model will be 
deployed for this study in order to focus on the critical data for analysis and this will be executed 
per the study specific monitoring plan. Additional checks of the consistency of the study records 
with the study database will be performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. 
The Investigator or designee must promptly enter the data into the study database after the subject’s 
visit. The monitor is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries. 
A copy of the study records will be retained by the Investigator who must ensure that it is stored

Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.  44 in a secure place with other study documents, such as the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure and 
any protocol amendments. 
The Investigator must provide Chiltern and the responsible IRB with a study summary shortly after 
study completion. 
10.1  QUALITY ASSURANCE AUDITS AND QUALITY CONTROL 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, audits of clinical research activities in accordance 
with SOPs may be performed to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP. A regulatory 
authority may also wish to conduct an inspection (during the study or even after its completion). 
If a regulatory authority requests an inspection, the Investigator must inform Chiltern immediately 
that this request has been made. 
Study conduct may be assessed during the course of the study by a Quality Assurance 
representative(s) to ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with the protocol and GCP. 
He
/she will be permitted to inspect the study documents (study protocol, study records, 
investigational product, original, study-relevant medical records). All subject data will be treated 
confidentially.  
11. E THICS AND RESPONSIBILITY 
This study must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ICH Guidance for Industry E6 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance and the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Investigator must submit all essential regulatory documentation, as required by local and national 
regulations (including approval of the protocol and informed consent/assent form by an IRB) to 
Chiltern before investigational product will be shipped to the study site. The Investigator will 
review the final study results to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately describes 
the conduct and results of the study.  
12. CONF IDENTIALITY 
All information generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission 
from Novan. Authorized regulatory officials, Novan and Chiltern personnel (or their 
representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records. All study 
investigational products, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely 
in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Novan. 
Subjects will be identified at a minimum by unique subject numbers in the study database.

Only Novan may modify the protocol. Amendments may be approved by all applicable national 
and local committees including, but not limited to, the government regulatory authorities and/or 
regional IRB before implementation. The only exception is when an Investigator considers that a 
subject may be harmed and immediate action is necessary. Under these circumstances, approval 
of the chairman of the IRB, or an authorized designee must be sought immediately. The 
Investigator should inform Chiltern and the full IRB no later than five working days after the 
emergency occurs. Protocol-specified safety reporting requirements must be adhered to 
independent of any other variables. All amendments that have an impact on subject risk, the study 
objectives or that require revision of the informed consent document must be approved by the IRB 
before implementation. Administrative changes to the protocol and/or changes that do not impact 
subject safety, risk or comfort may be implemented prior to IRB approval if local institutional 
policy permits. A copy of the written approval of the IRB, which becomes part of the essential 
study documents file, must be given to the study monitor. Examples of amendments requiring such 
approval are: 
 A sig nificant change in the study design 
 An increase in the number of invasive procedures to which subjects are exposed 
 An addition or deletion of a test procedure 
The Principal Investigator at each study site must sign the Investigator’s Agreement page of the 
amended protocol. 
14. USE  OF INFORMATION AND PUBLICATION 
It is understood by the Investigator that the information generated in this study will be used by 
Novan in connection with the development of the product and therefore may be disclosed to 
government agencies in various countries. To allow for the use of information derived from the 
study, it is understood that the Investigator is obliged to provide Novan with complete test results, 
all study data and access to all study records. 
Investigators may not report the results of this clinical study in any publication, poster or other 
public forum without express authorization from Novan.

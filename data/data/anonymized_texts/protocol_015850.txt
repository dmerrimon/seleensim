Alcon – Business Use Only  3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study Rationale and Purpose  
The new contact lens in development is intended for the optical correction of refractive 
ametropia in persons with non -diseased eyes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
performance of two commercially availabl e daily wear frequent replacement silicone 
hydrogel soft contact lenses as compared to investigational test product  (LID018869) to 
obtain on -eye performance data   
The primary endpoint was selected to address the prima ry objective of the study. Procedures 
for measurement of these endpoints were selected based on common practice for these 
assessments.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2 Trial Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall performance of an 
investigational silicone hydrogel lens when compared to AOHP .  
 
  
3.3 Risks and Benefits  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing  
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development  
are features consistent with successful contact lens wear.

AOHP co ntact lenses are commercially available for daily wear use under a biweekly 
replacement schedule;  Biofinity  contact lenses are commercially available for daily wear use 
under a monthly  replacement schedule; further details on any known potential risks and 
benefits can be found in the package insert. Refer to Appendix 13.1 and Appendix 13.2 . 
The site personnel will educate subjects on proper hygiene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be  instructed not to 
wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming . The site personnel will also advise the 
subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prompt follow -up of symptoms, such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing , vision changes, or hyperemia.  
3.4 Subject Population  
The study population  for Part A and Part B each includes approximately 66 volunteer 
subjects to be enrolled at approximately 4 sites, with approximately 1 6-18 subjects enrolled 
per site. The study population  will consist of subjects with normal eyes (other than the need 
for optical correction for myopia), who are adapted, existing wearers of soft contact lenses in 
both eyes.

obtaining consent from the subject and a witness, if applicable, sign and date the 
informed  consent document. Provide a photocopy of the signed document to the 
subject and place the original signed document in the subject’s chart. After signing 
the ICF, a subject will be assigned a subject number by the EDC system . A signed 
informed consent docu ment defines the point of enrollment.

In addition, all procedures for Visit 5 (Follow -up/Exit) should be completed (as possible).The 
Investigator may perform additional procedures for proper diagnosis and treatment of the 
subject. The Investigator must document this information in the subject ’s case history source

6 ANALYSIS PLAN  
Part A and Part B will be summari zed and presented separately.  
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with 
counts and percentages from each category.  
Any deviations to this analysis plan will be updated during the course of the study as part of a 
protocol amendment or will be detailed in the clinical study report.  
6.1 Subject Evaluability  
The final subject evaluability for Part A will be determined prior to breaking the code for 
masked treatment (lens) sequence assignment and  locking the respective subject data , based 
on the Deviations and Evaluability Plan  (DEP) . 
Similarly, final subject evaluability for Part B will be determined prior to locking the 
database , based on the DEP.

6.2.1 Safety Analysis Set  
Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set on a treatment -emergent basis. 
As such, t he safety analysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any study lenses  
evaluated i n this study. For treatment -emergent safety analyses, subjects/eyes will be 
categorized under the actual study lenses  exposed.  
6.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, race) will be summarized on the Safety 
Analysis Set. Baseline data pertaining to habitual lens (lens brand, lens care brand)  
 will be summarized on the Safety Analysis Set as well.  
6.4 Effectiveness Analyses  
This study defines one primary endpoint . The Safety 
Analysis Set will be used for all effectiveness analyses.  
6.4.1 Primary Effectiveness  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall performance of an 
investigational silicone hydrogel lens when compared to AOHP. The prima ry endpoint is 
distance VA with study lenses, collected in logMAR, for each eye.  
6.4.1.1  Statistical Hypotheses  
No inferences are to be made on the primary effectiveness endpoint; therefore, no hypotheses 
are formulated.  
6.4.1.2  Analysis Methods  
Descriptive statistics wil l be presented.

for missing values will be carried out for the primary analysis.  
6.7 Multiplicit y 
No multiplicity adjustment needs to be considered for the effectiveness endpoints since no 
formal hypothesis testing will be conducted.  
6.8 Safety Analysis

Effect  Serious ADE  which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome 
has been identified in the risk management file.  
Device Deficiency  Inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Note: This definition 
includes malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
Malfunction  Failure of a medical device to meet its pe rformance specifications 
or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications 
include all claims made in the labeling of the device. The intended 
performance of the device refers to the intended use for which the 
device is labeled or marketed.  
Non-serious Adverse 
Event  AE that does not meet the criteria for a n SAE . 
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  AE that led to any of the following:  
• Death.  
• A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either 
resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, ie, it 
does not include an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
b) any potentially sigh t-threatening event or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition,

complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is serio us. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization ” occurred, the event  should be 
considered serious.  
d) a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).  
e) any indirect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic 
test results when used within manufacturer ’s instructions 
for use.

contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks.  
Refer to Section 7.1 for additional Significant Non -Serious AEs.  
Unanticip ated 
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect  Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, 
severity or outcome has not been identified in the risk management 
file. 
Use Error  Act or omission of an act that results in a different medical device 
respon se than intended by manufacturer or expected by user.  
Note: This definition includes slips, lapses, and mistakes. An

7.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention a ny 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
Additionally, c hanges  in any protocol -specific parameters  and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by the Investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the Investigator, is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.

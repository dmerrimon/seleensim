 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE  
 
This document is a protocol for a clinical research study spons ored by Masimo Corporation.  The study will be 
conducted in compliance with all stipulations of this protocol,  the conditions of IRB approval, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 
CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part 812, ISO-14155, and International Conf erence on Harmonisation E6 Good Clinical 
Practice (ICH GCP). 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval.  Appr oval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by 
the IRB before the changes are implemented to the study.   
1. PURPOSE  
 
The objective of this study is to assess INVSENSOR00027’s clini cal performance for detection of a subject’s 
position and posture in bed, subject’s activity (sitting, stand ing, etc.) along with heart rate and respiratory rate. 
Only noninvasive sensors and corresponding devices will be empl oyed to collect data from healthy volunteers 
in this study. 
 
This is a nonrandomized single arm study where all of the subje cts are enrolled into the experimental arm and 
will receive the INVSENSOR00027 device on their chest or back, along with a RAM (Rainbow Acoustic 
Monitoring) sensor on their neck, a pulse oximeter on their fin ger, and a nasal cannula which will be attached 
to the capnography device.    
 
Outcome Measure: Assess the clinical performance of the detecti on of position, posture and activity through 
comparing INVSENSOR00027 measurements to observer’s notes. Asse ss INVSENSOR00027’s heart rate 
and respiratory rate measurements through comparison with those  from Masimo SET pulse oximeter and 
RAM.  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
Masimo Corporation develops non-invasive medical technologies. These devices have applications in the 
operating room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency t ransport vehicles, as well as physician’s 
offices.  
2.1. Background and Rationale     
People with the most risk of developing bedsores are those with  a medical condition that limits their 
ability to change positions, requires them to use a wheelchair or confines them to a bed for a long 
time. 
Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat. Automated detection of patients’ 
position can help medical staff monitor position to time and op timize interventions.  Masimo has 
developed a new noninvasive sensor named INVSENSOR00027 as a de vice to aid in preventing 
hospital-acquired pressure injury or worsening of existing pres sure injury by monitoring patient 
movement, position, and orientation. The sensor is also able to  detect falls through the same 
monitoring features. This type of monitoring may be effective i n reducing the debilitating conditions 
for patients and their duration of stay in hospitals, especiall y in the patient population vulnerable to 
pressure and/or fall related injuries.  
Each year over 2.5 million individuals in the U.S. develop a pr essure injury [1]. Pressure injuries are 
painful, debilitating and are usually avoidable. Routine reposi tioning relieves and redistributes

 pressure over bony prominences; it is a recommended procedure t o help mitigate the risks for 
developing a pressure injury [2]. The INVSENSOR00027 device, th rough detection of patient 
position, is a modality to ensure repositioning occurs routinel y.  
As many as 1 million Americans fall in the hospital every year.  Falls result in fractures, lacerations, 
bleeding and even death. Current practices to prevent falls inc lude assessment of patient risk, 
scheduled rounding practices and patient specific interventions  to prevent falls [3]. The 
INVSENSOR00027 device is proposed to supplement current practic es with a unique modality to 
assess risk for fall based on patient position. 
The INVSENSOR00027 system consists of a wearable, battery-opera ted, adhesive sensor and a 
back-end user interface and display at the patient bedside as w ell as a central location (e.g., nursing 
station). The sensor contains sensing elements (accelerometers,  gyroscopes), processor, and a blue-
tooth communication chip (BTLE 2.4 GHz). An algorithm processes  three-dimensional acceleration 
and rotation information and calculates the patient’s relative position and fall, heart rate and 
respiration rate as its key parameters. Position related parame ters are then combined over a given 
time period to compute trend and potential risk for pressure in jury. The system can generate alarms 
configured for adverse events related to patient posture, stres s level for pressure injury and detected 
fall events.

 9. DATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURE TO BE USED 
9.1. For each subject’s position detection, INVSENSOR00027 output wi ll be compared against 
observer’s notes at each turn of the subject. 
9.2. Correctly detected position changes will be marked as True Posi tive.  
9.3. Missed detections (if any) will be counted. 
9.4. Combining the two, sensitivity of INVSENSOR00027’s posture chan ge detection will be computed 
as Sensitivity = True Positive/(True Positive + Missed Detectio n) 
9.5. From the INVSENSOR00027’s output, all false positives will be c ounted, i.e., when a turn is 
indicated by INVSENSOR00027 but the observer’s notes do not agr ee with that. These will present 
a measure of specificity of the device. 
9.6. Heart rate readings from INVSENSOR00027 will be compared agains t reference pulse-rates to 
compute mean and standard deviation of the differences. 
9.7. Respiration rate readings from INVSENSOR00027 will be compared against reference respiration 
rate to compute mean and standard deviation of the differences.  
9.8. Expected Dropout Rates: Subjects may not complete the study for  various reasons, such as a clinical 
screening test failure, at the Principal Investigator’s discret ion, or because the subject does not want 
to continue the study. Expected dropout rate for this study is approximately 0% of the total number 
of subjects enrolled.  
10. ADVERSE EVENTS

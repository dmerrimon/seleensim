1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONAL E 
 
1.1 Gastric Cancer  
 Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy, and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
1 Currently, platinum -based and fluoropyrimidine -based 
combinations are accepted worldwide as established first- line drug regimens fo r advanced 
gastric adenocarcinoma, with a median survival ranging from 8 months to 10 months.2 
Selected second -line chemotherapy including docetaxel and irinotecan improved overall 
survival compared with best supportive care in randomized trials, however median survival remained dismally poor at less than 6 months.
3-5 Newer, more active second line systemic 
therapy options are needed.  
 
1.2 VEGF in Gastric Cancer 
 
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor -2 (VEGFR -2)-mediated 
signaling and angiogenesis contribute to the pathogenesis of ga stric cancer. In patients with 
gastric cancer, circulating VEGF levels are associated with increased tumor aggressiveness 
and reduced survival.6,7 In animal models of gastric adenocarcinoma, VEGFR -2 inhibition 
reduced tumor growth and vascularity.8 Ramucirumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
VEGFR -2 antagonist, prevents ligand binding and receptor -mediated pathway activation in 
endothelial cells.9  
 
1.3 Chemotherapy for Metastatic Gastric Cancer  
 
Ramucirumab monotherapy has shown overall survival benefit after first -line chemotherapy 
in advanced gastric cancer.10 Second -line treatment with ramucirumab plus paclitaxel after 
progression on frontline chemotherapy ( platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without an 
anthracycline) showed an improvement in overall survival to more than 9 months in patients 
with metastatic gastric or gastro -esophageal junction cancer.11 This is now being regarded 
as a new standard in second -line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.  
 
Despite these advances, many patients may be unable to receive this combination due to 
prior taxane exposure, as taxane containing regimens are a standard option as first line therapy.
12 Additionally, peripheral neuropathy after frontline platinum -based chemotherapy, 
may preclude patients from receiving paclitaxel in the second line setting, or can significantly worsen with paclitaxel leading to early discontinuation. Mos t platinum 
containing gastric cancer regimens have reported very high rates of peripheral neuropathy. In the REAL -2 (Randomized ECF for Advanced and Locally Advanced Esophagogastric 
Cancer 2) phase III trial, peripheral neuropathy (all grades) was seen in 30- 36% patients in 
cisplatin arms and 80- 84% patients in oxaliplatin arms.
13 Similarly, neurosensory toxicity 
was fairly common (all grades: 62.5%, grade 3 or 4: 14.3%) with oxaliplatin and 5-
fluorouracil/leucovorin use in the first line setting.14 In a large meta- analysis, p latinum based 
therapy compared to non -platinum based therapy containing S -1, taxanes or irinotecan was 
associated with two -fold risk of neurotoxicity (RR = 2.01, 95%CI, 1.05– 3.86, p = 0.03).15 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 10 of 64 Furthermore, in the RAINBOW trial, peripheral neuropathy was more common in the 
ramucirumab plus paclitaxel arm (all grades: 46%) compared with paclitaxel alone (all 
grades: 37%) and was associated with a higher cumulative paclitaxel dose.11 Therefore, there 
is a need to evaluate newer chemotherapy combinations with ramucirumab for advanced 
gastric cancer.  
 
1.4 Irinotecan (Camptosar) 
 
Irinotecan is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class.  Irinotecan is an 
active drug for gastric cancer, and is not neurotoxic. Irinotecan based combinations have 
shown survival benefit in first -line,16,17 second -line4,5,18 and third- line19 treatment of 
advanced gastric cancer.   Common adverse reactions observed in single agent therapy 
clinical studies are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, 
neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), anemia, asthenia, fever, body 
weight decreasing, and alopecia.  
 
Irinotecan has been studied in clinical trials in combination with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and 
leucovorin (LV) and as a single agent.  When given as a component of combination- agent 
treatment, irinotecan was either given with a weekly schedule of bolus 5- FU/LV or with 
an every -2-week schedule of infusional 5- FU/LV.  Weekly and once -every -3-week dosage 
schedules were used for the single-agent irinotecan studies. 
 
1.5 Ramucirumab (Cyramza)  
 
Ramucirumab is a human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antagonist 
indicated: as a single agent or in combination with paclitaxel for treatment of advanced 
gastric or  gastro -esophageal junction adenocarcinoma with disease progression on or after 
prior fluoropyrimidine - or platinum -containing chemotherapy; in combination with 
docetaxel for treatment of metastatic non -small cell lung cancer with disease progression 
on or  after platinum- based chemotherapy; and in combination with FOLFIRI for the 
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with disease progression on or after prior therapy 
with bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine.  Ramucirumab alone and 
ramucirum ab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel) has shown prolonged 
survival in the REGARD and RAINBOW trial. 
 
The most common adverse reactions observed in single -agent ramucirumab -treated 
patients were hypertension and diarrhea.  Ramucirumab increases t he risk of: hemorrhage 
and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal hemorrhagic events; 
gastrointestinal perforation; and impaired wound healing. 
 1.6 Study Rationale 
 
Ramucirumab monotherapy as well as combination of paclitaxel plus ramucirumab has 
shown overall survival benefit after first -line chemotherapy (platinum plus 
fluoropyrimidine with or without an anthracycline)  in advanced gastric or gastro -
esophageal junction cancer.10,11 Irinotecan is  active in gastric cancer and has shown 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 11 of 64 survival benefit, that is similar to taxanes in second -line setting.4,5,18  Safety of 5-
fluorouracil/Irinotecan (FOLFIRI  with irinotecan at a dose of 180 mg/m2 – similar to 
present study) and ramucirumab combination has been studied in second- line treatment for 
metastatic colon cancer, where this combination is safe and provides survival benefit.20 
Therefore, studying irinotecan plus ramucirumab in the second- line setting for gastric 
cancer after fluoropyrimidine and platinum based therapy is prudent. If active, this would 
offer a non -neurotoxic treatment combination of chemotherapy and ramucirumab for 
patients with advanced gastric cancer and GEJ cancers.  
 
We hypothesize that this combination regimen of irinotecan plus ramucirumab administered 
as second line treatment will be tolerated and lead to improved outcomes similar to paclitaxel 
plus ramucirumab in patients with advanced gastric and GEJ cancers. This study proposes a 
phase II clinical trial with irinotecan plus ramucirumab for treatment of patients with 
metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma  who have progressed after fir st line 
chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this regimen has not been previously administered to this 
patient population, so safety and tolerability will be monitored and reported. 
 
1.7 Correlative Studies  
 
1.7.1 Patient -derived xenograft and organoid in gastroesophageal cancer 
 
The use of biomarkers to predict response to novel targeted therapies have ushered in an ever - expanding era of precision oncology.  However, development of targeted 
treatments in upper gastrointestinal cancers has been met with, a t best, modest 
success.  HER2 and VEGF -targeting agents are the only approved targeted therapy 
for metastatic gastric and GEJ cancers. Several targeted therapy agents have been tested in clinical trials, but did not show significant improvement over traditional chemotherapy, in part due to limitations in patient selection. The advent of patient -
derived xenograft and organoid modeling systems has enabled novel approaches to truly personalize and improve cancer treatment.    Patient -derived xenograft  (PDX)  models are generated by growing cells or tissue 
from a patient’s cancer in an immunodeficient mouse.  These PDXs have been shown to recapitulate many key aspects of the original tumor biology, and, more importantly, allow predictions of clinical efficacy  for new targeted treatments in that 
patient whose cell or tissue is derived from. 
21,22 Therefore, PDXs derived from 
gastric and GEJ cancers are used to screen novel agents23-26 (Figure 1A).   
Patien t-derived organoid (PDO) models are generated by culturing epithelial tumor 
cells or tissue in 3D matrigel.  Novel “biobanks” have been established in many tumor types for use in genomic analyses, transcriptome studies, large scale drug screens, and the development of personalized medicine allowing predictions of future drug response.
27 Gastric and esophageal cancer have been shown to amenable to these 
culture techniques with high concordance between primary tissue and organoid histology, genomic landscape, and transcriptomic expression profiles
28,29 with the 
ability to car ry out large scale drug screens as shown in Figure 1B.   
 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 12 of 64  
 
 
Figure 1.  Applications for PDX and PDO models in cancer biology.  A) Five GC 
PDX models were generated and tested for tumor volume response after treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and 1A12 (a novel HER2 antibody).  B) Nine GC PDO 
models were used to screen drug sensitivities (IC
50) for 37 compounds.   
 Both techniques have certain advantages and disadvantages as pre -clinical models 
summarized in Table 1.  But despite the advancement in PDX and PDO technology, there have been few studies that have utilized both in direct comparison.  PDX models require less amount of patient tissue than PDO, but takes longer time to generate. Therefore, PDO models are likely better suited for rapid drug screen, and potentially can be used for real -time treatment decision making. Furthermore, prospective 
studies demonstrating the ability o f either of these models to predict or recapitulate 
individual patient treatment response are lacking.  This correlative study would be wholly novel in utilizing both techniques in the context of a clinical trial allowing prospective investigation of both models and actual patient response to the same treatments.   
 
We plan to generate PDX and PDO models from enrolled patient derived samples.  Using these models, we will specifically assay efficacy of ramucirumab and irinotecan and compare with prospective clinical data regarding actual patient treatment response.   T his will serve as a pilot study for future clinical trials that may 

Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 13 of 64 integrate PDX /PDO models to provide truly personalized cancer therapy options to 
patients with gastroesophageal cancer.  
 
 
Table 1.  Comparison of PDO and PDX models.  Features were determ ined as best 
(+++), suitable (++), po ssible (+), not very suitable (+/- ) or unsuitable (−).  
 
1.7.2 Circulating blood biomarkers including angiome profiles and cell -free 
DNA  
 
Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence suggests antiangiogenic therapy 
affects the level of several factors, and that changes in these factors with therapy may have predictive value. This trial provides an excellent correlative opportunity to assess markers that  may predict response to angiogenesis inhibition. 
 
For this trial, blood w ill be collected to measure alterations in circulating angiogenic 
factors  (plasma angiome profile)  during therapy and to assess correlations with 
outcome , and to identify relevant pharmacogenetic markers , mechanisms of 
resistance and correlate with respons e. 
 
Further rationale for correlative studies is described later in the protocol (Section 9.0).

the research coordinator or his/her delegate by email within one business day. Verification of eligibility and registration should be kept in the patient chart.  All patients at all sites must be registered through the Siteman Cancer Center database at 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 19 of 64 Washington University. 
    
4.3 Assignment of UPN 
 
Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  All data will be recorded with this identification number on the appropriate CRFs.   
5.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Premed ication Administration  
 
Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 to 1 mg of IV or SC atropine to prevent early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan).  It is recommended that patients receive premedication wi th antiemetic agents on the day 
of treatment, starting at least 30 minutes before administration of irinotecan.  Suggested antiemetic agents are 10 mg of dexamethasone given with a 5HT3 blocker (e.g. ondansetron or granisetron). Prior to each ramucirumab infusion, premedicate all patients with an intravenous histamine H1 antagonist (e.g., diphenhydramine).  For patients who have experienced a grade 1 or 2 infusion- related reaction, also premedicate with dexamethasone (or equivalent) and 
acetaminophen prior to each ramucirumab infusion. 
 
5.2 Agent Administration  
 
Patients will receive ramucirumab  intravenously on an outpatient basis at a dose of 8 mg/kg 
over the course of 60 minutes on D ay 1 of each 14-day cycle .  They will then receive 
irinotecan intravenously at a dose of 180 mg/m
2 over the course of 90 minutes on Day 1 of 
each 14 -day cycle.  With approval by the Washington University PI, the agents may be 
given on different days within the protocol specified window.  
5.3 Evaluability 
 
All patients who receive any study treatment are evaluable for toxicity.  Patients are evaluated from first receiving study treatment until a 30 -day follow up after the conclusion 
of treatment or death.  
 All patients are evaluable for disease response unless they discontinue treatment  prior to 
completion of C ycle 4 and have not had any disease assessment.   
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 20 of 64 Patients receiving warfarin must be switched to low molecular weight heparin and have 
achieved stable coagulation profile prior to the first dose of protocol therapy.  Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors  while patients are receiving 
irinotecan  (refer to Appendix B ). 
 UGT1A1 inhibitors (atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) are prohibited.  Late diarrhea associated with irinotecan can be life- threatening since it may be prolonged 
and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis.  Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea.  Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements 
more frequent than normal.  One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of later diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea -free for at least 
12 hours.  Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses because of the risk of paralytic ileus.  
 Patients with unresected primary tumors (or local recurrence) who develop grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolism may also receive anticoagulation and continue ramucirumab 
therapy provided that the tumor does not confer an excessive bleeding risk, in the opinion of the patient’s physician.  
 
5.5 Women of Childbearing Potential 
 
Women of childbearing potenti al (defined as women with regular menses , women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to 
have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first day of treatment.    Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study and for 3 months following the last dose of either study drug.   If a patient is suspected to be pregnant, ramucirumab and irinotecan should be immediately 
discontinued.  In addition, a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy 
test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume dosing.  
 If a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during therapy or within 3 months after the last dose of either study drug, the investigator must be notified in 
order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.6 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 21 of 64 in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug, including: 
o Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction 
o Grade 4 hypertension  
o Grade 3 or 4 art erial thromboembolic event, or any PE/DVT occurring or 
worsening during anticoagulant therapy 
o One occurrence of urine protein level > 3 g/24 hours, three occurrences of urine protein level > 2 g/24, or urine protein level > 2 g/24 hours for more than 2 weeks 
o Gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation  
o RPLS  
o Hepatic encephalopathy or other serious signs of liver impairment such as hepatorenal syndrome  
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unable to receive further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy 
• Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow-up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar . 
 
5.7 Duration of Follow- up 
 
Patients will be followed every 2 months after discontinuation of treatment for progression 
and survival for 30 months.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.          
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 22 of 64

Interrupt ramucirumab for severe hypertension until controlled wi th medical 
management.  Permanently discontinue ramucirumab for severe hypertension that cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy or any grade 4 hypertension. 
 
6.1.3 Proteinuria  
 
If urinalysis or dipstick shows protein ≥  2+, a 24 -hour urine collection must be 
collected and ramucirumab cannot be dosed until the below criteria are met. Interrupt ramucirumab for urine protein levels ≥ 2 g/24 hours.  Reinitiate treatment at a reduced dose once the urine protein level returns to < 2 g/24 hours.  If the prote in level ≥ 2 g/24 hours reoccurs, interrupt ramucirumab and reduce the dose 
again once the urine protein level returns to < 2 g/24 hours.  Permanently discontinue ramucirumab for urine protein level > 3 g/24 hours , if there is a third 
occurrence of > 2 g/2 4 hours, if the protein level does not return to < 2 g/24 hours 
within 2 weeks, or in the setting of nephrotic syndrome. If it is anticipated that the 
urine protein will be elevated, a 24- hour urine collection can be collected and 
evaluated for dosing criteria independent of the urinalysis or urine dipstick. 
 
Initial dose  8 mg/kg  
First dose reduction  6 mg/kg  
Second dose reduction  5 mg/kg  
 
6.1.4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolic Events, Gastrointestinal Perforation, Fistula, or Bleeding

perforation or fistula formation.   
 Patients with unresected primary tumors (or local recurrence) who develop grade 3 or 4 venous thromboembolism may receive anticoagulation and continue ramu cirumab therapy provided that the tumor does not confer an excessive bleeding 
risk, in the opinion of the patient’s physician.  Grade 3 or 4 arterial thromboembolic events, or any PE/DVT occurring or worsening during anticoagulant therapy, require permanent discontinuation of ramucirumab therapy.  Any venous or arterial event leading to discontinuation of ramucirumab therapy will be considered serious and should be reported via the SAE mechanism.  
 For any clinically significant bleeding events deemed at least possibly related to Ramucirumab, patients must be discontinued from further treatment unless permission is granted from the Washington University PI to continue study therapy.  
 
6.1.5 Hepatic Encephalopathy or Other Serious Signs of Liver Impairment  
 
Permanently discontinue ramucirumab.  Signs of serious liver impairment include hepatorenal syndrome or other signs as determined by the treating physician.  
 
6.1.6 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome  
 
If RPLS is diagnosed, ramucirumab must be permanently discontinued.  All cases of RPLS must be reported via the SAE mechanism. 
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Irinotecan  
 
Treatment modifications for toxicities not listed below will be made at the discretion of the 
PI.  Patients requiring a dose reduction beyond that outlined in the study protocol will have the agent discontinued. The other agent may be continued independently in keeping with the applicable dose modifications for that agent.  Treatment may be held for a maximum 
of 4 weeks before a patient must be removed from study treatment.  Treatment may be held 
beyond 4 weeks at the discretion of the PI.  
 
Initial Dose  180mg/m2 
First Dose Reduction  150 mg/m2 
Second Dose Reduction  120 mg/m2

Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 28 of 64 8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
8.1 Ramucirumab (Cyramza)  
 
8.1.1 Ramucirumab  Description  
 
Ramucirumab  is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically 
binds to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2. Ramucirumab  has an 
approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa. Ramucirumab  is produced in 
genetically engineered mammalian NS0 cells.  
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Ramucirumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 antagonist that specifically binds VEGF Receptor 2 and blocks binding of VEGFR ligands, VEGF -
A, VEGF -C, and VEGF -D. As a result, ramucirumab inhibits ligand- stimulated 
activation of VEGF Receptor 2, thereby inhibiting ligand- induced proliferation, 
and migration of human endothelial cells. Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in an in vivo animal model.  
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ramucirumab are similar for patients with gastric cancer, NSCLC, and mCRC based on a population PK analysis. The mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance for ramucirumab was 0.015 L/hour (30%) and the mean terminal half- life was  14 days (20%).  
 
8.1.4 Supplier(s)  
 
Ramucirumab will be provided free of charge by Eli Lilly and Company. 
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Ramucirumab is available in two dose strengths: 
• 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg per mL) solution, single dose vial 
• 500 mg/50 mL (10 mg per mL) solution, single dose vial 
 
8.1.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Store vials in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until time of use. Keep the 
vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  
  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 29 of 64 8.1.7 Administration  
 
Calculate the dose and the required volume of ramucirumab  needed to prepare the 
infusion solution. Vials contain either 100 mg/10 mL or 500 mg/50 mL at a concentration of 10 mg/mL solution of ramucirumab .  
 Withdraw the required volume of ramucirumab  and further dilute with only 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection in an intravenous infusion container to a final volume of 250 mL. Do not use dextrose containing solutions.   Gently invert the container to ensure adequate mixing.  
 
DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other 
solutions or co-infuse with other electrolytes or medications.   Store diluted infusion for no more than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) or 4 hours at room temperature (below 25°C [77°F]).   Discard vial with any unused portion of ramucirumab .  
 Visually inspect the diluted solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. If particulate matter or discolorations are identified, discard the solution.   Administer diluted ramucirumab  infusion via infusion pump over 60 minutes 
through a separate infusion line. Use of a protein sparing 0.22micron filter is recommended. Flush the line with sterile sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for injection at the end of the infusion.  
 
8.2 Irinotecan (Camptosar) 
 
8.2.1 Irinotecan Description  
 
Irinotecan is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class.  I t is a 
semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid extract from plants such as Camptotheca acuminata or is chemically synthesized.  
 The chemical name is (S)-4,11- diethyl -3,4,12,14- tetrahydro -4-hydroxy-3,14-
dioxo1H -pyrano[3’,4’:6,7]-indolizino[1,2-b]quinolin-9- yl-[1,4’bipiperidine]-1’-
carboxylate, monohydrochloride, trihydrate.  Its empirical formula is C
33H38N4O6·HCl·3H 2O.  Its molecular weight is 677.19. 
 
  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 30 of 64 8.2.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I, which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing 
reversible single -strand  breaks. Irinotecan and its act ive metabolite SN -38 bind to 
the topoisomerase I -DNA complex  and prevent relegation  of these single-strand 
breaks. Current research suggests that the  cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to 
double- strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis  when replicati on 
enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA,  and 
either irinotecan or SN -38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-
strand  breaks.  
 
8.2.3 Pharmacokinetics  and Drug Metabolism 
 
After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a  multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal 
elimination half -life of about 6 to 12 hours. The  mean terminal elimination half -life 
of the active metabolite SN -38 is about 10 to 20 hours. The  half-lives of the lactone 
(active) forms of irinotecan and SN -38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and 
SN-38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium. 
 Irinotecan exhibits moderate plasma protein binding (30% to 68% bound). SN -38 
is hig hly bound to human plasma proteins (approximately 95% bound). The plasma 
protein to which irinotecan and SN-38 predominantly binds is albumin.  Irinotecan is subject to extensive metabolic conversion by various enzyme systems, including esterases to form the active metabolite SN -38, and UGT1A1 mediating 
glucuronidation of SN -38 to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN -38G. 
Irinotecan can also undergo CYP3A4- mediated oxidative metabolism to several 
inactive oxidation products, one of which can be  hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase 
to release SN -38. In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN -38 and another 
metabolite aminopentane carboxylic acid (APC), do not inhibit cytochrome P -450 
isozymes. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to  reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. 
Approximately 10% of the  North American population is homozygous for the 
UGT1A1*28 allele (also referred to as  UGT1A1 7/7 genotype). 
 The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans. The urinary excretion of  irinotecan is 11% to 20%; SN -38, <1%; and SN -38 glucuronide, 3%. 
The cumulative biliary and  urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites (SN -
38 and SN -38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 hours following administration of 
irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately  25% (100 mg/m2) to 50% 
(300 mg/m2).

Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 32 of 64 9.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
9.1 Rationale for patient -derived xenograft and organoid generation 
 
Patient -derived xenograft (PDX) and patient -derived organoid (PDO) models have been 
shown to be important emerging preclinical models in oncology.  Recent work has focused on developing these models for application in gastric and GEJ cancers  to screen novel 
agents .
23-26,28,29 Despite the advancement in PDX and PDO technology, there have been few 
studies that have utilized both in direct comparison.  Furthermore, studies are also lacking demonst rating the prospective ability of either of these models to predict or recapitulate 
individual patient treatment response.  We propose to generate PDXs and PDOs from patient derived biopsy samples prior to initiation of trial treatment when the biopsy procedure is both 
safe and feasible.  We plan a prospective comparison between both models and actual patient response to the same trial treatments of ramucirumab and irinotecan.   
 
9.1.1 Collection of Specimens  
 
For patients enrolled at Washington University School  of Medicine, prior to study 
treatment, fresh tissue samples will be obtained either by surgical laparoscopic sampling (preferred), endoscopic biopsy, or image -guided core biopsy.  If safe and 
feasible, b iopsy will be done at least 7 days prior to planned C1D1.  Additional 
methods to obtain adequate samples for PDX/PDO generation, including large -
volume paracentesis or thoracentesis,  will be allowed at PI discretion.  
 
9.1.2 Handling of Specimens  
 
Samples will be stored in ice cold PBS prior to downstream processing. Samples will be immediately delivered to the Mills Laboratory (Washington University School of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology, Bldg: CSRB -NTA, Rm 927, 425 S Euclid 
Ave, St Louis, MO 62110 United States) and stored until processed. All s amples will 
be processed by Mills Lab and Fields Lab for PDX/PDO related experiments.  
 
 
9.1.3 PDX generation  
 
To generate gastric cancer PDX models, typical procedures are as follows; however, standard procedures at the Fields Laboratory and PDXNet will be followed (HRPO #201803010).   Primary patient tumor tissue will be implanted subcutaneously into the flank of 6-week -old NODSCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) for 
the first passage. When the tumor size reaches 500 mm3 (approximately 3months), the mice will be sacrificed, tumors will be surgically removed, and implanted into male athymic nude mice (BALB/c -nude; 6 weeks old; Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, 
Japan) for amplification. After four consecutive passages, the xenografts will be amenable to drug treatment.  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 33 of 64  
 
9.1.4 PDO generation  
 
To generate gastric cancer PDO models, typical procedures are as follows; however, standard procedures at the Mills Laboratory will be followed if there is any discrepancy.  
 Primary patient tumor tissues will be rinsed with advanced DMEM/F12 containing 1 x P/S twice, and then incubated at 37 C with digestion buffer (advanced DMEM/F12 containing 1x P/S, 1mg/ml primocin, 2.5% FBS, 0.6mg/mL collagenase, 20mg/mL hyaluronidase and 10mM Y -27632). Tissue debris will be removed by passing the 
mixture through a 100 µm cell strainer. Cell clusters will be washed twice using AdDMEM medium followed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min, and resuspension in Matrigel, and plated in a 24- well plate.  500 ml of standard gastric organoid 
medium (advanced DMEM/F12, 1x GlutaMax, 1x HEPES, 1x P/S, 50% Wnt3a, 10% RSPO -1, 10% Noggin, 1xB27, 50ng/mL EGF, 200ng/mL FGF10, 1mM N -
Acetylcystenine, 1nM Gastrin, 2mM A83- 01), 10mM Y -27632 and 1mg/ul primocin 
were added to each well. Fresh medium was changed every 2 -3 days and passage of 
the organoid cultures will be performed every two weeks.   
 
9.1.5 PDX and PDO treatment  
 
For treatment of PDX models, after maturation of xenografts, athymic nude mice will be treated with ramucirumab (27 mg/kg ) every 3 days  for 3 weeks and 
irinotecan ( 40 mg/kg  according to previous studies
30,31).  Tumors will be  measured 
twice weekly with calipers, and tumor volumes will be calculated .   
 
For treatment of PDO models,  one day after splitting, tumor organoids will be 
treated with ramucirumab and irinotecan diluted according to a seven- point half -
log scale, with a concentration range spanning patients’ therapeutic levels28. For 
each biological run, raw data from three technical replicates across three plates will be averaged and compared with the mean of the positive control (10mM MG132) 
and negative control (DMSO).  The effect of the drugs on the tumor organoids, in terms of cell viability, will be  quantitated using a Cell titer -Glo 2.0 assay  
(Promega).  Dose response curves, absolute IC50 and AUC will be calculated.  
 
Based on further molecular characterization as noted below, additional therapeutic agents may be used to treat these models.   
9.1.6 PDX and PDO characterization  
 
For our PDX and PDO models, we plan for additional characterization experiments 
to be performed before and after drug treatment.  These important additional experiments will assess concordance between PDX and PDO models through histology, transcriptome, and whole genome analyses.  In addition, pre and post 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 34 of 64 treatment data will allow further exploratory analyses to be made between treatment 
response and molecular characteristics to generate hypotheses regarding resistance/sensitivity mechanisms.  First we wil l process a portion of xenograft 
tumors and organoids by standard formalin fixation and  paraffin embedding for  
H&E pathohistological analyses and further serial unstained sectioning.  Additional samples from xenograft tumors and organoids will be processed for high quality 
RNA and DNA isolation using Qiagen isolation kits.    Dr. Mills is a human pathologist who will analyze morphological and cytological features of PD O and PDX samples analyzed for histology. Specifically, he will be 
interested in whether PDOs and PDXs and original tumor resection/biopsy specimens are concordant with level of differentiation (well, moderate, poor), pattern of invasion (single -cell, clusters, glands), morphology of tumor as a whole 
(single -cells with signet ring features vs. “intestinal” -type), cellular morphology 
(degree of atypia, N:C ratio, nuclear/nucleolar features).  A portion may be sent to the Washington University Genome Technology Access Core (GTAC) for library preparation and RNA and DNA sequencing (e.g., on an Illumina HiSeq -3000).  Downstream analyses will be performed on Partek 
Genomics Suite. Additional analyses including comparison between PDX and PDO models, and pre - and posttreatment molecular responses using exome sequencing 
and transcriptomics via RNA seq ma y be performed. We are cognizant that the 
tumor organoids are an epithelial -biased system. Methods, such as single -cell 
RNAseq or epithelial cell enrichment through flow cytometry, may be used to distinguish and analyze the contribution of non- epithelial, non-tumor tissue in our 
PDX models.  
 
9.2 Rationale for assessment of circulating angiogenic factors 
 
Circulating levels of angiogenic factors have been increasingly evaluated in cancer patients receiving antiangiogenesis therapy. The results of such correlative studies are well documented.
32 Overall, correlations have been inconsistent and have not identified clear  
predictive markers. Such data in patients with gastroesophageal cancer is sparse, given the lack
 of Phase 2 experience in delivering antiangiogenic therapy in this disease. How ever, 
certain  candidate factors warrant further investigation in ways which account for our 
growing  appreciation of the complexity of interwoven pathways. Angiogenesis appears to 
be important in  the progression of this disease and, therefore, correlative studies to improve 
our understanding of drug mechanisms and improve patient selection are warranted.  The association between circulating angiogenesis factors in gastroesophageal cancer has been  explored. Gastric cancer cells have been shown to generate high VEGF levels.
33 
Circulating V EGF levels have correlated with microvessel density in primary gastric  
tumors34 and with higher stage.35,36 In esophageal cancer, serum VEGF levels have been 
found to be raised in patients with cancer, compared with controls.37,38 Serum VEGF has 
been associated with tumor size, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, distant  metastasis, 
response to chemotherapy, and survival.37,39

9.3 Blood- based Angiome profiling using multiplex technology  
 In the past, the gold standard for detection of growth factors and cytokines in blood was the use of ELISAs; however, multiplex technology offers an attractive alternative approach for cytokine and growth factor analysis. This novel technology allows for the measurement of multiple analytes simultaneously from a single sample.  The advantages of multiplex technology compared to traditi onal ELISA assays are conservation of patient sample, 
increased sensitivity, and significant savings in cost, time and labor.  Furthermore, all plate designs have been  validated in order to 1) limit cross -reactivity of the antibodies 2) 
optimize sensitivit y and specificity and 3) maximize the linearity of the assay’s dynamic 
range.  
 Several systems exist, the plate -based platforms being the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) 
multiplex system and the SearchLight system, produced by Aushon Biosystems. The assay desig n in both cases is similar to a sandwich ELISA, except multiple capture antibodies 
are pre- spotted into individual wells of a 96- well plate. Samples or standards are added 
which bind to the specific capture antibodies and are detected using various outputs .  Over 
the past 7 years, the design of customized multiplex ELISA plates  has been optimized via 
extensive collaborations with Aushon Biosystems.  This has led to the development of an appropriately designed panel for the simultaneous evaluation of 28 regulators of tumor and normal angiogenesis.    The table below lists the panel of markers currently optimized; that would be analyzed for 
this study. This will be performed in collaboration with Duke Molecular Reference Laboratory at Duke University Medical C enter (Dr. Andrew Nixon).

9.4 Blood for Cell -Free DNA  
 
The analysis of cell free or circulating tumor DNA is a promising area of investigation that allows for interrogation of tumor -specific molecular alterations in the circulation. One of 
the key advantages of c fDNA analyses is the high degree of specificity offered, because 
mutations found in cfDNA are in essence integral agents of an individual's cancer and are defined by their presence in tumor DNA and absence in matched normal DNA. In te rms of 
sensitivity, levels of cfDNA are abundant in most patients with advanced cancer, allowing 
for the assessment of molecular heterogeneity, monitoring of tumor dynamics, 
identification of genetic determinants for therapy, tracking of genomic evolution, and development of acquired resistance.

12.0 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
12.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumor s 
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks  
regardless of dosing/cycle delays.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should 
also be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 41 of 64 Information from lesion evaluation by imaging done as part of routine care will be collected 
until progressive disease has been objectively determined if the patient discontinued treatment due to any other reason than progressive disease.  
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).
41  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) 
of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 42 of 64 12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions  are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest 
x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 Malignant lymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ though t to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions :  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded  at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 43 of 64  
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be ta ken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessm ent and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions:   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the as sumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used a t follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts , and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  PET -CT:  At p resent, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical dia gnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then 
the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 44 of 64  
Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization  of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Sp ecific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].  Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progr essive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follo w-up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 45 of 64 corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis o f the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstan ce should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, t aking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study ).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non- target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker  level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persisten ce of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 46 of 64 Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Princ ipal Investigator).  
 
12.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements re corded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontin uation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
  
12.4.4 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
12.4.5 Progression -Free Survival  
 
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. For those who are alive and do not experience 
progression, we censor them at the time of loss to follow -up (very few) or at  12 
months from the study entry, which come first.  
 
12.4.6 Response Review  
 
It is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by an expert(s) 
independent of the study at the study’s completion.  Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach.

13.0 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, an 
independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be specifically convened for this trial to review toxicity data.  A DSMB will consist of no fewer than 3 members including 2 clinical investigators and a biostatistician.  DSMB members must be emp loyed by Washington University, 
Barnes -Jewish Hospital, or St. Louis Children’s Hospital.  Like investigators, DSMB members are 
subject to the Washington University School of Medicine policies regarding standards of conduct. Individuals invited to serve on the DSMB will disclose any potential conflicts of interest to the 
trial principal investigator and/or appropriate university officials, in accordance with institution policies. Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSMB  must also 
be disclosed.   Until such a time as the first secondary site enrolls its first patient, a semi- annual DSM report to 
be prepared by the study team will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) semi- annually beginning 6 months after study activation at Washington 
University (if at least one patient has been enrolled) or one year after study activation (if no patients have been enrolled at the 6-month mark).  The DSM report for the DSMB will be prepared by the s tudy team with assistance from the study 
statistician, will be reviewed by the DSMB, and will be submitted to the QASM Committee.  The DSMB must meet beginning six months after enrollment of the first patient at a secondary site, no more than one month prior to the due date of the DSM report to QASMC.  This report will include:  
 
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
• History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason 
• Study- wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual including numbers from 
participating sites  
• Protocol activation date at each participating site  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years at each participating site  
• Expected accrual end date, accrual by site, and accrual by arm  
• Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who have met each objective  
• Measures of efficacy  
• Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants  who have 
met the early stopping rules  
• Summary of toxicities at all participating sites and separated by arm  
• Abstract submissions/publi cations  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 49 of 64  
Further DSMB responsibilities are described in the DSMB charter.   
The study principal investigator and c oordinator will monitor for serious toxicities on an ongoing 
basis. Once the principal investigator or c oordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE 
will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines  (Please refer to 
section 7.0).   
Refer to the Washington University Quality Assurance and Data Safety Monitoring Committee Policies and Procedures for full details on the responsibilities of the DSMC at https://siteman.wustl.edu/research/clinical- research -resources/protocol- office -prmcqasmc/.  
  
14.0 AUDITING  
 
Since Washington University is the coordinating center, each site will be audited annually by Siteman Cancer Center personnel (QASMC) unless the outside institution has an auditing mechanism in place and can provide a report. The outside sites will be asked to send copies of all audit m aterials , including source documentation.  The audit notification will be sent to the 
Washington University Research Patient Coordinator, who will obtain the audit materials from the participating institution.  
 Notification of an upcoming audit will be sent to the research team one month ahead of the audit. Once accrual numbers are confirmed, and approximately 30 days prior to the audit, a list of the cases selected for review (up to 10 for each site) will be sent to the research team. However, if 
during th e audit the need arises to review cases not initially selected, the research team will be 
asked to provide the additional charts within two working days.  Additional details regarding the Auditing Policies and procedures can be found at http://www.siteman. wustl.edu/uploadedFiles/Research_Programs/Clinical_Research_Resources/
Protocol_Review_and_Monitoring_Committee/QASMC%20Policies%20and%20Procedures%205-3-13.pdf    
15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1 Design and Sample Size  
 
This is a multi- institutional, open- label ed, Phase II study. The study will be  conducted at 
five institutions ( including Washington University ). Patients with previously treated, 
metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinomas will be assigned to  treatment with  irinotecan 
plus ramucirumab.  
 
Target sample size for this single arm, phase II study would be 40 patients . A sample size 
of 40 has 85 % power at a 0.050 significance level to detect a median progression- free 
survival time of 4 months in the treatment group when the median survival time of the 
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 50 of 64 historic control group is 2.5 months. These estimations are based on historical data from 
irinotecan studies and a PFS improvement of 1.5 months seen in the RAINBOW study (PFS for paclitaxel alone = 2.9 months, paclitaxel plus ramucirumab = 4.4 mont hs). 
Calculation is based on one -sided, one -sample log -rank test and assumes that subjects will 
be accrued for a period of 12 months, and follow -up continues for a period of 12 months 
after the last subject is enrolled.
42,43 The survival time distributions of both groups are 
assumed  to follow an exponential distribution. 
 
15.2 Primary Efficacy Measure  
 
Progression -Free Survival (PFS):  
PFS will be measured from date of study entry to first radiographic progression or death due 
to any cause. Radiographic progressive disease (PD) will be defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1).
41 For those who are alive and do 
not experience progression, we censor them at the time of loss to follow-up (very few) or at 12 months from the study entry, which come first.  
15.3 Secondary Efficacy Measures  
 
• Overall Survival Time (OS):  
OS time will be measured from date of study entry to date of death from any cause. For 
those who are alive, we censor them at the time of  loss to follow -up (very few) or at 30 
months from the date of treatment discontinuation, which come first. 
• Time to Progressive Disease (TTP):  
TTP is defined as the time from study entry until date of radiographic PD using RECIST v1.1 criteria. For those who are alive and do not experience progression, we censor them at the time of loss to follow -up (very few) or at 12 months from the study entry, which 
come first. For those who are dead before progression, we will consider death as the competing risk. If the number of death are very small, we will censor them at time of death.  
• Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or PD: BOR is defined as the best response across all time points from randomization until radiologically confirmed PD using RECIST, v1.1 criteria. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non -target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm and 
normaliz ation of tumor marker level of non- target lesions. PR is defined as having a 
≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. PD was defined as having a ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions and ≥5 mm increase above nadir. SD was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria.  
• Objective Response Rate (ORR):  
ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed CR or confirmed PR.  
• Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR):  
CBR is defined as percentage of combined patients who ha ve achieved confirmed CR, 
PR and SD.   
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 51 of 64  
   
 
15.4 Anticipated Findings  
 We anticipate prolongation of PFS with combination of irinotecan and ramucirumab. This may provide an early signal of activity of this combination in second line treatment of esophagogastric adenocarcinomas, and would lay the foundation for future phase II I 
studies.   
15.5 Exploratory Analyses 
For PDX/PDO models , successful generation  would be defined by growth in size/number  
ability to expand, and ability to passage.  Treatment response will be assessed by cell death 
by counting or using a cell death assay . The correlation coefficient from the PDX  and PDO 
models will be compared with the clinical outcome from the patients (progression vs no 
progressive disease)  using a point biserial model which will give us a measure on the 
strength of the relationship between the two variables. Paired  analyses for correlation will 
be underpowered (67% power to detect effect size of 0.6 and 10% significance level under 
null hypothesis of a medium effect size of 0.3 with 10 paired samples). Therefore, all 
analyses will be descript ive and hypothesis generating in nature, and it will be used to guide 
future clinical trial development incorporating PDX/PDO models.  
 For circulating biomarkers , levels of plasma -based biomarkers will be presented in 
descriptive summary. Spearman correlations among analytes may be calculated and illustrated. The prognostic value of each analyte as a continuous measure may be assessed by a univariate Cox proportional hazards model for PFS with corresponding hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Cox r egression analyses with each analyte adjusting for 
clinical variables, including age, race, gender and performance status may be performed.

16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Washington University requires that each participating site send s its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by the Washington University Regulatory Coordinator  (or designee ) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.     Each participating institution must have the following documents on file at Washington U niversity 
prior to first subject enrollment: 
• Documentation of IRB approval  of the study  in the form of a letter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.   This documentation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by the IRB.  
• Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form . The c onsent must 
include a statement that data will be shared with Washington University, including the Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC  (if 
applicable) , and the Washington University study team. 
• Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572, and signed and dated CVs of all 
participating investigators.  
• Documentation of training in protection of human subjects by all participating 
investigators.  
• Protocol signature page signed and dated by the investigator at each participating site.  
 The Principal Investigator is responsible for disseminating to the participating sites all study 
updates, amendments, reportable adverse events , etc.  There will be one current version of the 
protocol document at any given time and each participating institution will utilize that document.  
Protocol/consent modifications and IB updates will be forwarded electronically to the secondary 
sites within 2 weeks of obtaining Was hington University IRB approval with acknowledgement of 
receipt requested.  Secondary sites are to submit protocol /consent/IB modifications to their local 
IRBs within 4 weeks of receipt , and confirmation of submission must be forwarded to the 
appropriate contact person on the Washington University study team at the time of submission .  
Upon the secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such shall be sent to the Washington University study team  within 2 weeks of receipt of approval. 
 Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual continuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol violations/deviations/exceptions must 
be kept on file at Washington University. 
 The investigator or a designe e from each institution must participate in a regular conference call 
to update and inform regarding the progress of the trial.

Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 59 of 64 APPENDIX C: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -
threatening” if, in the view of t he investigator, its occurrence places the patient at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event  
Protocol Version:  10Jun2022 – Amendment 6   Page 60 of 64 o Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition:  A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
F. Deviation 
 
Definition:  Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
inclu ding the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study. 
 A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

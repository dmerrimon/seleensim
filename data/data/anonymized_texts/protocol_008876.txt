1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study  Design  
 
This is a Phase 2 study with a randomized lead -in phase of nivolumab in combination with 
Ipilimumab in Radioactive iodine (RAI) refractory, aggressive thyroid cancer, with exploratory 
cohorts in medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer. The medullary cohort  will be randomized 
(along with patients with differentiated thyroid cancer), but in the anaplastic cohort, there will be 
no randomization. Due to the aggressive nature of anaplastic thyroid cancer, patients with 
anaplastic disease will receive nivolumab a nd ipilimumab at their first treatment.  
 
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab was chosen because of mechanistic rationale, 
preclinical data and clinical evidence suggesting synergy between these two agents.  
 
The goal of the study is to test the hypo thesis that CTLA -4 and PD -1 inhibition combined is able 
to induce immunologic response in RAI refractory thyroid cancer resulting in tumor cell death 
and tumor shrinkage.  
 
Patients  will be seen at screening  and then every  2 weeks  during  treatment  until 24 months  from 
first study treatment, or until treatment discontinuation. Basic lab values will be obtained at 
every visit. Scans of known areas of disease will be obtained every 2 months and evaluated by 
RECIST v1.1.  
 
1.2 Primary  Objectives  
 
To evaluate efficacy  in terms of the Radiographic Response Rate to the investigational treatment, as 
determined by RECIST v1.1 (PR+CR)  
 
1.3 Secondary  Objectives  
 
To evaluate  progression -free survival  (PFS) 
To evaluate overall survival (OS)  
To evaluate tolerability  
To explore  biomarkers through correlatives  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study  Disease  
 
Thyroid cancer  is the ninth most common cancer in the United States. In 2014, it was estimated 
that nearly 63,000 Americans will be diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and nearly 1,900 will die of 
the disease. The overall  incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States has i ncreased in people 
of all racial/ethnic groups and in both males and females over the past several decades.

 Thyroid cancer incidence rates vary by both sex and race, with incidence being nearly three  
times higher in women than in men and near ly twice as high in whites as in African Americans. 
After whites, Asians/Pacific islanders have the second highest incidence. Overall  mortality  rates 
remain low despite rising incidence at an average of 0.8% annually from 2002 -2011.  
 
Differentiated  Thyroid  Cancer  
DTC includes papillary and follicular thyroid cancer as well as poorly differentiated histologies. 
Most DTC cases are usually cured with surgery, radioactive iodine (RAI), and thyroid hormone 
suppression therapy. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is t he most frequent type of thyroid cancer. 
Most people who develop thyroid cancer are between age 25 and 65 years.  The prognosis is 
generally good; however, 7 –23% of patients, distant metastases develop and further treatment 
with RAI can eradicate the diseas e in only one third of such cases, while two thirds develop 
radioiodine refractory (RAIR) disease. The 10 –year survival rate among patients with RAIR  
DTC  is only 10% (1). Currently,  only two multi -targeted  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI)  have 
U.S. Food an d Drug Administration (FDA) approval for progressive DTC based on improved 
PFS compared to placebo in two large phase 3 studies. Sorafenib demonstrated a 5 -month 
improvement in median PFS versus placebo (10.8 versus 5.8 months) in a phase 3 trial of 447 
RAIR TC patients  who had progressed  within  14 months  prior  to enrollment  (2). Lenvatinib,  also 
demonstrated a significant improvement in median PFS compared to placebo (18 months versus 
3.6 months) in a phase 3 trial of 330 RAIR TC patients who had progressed in the prior 13 
months (3). Remarkably, neither study showed a survival benefit for th e patients on the 
experimental arm except for those age 65 and older (4). Crossover was allowed in these studies.  
 
Recent data suggests that PD -1 and PD -L1 are over -expressed in thyroid cancer and the amount 
of PD -L1 expression appears to correlate with pr ognosis.  
 
The PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been tested in a phase I study that included 22 patients 
with PD-L1 positive  metastatic  thyroid  cancer  (5). Eighteen  of these  patients  had previously  been 
treated  with radioiodine  and were  considered  RAI refra ctory.  Two out of 22 patients  had a partial 
response (9.3%).  
 
The goal of this study  is to determine  response  rate in patients  with RAI refractory  thyroid  cancer 
that is incurable.  
 
Medullary  Thyroid  Cancer  
Medullary thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 2% of cases diagnosed with thyroid cancer 
and is derived from parafollicular C -cells. While it may not progress even as metastatic disease 
for many years, most patients enter an accelerated disease phase a nd require medical treatment. 
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors Vandetanib and Cabozantinib are FDA approved for this disease  
based on randomized phase 3 studies which showed a significant difference in PFS but no 
difference in overall survival. Subgroup analysis  showed that this was true for all subgroups 
except for those who had the RET M918T mutation. In that group, survival was improved over 
placebo.  
 
Pulsed dendritic cells were used in a study to treat refractory medullary thyroid cancer and 
decrease  in tumor  markers  were  seen suggesting  that medullary  thyroid  cancer  may be amenable

 to immunotherapy. However, no published experience with modern immunotherapy drugs has 
been published in medullary thyroid cancer. Given the fact that, there are no established 
treatment options beyond first line treatment and frequently, once patients have entered the 
accelerated phase, the cancer is very aggr essive and response to TKI treatment is often brief.  
 
However, no published reports have demonstrated efficacy of PD -1 or CTLA -4 directed therapy 
has been published.  
 
This study will include an exploratory cohort of 7 patients with medullary thyroid cancer  with 
any number of prior therapies (including first line in this patient population without the RET 
M918T mutation) to explore possible use of IO in this patient population. Exploratory cohorts 
(histologic subtypes) will be randomized.  
 
Anaplastic  Thyroid  Cancer  
Anaplastic thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 1 -2% of all thyroid cancer cases. It is  
usually a disease of the elderly with about three out of every four patients over the age of sixty 
and occurs more frequently in women than in men. It is on e of the most aggressive solid tumors 
and is characterized by extremely aggressive growth and early metastasis.  It accounts for 30 - 
50% of thyroid  cancer  mortality  and no effective  standard  of care exists  for these  patients  (6). An 
unpublished  study  using  the CTLA -4 inhibitor  ipilimumab  together  with radiotherapy  to the neck 
in anaplastic thyroid cancer also showed responses outside of the radiation field, suggesting 
systemic activity of this drug in thyroid cancer. Before initiat ing this protocol, we treated one 
patient with metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with the PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab and saw a 
mixed response with significant tumor shrinkage in several areas.  
 
In Vitro  Studies  
Our own in vitro data suggests that ipilimum ab and nivolumab may have significant activity in 
differentiated as well as aggressive thyroid cancer (Russell Jenkins and David Barbie,  
manuscript submitted). In this assay, tumor cells from thyroid cancer biopsies or pleural  
effusions were grown to spher oids in a 3 -dimensional microfluidic fluid chamber system along 
with the tumor infiltrating immune cells from the same individual. Treatment of these spheroids 
with ipilimumab  and with nivolumab  resulted  in impressive,  unusually  rapid  cell death  compared 
with other tumor types tested in this system while untreated spheroids continued to grow. 
Cytokine release measured in the culture media was suggestive of a specific T -cell mediated  
anti-tumor response.  
 
These data and the lack of viable treatment options f or this patient population are the basis for 
this study. The primary goal is to study the activity of this combination in incurable RAI 
refractory thyroid cancer but will also include exploratory cohorts in medullary and anaplastic 
thyroid cancer. Explorat ory cohorts (histologic subtypes) will be randomized.

 Cancer immunotherapy is based on the premise that the body’s immune system can recognize a 
tumor as foreign and mount an effective antitumor response capable of eliminating that tumor. 
This likely requires immune recognition of specific tumor antigens, but  also effective  
functioning of activated T -cells capable of eliminating tumor cells as they arise and causing 
tumor shrinkage where existing tumor deposits are present. Conversely, tumor progression is 
likely intimately intertwined with mechanisms by which  tumors evade immune recognition and 
attack.  
 
One mechanism by which tumors may evade immune attack is by coopting inherent immune 
checkpoints that function under normal circumstances to maintain immune homeostasis and 
prevent harmful autoimmunity. Thus, o ne strategy that exists for cancer immunotherapy is to 
modulate these regulatory immune checkpoints that largely exist on the surface of T -cells.  This 
can ideally overcome tumor mediated immune suppression, and potentiate nascent antitumor 
immune responses  that might otherwise have been unable to lead to meaningful tumor  
regression.  
 
Programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1, CD279), is a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein is a 
member of the CD28 family of T -cell costimulatory molecules that also includes CD28, CTL A- 
4, ICOS, and BTLA (7). PD -1 contains an intracellular membrane proximal immunoreceptor 
tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and a membrane distal immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch 
motif (ITSM). Two ligands specific for PD -1 have been identified: PD -L1 (B 7-H1/CD274) and 
PD-L2 (B7 -DC/CD273) (8). PD -L1 and PD -L2 have been shown to down -regulate T -cell 
activation upon binding to PD -1 in both murine and human systems (8, 9). PD -1 delivers a 
negative signal by the recruitment of SHP -2 to the phosphorylated tyro sine residue in the ITSM 
in its cytoplasmic region (10, 11). PD -1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and 
myeloid cells (11).  
 
Further evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD -1 comes from studies of PD -1-deficient 
mice. PD -1-deficie nt mice develop various autoimmune phenotypes, including dilated 
cardiomyopathy, a lupus -like syndrome with arthritis and nephritis, and accelerated diabetes 
mellitus (12 -14). The emergence of these autoimmune phenotypes is dependent upon the genetic 
backg round of the mouse strain and many of these phenotypes emerge at different times and 
show variable penetrance. In addition to the phenotypes of null mutations, PD -1 inhibition by 
antibody -mediated blockade in several murine models has been found to play a role in the 
development of autoimmune diseases such as encephalomyelitis, graft -versus -host disease, and 
type I diabetes (15, 16). Taken together, these results suggest that PD -1 blockade has the 
potential to activate anti -self T -cell responses, but these responses are variable and dependent 
upon various host genetic factors. Thus, PD -1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a 
universal loss of tolerance to self -antigens.  
 
Preclinical animal models of tumors have shown that blockade by PD -1 by monoc lonal 
antibodies (mAbs) can enhance the anti -tumor immune response and result in tumor rejection. 
Antitumor activity by PD -1 blockade functions in PD -L1-positive tumors as well as in tumors 
that are negative for the expression of PD -L1 (17 -22). This sugges ts that host mechanisms (ie, 
expression of PD -L1 in antigen -presenting cells) limit the antitumor response. Consequently, 
both PD-L1 positive  and negative  tumors  may be targeted  using  this approach.  In humans,

 constitutive PD -L1 expression is  normally limited to macrophage -lineage cells, although 
expression of PD -L1 can be induced on other hematologic cells as well, including activated T 
cells. However, aberrant expression of PD -L1 by tumor cells has been reported in a number of 
human malignan cies (23 -28). PD -L1 expressed by tumor cells has been shown to enhance 
apoptosis of activated tumor -specific T cells in vitro (11). Moreover, the expression of PD -L1 
may protect the tumor cells from the induction of apoptosis by effector T cells (29). 
Retrospective analyses of several human tumor types suggest that tumor over -expression (as 
measured by IHC) of PD -L1 may permit immune evasion by tumors. In renal cell carcinoma, 
high surface expression levels of PD -L1 on tumor cells are related to tumor aggre ssiveness (26, 
27). Subjects with high tumor and/or lymphocyte PD -L1 levels are 4.5 times more likely to die 
from their cancer than subjects exhibiting low levels of PD -L1 expression. In addition, in 
multivariate analysis, high expression of PD -L1 is corre lated to have a worse overall survival  
rate compared to low expression levels of PD -L1(30).  
 
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558 or MDX1106) is a human monoclonal antibody 
(HuMAb; immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4] -S228P) that targets the programmed death -1 (P D-1) 
cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. Nivolumab is expressed 
in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using standard mammalian cell  
cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical st udy product is a sterile 
solution for parenteral administration.  
 
OPDIVO ™ (nivolumab) is approved for use in multiple countries including the United States 
(US, Dec -2014), the European Union (EU, Jun -2015), and Japan (Jul -2014).  
 
Nivolumab has been shown t o bind specifically to the human PD -1 receptor and not to related 
members  of the CD28  family.  Nivolumab  inhibits  the interaction  of PD-1 with its ligands,  PD-L1 
and PD -L2, resulting in enhanced T -cell proliferation and interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) release in 
vitro (31). Nivolumab binds with high affinity to activated human T -cells expressing cell surface 
PD-1 and to cynomolgus monkey PD -1. In a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), nivolumab 
promoted a reproducible concentration -dependent enhancement of IFN -α release (32).  
 
In intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys, nivolumab was well 
tolerated  at doses  up to 50 mg/kg,  administered  weekly  for 5 weeks,  and at doses  up to 50 mg/kg, 
administered twice weekly for 27 doses. While nivolumab alone was well tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys, combination studies have highlighted the potential for enhanced toxicity 
when combined with other immunostimulatory agents.  
 
In addition,  an enhanced  pre- and postnatal  development  (ePPND)  study  in pregnant  cynomolgus 
monkeys with nivolumab was conducted. Administration of nivolumab at up to 50 mg/kg 2QW 
was well tolerated by pregnant monkeys; however, nivolumab was determined to be a selective 
developmental  toxicant  when  administered  from  the period  of organogenesis  to parturition  at 
<=10 mg/kg (area under the concentration -time curve [AUC] from time zero to 168 hours [AUC 
(0-168 h)] 117,000  
g
  h/mL).  Specifically,  increased  developmental  mortality  (including  late 
gestational fetal losses and extreme prematurity with associated neonatal mortality) was noted in 
the absence of overt maternal toxicity. There were no nivolumab -related changes in surviving 
infants  tested  throughout  the 6-month  postnatal  period.  Although  the cause  of these  pregnancy

 failures was undetermined, nivolumab -related effects on pregnancy maintenance are consistent 
with the established role of PD -L1 in maintaining fetomaternal tolerance in mice (33).  
 
The PK, clinical activity, and s afety of nivolumab have been assessed in subjects with non -small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and clear -cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in addition to 
other tumor types. Please refer to the 2015 IB for specific details. Nivolumab is being 
investigat ed both as monotherapy  and in combination  with chemotherapy,  targeted  therapies,  and 
other immunotherapies.  
 
Nivolumab is approved in multiple countries including the US for treatment of previously  
treated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced ren al cell carcinoma and previously 
treated, metastatic  squamous NSCLC, the EU  for treatment  of previously  treated, unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma, and Japan for treatment of unresectable melanoma.  
 
On November  10, 2016,  the U. S. Food  and Drug  Administration  approved  nivolumab  (OPDIVO 
Injection, Bristol -Myers Squibb Company), for the treatment of patients with recurrent or 
metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with disease progression on 
or after a platinum -based therap y. 
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of nivolumab was studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geometric mean (% CV%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), geom etric mean volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vss) was 8.0 L (30.4%), and geometric mean elimination half -life 
(t1/2) was 26.7 days (101%). Steady -state concentrations of nivolumab were reached by 12 
weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemi c accumulation was approximately 3 - 
fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 to 10 
mg/kg administered every 2 weeks. The clearance of nivolumab increased with increasing body 
weight. The PPK analysis suggeste d that the following factors had no clinically important effect 
on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline LDH, PD -L1. A PPK 
analysis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on age, gender, race, tumor type, 
baseline tumo r size, and hepatic impairment.  
 
Although ECOG status, baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albumin, body weight, and 
mild hepatic impairment had an effect on nivolumab CL, the effect was not clinically  
meaningful. When nivolumab is administered in c ombination with ipilimumab, the CL of 
nivolumab was increased by 24%, whereas there was no effect on the clearance of ipilimumab. 
Additionally, PPK and exposure response analyses have been performed to support use of 240 
mg Q2W dosing in addition to the 3 mg/kg Q2W regimen. Using the PPK model, exposure of 
nivolumab at 240 mg flat dose was identical to a dose of 3 mg/kg for subjects weighing 80 kg, 
which was the approximate median body weight in nivolumab clinical trials (please see 2015 IB 
for more details ). 
 
Clinical  safety  
The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with other 
therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 8,600 subjects treated to date.

 For monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. There is no pattern in the 
incidence, severity, or causality of AEs to nivolumab dose level. In Phase 3 controlled studies, 
the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is acceptable in the context of the observed clinical 
efficacy, and manageable using established safety guidelines. Clinically relevant AEs typical of 
stimulation of the immune system were infrequent and manageable by delaying or stopping 
nivolumab treatment and timely immunos uppressive therapy or other supportive care.  
 
In several ongoing clinical trials, the safety of nivolumab in combination with other therapeutics 
such as ipilimumab, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti -angiogenics, and targeted therapies is being 
explored. Most st udies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of nivolumab combinations 
continues to evolve. The most advanced combination under development is 
nivolumab+ipilimumab, as is proposed in this study. Results to date suggest that the safety  
profile of nivo lumab+ipilimumab combination therapy, described in more detail below, is 
consistent  with the mechanisms of  action of  nivolumab  and ipilimumab. The  nature  of the AEs is 
similar to that observed with either agent used as monotherapy; however, both frequency and 
severity of most AEs are increased with the combination.  
 
Safety data for nivolumab administered in the context of NSCLC and melanoma are detailed 
below; additional information for other diseases can be found in the IB.  
 
Safety data for subjects with p reviously treated advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with 
nivolumab monotherapy in CA209017 (131 subjects), CA209057 (287 subjects), and CA209063 
(117 subjects) were pooled and safety analyses were performed for these pooled subjects who 
receiving nivolu mab monotherapy (a total of 535 subjects).  
 
Based on the pooled analyses, nivolumab monotherapy at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered IV 
Q2W has an acceptable safety profile, as demonstrated by the frequency, severity, and types of 
AEs, drug -related deaths, SA Es, and AEs leading to discontinuation. The following were the key 
safety findings for these pooled subjects:  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs (reported in ≥ 10% of subjects) were fatigue 
(19.6%), decreased appetite (12.3%), nausea (12.0%), a nd asthenia (10.5%). The majority of 
drug-related  AEs were  of Grade  1-2 in severity.  Drug -related  Grade  3-4 AEs were  observed  in 
11.0 % of subjects  and included  fatigue  (1.7%), pneumonitis  (1.3%),  and diarrhea (0.9%).  
 
Drug -related SAEs and drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 7.9% and 
6.0% of subjects, respectively. The most frequently reported event (>=1% of subjects) was 
pneumonitis (1.9%). The majority of subjects experiencing drug -related SAE s and drug -related 
AEs leading to discontinuation had an event with worst grade of Grade 3 -4 in severity.  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related select AE categories were skin (15.1%), GI (8.4%), 
and endocrine disorders (7.3%).  
 
The majority of select AEs in each category (described in more detail in the IB) were considered 
by the investigator to be related to the study drug, except for AEs belonging to the hepatic, and 
renal select AE categories.

Across select AE categories, the majority of events were manageable, with resolution occurring 
whether or not immunosuppressive medication was needed. Among these medications, 
corticosteroids were the most common immunosuppressive concomitant medication  
administered.  
Most deaths (293/339) were due to disease progression. Two deaths (0.4%) were attributed to 
study drug toxicity: drug -related hypoxic pneumonia reported within 30 days of last nivolumab 
dose (ie, on-study)  and drug-related  ischemic  stroke  withi n 100 days of last nivolumab  dose.  One 
additional death, although reported prior to database lock for CA209057 CSR, had its causality 
changed after database lock to drug -related paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.  
 
Hematology laboratory results, liver func tion, renal function, and thyroid function remained 
stable in the majority of subjects. Abnormalities were primarily Grade 1 -2 in severity. The 
immunogenicity of nivolumab was low and not clinically meaningful.  
 
Safety data for subjects with previously tre ated and untreated unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma treated with nivolumab monotherapy in CA209037 (268 subjects), CA209066 (206 
subjects), and CA209067 (313 subjects) were pooled and safety analyses were performed for 
these pooled subjects receiving ni volumab monotherapy (a total of 787 subjects).  
 
Based on the pooled analyses, nivolumab monotherapy at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered IV 
Q2W has an acceptable safety profile, as demonstrated by the frequency, severity, and types of 
AEs, drug -related deaths , SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation. The following were the key 
safety findings for these pooled subjects:  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs (>=10% of subjects) were fatigue (29.2%), 
pruritus (18.4%), diarrhea (17.2%), rash (16.9%), and  nausea (13.7%). No drug -related Grade 3 - 
4 AEs with the exception of lipase increased (2.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), and ALT increased (1.1%) 
were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects.  
 
No drug -related SAEs of any grade were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects. The most frequ ently 
reported drug -related SAEs of any grade were hyperglycemia (0.6%), colitis, diarrhea, and 
pneumonitis (0.5% each).  
 
No drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported in ≥ 1% of subjects. 
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were 
ALT increased (0.9%), diarrhea (0.8%), AST increased (0.5%), and colitis (0.5%).  
 
The most frequently reported drug -related select AE categories with nivolumab monotherapy 
were skin (38.4%), GI (17.7%),  endocrine (10.8%), and hepatic (6.9%). The majority of select 
AEs were considered by the investigators to be related to study treatment.  
Drug -related  select  AEs were  mostly  Grade  1-2. 
 
Across categories, the majority of high -grade events subsequently resolved, including those for 
which immunosuppressive medication was not initiated.

 The majority of deaths (229/251) were due to disease progression. Only 1 death was attributed to 
study drug toxicity; this death was due to drug -related neutropenia reported between 31 and 100 
days of last nivolumab dose.  
 
Abnormalities in select hematolog y assessments and liver/kidney function tests were primarily 
Grade 1 -2 in severity.  
 
The immunogenicity  of nivolumab  was low and not  clinically meaningful.  
 
Clinical  Efficacy  
Nivolumab  has demonstrated  efficacy  across  multiple  tumor  types  including  NSCLC,  melanoma, 
renal cell carcinoma, esophageal cancer and most recently SCCHN. Approval for SCCHN was 
based on data from  an international, multi -center, open -label, randomized trial (CheckMate 141) 
comparing nivolumab with investigator’s choice (IC) of chemoth erapy (either cetuximab, 
methotrexate, or docetaxel) in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with disease 
progression on or within 6 months of receiving platinum -based chemotherapy . Please see the IB 
version 15 for more details.  
 
In subjects with pr eviously treated, unresectable or metastatic NSQ NSCLC (CA209057), 
nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated superior OS compared with docetaxel, with a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement observed (HR=0.73 [95.92% CI: 0.59, 
0.89]; str atified log -rank test p -value = 0.0015). In subjects with previously treated, unresectable 
or metastatic SQ NSCLC (CA209017), nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated superior OS 
compared with docetaxel, with a clinically meaningful and statistically significant  improvement 
observed (HR=0.59 [96.85% CI: 0.43, 0.81]); stratified log -rank test p -value = 0.0002).  
 
Results of secondary endpoints of ORR, DOR, and TTR further support the antitumor activity of 
nivolumab in both SQ and NSQ NSCLC subjects. In CA209057, PF S was not statistically 
different between treatment groups; however, while the median PFS favored docetaxel, the 
overall HR and 1 -year PFS rate favored nivolumab, indicating the potential for long -term PFS 
benefit from nivolumab in a subset of subjects. In  CA209017, nivolumab treatment resulted in a 
clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in PFS with a 38% reduction in 
the risk of progression as compared with docetaxel.  
 
Nivolumab demonstrated superior OS compared with dacarbazine in  previously untreated 
subjects  with BRAF  wild-type advanced  (unresectable  or metastatic)  melanoma,  with a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvement observed (HR=0.42 [99.79% CI:  
0.25,0.73]; p<0.0001). Results of secondary and explorat ory endpoints of PFS, ORR, DOR, and 
TTR further support the robust and durable antitumor activity of nivolumab in this population.  
Nivolumab  combined  with  ipilimumab 
Preclinical activity and data  
Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD -1 and CTLA -4 receptor blockade may 
improve  antitumor  activity  by activating  a more  robust  anti-tumor  immune  response  compared  to 
either  agent  alone.  In vitro  combinations  of nivolumab  plus ipilimumab  increase  IFN-gamma

 production 2 - to 7-fold over either agent alone in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Increased 
antitumor activity of the combination was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic murine cancer 
models. In a murine melanoma vaccine model, blockade with either CTLA -4 or P D-1 antibodies 
increased  the proportion  of CTLA -4 and PD-1-expressing  CD4/CD8  tumor  infiltrating  T effector 
cells, and dual blockade increased tumor infiltration of T effector cells and decreased 
intratumoral T regulatory cells, as compared to either agent  alone (34).  
 
Preclinically, a 4 -week toxicity study of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab conducted  
in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated that the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab 
resulted in dose -dependent gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Histol ogic findings included 
inflammatory changes in the large intestine, which increased in incidence and severity in a dose - 
dependent manner. GI toxicity/colitis was not observed in cynomolgus monkeys administered 
nivolumab alone, but was observed in monkeys receiving ipilimumab. Nivolumab in  
combination with ipilimumab was also associated with lymphoid hypocellularity of the cortex 
and/or medulla of the thymus and with acinar cell degranulation in the pancreas. Additional 
findings included interstitial mononu clear cell infiltrates in the kidneys, portal mononuclear cell 
infiltrates in the liver and myeloid hypercellularity in the bone marrow. Nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab at the high -dose level (ie, 50 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) 
was associate d with the death of 1 animal, attributed to acute gastric dilatation without 
histopathological evidence of colitis upon pathology evaluation of the GI tract.  
 
Clinical  safety  of single  agent  of ipilimumab  and pharmacology  
Ipilimumab has specificity and a high affinity for human CTLA -4. The calculated dissociation 
constant value from an average of several studies was 5.25 nM. Binding of ipilimumab to 
purified, recombinant human CTLA -4 antigen was also demonstrated by enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay with half -maximal binding at15 ng/mL, whereas saturation was observed  
at approximately  0.1 µg/mL.  No cross -reactivity  was observed  against  human  CD28.  Ipilimumab 
completely blocked binding of B7.1 and B7.2 to human CTLA -4 at conc entrations higher than 6 
µg/mL and 1 µg/mL, respectively.  
 
Ipilimumab has a terminal half -life of approximately 15.4 days. The expected in vivo  
degradation of monoclonal antibodies is to small peptides and amino acids via biochemical 
pathways that are inde pendent of cytochrome P450 enzymes. The population PK of ipilimumab 
was studied with 785 subjects and demonstrated that PK of ipilimumab is linear and exposures 
are dose proportional across the tested dose range of 0.3 to 10 mg/kg, and the model parameters  
are time invariant. Upon repeated dosing of ipilimumab, administered every three weeks, 
minimal systemic accumulation was observed by an accumulation index of 1.5 -fold or less and 
ipilimumab steady -state concentrations were achieved by the third dose. The  ipilimumab 
clearance of 16.8 mL/h from population PK analysis is consistent with that determined by PK 
analysis. The terminal half -life (T -HALF) and Vss of ipilimumab calculated from the model  
were 15.4 days, and 7.47 L, which are consistent with that det ermined by non -compartmental 
analysis (NCA). Volume of central (Vc) and peripheral compartment were found to be 4.35 L  
and 3.28 L, respectively, suggesting that ipilimumab first distributes into plasma volume and 
subsequently into extracellular fluid space . Clearance of ipilimumab and Vc were found to 
increase with increase in body weight. Nevertheless, there was no significant increase in  
exposure  with increase  in body  weight  when  dosed  on a mg/kg  basis,  supporting  dosing  of

 ipilimumab based on a weight normalized regimen. Additional details are provided in the 
Investigator Brochure.  
 
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) and Medarex, Inc. (MDX, acquired by BMS in Sep -2009) have co - 
sponsored an extensive clinical development program for ipilimumab, enco mpassing more than 
19,500 subjects (total number of subjects enrolled in ipilimumab studies) in several cancer types 
in completed and ongoing studies, as well as a compassionate use program. The focus of the 
clinical program is in melanoma, prostate cancer , and lung cancer, with advanced melanoma 
being the most comprehensively studied indication. Ipilimumab is being investigated both as 
monotherapy and in combination with other modalities such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, 
and other immunotherapies.  
 
Phase 3 programs are ongoing in melanoma, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. In melanoma, 2 
completed Phase 3 studies (MDX010 -20 and CA184024) have demonstrated a clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit in pretreated advanced me lanoma and 
previously untreated advanced melanoma, respectively. Refer to the IB for additional details.  
 
While the types of safety events observed in subjects receiving ipilimumab do not appear to 
change, even in combination with other anti -cancer agents,  the proportion of subjects 
experiencing one type or another irAE may be impacted by the choice of combination partner. 
For example, skin and GI irAEs predominate in monotherapy studies. In MDX010 -20, the 
ipilimumab monotherapy arm was administered 3 mg/kg  ipilimumab every 3 weeks for four 
doses. In this arm, there were 79% drug related adverse events, with 21% being Grade 3/4 and 
3/131 (2%) Grade 5. The most frequent adverse events of interest were rash (30%), pruritis 
(33%), diarrhea (33%), colitis (8%), endocrine disorders (9%), AST/ALT increased (2%), and 
hepatitis (1%). Any grade immune related adverse events were 60% and the Grade 3/4 immune 
related adverse events for the same cohort was 13% with the most frequent adverse events being 
diarrhea (5%), co litis (5%), rash (2%), and endocrine disorders (3%). Additional details on the 
safety profile of ipilimumab, including results from other clinical studies, are also available in  
the ipilimumab IB.  
 
Yervoy TM (ipilimumab) has been approved for use in over 4 7 countries including the United 
States (US, Mar -2011), the European Union (EU, Jul -2011), and Australia (Jul -2011). Of note, 
ipilimumab will be given at a lower dose (1mg/kg) in this trial as compared to many previously 
conducted trials in order to reduce  the rates of ipilimumab induced toxicity.  
 
Clinical  safety  of nivolumab  combined  with  ipilimumab  
The safety profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab combination therapy was consistent with the 
mechanisms of action of nivolumab and ipilimumab. A dose of 3 mg/kg nivolumab/3 mg/kg 
ipilimumab exceeded the MTD, and both 1 mg/kg nivolumab/3 mg/kg ipilimumab and 3 mg/kg 
nivolumab/1 mg/kg ipilimumab were identified as the MTD.  
 
In a Phase 1 study, CA209004, ascending doses of nivolumab were studied concomitantly with 
ascending doses of ipilimumab in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In each 
arm in th is multi -arm study, ipilimumab was administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses with 
nivolumab  administered  once  every  3 weeks  for 8 doses.  Starting  at week  24, ipilimumab  and

 nivolumab were administered once every 12 weeks for 8 doses. The th ree initial dose -escalation 
cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 14), Cohort 2 
(nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus 
ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 6). Later, the study was amended to include Cohort 2a which evaluated 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 16). The following DLTs were observed in 
Cohort 1 - Grade 3 elevated AST/ALT (1 subject); in Cohort 2 - Grade 3 uveitis (1 subject) and 
Grade  3 elevated  AST/ALT  (1 subject)  and in Cohort  3 - Grade  4 elevated  lipase  (2 subjects)  and 
Grade 3 elevated lipase (1 subject). Based on these data, Cohort 2 was identified as the  
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and Cohort 3 exceeded the MTD.  
 
Among the 53 patients in the concu rrent -regimen group, adverse events of any grade, regardless 
of whether they were attributed to the therapy, were observed in 98% of patients. Treatment - 
related adverse events were observed in 93% of patients, with the most common events being 
rash (in 55 % of patients), pruritus (in 47%), fatigue (in 38%), and diarrhea (in 34%). Grade 3 or  
4 adverse events, regardless of attribution, were observed in 72% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 
treatment -related events were noted in 53%, with the most common events b eing elevated levels 
of lipase (in 13% of patients), aspartate aminotransferase (in 13%), and alanine aminotransferase 
(in 11%). A total of 6 of 28 patients (21%) had grade 3 or 4 treatment related events that were 
dose-limiting. Serious adverse events rel ated to the treatment were reported in 49% of patients in 
the concurrent regimen group. Common grade 3 or 4 selected adverse events that were related to 
the therapy included hepatic events (in 15% of patients), gastrointestinal events (in 9%), and 
renal ev ents (in 6%). Isolated cases of pneumonitis and uveitis were observed, a finding that is 
consistent  with previous  experience  with monotherapy.  A total of 11 patients  (21%)  discontinued 
therapy owing to treatment -related adverse events, no drug -related deaths were reported (35).  
 
More recently, the results of a phase 3 trial comparing the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab to either agent alone in metastatic melanoma wer e reported (36). Nivolumab was 
given  at a dose of 1 mg / kg and ipilimumab  was given  at a dose of 3mg/kg  every  three  weeks  for 
a total a four cycles. After this, nivolumab was continued alone every two weeks. There were  
314 patients enrolled on the treatme nt arm combining nivolumab and ipilimumab.  Adverse 
events of any grade occurred in 95.5% of those in this group. The most common adverse events 
group were diarrhea (in 44.1% of patients), fatigue (in 35.1%), and pruritus (in 33.2%). The 
incidence of treatm ent-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 was also higher in the nivolumab 
plus-ipilimumab group (55.0%) than in the nivolumab group (16.3%) or the ipilimumab group 
(27.3%). Treatment -related adverse events of any grade that led to discontinuation of the study 
drug occurred in 7.7% of the patients in the nivolumab group, 36.4% of those in the nivolumab - 
plus ipilimumab group, and 14.8% of those in the ipilimumab group, with the most common 
events being diarrhea (in 1.9%, 8.3%, and 4.5%, respectively) and c olitis (in 0.6%, 8.3%, and 
7.7%, respectively). One death due to toxic effects of the study drug was reported in the 
nivolumab group (neutropenia) and one in the ipilimumab group (cardiac arrest), but none were 
reported in the nivolumab -plus-ipilimumab gro up. 
 
Preliminary experience in lung cancer as part of the Checkmate -012 study has evaluated the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced non -small cell lung cancer.

 explored.  In arm A, both agents  were  administered  at a dose of 1 mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W,  N 
= 31). In arm B, nivolumab was administered at 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W; N = 40). Arm C and D dosed nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks (Q12W; N=38) or Q6W (N = 39). Treatment -emergen t 
grade 3/4 adverse AEs occurred in 28% to 35% of patients in each group but led to 
discontinuation in just 3% to 10% of cases. All grade treatment -related AEs occurred in 77%, 
73%, 74%, and 69% of patients in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The safet y profile was 
consistent with previous studies of the combination, and the discontinuation rate associated with 
AEs was similar to rates observed with nivolumab alone. The only grade 3/4 adverse events that 
occurred in as many as 10% of patients were hepat ic in arm B (10%) and skin -related in arm C 
and D (13%). Grade 3/4 pulmonary AEs occurred in no more than 3% of patients in any of the 
groups. There were no treatment -related deaths in the trial.  
 
This data suggests that delivering fewer doses of ipilimuma b at a lower dose of 1mg/kg will 
reduce the toxicity of this agent combined with nivolumab.  
 
Clinical  efficacy  of nivolumab  combined  with  ipilimumab  
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has been studied most extensively in melanoma, 
where combination therapy is now FDA approved.  
 
In the Phase 1 study CA209004, ascending doses of nivolumab were studied concomitantly with 
ascending doses of ipilim umab in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In each 
arm of this multi -arm study, ipilimumab was administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses with 
nivolumab administered once every 3 weeks for 8 doses. Starting at week 24, ipilimumab and 
nivol umab were administered once every 12 weeks for 8 doses. The three initial dose -escalation 
cohorts consisted of Cohort 1 (nivolumab 0.3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n=14), Cohort 2 
(nivolumab 1.0 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 17) and Cohort 3 (nivolu mab 3.0 mg/kg 
plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg; n = 6). Later, the study was amended to include Cohort 2a that 
evaluated nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (n = 16). In the concurrent -regimen 
cohorts, across all dose levels, confirmed objective responses acc ording to modified WHO 
criteria were observed in 21 of 52 patients (40%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27 to 55) who 
had a response that could be evaluated. In addition, 4 patients had an objective response 
according to immune -related response criteria and  2 had an unconfirmed partial response. These 
patients were not included in the calculation of objective response rates.  
 
After noting that several patients had major responses (approaching complete response), a post 
hoc analysis  of the number  of patients  with tumor  reduction  of 80% or more  was conducted.  This 
depth  of response  was uncommon  in published  studies  of checkpoint  blockade  (37).  A total of 16 
patients had tumor reduction of 80% or more at 12 weeks, including 5 with a complete response. 
In the concurrent -regimen group, overall evidence of clinical activity (conventional, 
unconfirmed, or immune -related response or stable disease for >24 weeks)  was observed in 65% 
of patients (95% CI, 51 to 78). Responses were ongoing in 19 of 21 patients who had a response, 
with the duration ranging from 6.1 to 72.1 weeks at the time of data analysis (35).  
 
More recently, the results of a phase 3 trial comparin g the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  to either  agent  alone  in metastatic  melanoma  were  reported  (36).  Nivolumab  was

 given  at a dose of 1 mg / kg and ipilimumab  was given  at a dose of 3mg/kg  every  three  weeks  for 
a total a four cycles. After this, nivolumab was continued alone every two weeks. The median 
progression -free survival was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 9.5) in the 
nivolumab group, 11.5 months (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.7) in the nivolumab -plus-ipilimumab group, 
and 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 3.4) in the ipilimumab group. Significantly longer progression - 
free survival was observed in the nivolumab plus -ipilimumab group than in the ipilimumab  
group (hazard ratio for death or disease progress ion, 0.42; 99.5% CI, 0.31 to 0.57; P<0.001) and 
in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; 
P<0.001).  
 
The tumor -burden change was assessed as the change from baseline in the sum of the longest 
diameters  of the target  tumor  lesions.  The median  change  was −34.5%  (interquartile  range,  −75.4 
to 15.4) in the nivolumab group, −51.9% (interquartile range, −75.8 to −10.2) in the nivolumab 
plus-ipilimumab group, and 5.9% (interquartile range, −28.0 to 33.3) in th e ipilimumab group.  
 
Preliminary experience in lung cancer as part of the Checkmate -012 study has evaluated the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced non -small cell lung cancer. 
Preliminary data was presented at the 2015 World C onference on Lung Cancer. Four 
administration/dosing schedules for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab were 
explored.  In arm A, both agents  were  administered  at a dose of 1 mg/kg  every  3 weeks  (Q3W,  N 
= 31). In arm B, nivolumab was administered at 1 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) plus ipilimumab 
1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W; N = 40). Arm C and D dosed nivolumab at 3 mg/kg Q2W and 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 12 weeks (Q12W; N=38) or Q6W (N = 39). All four regimens 
demonstrated  activity,  with the arms  containin g nivolumab  at 3 mg/kg  showing  the best objective 
response rate (ORR). In arm C, the ORR was 39% and in arm D the ORR was 31%. The ORRs 
were 25% and 13%, in arm B and arm A, respectively.  
 
2.3 Rationale  
 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are quickly becoming standard of care treatment options in many 
solid tumor types. In particular, PD -1, PDL -1 and CTLA -4 inhibition are now established 
therapies   in  Melanoma   and  have  shown   activity   in  most  tumors   tested.  
 
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy worldwide and accounts for over 30 
000 cases per year in the US. Multimodality treatment including surgery and radioactive iodine 
(RAI) results in a cure in >90% of differentiated thyroid cancer cases (DTC), which include 
papillary, follicular and poorly differentiated histologies with their respective sub -types. 
However, in approximately 10% of cases distant metastasis occurs and the disease becomes 
iodine refractory (RAI refractory), rendering it incu rable. Sorafenib and lenvatinib are FDA 
approved for RAI refractory differentiated thyroid cancer based on randomized phase 3 studies 
which showed superior progression free survival compared to placebo but no difference in  
overall survival (OS) except for patients older than 65y (2, 4).  We have tested mTOR inhibition 
with everolimus  in a phase  2 study  and found  that the drug is very active  in this disease  as well 
(38). Everolimus will likely receive compendia listing this year based on our data. Medullary 
thyroid cancer which is derived from parafollicular c -cells, does not respond to RAI and has a 5 
year survival  of approximately  80%.  The vast majority  of these  cases  are driven  by activating

 RET mutations. Cabozantinib and vandetanib are FDA approved based on phase 3 studies which 
demonstrated differences in PFS but not OS. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is one of the most 
aggressive known malignancies known with a median survival of only approxima tely 6 months 
and 5 year survival less than 10%. For anaplastic thyroid cancer, no standard of care exists, 
although lenvatinib and mTOR inhibitors such as everolimus have shown promise (39).  
 
Data are emerging about checkpoint inhibition in thyroid cancer . PD -1 and PD -L1 expression  
has been documented and expression appears to be more pronounced in more advanced cases 
(Han and Walfish, ATA 2015). If the BRAF V600E mutation is present, which occurs in 
approximately 60% of newly diagnosed cases of DTC, PDL -1 expression and tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes appear to be higher than in BRAF -V600E no -mutated (WT) cases (40). 
Pembrolizumab, was tested in extensive phase 1 studies which included a number of RAI 
refractory thyroid cancer cases and PR’s occurred in 2/2 2 (9%) cases that were PD -L1 positive. 
These data were presented at the annual ASCO meeting 2016.  
 
The lack of predictive markers that could be used to select patients is a challenge in 
immunotherapy research. The correlation between PD -1 and PDL -1 express ion and response to 
checkpoint inhibition is weak and of limited clinical usefulness in many tumor types. Traditional 
cell culture and tumor transplant models do not reflect the immune microenvironment and are 
also not considered reliable to predict tumor response in vivo.  
 
Scientists at MIT and Dana Farber have developed a unique microfluidic chamber which allows 
the growth of tumor spheroids while preserving the full array of tumor invading immune cells. 
We have found that spheroids grown from 3 patients with RAI refractory thyroid cancer (2 RAI 
refractory papillary TC, one Hurthle cell follicular TC) showed mild response to PD -1 inhibition 
but a dramatic and very rapid response to CTLA -4 inhibition. Cytokine measurements in the cell 
culture fluid showed a  rise in TNF -alpha, IL6, IFN gamma and IL2, all indicating response to 
checkpoint  inhibition  with CTLA -4 which  closely  resembles  what  would  be expected  in vivo 
(41).  Of note, all  patients had  recently or  currently been  treated with  mTOR inhibitors.  
 
We rec ently treated a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer off label with nivolumab and saw a 
mixed response with some lesions growing while others were getting smaller.  
 
At this point, no standard options exist for patients with RAI refractory thyroid cancer or 
medullary thyroid cancer beyond first line treatment. Since none of the treatments available are 
curative and induce responses for limited time only, there is a major unmet need for treatment 
options.  
 
Rationale  for 24 Months  Maximum  Treatment  Duration  
 
The optimal duration of treatment by checkpoint blockade inhibitors in oncology is currently 
unknown. However, given their mechanism of action continuous treatment may not be required 
as opposed to targeted agents or most of cytotoxic therapies.  
 
With almo st a decade of experience using CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors, accumulating 
evidence  from  different  clinical  trials  in different  tumor  types  indicates  that most  of the

19  
 responses are generally occurring early, with a median time to response  of 2 to 4 months 
including in patients with NSCLC, and most of the responses are likely to be durable as 
compared to conventional therapies.  
 
Limited duration of therapy was explored in few trials, for instance, ipilimumab the first 
checkpoint blockade in hibitor targeting CTLA -4 was initially approved in metastatic melanoma 
in participants who failed standard of care chemotherapy. This approval was based on overall 
survival improvement after a limited duration of ipilimumab therapy, including only 4 induct ion 
doses for a duration of treatment of 12 weeks, with a sustained plateau in survival starting at 
around year two. Moreover, in Checkmate 003 a dose -escalation cohort expansion trial 
evaluating the safety and clinical activity of nivolumab in patients wi th advanced solid tumors 
implemented stopping nivolumab monotherapy at 96 weeks (~ 2 years). At 2 years, 16 NSCLC 
participants who were on still on therapy discontinued nivolumab per protocol, of these, 75% of 
patients (n = 12) were alive > 5 years and did  not receive further therapy after stopping 
nivolumab and remained progression free.  
 
Moreover, long -term follow up data from study KeyNote -006 a phase 3 Melanoma study 
demonstrates that pembrolizumab provides durable efficacy after stopping the protocol -specified 
duration of treatment at 2 years. The median follow -up was of 33.9 months, among the 104 
(19%) participants who completed pembrolizumab, median exposure was 24.0 months. After 
additional median follow -up of 9.0 months after completion of pembroliz umab, 102 (98%) pts 
were alive and responses were durable in pts who completed pembrolizumab.  
 
In addition, data from different series are showing that patients receiving immunotherapy -based 
treatment may discontinue treatment due to safety events. In a re cent analysis in a melanoma 
study the majority of patients who discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxicity 
maintain disease control in the absence of further treatment.  
 
CheckMate 153 is the first randomized study to evaluate treatment duration wi th a PD -1/PD -L1 
inhibitor. In this study, progression free survival appears to be durable with a plateau at 2 years 
from first dose including in pts who stopped nivolumab after 1 year, suggesting the risk of 
progression after 2 years of treatment is minima l, even in the absence of further treatment, which 
is consistent with existing data with PD -1/PD -L1 datasets. In addition, 34 out of 87 patients with 
clinical benefit who stopped therapy at 1 year were retreated upon progression as per protocol, in 
this gr oup, nivolumab retreatment did not appear to re -induce responses and in the majority of  
the cases, the tumor continues to progress suggesting that treatment change, using preferentially 
an agent or approach with a different MOA.  
 
Collectively, these  data suggest  that there  is likely no  benefit from  treatment beyond  two years  in 
advanced tumors. However, even though immunotherapy is well tolerated, patients will be 
exposed to the risk of additional toxicity with longer -term treatment. Therefore, in CA209 -651 
treatment with nivolumab +/ - ipilimumab will be given for up to 2 years from start of treatment.  
 
2.4 Correlative  Studies  Background  
 
Correlative  studies  are an integral  part of this protocol  to gain insight  into the basic  biologic

20  
 response to PD -1 and CTLA -4 blockade in thyroid cancer and the early identification of 
mechanisms of drug resistance. The purpose of the randomized lead -in phase with Nivolumab 
and ipilimumab starting sequentially is to provide opportunities to study the s pecific 
immunologic changes that occur in response to either drug alone as well as both drugs in 
combination. The clinical endpoints are assessed during treatment with both drugs combined.  
 
Recently, a novel method for evaluating ex vivo response to immune  checkpoint blockade using 
patient -derived organotypic tumor spheroids (PDOTS) cultured in a 3 -dimensional microfluidic 
system has been developed. It could be demonstrated that spheroids isolated from fresh human 
tumor samples retain autologous lymphoid an d myeloid cell populations, including antigen - 
experienced  tumor  infiltrating  CD4/CD8  T lymphocytes,  and survive  in extracellular  matrix.  PD- 
1 and CTLA -4 blockade inhibition across a large panel of PDOTS including samples from 4 
thyroid cancer patients co nsistently showed up -regulated homeostatic lymphokines involved in 
T- and B - cell chemoattraction, demonstrating the feasibility of ex vivo profiling of PD -1 and 
CTLA -4 blockade, it could also be demonstrated that induction of a dysfunctional cytokine 
response may contribute to intrinsic resistance. (Jenkins et al., Nature , under review).  
 
We have tested samples from 4 patients with thyroid cancer and found that treatment of spheroid 
cultures with CTLA4, and to a lesser extent with PD -1 blockade led to the rapid cell death of 
thyroid cancer cells. These studies along with early reports to PD -1 and CTLA -4 blockade are  
the basis for this protocol.  
 
Patients will be required to undergo sequential biopsies, if accessible tumor is present. Tumor 
samples will be g rown in the microfluidic chamber system and tumor infiltrating lymphoid and 
myeloid cells will be analyzed both in vitro and by flow cytometry across several samples 
obtained prior to treatment, during treatment with nivolumab or ipilimumab and with both d rugs 
combined. This will allow us to determine optimal sequencing of the 2 drugs, and potential 
mechanisms of resistance during treatment.  
 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may reflect the ongoing molecular evolution of thyroid cancer 
cells and reveal molecu lar and genetic changes that confer migration and invasion advantages. It 
is essential to define mechanisms of resistance at more than one timepoint. This is important 
because resistance mechanisms may be completely different at different stages of disease , but 
difficult to achieve with tissue biopsies. The goal of this exploratory endpoint is to understand 
how tumor heterogeneity evolves during progression of thyroid cancer, and with development of 
resistance/refractory disease. The objective is to determi ne the transcriptional profile of CTCs, 
myeloid and lymphoid WBC’s in peripheral blood and compare to cancer and tumor infiltrating 
lymphoid and myeloid cells in tissue biopsies through RNA sequencing, and to define how these 
change with therapeutic interv ention over time. Recent advances in next -generation sequencing 
and single cell isolation techniques will make this a minimally invasive approach to perform 
comprehensive genomics in patients with thyroid cancer to inform clinical treatment decisions.  
 
In addition to CTCs, other circulating biomarkers can be detected in plasma and serum, such as 
cell-freeDNA (cfDNA), microvesicles and exosomes. Some of these markers have been found to 
correlate with increasing tumor burden and treatment response in various types of malignancies. 
cfDNA,  and nucleic  acids  in microvesicles  and exosomes  in cancer  subjects  can harbor  many

21  
 genetic alterations (mutations, microsatellite alterations, aberrant methylation), which are 
generally consistent with the tumor. Thus, blood may be a useful surrogate for tissue, and can be 
especially valuable at time points or in disease settings where t umor tissue collection may be 
challenging to evaluate drug response, resistance and disease progression.  
 
In addition, cell sorting of peripheral CD4 and CD8 positive cells by flow cytometry and single 
cell sequencing provides an opportunity to evaluate th e changes immune cells undergo in 
response to checkpoint inhibition with PD -1 and CTLA -4. Samples will be assessed for 
expression of markers of exhaustion (PD -1, CTLA -4, TIM3) and how these markers change in 
response to nivolumab, Ipilimumab or both drugs combined.  
We have tested several peripheral blood samples from thyroid cancer patients and could 
document the presence of CTC’s as well as cfDNA in approximately 60% of cases.

3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
1. Patients should be excluded if they have an active, known or suspected autoimmune 
disease.  Subjects are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, 
residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone 
replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to 
recur in th e absence of an external trigger  
 
2. Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before administration of the 
first dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any 
evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ

3. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with 
either  corticosteroids  (> 10 mg daily  prednisone  equivalents)  or other  immunosuppressive 
medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and 
adrenal replacement doses > 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the 
absence of active autoimmune disease.  
 
4. As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab 
combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in 
patients treated with nivolumab -containing regimen.  
 
5. Patients who have had chemotherapy/radiotherapy and/or tar geted agentswithin 2 weeks 
(6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have

4. REGISTRATION  AND  RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General  Guidelines  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
Institutions will register eligible participants in the Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS) 
OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy. Any participant not 
registered to the protocol before protocol therapy begins wil l be considered ineligible and 
registration will be denied.  
 
An investigator  will confirm  eligibility  criteria  and a member  of the study  team  will complete  the 
protocol -specific eligibility checklist.  
 
For DTC and MTC patients, the eligibility checklist a nd all pages of the consent form will be 
faxed  to the ODQ  . The ODQ  Registrar  will (a) review  the eligibility  checklist,  
(b) register the  participant on the  protocol, and (c)  randomize the participant.  
 
For ATC patients, who will not undergo randomization, the study team is responsible for 
registering patients in OnCore.  
 
An email confirmation of the registration and/or randomization will be sent to the Overall PI, 
study coordinator(s) from the Lead Site,  treating investigator and registering person immediately 
following the registration and/or randomization.  
 
Following registration, participants may begin protocol therapy. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Princ ipal Investigator (PI). If a participant 
does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s registration on the 
study must be canceled. Registration cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.  
 
4.2 Registration  Process  for DF/HCC  Institutions  
 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject Protocol 
Registration (SOP #: REGIST -101) must be followed.

 described below may be administered with the intent to treat the participant’s malignancy during 
the course of treatment.  
 
The treatment  plan is shown  below:  
 
Nivolumab  infusion at a dose of 3mg/kg, once every 2 wee ks, until treatment discontinuation. 
Ipilimumab  infusion  at a dose of 1mg/kg,  once  every  6 weeks,  until treatment  discontinuation.  
 
For DTC  and MTC  patients,  there  will be randomization  to 2 arms  for a lead-in phase  in this 
study:  
Arm 1: Nivolumab  starts  2 weeks  prior  to Ipilimumab 
Arm 2: Ipilimumab  starts  2 weeks  prior  to Nivolumab  
 
The following  stratification  factor  will be used in order  to prevent  imbalance  across  treatment 
arms:

Due to the aggressive nature of their disease, for patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, both 
drugs will start synchronously on day 1. No randomization or lead -in phase will occur for these 
patients.

This design will allow us to obtain liquid and in some cases tumor tissue biopsies sequentially 
that will provide valuable information about biological endpoints including changes in T cell 
invasion, release of inflammatory cytokines, cell death and RNA ex pression profile, cell free 
DNA, and circulating tumor cells at baseline, while on one drug alone, on both drugs and at the 
time of progression.  
 
5.2 Pre-Treatment  Criteria  
 
Eligibility and exclusion criteria are provided in Section 3.  These criteria will be assessed 21 
days prior to study registration to establish eligibility and baseline values.  
 
Informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to t he subject and 
before the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  If screening assessments occur 
within 3 days before start of study treatment, then they may serve as the baseline cycle 1 day 1 
visit and cycle 1 day 1 labs do not need to be per formed.  
 
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be collected at the Screening Visit. 
Standard demographic parameters include age, sex, and race/ethnicity (recorded in accordance 
with prevailing regulations).  Baseline characteristics will  include ECOG PS (Appendix A), 
disease status, medical histories, and prior and concomitant medications.  
 
Additional testing required, as per Section 3, is:  hematology panel (see Table 1), chemistry  
panel  (see Table 1), coagulation  panel, urine  or serum  HCG  (in women of  childbearing potential; 
see Section 3 for when serum HCG testing is required), TSH (with reflexive Free T4 and Free 
T3), Mg, LDH, amylase, lipase.

Archival  tumor  sample  should  be collected  (block  or if not possible,  at least 20 unstained  slides). 
If unavailable, a baseline tumor biopsy is required, if safe to perform.  
 
5.3 On treatment visits  
Reasonable  effort  should  be made  to conduct  study  visits  on the day scheduled  (+/- 3 days).  
 
Any changes from screening clinical evaluation findings that meet the definition of an AE will  
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  
 
If screening assessments occur within 3 days before start of study treatment, then they may serve 
as the baseline cycle 1 day 1 visit and screening tests do not need to be repeated.  
 
Pharmacy will follow the DFCI dosing weight practice which is to use the weight from baseline 
or the previous dose if it has not changed more than ≥ 5%.  
 
5.4 Monitoring  of Patients  with  Anaplastic  Thyroid  Cancer  
 
Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer have very aggressive disease and usually require 
immediate treatment. If a patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer chooses to participate, he/she 
will need to sign an additional section in the consent stating he/she agrees to weekly follow -up 
by phone or in clinic if he/she experiences intolerable symptoms, as determined based on an 
assessment by the patient’s treating physician.  Anaplastic thyroid cancer patients deemed to 
have  intolerable  symptoms  will be followed  closely  outside  of the protocol’s  study  schedule  (i.e., 
with phone calls or clinic visits to be determined by treating physician) until they achieve 
tolerable symptoms as assessed by the patient’s treating physician.  
 
5.5 Agent  Administration  
 
When study drugs (ipilimumab or nivolumab) are to be administered  on the same day, separate 
infusion bags and filters must be used for each infusion. It is recommended that nivolumab be 
administered first. The second infusion will always be ipilimumab, and will start approximately 
30 minutes after completion of the nivo lumab infusion.  
 
BMS -936558 (nivolumab) is to be administered as a 30 (+/ - 15) minute  IV infusion. Ipilimumab 
should be administered as a 30 (+/ - 15) minute infusion following.  
 
Ipilimumab and nivolumab may be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Solution or 5%  Dextrose 
solution.

28  
 The dosing  calculations  should  be based  on the body  weight.  If the subject’s  weight  on the day of 
dosing differs by ≥ 5% from the weight used to calculate the dose, the dose must be recalculated. 
All doses should be rounded up or to the nearest milligram per institutional standard.  
 
5.6 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Protocol  Therapy  
 
Duration of  therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and 
tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Disease  progression  
 
• Intercurrent  illness that  prevents  further administration of treatment  
 
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  
 
• Participant  demonstrates  an inability  or unwillingness  to comply  with the oral 
medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
 
• Participant  decides  to withdraw  from the protocol  therapy  
 
• General  or specific  changes  in the participant's  condition  render  the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating investigator  
 
• A maximum  of 24 months from the first  study treatment  
 
Participants will be removed from the protocol therapy when any of these criteria apply (with the 
exception of disease progression, in which case participants may or may not be removed from 
protocol  therapy,  at the investigator’s  discretion).  The reason  for removal  from  protocol  therapy, 
and the date the participant was removed, must be documented in the case report form (CRF). 
Alternative care options will be discussed with the participant.  
 
When a participant is removed from protocol therapy, Treatment En ded information will be 
updated in OnCore by the research team.  
 
In the event  of unusual  or life-threatening  complications,  treating  investigators  must  immediately 
notify the Overall PI, Kartik Sehgal, MD  
 
5.6.1 Treatment  Beyond  Disease  Progression  
 
Accumulating  evidence indicates a minority of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progression of disease (PD).  
 
Subjects  will be permitted  to continue  on study  treatment  for treatment  beyond  initial  RECIST  
1.1 defined  PD up to a total of 24 months  total treatment  duration  from  the start of study 
treatment as long as they meet the following criteria:

29  
  
• Investigator -assessed  clinical  benefit  and no rapid  disease progression  
 
• Tolerance  of study  drug 
 
• Stable  performance  status  
 
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
 
• Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional study 
treatment,  using  an ICF describ ing any reasonably  foreseeable  risks  or discomforts,  or 
other alternative treatment options. The decision to continue treatment beyond initial 
investigator -assessed progression should be discussed with the investigator and 
documented in the study records.  
 
If the investigator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment,  the subject  should  remain  on the trial and continue  to receive  monitoring  according  to 
the Study Calendar (section 10).  
 
For the subjects who continu e study therapy beyond progression, further progression is defined  
as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial PD. This includes an increase 
in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the diameters of new measurable lesion s 
compared to the time of initial PD. Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression.  
 
New  lesions  are considered  measurable  at the time of initial  progression  if the longest  diameter  is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 
mm). Any new lesion considered non -measurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the long est diameter increases to at  
least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 15 
mm).  
 
In situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion 
of new lesions which become me asurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  
 
5.7 Duration  of Follow  Up 
 
Participants will be followed for response until first disease progression or treatment 
discontinuation (whichever comes last) and for survival for 2 years from study registration. 
Participants removed from protocol therapy for unacceptable adverse event(s ) will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event and if have not experienced first disease 
progression at time of discontinuation of protocol therapy, will continue to be followed until first 
disease progression. After disease prog ression, patients will be followed by phone, until death or 
for 2 years from study registration (whichever occurs first).

5.8 Criteria  for Taking  a Participant  Off Study  
 
Participants  will be removed  from  study  when  any of the following  criteria  apply:  
• Patient  completed  required  follow -up 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal  of consent  for data  submission  
• Death  
 
The reason for taking a participant off study, and the date the participant was removed, must be 
documented in the case report form (CRF).  
 
The research  team  updates  the relevant  Off Study  information  in OnCore.  
 
 
6. DOSING  DELAYS/DOSE  MODIFICATIONS  
 
6.1 Dose  Reduction  for Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab:  
 
There  will be no  dose reductions  for nivolumab or  ipilimumab permitted.  
 
6.2 Dose  Delay  Criteria  for Nivolumab  and Ipilimumab:  
 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug -related AEs. Treatment delay is up to 6 weeks for 
nivolumab and up to 12 weeks for ipilimumab from the last dose are allowable (any dose delays 
greater than these will require approval from the PI).  
Tumor  assessments  for all subjects  should  continue  as per protocol  even  if dosing  is delayed. 
Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for the following:  
• Any Grade ≥ 2 non -skin, drug -related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory 
abnormalities  
• Any Grade  ≥ 3 skin drug-related  AE 
• Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions for 
lymphopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase:  
o Grade  3 lymphopenia does  not require  a dose delay  
o If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal 
limits, delay dosing for drug -related Grade 2 toxicity  
o If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity 
range delay dosing for drug -related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity  
o Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestatio ns of pancreatitis does not require dose 
delay. The PI should be consulted for such Grade ≥ 3 amylase or lipase 
abnormalities.  
o Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter -current illness which, in the judgment of 
the investigator, warrants delaying the dose of  study medication.

31  
 • Subjects receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab that have drug -related 
toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipilimumab and 
nivolumab) delayed until retreatment criteria are m et. (Exceptions apply to the retreatment 
criteria after dose delay of ipilimumab and nivolumab for Grade ≥ 3 amylase and lipase 
abnormalities  that are not associated  with symptoms  or clinical  manifestations  of pancreatitis 
and that are attributed to ipilim umab alone.)  
 
Rescheduling:  
• Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose if the next ipilimumab 
dose is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing to be 
synchronized with nivolumab dosing.  
• Ipilimumab s hould be dosed at the specified interval regardless of any delays in intervening 
nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing of ipilimumab 
and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted within the  
permitted  +/- 3 day window.  Ipilimumab  may be delayed  beyond  the 3 day window  if needed 
to synchronize with the next nivolumab dose.  
• If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then 
subsequent ipilimumab doses should be  rescheduled to maintain the 6 week interval between 
consecutive ipilimumab doses.  
• A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 6.4.  
 
6.3 Treatment  Discontinuation  Criteria  
For all subjects, global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time will be captured on the health 
outcomes questionnaires. Tumor assessments for subjects who discont inue study treatment 
without radiographic progression, should continue as per protocol until radiographic progression 
is determined.  
 
6.4 Nivolumab  Dose  Discontinuation  
Treatment  with nivolumab  should  be permanently  discontinued  for any of the following:  
• Any G rade 2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to  
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re -treatment period OR 
requires systemic treatment  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related bronchospasm, hypersensitivit y reaction, or infusion reaction 
regardless of duration;  
• Any Grade 3 non -skin, drug -related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following 
exceptions for uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic toxicity, 
hypersensitivity  react ions,  infusion  reactions,  endocrinopathies,  and laboratory  abnormalities:  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic 
toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires 
disconti nuation.  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation.  
• Any Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment discontinuation 
except:

32  
 o Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bleeding 
requires discontinuation.  
o Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following 
criteria require discontinuation (also see Hepatic Adverse Event Management 
Algorithm, Appendix B):  
o AST  or ALT  > 5-10x ULN  for > 2 weeks  
1. AST  or ALT  > 10x ULN  
2. Total  bilirubin > 5 x ULN  
3. Concurrent  AST  or ALT  > 3 x ULN  and total bilirubin  > 2 x ULN  
• Any Grade  4 drug-related  adverse  event  or laboratory  abnormality,  except  for the following 
events, which do not require discontinuation:  
1. Grade  4 neutropenia   7 days 
2. Grade  4 lymphopenia  or leukopenia  
3. Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade 4 within  
1 week of onset. The PI should be consulted for Grade 4 amy lase or lipase 
abnormalities  
4. Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management 
within 72 hours of their onset  
 
• Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occur for non -drug-related 
reasons may be allowed if approved by the PI. Prior to re -initiating treatment in a subject  
with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks, the PI must be consulted. Tumor assess ments should 
continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and 
laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically 
indicated during such dosing delays.  
• Any adverse event, labor atory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued nivolumab 
dosing.  
 
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the 
assessment made for discontinuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the 
discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for 
nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued.  
 
If a subject meets criteria for discontinuation and investigator is unable to determine whether 
the event is related to both or one study drug, the subject should discontinue both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab and be taken off the treatment phase of the study.  Continuation of 
ipilimumab after discontinuation of nivolumab is not allowed on study.  
 
6.5 Ipilimumab  Dose  Discontinuation  
Ipilimumab  should  be permanently  discontinued  if any  of the following  criteria  are met: 
• Any Grade  2 drug -related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to 
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 weeks OR requires 
systemic treatment;

laboratory abnormalities, grade 3 nausea and vomiting, grade 3 neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia, and symptomatic endocrinopathies which resolved (with or without 
hormo ne substitution);  
• Any drug -related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria 
require discontinuation:  
o AST  or ALT  > 8x ULN  
o Total  bilirubin > 5 x ULN  
o Concurrent  AST  or ALT  > 3 x ULN  and total bilirubin  > 2 x ULN

o Grade  4 lymphopenia  or leukopenia  
o Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities which are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. The PI should be consulted 
for Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities.  
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalitie s that are not associated with 
clinical  sequelae  and are corrected  with supplementation/appropriate  management 
within 72 hours of their onset  
• Any treatment delay resulting in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks with the following 
exceptions: Dosing delays to manage drug -related adverse events, such as prolonged steroid 
tapers, are allowed. Prior to re -initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing delay lasting > 
12 weeks, the PI must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even 
if dosing is delayed.  
• Dosing delays resulting in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks that occur for non -drug 
related reasons may be allowed if approved by the PI. Prior to reinitiating treatment in a 
subject with a dosing delay lasting > 12 weeks, the PI must  be consulted. Tumor assessments 
should continue as per protocol even if dosing is delayed.  
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject w ith continued ipilimumab 
dosing  
 
The assessment for discontinuation of ipilimumab should be made separately from the 
assessment made for discontinuation of nivolumab. Although there is overlap among the 
discontinuation criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not f or 
nivolumab, treatment with nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued.  
 
If a subject meets criteria for discontinuation and investigator is unable to determine whether 
the event is related to both or one study drug, the subject should discontin ue both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab and be taken off the treatment phase of the study.  
 
6.6 Criteria  to Resume  Nivolumab  Dosing  
Subjects  may resume  treatment  with nivolumab  when  the drug-related  AE(s)  resolve(s)  to 
Grade  1 or baseline, with the following except ions:

 • Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue.  
• Subjects  who have  not experienced  a Grade  3 drug-related  skin AE may resume  treatment  in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
• Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting  
discontinuation parameters (Section 6.7) should have treatment permanently discontinued.  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with and 
approved by the PI.  
• Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for managem ent of any drug -related toxicity 
must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of prednisone  10 
mg/day.  
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.  
• Subjects who delay study treatment due to any Grade  3 amylase or lipase abnormality that 
is not associated  with symptoms  or clinical  manifestations  of pancreatitis,  and that is assessed 
by the investigator to be related to ipilimumab and not to nivolumab, may resume nivolumab 
when the amylase or lipase abnormality has resolved to Grade < 3. The PI should be 
consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such subjects.  
• Dose delay of niv olumab which results in treatment interruption of > 6 weeks requires 
treatment discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in Section 6.7.  
 
6.7 Criteria  to Resume  Ipilimumab  Dosing  
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab when drug -related AE(s) 
resolve(s) to Grade 1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions:  
• Subjects  may resume  treatment  in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue.  
• Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may resume treatment in 
the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.  
• Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for 
reasons other than a 2 -grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in the 
presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT or total bilirubin.  
• Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting  
discontinuation parameters (given below) should have treatment permanently discontinued.  
• Drug -related pulmonary toxic ity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed.  
• Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug -related toxicity 
must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of predn isone  10 
mg/day.  
• Drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the PI.  
• Dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for > 12 weeks requires 
ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted below.  
• Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks (  5days) after the prior ipilimumab 
dose.

35  
 • In general, subjects who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria to 
resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when 
resuming ipilimumab. In order to facilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab an d 
ipilimumab may be adjusted within the permitted  5 day window, as long as consecutive 
nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days apart.  
• One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses are delayed due to drug 
related Grade   3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or clinical 
manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses the Grade  3 amyla se or lipase 
abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivolumab, nivolumab may be 
resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade < 3 but ipilimumab may 
only be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to G rade 1 or baseline. 
Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must be clearly noted in the 
subject’s medical chart. The PI should be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such 
subjects.  
 
Treatment  of Nivolumab  or Ipilimumab  Rela ted Infusion  Reactions  
Since nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is  
unlikely to be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such  
a reaction  were  to occur,  it might  manifest  with fever,  chills,  rigors,  headache,  rash,  pruritis, 
arthralgias, hypo - or hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms. All Grade 3 or 4 infusion 
reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be graded  
according  to NCI CTCAE  (version  4.0) guidelines.  Treatm ent recommendations  are provided 
below and may be modified based on local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate: 
For Grade  1 symptoms:  (Mild  reaction;  infusion  interruption  not indicated;  intervention  not 
indicated)  
 
Remain at bedside and monit or subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 minutes before 
additional nivolumab  administrations.  
 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non -steroidal anti - 
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, I V fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours).  
 
Stop the nivolumab or ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the 
subject with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetamino phen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion 
is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when  symptoms 
resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of 
the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab 
or ipilimumab will be administered at that visit. Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and 
remain at bedside and monitor the subject until resolution of symptoms. The amount of study 
drug infused  must  be recorded  on the electronic  case report  form  (eCRF).  The following

 prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or 
equivalent)  and/or  paracetamol  325 to 1000  mg (acetaminophen)  should  be administered  at least 
30 minutes before additional nivolumab or ipilimumab administrations. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (recommended dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be 
used.  
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms: (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly 
responsive to symptomatic medication and/or brief interrup tion of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae  
[eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).  
 
Immediate ly discontinue infusion of nivolumab or ipilimumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal 
saline, and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of  
a 1: 1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:  10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored until the 
investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolu mab or ipilimumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. 
In the case of late -occurring hypersensitiv ity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg,  
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
6.7.1 Management  Algorithms  for Immuno -Oncology  Agents  
Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with adverse events that can differ in severity and 
duration than adverse events caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and ipilimumab are 
considered immuno -oncology agents in this protocol. Management al gorithms have been 
developed to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of adverse 
events: Gastrointestinal, Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, and Neurological.  
 
Early recognition and intervention are recommende d according to the management algorithms; 
and in addition include ophthalmologic evaluations for any visual symptoms in order to evaluate 
for nivolumab or ipilimumab related uveitis.  
 
The recommendations are to follow the algorithms in the nivolumab invest igator brochure for 
immune related events; while the ipilimumab investigator brochure contains similar algorithms, 
the algorithms in the nivolumab brochure have been aligned to accommodate combinations as 
well as nivolumab monotherapy.  
 
Therefore,  the algorithms  recommended  for utilization  are in Appendix  B for reference.  
 
Additional details on the safety of nivolumab and ipilimumab, including results from clinical 
studies, are available in the IB.

 6.8 Concomitant  Treatments  
 
6.8.1 Prohibited  and/or  Restricted  Treatments  
The following  medications  are prohibited  during  the study  (unless  utilized  to treat a drug related 
adverse event):  
• Immunosuppressive agents.  
• Immunosuppressive  doses  of systemic  corticosteroids  (except  as stated  in section  6.8.2)  
• Any concurrent anti -neoplastic therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, 
immunotherapy,  extensive,  non-palliative  radiation  therapy,  or standard  or investigational 
agents for treatment of cancer)  
• Surgical  resection  of tumor  
 
Caution should be used regarding the use of herbal medications as there may be as yet unknown 
interactions  with nivolumab  and/or  ipilimumab.  Discontinuation  of the use of herbal  medications 
prior to study enrollment is encouraged. Except for the permitted procedures specified as 
palliative local therapies (Section 6.8.3), all other radiation therapy or surgery to any tumor 
lesion is not permitted during study treatment. Subjects who require such non -palliative 
procedures must be discontinued from study trea tment.  
 
6.8.2 Other  Restrictions  and Precautions  
Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg daily 
prednisone  equivalent)  or other  immunosuppressive  medications  within  14 days of first treatment 
are excluded. Inhal ed or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg daily 
prednisone equivalent, are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.  
 
It is the local imaging facility  ’ s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes (eg , 
allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and contrast 
regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks should be considered in 
this assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be  assessed as to whether or not they 
should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. If CT is 
contraindicated for a subject because of an iodinated contrast allergy, then a contrast enhanced 
MRI of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed. Specific to MRI, subjects with 
severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) 
are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should not be given to this 
subject population. In addition, subjects are excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic 
implants, pacemakers, etc. The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual subject in this 
study rests with the site radiologist, the investigator and the st andard set by the local Ethics 
Committee.  
 
6.8.3 Permitted  Therapy  
Subjects  are permitted  the use of topical,  ocular,  intra-articular,  intranasal,  and inhalational 
corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Adrenal replacement steroid doses > 10 mg 
daily  prednisone  are permitted.  A brief  (less than 3 weeks)  course  of corticosteroids  for 
prophylaxis  (eg, contrast  dye allergy)  or for treatment  of non-autoimmune  conditions  (eg, 
delayed -type hypersensitivity  reaction  caused  by a contact  allergen)  is permitted.  Regular

 concomitant use of bisphosphonates and RANK -L inhibitors for prevention or reduction of 
skeletal -related events in subjects with bone metastases is allowed if initiated prior to first dose  
of study  therapy.  Prior  palliative  radiotherapy  must  have  been  comp leted  at least 4 weeks  prior  to 
treatment.  
 
For patients with differentiated or medullary disease, prior palliative radiotherapy must have  
been completed at least 8 weeks prior to randomization for cases of radiotherapy to the head and 
neck, and completed within 4 weeks prior to randomization for radiotherapy to other sites. On 
study palliative radiotherapy is only allowed for treatment of painful bone lesions. Palliative 
surgical resection of tumor sites is not permitted. Subjects requiring palliative radi otherapy 
should be evaluated for objective evidence of disease progression prior to the initiation of such 
therapy,  particularly  if the most  recent  tumor  assessment  was more  than 4 weeks  prior  to the start 
of local therapy. If progression per RECIST 1.1 is  identified on any tumor assessments prior to 
the initiation of palliative local therapy, then subjects must either discontinue study drug 
treatment or they must meet criteria to continue treatment beyond progression in order to resume 
immunotherapy after palliative local therapy.  
 
Due to the aggressive nature of their disease, anaplastic thyroid cancer patients may receive 
palliative radiation to non -bone sites and/or resection at the investigator’s discretion. For these 
patients, the washout period for ra diation will be at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
The potential  for overlapping  toxicities  with radiotherapy  and nivolumab/ipilimumab  currently  is 
not known; however, anecdotal data suggests that it is tolerable. As concurrent radiotherapy and 
nivolumab/ipilimumab have not been formally evaluated, in cases where palliative radiotherapy 
is required for a  tumor lesion, then nivolumab/ipilimumab shou ld be withheld  for at  least 1 week 
before,  during,  and 1 week  after radiation.  Subjects  should  be closely  monitored  for any potential 
toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy, and AEs should resolve to Grade <=1 prior to 
resuming nivolumab or nivol umab plus ipilimumab.  
6.9 Holding  Study  Treatment  
 
Following disease control (i.e., stable disease or response) sustained over the course of a year or 
more of therapy (or as determined by the investigator), the investigator may decide to hold study 
treatment f or an extended period of time.  In this case, imaging will be continued with timing at 
investigator’s discretion.  The investigator may choose to restart study treatment based on scan 
results.  
 
7. ADVERSE  EVENTS:  LIST  AND  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse  event  (AE) monitoring  and reporting is  a routine  part of every  clinical trial. 
 
7.1 Adverse  Event  Characteristics

• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Probable  – The AE is likely  related  to the study treatment.  
- Possible  – The AE may be related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.  
 
7.2 Unanticipated/Life -Threatening  Problems  
 
In the event of an unanticipated problem or life -threatening complications, treating investigators 
must immediately notify the Overall PI.  
 
7.3 Multi -Center  Trial Requirements  
 
Each participating institution must abide by the reporting requirements set by the DF/HCC. This 
applies to any medical event equivalent to an unexpected grade 2 or 3 with a possible, probable 
or definite attribution, unexpected grade 4 toxicities, and grade 5 (death) regardless of study 
phase or attribution.  
 
7.4 DF/HCC  Adverse  Event  Reporti ng Guidelines  
 
Investigative sites within DF/HCC will report AEs directly to the DFCI Office for Human 
Research Studies (OHRS) per the DFCI IRB reporting policy.

 7.5 Expected Toxicities  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously ident ified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. Consistent with the mechanism of action of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab, the most frequently reported drug -related adverse events observed in clinical trials 
are those associated with activation of the immun e system. The most common types of immune - 
mediated adverse events include endocrinopathies, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
nephritis and rash. In the combination regimen, the frequency and intensity of these events may 
vary and depend on the sp ecific dose and schedule used.  
 
Management  of these  expected  toxicities  are described  in Appendix  B. 
 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochures and/or Package Inserts for more information on 
adverse events related to the study drugs.  
 
7.6 Routine  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
Investigators  will assess  the occurrence  of AEs and SAEs  at all participant  evaluation  time points 
during the study.  
 
All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly 
observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded  
in the participant’s med ical record and on the appropriate study -specific case report forms.  
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Active Version of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0) will be utilized for AE reporting. 
The CTEP Active Version of the CTCAE version 4.0 is identified and located on the CTEP 
website at:  
 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/c tc.htm . 
 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP Active Version of 
CTCAE.  
 
All Adverse Events must be reported in routine study data submissions to the Overall PI on the 
toxicity case rep ort forms.  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the 
IRB, FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 
7.7 Serious  Adverse  Event  Collection  and Reporting  
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occ ur within 30 days of 
discontinuation of dosing.  
 
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period. If applicable, SAEs must be 
collected  that relate  to any protocol -specified  procedure  (e.g.,  a follow -up skin biopsy).   The

related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  
 
7.8 Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporting  to Overall  PI 
Investigators must report to the Overall PI any serious adverse event (SAE) that occurs after the 
initial do se of study treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days of the last dose of treatment 
on the local institutional SAE form.  
 
Investigators will report AEs directly to the DFCI Office for Human Research Studies (OHRS) 
per the DFCI IRB reporting policy, us ing the local institutional SAE form.  
 
7.9 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
The Overall  PI, as study  sponsor,  will be responsible  for all communications  with the FDA.  The 
Overall  PI will report  to the FDA,  regardless  of the site of occurrence,  any serious  adverse  event 
that meets the FDA’s criteria for expedited reporting following the reporting requirements and 
timelines set by the FDA.  
 
SAEs should be reported on MedWatch  Form  3500A, which can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/.  
 
MedWatch  SAE  forms  should  be sent to the FDA  at:

7.10 Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporting  to Hospital  Risk  Management  
Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any participant 
safety reports or sentinel events that require reporting according to institutional policy.  
 
7.11 Expedited  Adverse  Event  Reporti ng to BMS  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on BMS or an approved form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
 
 
If only limited  information  is initial ly available,  follow -up reports  are required.  (Note:  Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  All SAEs 
should be followed to resolution or stabilization.

44  
 time points  will provide  fresh  tumor  samples  for analysis.  
 
Correlative blood samples will be drawn prior to treatment, at 2 weeks after start with either 
nivolumab or ipilimumab (end of week 2, prior to week 3) at week 9, and at 6 and 12 months 
after start of protocol treatment, and at the t ime of treatment discontinuation (or within 30 days 
after). Cell -free DNA will be analyzed using NexGen sequencing to detect the presence and 
changes in the amount of cell free DNA (cfDNA). Flow -based cell sorting will be used to 
determine if circulating t umor cells are present and how the proportion of CD4, CD8, and Treg 
cells changes over the course of treatment. These changes will be correlated with clinical 
response. We will also profile T cell neoantigens.  
 
Blood collection tubes as specified below wil l be obtained at the time points indicated in the 
study table.  There is a +/ - 3 day window (for obtaining these samples except for collection at  
W2 prior to start of second drug).  These collections will be taken at the time of routine blood 
collection time  points required for this study.  Specimens will be processed on site according to 
instructions below and shipped (via traceable carrier) to Dana -Farber Cancer Institute.  Once the 
shipment is received, samples will be subsequently processed, analyzed, and s tored at Dana - 
Farber Cancer Institute.  
 
All tubes should be transported at (ambient) room temperature. Collection kits containing the 
appropriate tubes will be sent to participating sites.  
 
Sequential biopsies are strongly recommended for patients with ac cessible tumor. These will 
consist of core needle biopsies and if necessary open biopsies.  
 
Samples will be subject to immune cell analysis by flow cytometry as previously described. Live 
cells will be used for in vitro analysis of immune response in the o rganotypic tumor spheroid 
culture system in either the lab of Dr. David Barbie or the Bowden lab where response to 
nivolumab and ipilimumab will be determined. The responses seen in vitro will be correlated 
with clinical response. Biopsies may be obtained prior to treatment start, after 2 weeks of 
treatment with one drug alone, following restaging CT scans at 8 weeks (within a 10 day 
window) and at time of progression.  
 
TIL’s will undergo RNA sequencing to determine changes of expression in response to 
nivolumab, ipilimumab or both drugs combined. This will allow to identify antigens involved in 
immune response as well as resistance mechanisms that could account for primary or secondary 
resistance  and tumor  progression.  
 
 
The tissue will be used to assess PD -1, PDL -1 expression, T -cell infiltration on IHC and flow 
cytometry.  
 
Whole exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing to assess changes in expression profile 
will be performed.  Single  cell sequencing  of infiltrating  immune  cells will be performed  as well.

 Tissue  will be stained  for STING  protein  expression.  
 
These studies will provide information that will help to identify patterns indicative of response 
and resistance to immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in thyroid cancer.  
 
As additional hypotheses about the drivers of response and resistance arise over the course of the 
study, investigators may choose to use additional tissue testing methodologies beyond those laid 
out above. Investigators may also request additional archival tissue for such testing.  
 
Non-DF/HCC sites will be responsible for shipping samples via overnight delivery to DF/HCC 
on the day of collection. DF/HCC will provide shipment instructions to participating sites. This 
applies only to biomarker samples (routine  laboratory samples will be analyzed locally).  
 
10. STUDY  CALENDAR  
 
Baseline evaluations are to  be conducted within  3 weeks prior to  study  registration. If these 
screening  assessments  occur  within  3 days before  start of study  treatment,  then they may serve  as 
the baseline cycle 1 day 1 values and do not need to be repeated. Each treatment cycle will be 6 
weeks  long.  Scans  must  be done  <4 weeks  prior  to study  registration.  
 
As detailed in the Study Calendar, a negative pregnancy test in women of child -bearing potential 
must be documented within 24 hours of the first dose of study drug.  
 
Laboratory evaluations do not need to be repeated to meet eligibility criteria on date of first 
treatment dose, if they were done within 3 days of the first treatment dose.  
 
In the event that the participant’s condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be 
repeated within 48 hours prior to initiation of the next treatment dose.  
 
Assessments must be performed prior to administration of any study agent. Study asses sments 
and agents should be administered within + 3 days of the protocol -specified date, unless 
otherwise noted.

11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
11.1 Antitumor  Effect  – Solid  Tumors  
 
For the purposes  of this study,  participants  should  be re-evaluated for  response  every  8 weeks (or 
as clinically indicated).  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be 
obtained 8 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (ver sion 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
 
11.1.1  Definitions  
 
Evaluable for Target Disease response.  Only those participants who have measurable 
disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their 
disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for target disease response.  These 
participants will have their response classified according to the definitions stated below. 
(Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Res ponse . Participants who have lesions present at 
baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the 
presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2  Disease  Parameters  
 
Measurable disease . Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm by  
chest x -ray or ≥10 mm with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor  lesions  that are situated  in a previously  irradiated  area might  or might  not be 
considered measurable.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other lesions (or  sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangit is cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all considered 
non-measurable.  
 
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts  
should  not be consi dered  as malignant  lesions  (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)

48  
 since  they are, by definition,  simple  cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non - 
cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for sele ction as  
target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesi ons should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasio n, the largest lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal lesions)  for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline  sum diameters.  If lymph  nodes  are to be included  in the sum,  then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characteriz e any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods  for Evaluation  of Disease  
 
All measurements should  be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital  measurement  tool. All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during fol low-up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 
Clinical lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they a re 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is r ecommended.  
 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however, CT is preferable.

Conventional CT and MRI.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice 
thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice  
the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e .g. for body scans).  
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable glo bally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow -up should be the same as was  used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type  of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
FDG -PET.  While FDG -PET response assessments need addi tional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the  following algorithm:  
(a) Negative  FDG -PET at baseline,  with a positive  FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
(b) No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of di sease confirmed by CT, this is 
PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease 
on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
(c) FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The u se of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches 
may lead to false positive CR due to limitat ions of FDG -PET and biopsy 
resolution/sensitivity.  
 
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
PET-CT. At present, the low dose or  attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always  of optimal  diagnostic  CT quality  for use with RECIST

50  
 measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic qu ality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET p ortion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
 
MIBG (meta -iodobenzylguanidine).  The following is recommended, to assure high 
quality images are obtained.  
 
Patient  preparation:  Iodides,  usually  SSKI  (saturated  solution  of potassium  iodide), 
are administered to reduce thyroidal accumulation of free radioiodine, preferably 
beginning  the day prior  to injection  and continuing  for 3 additional  days (4 days 
total).  For infants  and children,  one drop t.i.d. is sufficient,  for adolescents  2 drops 
t.i.d.,  and for adults  3 drops  t.i.d. Participants  and/or  parents  are asked  about  exposure 
to potential interfering agents. If none is noted, an indwelling intrav enous line is 
established. The dose of MIBG is administered by slow intravenous injection over 90 
seconds.  Images  from  the head  to the distal  lower  extremities  should  be obtained.  
 
I-123MIBG scintigraphy is performed to obtain both planar and tomographic images.  
Planar:  Anterior  and posterior  views  from  the top of the head  to the proximal  lower 
extremities  are obtained  for 10 minutes  at 24 hours  and occasionally  at 48 hours 
following  injection  of 10 mCi/1.7  square  meters  of body  surface  area (~150  μCi/kg, 
maximum  10 mCi).  Anterior  views  of the distal  lower  extremities  are adequate.  A 
large  field of view  dual head  gamma  camera  with low energy  collimators  is preferred.  
 
SPECT: Most participants receiving I -123 MIBG also undergo SPECT at 24 hours,  
using a single or multi -headed camera with a low energy collimator. The camera is 
rotated through 360 degrees, 120 projections at 25 seconds per stop. Data are 
reconstructed usin g filtered back projections with a Butterworth filter and a cut off 
frequency  of 0.2-0.5. SPECT/CT  may be performed  at institutions  with this capacity.  
 
Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety  for independent  review  at a later data and, because  they are operator  dependent,  it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study,  confirmation  by CT or MRI  is advised.  If there  is concern  about  radiation  expo sure 
from CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
Tumor  markers.  Tumor  markers  alone  cannot  be used to assess  response.  If markers  are

51  
 initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response 
(in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have be en 
published [JNCI 96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 
26:1148 -1159,  2008].  In addition,  the Gynecologic  Cancer  Intergroup  has developed  CA- 
125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment fo r 
use in first -line trials in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
 
Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, suc h as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease  is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
11.1.4.1  Evaluation  of Target  Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference  the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the  
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to quali fy for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
11.1.4.2  Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions  
 
Complete  Response  (CR) : Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This document  is confidential. Do  not disclose  or use except aIsRaButhAoPrizPedR. 
52  
  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or  
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the  treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
 
11.1.4.3  Evaluation  of New  Lesions  
 
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. no t due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or 
flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will 
indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirm ed, 
progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion 
was discovered.  
 
11.1.4.4  Evaluation  of Best Overall  Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note : Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.1.5  Duration  of Response  
 
Duration  of overall  response : The duration  of overall  response  is measured  from  the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first  
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive  disease  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  the treatment  started,  or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation).  
 
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for  CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events  
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation.  
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start  of the treatment  
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

11.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
 
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. 
Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease 
evaluation.  
 
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time fro m 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease 
evaluation for those without progression reported.  
 
 
11.1.7  Response Review  
 
For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint, it is strongly recommended  
that all responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s 
completion.  Simultaneous review of the participants’ files and radiological images  is the 
best approach.

13. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Prior to Amendment 7, patients with DTC, MTC, and ATC were randomized to Arms 1 and 2. 
With approval of Amendment 7, patients with ATC were no longer randomized into Arms 1 and 
2, but rather registered into Arm 3 (for a total of n=7 patient s with ATC entered into Arms 1, 2, 
and 3). With approval of Amendment 12, the accrual for the ATC cohort was increased to n=10.  
 
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate efficacy in terms of best overall response rate 
(CR+PR) for patients with DT C. The purpose of the randomization with nivolumab and 
ipilimumab starting sequentially is to provide opportunities via the correlatives to study the 
specific  immunologic  changes that occur  in response  to either  drug alone  as well  as both drugs  in 
combinat ion. Although patients will be randomized between arms, no differences in terms of 
efficacy are expected, therefore, for the primary endpoint of response, the arms will be analyzed 
together.  
 
A two -stage design (Simon’s minimax design) will be used to min imize the number of pts 
enrolled. Twenty -three eligible patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who start 
protocol  treatment  are to be accrued  in the first stage.  If there  are ≤ 2 patients  with DTC  with

56  
 disease in response, accrual to this trial will be closed with the expectation that there is little 
evidence that the response rate will reach 25%. The probability that the trial will close early is 
59% if the true response rate is 10%. If there are >2 pat ients with DTC with disease in response, 
accrual will continue until a total of 32 eligible patients with DTC who start protocol treatment 
are entered. If there are >5 patients with DTC with disease in response among 32 eligible  
patients with DTC who began  protocol treatment, further testing of this regimen will be 
considered. If the true response rate is 25%, the probability of concluding the regimen is  
effective is 84%, if the true response rate is 10%, the probability of concluding the regimen is 
effecti ve is 9%. In addition, n=7 medullary and n=10 anaplastic thyroid patients will also be 
included as exploratory cohorts. Allowing for patients to be declared ineligible and/or not start 
protocol treatment after registration, a total of 54 pts will be entere d into Arms 1, 2, and 3. The 
following stratification factor will be used for Arms 1 and 2 only in order to prevent imbalance 
across treatment arms:  
• Histology  (differentiated  thyroid  cancer  vs. medullary  thyroid  cancer)  
(Prior to Amendment 7, patients with  anaplastic thyroid cancer were also randomized, and as of 
approval of Amendment 7, patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer will no longer be randomized, 
they will instead be entered into Arm 3 (see schema and section 5 for details)).  
 
The primary efficacy  population includes all eligible patients with DTC who begin protocol 
treatment. Best overall response will be summarized as a proportion with a corresponding exact 
95% confidence interval (CI) (if the trial closes to accrual after the first stage), or a  
corresponding 95% two -stage CI if the trial closes to accrual after the second stage. Best overall 
response for patients with medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer will also be summarized.  
 
For secondary  objectives:  Adverse  events  will be classified  and graded  according  to the CTCAE  
v.4.0. Frequencies of adverse events will be summarized among patients who begin protocol 
therapy overall and within histologic type. The distributions of progression and survival will be 
estimated within histologic subtype using a Kaplan -Meier method with  corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for the median or time -specific event time. Several correlative studies are 
also planned.  Given  the small  sample  size of this trial, these  studies  are exploratory.  Samples  will 
be collected at baseline and at post -baseline timepoints as outlined in the protocol. Markers from 
the patients with evaluable samples will be summarized descriptively and graphically. Within 
subject changes in markers will also be analyzed. Assuming 32 patients with DTC with baseline 
and a pos t-baseline value provides 82% power to detect .54 SD mean difference (Wilcoxon sign 
rank test two -sided 0.05 alpha level). Markers from the patients with evaluable samples within 
medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer will also be summarized descriptively . 
 
With an estimated monthly accrual of 1 -2 patients, the first stage of accrual for patients with  
DTC is estimated to complete accrual in approximately 18 months. Due to possible delays in 
initiation of approval at other sites, in initiation of accrual itself, accrual to the first stage could 
take 24 months.  As is customary with this type of design, ac crual will be suspended after the 
first stage (n=23 eligible patients) in order to assess outcome; however, this suspension is also 
dependent on the actual observed accrual rate and the number of patients with confirmation of 
disease response status while the first stage of the trial is accruing

 14. PUBLICATION  PLAN  
 
The results should be made public within 24 months of reaching the end of the study. The end of 
the study is the time point at which the last data items are to be reported, or after t he outcome 
data are sufficiently mature for analysis, as defined in the section on Sample Size, Accrual Rate 
and Study Duration. If a report is planned to be published in a peer -reviewed journal, then that 
initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical  Journal  Editors.  A full report  of the outcomes  should  be made  public  no later than three  
(3) years after the end of the study.

 APPENDIX  D  METHODS  OF CONTRACEPTION  
At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effective OR one less effective method of 
contraception as listed below:  
 
Highly  Effective Methods of Contraception  
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently  
and correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to 
use one of the highly  effective  methods  of contraception  listed  below.  Male subjects  must  inform 
their female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements of the protocol and are 
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner. Contraception methods are as 
follows:  
1. Progestogen  only hormonal  contraceptio n associated  with inhibition  of ovulation.  
2. Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pills containing combined 
estrogen + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such 
as Mirena®  
3. Nonhormonal  IUDs, such as ParaGard®  
4. Bilateral  tubal  occlusion  
5. Vasectomised  partner  with documented  azoospermia  90 days after procedure  
Vasectomised  partner  is a highly  effective  birth  control  method  provided  that partner  is the sole 
sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success.  
6. Intrauterine  hormone -releasing  system  (IUS).  
7. Complete  abstinence  
Complete  abstinence  is defined  as the complete  avoidance  of heterosexual  intercourse.  
Complete  abstinence  is an acceptable  form  of contraception  for all study  drugs  and must  be used 
throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 half -lives of the investigational drug plus 
30 days).  
It is not necessary  to use any other  method  of contraception  when  complete  abstinence  is elected.  
Subjects  who choose  complete  abstinence  must continue  to have pregnancy  tests 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event 
that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  
 
Less  Effective Methods  of Contraception  
1. Diaphragm  with spermicide  
2. Cervical  cap with spermicide  
3. Vaginal  sponge  with spermicide  
4. Male  or female  condom  with or without  spermicide*  
5. Progestogen -only oral hormonal  contraception,  where  inhibition  of ovulation  is not the 
primary mode of action  
* A male and a female  condom must not be used together.  
 
Unacceptable  Methods  of Contraception  
1. Periodic  abstinence  (calendar,  symptothermal,  post-ovulation  methods)  
2. Withdrawal  (coitus  interruptus)

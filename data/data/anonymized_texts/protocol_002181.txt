Study Duration  Part 1  
The total study duration is approximately 10 weeks. Subjects will receive study drug for 
approximately 2 weeks.  
Part  2  
The total study duration is approximately 16 weeks for subjects in Cohort  2A and 
18 weeks for subjects in Cohort  2B.  
Study drug will be administered for approximately 8  weeks in Cohort  2A and 
approximately 10 weeks in Cohort  2B. 
  
Study Design  This is a Phase  2, 2-part (Parts 1 and 2) , randomized, double -blind, placebo - and 
VX-661/IVA -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety 
of VX -152 in TC with VX -661 and IVA.  
Parts 1 and 2 will enroll multiple cohorts, with each cohort evaluating 1 dose level of 
VX-152 as part of TC with VX -661/IVA (100 mg daily [qd]/150 mg every 12 hours 
[q12h]). Each cohort will enroll up to approximately 12 subjects  in Part 1 and Part  2 
Cohort  2A and up to approximately 24  subjects in Part  2 Cohort  2B. Subjects in all 
cohorts  will be randomized 3:1 (active TC:comparator). Triple placebo will be the 
compara tor in Part 1, and VX -661/IVA will be the comparator in Part 2.  
Up to 3  cohorts are planned for Part 1 (Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C). Up to 2 cohorts are 
planned for Part 2 (Cohorts 2A and 2B). The doses of VX -152 planned for evaluation are 
100 mg q12h in Cohor t 1A, 200 mg q12h in Cohorts 1B and 2A, and 300 mg q12h in 
Cohorts  1C and 2B.  The dose of VX -152 may be adjusted to be lower or the same as the 
dose level evaluated in the previous cohort.  
The actual number of cohorts enrolled in each part may be modified based on emerging 
safety and PK data. Blinded reviews of safety and available PK data will be conducted by 
the Vertex study team and lead investigator(s) on an ongoing basis.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Assessments  Safety:  AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical 
examinations (PEs), and ophthalmologic examinations  
PD: sweat chloride  
Efficacy: spirometry, CFQ -R 
PK: Plasma concentrations of VX -152, VX -661, M1 -661, IVA, M1 -IVA 
 
  
Statistical 
Analyses  Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of safety and tolerability of VX -152 in 
TC with VX -661/IVA.  
The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, 12 -lead ECGs, vital signs, 
and pulse oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit . The safety analysis for all 
treatment groups in both parts will be descriptive only.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The s econdary objectives of the study include the evaluation of the PD effect of VX -152 
in TC with VX -661/IVA, and the evaluation of the efficacy of VX -152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA.  
The PD endpoint is the absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Day  15 of a 
non-decreasing dose -response trend in the mean absolute change from baseline at Day 15 
for sweat chloride, between placebo and the TC dose groups will be tested using a 
multiple comparisons procedure based on the 1 -sided maximum t-statistic. In both p arts, 
the null within -group hypothesis of no decrease in the mean absolute change from baseline 
at Day 15, for sweat chloride in the TC treatment groups, will be tested using a 1 -sided 
1-sample  t-test within the mixed -effects model for repeated measures (M MRM) 
framework at a 5% alpha level, with baseline value as a covariate. The adjusted means and 
2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, for all within -group 
and between -group comparisons will be estimated within MMRM.  
The efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline at Day 15 for ppFEV 1. In both 
parts, the null within -group hypothesis of no increase in the mean absolute from baseline 
at Day 15, for ppFEV 1 in the TC treatment groups, will be tested using a 1 -sided 1-sample  
t-test within MMRM at a 5% alpha level. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, for all within -group and between -group 
compariso ns will be estimated within MMRM.  
  
Interim 
Analyses  Interim analy ses for each cohort may be performed after all subjects in the cohort have 
completed the Day 15 Visit.  
  
IDMC Reviews  The independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular planned safety 
reviews of study data from all parts of the study as outlined in the IDMC Charter.

a  Assessments will be performed in the order presented, unless noted otherwise. All assessments will be performed before dosing, unless noted otherwise. 
Assessments that are collected before and after dosing will only be collected once if study drug is not administered on the day of the visit (i.e., premature 
discontinuation of study drug treatment). 
b  To be eligible to continue into the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease and have remained on stable CF medication regimen during the 
28 days before the Day 1 Visit AND must not have had an acute non-CF illness within 14 days before the Day 1 Visit. See Section 8.1.3 . 
c  If the subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an ETT Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study drug 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or 
later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not be 
required. 
d  All screening results must be reviewed before randomization, unless noted otherwise. 
e  Days 3, 5, and 11 assessments may be collected at the clinic, at a local laboratory, or during a visit by a qualified individual (e.g., home nurse). 
f  Day 3 and Day 5 assessments will be performed at least 2 days apart, with the first day of assessments occurring no earlier than Day 3 and the second day of 
assessments occurring no later than Day 6. (i.e., Assessments will be performed on Days 3 and 5, Days 4 and 6, or Days 3 and 6.) 
g  Randomization may occur on the previous day (Day -1) after all inclusion and exclusion criteria have been confirmed. See Section 8.1.3 . 
h  CFQ- R must be completed before the start of any other assessments scheduled at that visit. 
i  The predose assessment on Day 1 may be performed on the previous day (Day -1) if randomization has occurred.

m  Complete and abbreviated PEs are described in Section 11.7.3 . Symptom-targeted PEs will occur at any time during the study if triggered by AEs or if 
deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider. 
n  The ophthalmological examination can be performed at any time during the Screening Period through the Day 1 Visit (before the first dose of study drug). 
The screening ophthalmological examination does not have to be performed if there is documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and was 
within 3 months before the date of informed consent, or if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. 
o  All standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be collected before procedures that may 
affect heart rate (e.g., blood sampling). On Days 1 and 15, ECGs will be collected before dosing and 4 hours (± 1 hour) after dosing. At all other visits, 
ECGs will be collected before dosing (as applicable). ECGs collected on Day 1 before dosing will be performed in triplicate.  
p  Sweat chloride will be measured in all subjects. If the value cannot be determined from the screening test, a sweat chloride value documented in the subject’s 
medical record may be used to establish eligibility. 
q  Spirometry may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator at the Screening Visit. Spirometry will be performed pre-bronchodilator, before the morning dose 
of study drugs, and should be performed at approximately the same time at every other study visit. On Days 1 and 15, spirometry will also be performed 
pre-bronchodilator 5 hours (± 1 hour) after study drug administration.

a  Assessments will be performed in the order presented, unless noted otherwise. All assessments will be performed before dosing, unless noted otherwise. 
Assessments that are collected before and after dosing will only be collected once if study drug is not administered on the day of the visit (i.e., 
premature discontinuation of study drug treatment). 
b  To be eligible to continue into the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease and have remained on stable CF medication regimen during 
the 28 days before the Day 1 Visit AND must not have had an acute non-CF illness within 14 days before the Day 1 Visit. See Section 8.1.3 . 
c  If the subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an ETT Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study drug 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks 
or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow- up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not 
be required. 
d  Subjects who meet criteria specified in Section 8.1.5  will not have a Safety Follow-up Visit. 
e  All screening results must be reviewed before the subject receives VX-661/IVA in the Run-in Period on Day -28, unless noted otherwise.  
f  The Day -14 Visit is only required for subjects who are naïve to VX-661/IVA treatment. 
g  Days 3, 5, and 11 assessments may be collected at the clinic, at a local laboratory, or during a visit by a qualified individual (e.g., home nurse). 
h  Day 3 and Day 5 assessments will be performed at least 2 days apart, with the first day of assessments occurring no earlier than Day 3 and the second 
day of assessments occurring no later than Day 6. (i.e., Assessments will be performed on Days 3 and 5, Days 4 and 6, or Days 3 and 6.) 
i  Randomization may occur on the previous day (Day -1) after all inclusion and exclusion criteria and criteria for entry into the Treatment Period have 
been confirmed. See Section 8.1.3 . 
j  CFQ-R must be completed before the start of any other assessments scheduled at that visit. 
k  The predose assessment on Day 1 may be performed on the previous day (Day -1) if randomization has occurred. 
l  Subjects will complete the CFQ-R at the ETT Visit only if it has been 2 weeks or more since their last visit.

o  Complete and abbreviated PEs are described in Section 11.7.3 . Symptom-targeted PEs will occur at any time during the study if triggered by AEs or if 
deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider. 
p  The ophthalmological examination can be performed at any time during the Screening Period through the Day 1 Visit (before the first dose of study 
drug). The screening ophthalmological examination does not have to be performed if there is documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria 
and was within 3 months before the date of informed consent, or if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. 
q  Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the subject has been seated for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be collected before procedures that may 
affect heart rate (e.g., blood sampling). On Days 1, 15, and 29, ECGs will be collected before dosing and 4 hours (± 1 hour) after dosing. At all other 
visits, ECGs will be collected before dosing (as applicable). ECGs collected on Day 1 before dosing will be performed in triplicate.  
r  Sweat chloride will be measured in all subjects. If the value cannot be determined from the screening test, a sweat chloride value documented in the 
subje ct’s medical record may be used to establish eligibility.

s  Spirometry may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator at the Screening Visit. Spirometry will be performed pre-bronchodilator, before the morning 
dose of study drugs, and should be performed at approximately the same time at every other study visit. On Days 1, 15, and 29, spirometry will be 
performed pre-bronchodilator 5 hours (± 1 hour) after study drug administration.  
t  CFTR  genotyping will be performed for all subjects. If the screening CFTR genotype result is not received before Day -28, a previous CFTR  genotype 
laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility.

.1 Background 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects more than 70,000 children and adults worldwide1 and is the most 
common fatal genetic disease in persons of European descent.2 CF is caused by a defect in 
the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an ion channel that 
regulates the flow of chloride and other ions in epithelia of various tissues, including lungs, 
pancreas and other gastrointestinal org
ans, and sweat glands.2 Decreased CFTR activity in 
people with CF results in multisystem pathology3, beginning at birth. Despite progress in the 
treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the median predicted survival age for a 
person with CF is approximately 40 years.2,4 More effective treatments are needed for CF. 
To address this medical need, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is developing treatment 
regimens that include CFTR modulators to target the underlying cause of CF: the defective 
CFTR protein. Two types of CFTR modulators have been developed: potentiators, which 
increase the channel gating activity of the CFTR protein, and correctors, which increase the 
quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Because potentiators can increase the activity of CFTR 
protein delivered to the cell surface by correctors, CFTR potentiators and correctors are 
complementary therapeutic approaches. 
Ivacaftor (IVA; Kalydeco®), the first CFTR modulator developed by Vertex, is an orally 
administered CFTR potentiator that increases the channel-open probability of CFTR protein 
to enhance chloride transport. Globally, Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of CF in 
patients as young as 2 years who have the G551D  and certain other gating mutations as well 
as the R117H  mutation in the CFTR  gene depending on the country.5 
Lumacaftor (LUM) and VX-661 are orally administered first-generation CFTR correctors 
developed by Vertex that act directly on CFTR to improve its cellular processing and 
trafficking, thereby increasing the quantity of functional F508del-CFTR protein at the cell 
surface. F508del , the most prevalent mutation in people with CF, occurs in about 83% of CF 
patients and results in a decreased quantity of CFTR protein at the cell surface. Orkambi™ 
(LUM/IVA combination therapy) is approved in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia for 
patients 12 years and older who are homozygous for F508del . Phase 3 studies of 
VX-661/IVA combination therapy are ongoing in populations that are homozygous or 
heterozygous for F508del . 
VX-152 is a second-generation CFTR corrector that acts through a different site of the CFTR 
protein than LUM and VX-661. In vitro, VX-152 improves the processing and trafficking of 
F508del-CFTR, thereby increa
sing the quantity of functional F508del-CFTR protein at the 
cell surface. Consistent with different mechanisms of action, the effects of VX-152 and 
VX-661 are additive. The activity of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by 
VX-152, alone or in combination with VX-661, is potentiated by IVA. In human bronchial 
epithelial (HBE) cells derived from CF patients homozygous for F508del , the triple 
combination (TC) of VX-152, VX-661, and IVA increased CFTR-mediated chloride 
transport more than the dual combinations (VX-152 and VX-661; VX-152 and IVA; VX-661 
and IVA) or individual agents (VX-152; VX-661; IVA). These data, as well as the

macokinetic (PK) and safety profile, support the development of VX-152 in 
combination with other CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF.  
5.2 Rationale for the Present Study 
The present study is the first clinical study of VX-152 in subjects with CF and is designed to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, PK, and efficacy of VX-152 
in TC with VX-661 and IVA. 
VX-152 has be
en studied in vitro and in vivo, and the safety profile in the nonclinical 
toxicology studies supports clinical development of VX-152.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Base
d on in vitro results and modeling of in vitro and in vivo data, there is the potential for 
clinical efficacy at a safe dose, providing the rational for the present study.

8.1 Overview of  Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and VX-661/IVA-controlled, 
parallel-group, multicenter study designed to evaluate the safety of VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA.  
Up to approximately 72 subjects with CF are planned for enrollment: up to approximately 
36 subjects in each of Part 1 ( F508del /MF genotype) and in Part 2 ( F508del/ F508del  
genotype).  
Parts 1 and 2 will enroll multiple cohorts, w ith each cohort evalua ting 1 dose level of 
VX-152 as part of TC with VX-661/IVA (100 mg qd/150 mg q12h). Each cohort will enroll 
up to approximately 12 subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 Cohort 2A and up to approximately 
24 subjects in Part 2 Cohort 2B. Subjects in all cohorts will be randomized 3:1 (active 
TC:comparator). Triple placebo will be the comparator in Part 1, and VX-661/IVA will be 
the comparator in Part 2. 
Up to 3 cohorts are planned for Part 1 (Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 1C). Up to 2 cohorts are planned 
for Part 2 (Cohorts 2A and 2B). The doses of VX-152 planned for evaluation are 100 mg 
q12h in Cohort 1A, 200 mg q12h in Cohorts 1B a nd 2A, and 300 mg q12h in Cohorts 1C and 
2B. The dose of VX-152 may be adjusted to be lower or the same as the dose level evaluated 
in the previous cohort. The actual number of cohorts enrolled in each part may be modified based on emerging 
safety and PK data. Blinded reviews of safety and available PK data will be conducted by the 
Vertex study team and lead investigator(s) on an ongoing basis. Cohorts will initiate dosing as follows: 
 Cohort 1A will initiate dosing first.  
 Cohorts 1B and 2A may initia te dosing if supported by blinded review of safety and 
available PK data after all subjects in  Cohort 1A complete the Day 15 Visit. 
 Cohorts 1C and 2B may initiate dosing if supported by blinded review of safety and 
available PK data after any of the following has occurred: 
o All subjects in Cohort 1B complete the Day 15 Visit. 
o All subjects in Cohort 2A complete the Day 15 Visit. 
o At least 12 subjects across Cohorts 1B and 2A complete the Day 15 Visit. 
A schematic of the study design (including the doses of VX-152, VX-661, and IVA to be 
evaluated) is shown in Figure 8-1.

creening 
For Part 1, the Screening Period will occur within 28 days before the first dose of study drug 
in the Treatment Period. For P
art 2, the Screening Period will occur within 28 days before the 
first dose of VX-661/IVA in the Run-in Pe
riod.  
The assessments to be conducted are shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3 and will 
be used to confirm that s
ubjects mee
t the eligibility criteria for the study. The investigator (or 
an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent from each subject before 
any study procedure takes place.  
The screening ophthalmologic examination does not have to be performed if there is 
documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and was within 3 months before 
the date of informed consent (Section 
11.7.6) or if there is documentation of bilateral lens 
removal for the subject.  
8.1.
1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) 
Repetition of individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria is not 
permitted with the following excepti
ons:  
 If there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolyzed sample) or equipment 
malfunction, collection of a rep
eat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or 
assessment may be permitted with the approval of the medical monitor. 
 Exclusionary liver function test (LFT) levels, which may be retested once within 14 days 
of the original screening date, w
ith approval of the medical monitor. 
If screening spirometry measurements fail to meet acceptability and repeatability criteria as 
specified by American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines,6 repeat 
spirometry evaluation may be performed once. 
If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and 
completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 
8.1.1.2  Rescreening 
Subjects may only be rescreened with the approval of the medical monitor. If a subject is 
rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR  genotyping, 
follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was ≥40  mIU/mL during prior 
screening), G6PD activity test (if total bilirubin level was <2 × upper limit of normal [ULN] 
during prior screening), sweat chloride level, and the ophthalmologic examination (if 
documentation shows it was performed within the last 3 months). If a subject is rescreened, 
the new screening window will begin once
 the first rescreening assessment has been initiated.

.3 Extension of Screening Period Window 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks, without medical 
monitor approval, for the following reasons: 
 Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 8.1.1.1) 
 To meet the eligibility criteria 
 Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (Section 11.7.6) 
 Repetition of spirometry assessment if results are of poor quality 
A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 4 weeks, without medical 
monitor approval, for the following reason: 
 For Part  1 subjects, washout of VX-661/IVA if enrolling from Study VX14-661-110 
(Study 661-110) 
 Operational or logistic delays 
8.1.2  Run-in Period (Part 2) 
The Run-in Period will have a total duration of 4 weeks and is designed to establish a reliable 
on-treatment (VX-661/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of 
VX-661/IVA will be administered at the Day
 -28 Visit. The last dose of VX-661/IVA within 
the Run-in Period will be administered in the evening of Da
y -1 (1 day before the Day 1 
Visit).  
Study eligibility for Part 2 subj
ects will be confirmed before the first dose of VX-661/IVA in 
the Run-in Period (on Day -28). 
Study visits during the Run-in Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. All 
visits will occur within the windows specified. 
8.1.3  Treatment Period 
For Part 1, the Treatment Period will last approximately 2 weeks. For Part 2, the Treatment 
Period will last approximately 2 weeks for subj
ects in Cohort 2A and approximately 4 weeks 
for subjects in Cohort 2B. 
Study visits during the Tre
atment Period will occ
ur as shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and 
Table 3-3. All visits should occur within the windows specified. Study drug administration 
details are provided in Section 10.2. 
Subjec
ts must meet both of the following criteria to continue into t
he Treatment Period: 
 Must have stable CF disease (as judged by the investigator) and have remained on a 
stable CF medication regimen during the 28 days before the Day 1 Visit. (For example, 
subjects cannot have an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary 
exacerbation, or changes in therapy [including antibiotics] for pulmonary disease within 
28 days before the Day 1 Visit.)  
 Must not have had an acute non-CF illness (e.g., gastroenteritis) within the 14 days 
before the Day 1 Visit.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                If these c
riteria are not met, subjects may not be randomized and enter into the Treatment 
Period. 
Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and 
will occur on Day 1 (or Day -1) after all criteria for entry into the Treatment Period have 
been confirmed. Study eligibility for Part
 1 subjects will be confirmed before randomization. 
For Part 2, subjects who prematurely discontinue VX-661/IVA during
 the Run-in Period will 
not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period.  
8.1.4  Washout Period (Part 2) 
The Washout Period will last approximately 2 weeks and is designed to allow for the 
measurement of off-treatment effects. Subjects will continue
 to receive VX-661/IVA during 
the Washout Period. 
Study visits during the Washout Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. All 
visits should occur within the windows specified. 
8.1.5  Follow- up 
The Safety Follow-up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3. 
There will be an outpatient Safety Follow-up Visit occurring approximately 28 days after the 
last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who 
prematurely discontinue study drug dosing. 
The following subjects will not have a Safety Follow-up Visit: 
 Part 2 subjects who do not meet the criteria to enter the Treatment Period ( Section 8.1.3), 
and re-enter Study 661-110 
 Part 2 subjects in Cohort 2A who complete the Day 29 Visit and re-enter Study 661-110  
 Part 2 subjects in Cohort 2B who complete the Day 43 Visit and re-enter Study 661-110 
All other subjects will have a Safety Follow-up Vi
sit. 
8.1.6  Early Termination of Treatment  
If a subject prematurely discontinues treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) 
Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study drug 
treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete 
the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days after their last dose of study drug. The 
assessments performed at the Safety Follow-up Visit are li
sted in  Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and 
Table 3-3. 
If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose
 of study drug, then the ETT 
Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit, and a separa
te Safety Follow-up Visit will not 
be required.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal 
of consent.

pendent Data Monitoring Committee 
This study will be monitored by an external independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), 
which will conduct periodic reviews of safety data from all parts of the study 
(Section 12.3.6.2). Procedura
l details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of 
meetings, and data planne
d for review will be included in the IDMC Charter. The IDMC 
Charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened.  
8.2 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 
8.2.1  Study Design 
This Phase 2 study is the first clinical study of VX-152 in subjects with CF. It is designed to 
evaluate the safety of VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA and to establish proof-of-concept in 
2 populations of subjects defined by CFTR  genotype: subjects heterozygous for the 
F508del-CFTR  mutation with a second CFTR  mutation not expected to respond to 
VX-661/IVA ( F508del /minimal function [MF]) (Part 1) and subjects homozygous for 
F508del  (F508del /F508del ) (Part 2). 
Based on in vitro data, TC is predicted to provide clinically relevant improvements in 
chloride transport in both populations, though the magnitude of response may not be the 
same in these populations. The subjects will be
 evaluated by genotype in separate cohorts in 
Parts 1 and 2, based on the potential for differences in the magnitude of treatment response 
among these genotype categories. PD will be evaluated through the assessment of sweat 
chloride, and efficacy will be evaluated through the assessment of spirometry and patient 
reported outcomes. Part 1 of the study will also obtain information regarding the 
exposure-response relationship (Section 12.1.2.1 ). 
Placebo is the comparator in Pa
rt 1, as efficacy has not been established for a corrector, 
potentiator, or corrector/potentiator combination in subjects with F508del /MF genotypes. 
VX-661/IVA is the comparator in Part 2, based on the potential for benefit demonstrated for 
VX-661/IVA in subjects with the  F508del /F508del  genotype in Study VX11-661-101.7 
Part 2 will have a 4-we
ek run-in period to establish a reliable on-treatment (VX-661/IVA) 
baseline for comparison t
o the Treatment Period, when subjects will additionally receive 
VX-152 or placebo. Off-treatment effects will also be measured at the Safety Follow-up Visit 
in Part 1 and at the end of the W
ashout Period in Part 2. 
8.2.2  Study Drug Dose a
nd Duration 
Part 1 wil
l evaluate up to 3 dose levels of VX-152 (100, 200, and 300 mg q12h) in TC with 
VX-661/IVA in subjects with the F508del /MF genotype.  
 
  
The dose
 escalation of VX-152 is no more
 than 2-fold.  
 
 
  
   

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 35 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                Up to 3 dose levels of VX
-152 will be evaluated as part of the TC in Part 1 to provide a range 
of doses and exposures that will enable dose-response and exposure-response analyses for 
PD (Section 12.1.2.1). Dose- and exposure-response information obtained from Part 1 
(F508del /MF genoty
pe) is expected to be applicable to other populations with an F508del  
mutation, including F508del /F508del  genotypes, based on similar in vitro potency for the TC 
in HBE cells with 1 or 2 copies of F508del .8  
The dose of VX-661 and IVA (100 mg qd and 150 mg q12h) in the TC are the same doses 
currently under eva
luation in Phase 3 studies of VX-661/IVA. These doses of VX-661 and 
IVA are appropriate for evaluation in the TC based on in vitro experiments with VX-152 
which evaluated similar levels of VX-661 and IVA exposure after correction for protein-
binding. 
 
 
In 
Studi
es VX06-770-101 and VX11-661-101, improvements in sweat chloride and ppFEV 1 
were observed 
as ra
pidly as 3 to 7 days after the start of dosing, with most of the effect 
observed within 14 days.
 Given the increa
sed in vitro response of the TC relative to 
VX-661/IVA, it is expected that the 2-week treatment duration will be sufficient to observe 
differences between treatment arms with respect to efficacy and PD endpoints. In addition, 
based on previous clinical experience, 2 weeks is sufficient for VX-152, VX-661, and IVA to 
reach steady-state levels of exposure. The 4-week treatment duration in Part 2 Cohort 2B will 
provide additional safety data for the TC. 
8.2.3  Rationale
 for Study Assessments 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The PD a
nd efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant to the study of patients in CF. All assessments were routinely 
measured in the registration studies of IVA (Kalydeco) or LUM/IVA combination therapy 
(Orkambi).

(subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, or 
intracranial trauma), or autonomic neuropathy. 
4. History of hemolysis. 
5. G6PD deficiency, defined as G6PD activity less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) or 
70% of the mean of the LLN and the ULN, whichever is greater. 
6. Any of the following abnormal laboratory values at screening: 
 Hemoglobin <10 g/dL 
 Total bilirubin ≥2 × ULN  
 AST, ALT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), or alkaline phosphatase (ALP)

 Abnormal renal function defined as glomerular filtration rate ≤50  mL/min/1.73 m2 
(calculate
d by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Equation)10,11 for 
subjects ≥18  years of age 
7. An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in 
therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before the first dose 
of study drug
 (Day 1 for Part 1, Day -28 for Part 2). 
8. Lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status 
(e.g., Burkholderia cenocepacia , Burkholderia dolosa , and Mycobacterium abscessus ). 
For subjects who have had a history of a positive culture in the past, the investigator will 
apply the following criteria to establish whether the subject is free of infection with such 
organisms:  
 The subject has had 2 respiratory tract cultures negative for these organisms within 
the past 12 months, with no subsequent positive cultures. 
 These 2  respiratory tract cultures were separated by at least 3 months, and 1 of them 
was obtained wit
hin the past 6 months.

the ophthalmologist or optometrist, based on the ophthalmologic examination during the 
Screening Period. If there is documentation of an examination meeting protocol criteria 
that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent then the 
ophthalmologic examina
tion does not need to be repeated during the Screening Period. 
This criterion does not apply to subjects with documentation of bilateral lens removal, 
and the ophthalmologic examination is not required for these subjects at screening. 
13. History of alcohol or drug abuse in the past year, including but not limited to, cannabis, 
cocaine, and opiates, a
s deemed by the investigator. 
14. Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study with the exception of the 
following: 
 Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational study of VX-661/IVA, IVA, 
LUM/IVA, or other CFTR modulator. For Part 1, a washout period of 28 days must 
elapse before Day 1. Subjects participating in Study 661-110 may have the Part 1 
Screening Period extended by 4 weeks (Section 8.1.1.3). For Part 2, a washout period 
before Da
y -28 is not required, and subjects participating in Study 661-110 will 
transition directly from their prior treatment to the VX-661/IVA Run-in Period 
providing that they meet eligibility criteria. For both parts, subjects participating in 
Study 661-110 may have their screening assessments performed while continuing to 
participate in Study 661-110. 
 For prospective subjects with ongoing or prior participation in all other interventional 
studies, a washout period of 28 days or 5 terminal half-lives, whichever is longer, 
must elapse before scr
eening. The duration of the elapsed time may be longer if 
required by local regulations.  
 Ongoing participation in a noninterventional study (including observational studies 
and studies requiring assessments without administration of study drug or assignment 
to other interventions) is permitted. 
15. Use of commercially available CFTR modulator (e.g., Kalydeco, Orkambi) within 
14 days before screening (Part 1 only).

tions as defined in Table 9-1, within the specified window before 
the first dose of study dr
ug (Day 1 in Part 1, Day -28 in Part 2). 
17. Pregnant or nursing females: Females of childbearing potential must have a negative 
pregnancy test at screening and Day 1. 
18. The subject or a 
close relative of the subject is the investigator or a subinvestigator, 
research assistant, pharmacist, study coordinator, or other staff directly involved with the 
conduct of the study. An adult (aged 18 years or older) who is a relative of a study staff 
member may be randomized in the study provided that 
 the adult lives independently of and does not reside with the study staff member, and 
 the adult participates in the study at a site other than the site at which the family 
member is employed.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                9.3 Prohibited Medi
cations 
Medications that are prohibited in this study (Screening Period through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit) are shown in Table 9-1. VX-152, VX-661, and IVA are metabolized extensively via 
cyto
chrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. VX-152 is also metabolized by CYP2C9. Therefore, the use of 
moderate and strong inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C9 and strong and moderate inhibitors of 
CYP3A, which have the 
potential to alter the exposure of VX-152, VX-661, or IVA, will be 
restricted in this study. VX-152 was shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of the hepatic 
transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) and 1B3 (OATP1B3). 
Therefore, sensitive substrates of OATP1B1/1B3, such as HMG Co-A Reductase Inhibitors 
(i.e., “statins”), are also restricted during the study.  
A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medication will be provided in 
the Study Reference Manual. 
Table  9-1 Study Restrictions  
Medication  Timing of Restriction  
Start of Restriction  End of Restriction  
Moderate and strong CYP3A or 
CYP2C9 inducers  None allowed within 14  days before

Follow -up Visit  
Moderate and strong CYP3A 
inhibitors (except ciprofloxacin)  None allowed within 14  days before 
the first dose of the study drug on 
Day 1 (Part 1) or Day -28 (Part 2)  None allowed through the Safety 
Follow -up Visit  
Sensitive OATP1B1/1B3 
substrates  None allowed within 14 days before 
the first dose of VX -152 or placebo 
on Day 1  None allowed until after last dos e of 
VX-152 or placebo  
Commercially available CFTR 
modulators (e.g., Kalydeco, 
Orkambi)  Part 1:  None allowed within 14  days 
before screening  
Part 2:  None allowed from the start 
of the Run -in Period  Part 1: None allowed through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit  
Part 2: None allowed through the 
end of the Washout Period  
Note: The use of restricted medication by subjects with medical needs will be addressed on a case -by-case basis 
with the medical monitor.

nd Concomitant Medications 
Information regarding all prior and concomitant medications, including the subject's CF 
medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered from 
28 days before the Screening Period through the Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable, will be 
recorde
d in each subject's source documents. For subjects who are screened but are not 
subsequently ra
ndomized in the study, details of prior medication will only be documented in 
the subjects' source documents. 
 Subjects must remain on a stable medication (and supplement) regimen for their CF from 
28 days before Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit. Stable medication regimen is 
defined as the 
current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at 
least 28 days before Day 1. Subjects must not initiate long-term treatment with new 
medication from 28
 days before Day 1 through the Safety Follow-up Visit unless 
discussed and approv
ed by the medical monitor. Guidelines for stable medication 
regimens for CF are as follows: 
o Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled 
antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. 
o Subjects who cycle onto and off an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior 
schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on Day 1 should be synchronized 
as closely
 as possible (and not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 
the inhaled antibiotic. 
o Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the 
same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on 
Day 1 should be synchronized as closely as possible (and not more than ± 3 days) to 
the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. 
 Subjects may receive doses of prednisone of up to 10 mg/day or equivalent (chronically) 
or prednisone 60
 mg qd for up to 5 days without prior approval of the medical monitor. 
 Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. 
Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments 
performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.1. 
9.5 Remov
al of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be 
withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or 
Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. 
If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be 
followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent. 
Subjects who have been randomized and whose screening CFTR genotype does not confirm 
study eligibility must be discontinued from the study, even if a previous CFTR  genotype 
laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the 
subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                The investigator w
ill inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return 
all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow-up 
Visit, if applicable (see Section 8.1.6), and follow up with the subject regarding any 
unresolved AEs. 
I
f the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations will be performed and 
no additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected 
before such withdrawal of consent. 
9.6 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of study drug on Day 1 may be 
replaced.  
Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug 
treatment period may be replaced at Vertex's discretion. 
10 STUDY DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT 
Study drug refers to VX-152, VX-661/IVA, IVA, and their matching placebos. 
10.1 Pre
paration and Dispensing 
Study drug may be dispensed only under the supervision of the investigator or an authorized 
designee and only for administration to the study subjects. 
10.2 Administration 
Study drug will be administered orally. Subjects will receive the same number of tablets each 
day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
Study drug will be administered with a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a standard "CF" 
high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack or a standard meal, according to the following 
guidelines: 
1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or 
snack. 
2. Study drug will be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses of study 
drugs will
 be taken at approximately the same time each day. For example, the morning 
dose could be taken at 08:00 every morning and the evening dose could be taken at 20:00 
every evening throughout the study. 
3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food 
was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection 
and the dose rec
eived on the morning of PK sample collection. 
4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the 
site after predose assessments have been completed. The meal or snack will be provided 
by the site for the morning dose of study drug.  

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 42 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                5. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be 
used: 
 If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject's scheduled morning 
dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug and the morning 
dose will be administered in the clinic. 
 If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject's scheduled 
morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home and the evening dose 
will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected 
relative to the evening dose. 
6. For visits after the Day 1 Visit, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused 
study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 
10.2.1  Missed Doses 
If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within 6 hours, the subject should take 
his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the 
subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For 
example, 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the 
subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the 
dose with food as soon as possible. 
 if the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:00, and 
more than 6 hours have elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 
14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 
10.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Approximately 12 subjects (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 1A) and approximately 24 subjects 
(Part 2, Cohort 2B) will be randomized in the ratio 3:1 to TC versus comparator in each 
cohort. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to 
treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified 
randomization vendor. 
10.4 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules  
Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, or total 
bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by 
the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close 
monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. 
If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. 
Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the 
subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible 
(ideally within 48 to 72 hours). 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 43 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                Study drug administration must be interrupted  immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), 
and the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria are met: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2  weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
 Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct 
bilirubin) 
A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be 
followed closely for clinical progression.  
Study drug administration must be discontinued , if confirmatory testing results obtained 
after study drug interruption meet any of the following criteria: 
 ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
 ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2  weeks 
 ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical 
jaundice 
 Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct 
bilirubin), in association with decreased haptoglobin 
If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or 
clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once 
transaminases or bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2  × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval 
of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. 
All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin 
should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 
10.5 Packaging and Labeling 
Study drug tablets will be supplied in blister cards by Vertex. Study drug labeling will be in 
compliance with applicable local and national regulations. Additional details regarding 
packaging, labeling, and dispensing for study drug will be included in the Pharmacy Manual.

10.7 Drug Accountability 
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information regarding the dates 
and amounts of study drug received; study drug dispensed to the subjects; and study drug 
returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials 
associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site 
according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study 
monitor. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the 
study. 
10.8 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug 
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects 
until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study 
monitor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. 
If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that 
the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, 
institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be 
adequately documented.

conducting ongoing reviews of safety and efficacy data for planning and enabling clinical 
development, regulatory, and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) decisions.  
The Vertex study team and lead investigator(s) will also conduct blinded reviews of all 
available safety and PK data after all subjects within a cohort complete the Day 15 Visit to 
make decisions about dose selection for potential subsequent cohorts. 
When an interim analysis is performed after all subjects in 1 part have completed the Safety 
Follow-up Visit, results from that part will be unblinded for full review by the Vertex study 
team. 
10.10.2  Unblinding 
At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the 
blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process.  
Unblinding of the individual subject's treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment 
is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best 
judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to 
discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind 
immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the 
need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, 
they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, 
and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the 
situation with the medical monitor. 
Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a 
separate document. 
In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center (  will answer 
calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the 
study medical monitor or appropriate backup. 
If a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding 
event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject's 
study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be 
maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the 
sponsor (Vertex), contract research organization (CRO), or any site personnel (other than the 
physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical 
event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 47 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                definitions or criter
ia for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, 
per Section 13.1.2 . 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, 
unblind individual subjects at any time. 
11 ASSESSMENTS 
11.1 Timing of Assessments 
The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3.  
The CFQ-R assessment must be completed before any other assessment at the clinic visits 
when it is required. For the remaining assessments, the following assessments must be 
performed in the following order when more than 1 assessment is required at a particular 
time point: 
1. Vital signs and pulse oximetry 
2. Standard 12-lead ECG recordings  
3. Sweat chloride, spirometry 
4. Safety laboratory assessments (including all blood draws) 
5. PK sampling 
11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics 
Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, 
height, and weight. 
Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during 
screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying 
medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history 
shall include a complete review of systems, past medical and surgical histories, and any 
allergies. 
11.3 Pharmacokinetics 
11.3.1  Blood Sampling 
Blood samples will be collected as shown in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3 for the 
determination of plasma concentr
ations of VX
-152, VX-661, M1-661, IVA, and M1-IVA. 
 
 
 
 
All efforts wi
ll be made to obtain the PK samples at the exact nominal time relative to 
dosing. Acceptable windows for sampling times are shown in Table 11-1. Samples collected 
outside of these acceptable windows will be considered protocol deviations.

From 0.25 up to ≤8  hours after study drug dosing  ± 15 minutes  
 
For each visit with a PK blood draw, a record of study drug administration will be collected 
as described in Section 10.2. The collection date and exact time that each PK blood sample is 
drawn will also be record
ed. 
Samples from the PK sampling will be kept frozen by Vertex or its designee until all analyses 
have been completed and then disposed of according to Vertex or designee standard 
operating procedures. 
Plasma concentration samples collected from subjects treated with placebo will not be 
routinely analyzed. 
11.3.2  Processing and Handling of Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples and further procedures for processing 
and handling of samples for PK analysis will be provided in the PK Sample Handling 
Guidelines. The shipment address and assay laboratory contact information will be provided 
to the investigational site before initiation of the study. 
11.3.3  Bioanalysis 
Samples will be analyzed using 1 or more validated analytical methods in compliance with 
Vertex or designee standard operating procedures. A description of the assay and validation 
data will be provided in separate reports. 
11.4 Pharmacodynamics 
11.4.1  Sweat Chloride 
The sweat chloride test is a standard diagnostic tool for CF, serving as a biomarker of CFTR 
activity. Collection of sweat samples will be performed at visits specified in Table 3-1, 
Table 3-2, and 
Table 3-3,  using an approved collection device. At each time point, 2 samples 
will be collected, 1 from each 
arm (left and right). Sweat samples will be sent to a central 
laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Individual sweat chloride test results will 
not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening values. Specific 
instructions for collection, handling, processing, and shipping of sweat chloride samples to 
the central laboratory will be provided separately. 
Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of their 
study-related sweat chloride results during the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the 
subject prematurely discontinues treatment.

.6 Efficacy 
11.6.1  Spirometry 
Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society 
Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines6 at the time points noted in Table 3-1, 
Table 3-2, and Table 3-3 and according to the additional guidelines that follow. 
Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subje
cts who 
ha
ve 
 withheld their short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic 
(e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry 
assessment; 
 withheld their long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before 
the spirometry assessment; and 
 withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide 
[Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spirometry assessment. 
During the Screening Per
iod, spirometry assessments may be perfo
rmed pre- or 
post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed 
"pre
-bronchodilator". During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be 
performed before the morning dose of study drugs at approximately the same time at each 
visit. Postdose spirometry assessments will be performed as noted in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, 
and Table 3-3.  
In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodila
tor(s), spirometry should be 
perfor
med according to the following: 
 If a subject's Day 1 spirometry assessment is pre-bronchodilator but, on a subsequent 
visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry 
assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled. 
 If, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry 
should be performed post-bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric measurements 
(according to the schedule of assessments detailed in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3) 
should be performed post-bronchodilator. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 50 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                 Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or 
post-bronchodilator. 
If more than 1 spirometry assessment is required a
t a visit, bronchodilators will be withheld 
until completion of the last scheduled spirometry assessment. 
All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry 
data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. 
Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of their 
study-related spirometry results during the Treatment Period, regardless of whether the 
subject prematurely discontinues treatment. 
The measured spirometric values listed below will be converted to percent predicted values 
using the standards of GLI.9

Height and weight will be measured with shoes off at time points noted in Table 3-1, 
Table 3-2, and Table 3-3.  
11.6.3  Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised 
S
ubjects wi
ll be asked to complete the CFQ-R in their native language, if validated 
translations are available.12,13 The CFQ-R will be completed before any other study 
assessments are performed at the visits noted in Table 3-1 (Part 1) , Table 3-2 (Part 2, 
Cohort 2A), and Table 3-3 (Part 2, Cohort 2B). Subjects will complete the Adole
scent/Adult 
version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. The questionnaires provide information 
about demogr
aphics; general quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom 
difficulties (pertaining to CF). Copies of the CFQ-R used in this study will be provided in the 
Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of the CFQ-R, if available, will be provided 
for participating centers in non-English-speaking countries.14,15 
11.7 Safety 
Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, ECGs, clinical 
evaluation of vital signs, pulse oximetry, PEs, and ophthalmologic examinations. 
11.7.1  Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. 
Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for
 
documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE ca
se report 
form (CRF) completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided.

cal Laboratory Assessments 
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in 
Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and  Table 3-3 . Fasting is not required. Blood and urine samples will be 
analyzed at a central laboratory, with the exception of the urine pregnancy tests which will be 
performed and analyzed at the site. Laboratory test results that are abnormal and considered 
clinically significant will be reported as AEs.

y. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at the site as 
specified in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be 
negative before the first dose of study drug. Additional urine preg
nancy tests may be required 
according to local regulations and/or requirements. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 52 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                Follicle-stimulating Hormone (Screening Period only): Blood sample for FSH will be 
measured for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous 
spontaneous amenorrhea. Se
rum FSH levels must be within the postmenopausal reference 
range of the performing laboratory to be considered postmenopausal. 
CFTR  genotype (Screening Period only):  CFTR  genotyping will be performed for all 
subjects. If the screening CFTR  genotype result is not received before randomization, a 
previous CFTR  genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who 
have been randomized and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibility must 
be discontinued from the study ( Section 9.5). 
G6PD Activity Test (Screening Period only): A single blood sample will be collected for the 
G6PD activity test, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay 
routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs quantitative G6PD activity assays 
is acceptable as an alternative to the central laboratory. 
Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, the central laboratory must be used for all laboratory tests 
with the exception of the G6PD activity test. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion 
of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test 
value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central 
laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If 
it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was 
hospitalized elsewhere), the investig
ator may base the assessment of an AE on the local 
laboratory value. 
11.7.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs 
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and 
select study visits ( Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3). At other visits, symptom-directed 
PEs and sympt
om-direc
ted vital sign assessments can be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator or healthcare provider. 
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; 
eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be 
performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal 
findings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: EENT, 
cardiovascular system, respiratory system, abdomen, and skin. 
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and 
respiration rate. These will be assessed following a 5-minute rest in the seated position.

ulse Oximetry 
Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured at visits specified in 
Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and  Table 3-3 . This will be assessed following a 5-minute rest (seated) 
and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry 
will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery 
to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. 
11.7.5  Electrocardiograms 
Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3). Additional standard 12-lead 
ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all 
ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
 The subject will be instructed to rest in the seated position for at least 5 minutes before 
having an ECG performed. 
 The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate (HR), 
such as blood draws. 
The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safety 
Follow-up Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the 
investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG 
abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded 
as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45 msec from the 
baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs 
will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the
 original measurement. If 
either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs re
mains above the threshold value 
(>45 msec from baseline or ≥500  msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until 
QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat 
measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separ
ate 
document (ECG Manual). 
11.7.6  Ophthalmologic Examination 
Subjects will undergo an ophthalmologic examination performed by a licensed 
ophthalmologist or optometrist as noted in Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3, which 
includes 
 measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; 
 pharmacologically-dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp. 
The screening ophthalmologic examination must be completed and the results reviewed 
before randomization. This examination does not have to be performed if there is 
documentation of an examination that met protocol criteria and was within 3 months before 
the date of informed consent or if there is documentation of bilatera
l lens removal for the 
subject.

ataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by the 
ophthalmologist or optometrist
 at the screening examination, the subject must not be 
randomized. If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically 
significant by the ophthalmologist or optometrist after dosing, the subject will be notified. 
After discussion with the principal investigator, and in collaboration with the medical 
monitor, the subject may elect to continue or discontinue study drug treatment. If the subject 
discontinues study drug treatment, the subject should complete the ETT and Safety 
Follow-up Visit. If the subject continues study drug treatment, more frequent ophthalmologic 
monitoring should be consider
ed. 
Additional ophthalmologic examinations may be conducted at the discretion of the 
investigator. The medical monitor should be notified of any additional ophthalmologic 
examinations and their results. 
In addition, at screening, the following history will be obtained and documented for all 
subjects: 
 history of steroid use 
 history of trauma to the eye 
 any family history of glaucoma, congenital cataracts, or cataracts arising later in life 
11.7.7  Contraception and Pregnancy 
The effects of VX-152 monotherapy or in dual or triple combination with VX-661 and IVA 
on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. VX-152, VX-661, and 
IVA did not show any genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, 
chromosomal aberra
tion or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent 
micronucleus) studies. VX-152, VX-661, and IVA were each found to be nonteratogenic in 
reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits.5,7,16,17,18,19,20 
11.7.7.1  Contrac
eption 
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below. 
Contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: 
 True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last 
dose of study drug
. 
 If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have 
complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the 
first dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of 
the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).

potential, the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria: 
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH 
level within the labor
atory's reference range for postmenopausal females. 
o Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy. 
Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do not 
have a documented bilateral oophorectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing 
potential.  
 Same sex relationships  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived, study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method of contraception is 
used as a couple.  Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table 11-3.

Note: At least 1 acceptable method of contraception must be used by couples not exempt from the contraception 
requirement. Methods of contraception must be in successful use from signing of consent, approximately 
28 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted), and until 90  days following the last 
dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements m ay need to be followed according to local 
regulations and/or requirements.  
a A female condom cannot be used with a male condom due to risk of tearing.  
b Hormone -releasing intrauterine devices and hormonal contraceptives are not considered an acceptable 
method in female study subjects; however, female subjects are not required to discontinue their use of 
hormone -releasing intrauterine devices or hormonal contraceptives.

 Male subjects must not donate sperm after the first dose of study drug, throughout the 
study, and for 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
 Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant 
during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
 Male subjects whose female partner becomes pregnant through well-documented in vitro 
fertilization (donated sperm) or banked sperm (collected before the subject received study 
drug), or is otherwise already pregnant before the male subject’s fi rst dose of study drug, 
must be compliant with the contraception requirements. In this scenario, the male subject 
and his female partner must commit to using a male condom (to ensure there is no 
exposure of the fetus to study drug) for the duration of the study and until 90 days after 
the last dose of study drug. 
 Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 
90 days following the last dose of study drug. 
 Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications should be discussed 
with the medical monitor. 
11.7.7.2  Pregnancy 
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during 
study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. 
If a female subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while 
participating in the study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The 
investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site's 
knowledge of the subject's (or partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information 
Collection Form. 
If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of the 
pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed 
consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. 
Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 
12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 
12.1 Sample Size and Power 
12.1.1  Primary Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of safety and tolerability of VX-152 in 
TC with VX-661/IVA. The sample size calculations described below are deemed adequate to 
evaluate the safety objective of the study, based on clinical and statistical considerations.

.1 Safety and Tolerability 
The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of AEs. Up to approximately 72 subjects are 
planned to be enrolled in the study with up to 36 subjects receiving VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA for 2 weeks (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 2A), and 18 subjects receiving VX-152 
in TC with VX-661/IVA for 4 weeks (Part 1 and Part 2, Cohort 2B). The sample size for 
each treatment group in Parts 1 and 2 will provide sufficient data for a descriptive analysis of 
AEs. Table 12 -1 provides the probability of observing an AE in at least 1 subject based on a 
sample size of 9 or 18 subjects subjects per TC treatment group and AE incidences ranging 
from 5% to 15%. The probability calculations are based on a binomial model using the 
probability calculator in the PASS software package (Version 11.0).

12.1.2  Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study include the evaluation of the PD effect of VX-152 in 
TC with VX-661/IVA on sweat chloride concentrations, and the evaluation of the efficacy of 
VX-152 in TC with VX-661/IVA.  
12.1.2.1  Pharmacodynamic Effect 
The absolute change from baseline at Day 15 in sweat chloride concentrations is a secondary 
endpoint used to evaluate the PD objective of the study. In Part 1, a test for a decreasing 
dose-response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using a 
multiple comparisons procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null hypothesis 
of a non-decreasing dose-response trend versus a decreasing trend using the 1-sided 
maximum t-statistic that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a 
family of 
candidate dose-response models to be prespecified, that covers the range of 
plausible and diverse dose-response profiles.  
The candidate models that best describe the expected decreasing dose-response profile of the 
TC groups compared to placebo include a linear model, a maximum effect (E max) model, and 
a sigmoid E max model. The contrasts (i.e., linear combinations of the treatment group means 
at Day 15) selected to perform the MCP and that capture the shape of these candidate models 
are desc
ribed in Table 12-2 below.

3 different expected dose-response profiles with 9 subjects assigned to placebo, 9 subjects 
assigned to TC in Cohort 1A, 9 subjects assigned to TC in Cohort 1B, and 9 subjects 
assigned to TC in Cohort 1C for a total sample size of 36 subjects in Part 1 (based on 
5000 simulations for each profile using the R software package MCPMod [Version 1.0-8]).

change from baseline in sweat chloride of 13 mmol/L was used for pow er calculations.  
Table 12 -4 provides the power to reject the null within-group hypothesis of no decrease in 
the mean absolute change from baseline for sweat chloride at Day 15 for the TC treatment 
groups in Parts 1 and 2 with a sample size of 9 or 18 subjects per treatment group. The power 
calculations are based on a 1-sided 1-sample t-test at alpha = 5% using the software package 
PASS (Version 11.0), assuming a mean change of -10 to -20  mmol/L and an SD of 13 
mmol/L in the absolute change from baseline for sweat chloride.

The absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 is a secondary endpoint used to 
evaluate the efficacy objective of the study. Table 12 -5 provides the power to reject the null 
within-group hypothesis of no increase in the mean absolute change from baseline for 
ppFEV 1 at Day 15, for the TC treatment groups in Parts 1 and 2 with a sample size of 9 or 18 
subjects per treatment group. The power calculations are based on a 1-sided 1-sample t-test at 
alpha = 5% using the software package PASS (Version 11.0), assuming an absolute mean 
change of 3 to 7 percentage points and an SD of 8 percentage points in the absolute change 
from baseline for ppFEV 1.

12.2 Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set, and Safety Set. 
Additional analysis sets related to the Run-in Period will be defined in the statistical analysis 
plan (SAP), as appropriate. 
The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 
1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and 
disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended 
CFTR  allele mutation and have received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment 
Period. The FAS will be used to summarize subject demographics and baseline 
chara
cteristics, and for all PD and efficacy analyses, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Set  will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the 
Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses, unless otherwise 
specified. 
12.3 Statistical Analysis 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary PD and 
efficacy endpoints of the study. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the SAP and 
clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis 
plan (CPAP). Both plans will be finalized before the clinical data lock and unblinding of the 
study.

Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary 
statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum value 
(min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous 
variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, minimum and maximum 
values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, 
median, SD, and SE will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a 
transformation to standard units (metric or International System [SI]) will be converted with 
the appropriate precision. 
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be 
presented to 1 decimal place. 
The b
aseline  value, unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent 
non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study 
drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the average 
of the most recent triplicate pretreatment measurements before the first dose of study drug in 
the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1). 
Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as postbaseline value –  baseline value. 
Relative change  from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline 
value)/baseline value. 
The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period will include the time from the first dose in the 
Treatment Period to the Safety Follow-up Visit or 28 days after the last dose of the study 
drug for subjects who do not complete the Safety Follow-up Visit. Additional TE periods 
related to the Run-in period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate.  
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests.  
The rules for handling missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be 
described in the SAP. 
All data will be summarized for Parts 1 and 2, separately, unless specified otherwise. 
12.3.2  Background Characteristics 
12.3.2.1  Subject Disposition 
The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, 
included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed 
study/Safety Follow-up Visit, and discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the 
reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized overall and by treatment group. 

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 61 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                12.3.2.2  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic, background (e.g., medical history), and baseline characteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive summary statistics. 
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by 
treatment group for the FAS and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, age, baseline 
weight, baseline height, baseline body mass index (BMI), baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline 
sweat chloride.  
No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment 
groups. 
12.3.2.3  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications used in this study will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Enhanced and categorized as the following: 
 Prior medication:  any medication that started before initial dosing of study drug, 
regardless of when it ended 
 Concomitant medication:  medication continued or newly received during the TE Period 
 Post-treatment medication:  medication continued or newly received after the TE Period 
A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a 
post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; 
or prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing 
start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose 
of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be 
considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post-treatment medication. 
Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by 
Preferred Name based on the FAS. Post-treatment medications will be provided separately in 
an individual subject data listing. 
Additional classifications of concomitant medications related to the Run-in Period will be 
defined in the SAP, as appropriate.  
12.3.2.4  Study Drug Exposure and Compliance 
Exposure to study drug will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a 
subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of study drug plus 1. 
Dosing compliance based on number of tablets taken, will be summarized for the FAS, and 
will be derived as 100  [(total number of tablets dispensed) – (total number of tablets 
returned)]/ (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day  duration of study drug 
exposure in days). 
Dosing compliance based on study drug exposure, will be derived as 100 × [1 - (total number 
of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of study drug exposure in days)].

An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the 
completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject’s rights, safety, or well -being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in 
the SAP. 
All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing. 
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis 
A secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA in Parts 1 and 2. 
12.3.3.1  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables 
The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 at Day 15. 
The analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) 
with change from baseline for ppFEV 1 as the dependent variable. The model will include 
treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with the baseline 
ppFEV 1 value as a covariate. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum 
likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated 
using the Kenward-Roger approximation. A compound symmetry covariance structure will 
be used to model the within-subject errors. Conditional on the fixed effects, missing data due 
to treatment or study discontinuation will be assumed to be missing at random.  
Descriptive analyses of the change from baseline will be performed for all treatment groups. 
Adjusted means and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at Day 15, with 
1-sided P values for all within-group and between-group comparisons, will be estimated 
within MMRM using LSMeans via PROC MIXED in SAS in both parts.  
 
  
 
 
There will be no multiplicity adjustment for performing multiple hypothesis tests. 
12.3.3.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary efficacy variables include: 
 Absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only).  
 Relative change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Day 15 (Part 1 and Part 2), and through Day 
29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only) 
 Absolute change in the CFQ-R respiratory domain score from baseline at Day 15 (Part 1 
and Part 2), and at Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B onl y) 
Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP.

12.3.4  Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
A secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of the PD effect of VX-152 in TC with 
VX-661/IVA on sweat chloride concentrations. 
12.3.4.1  Pharmacodynamic Effect at Day 15 
The absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at Day 15 is a secondary endpoint used 
to evaluate the PD objective of the study. In Part 1, the test to detect a decreasing 
dose-response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using the 
MCP procedure with the prespecified comparisons (contrasts) of the treatment group means 
within a linear MMRM framework. The model will include the absolute change from 
baseline for sweat chloride as the dependent variable, with treatment group, visit, and 
treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and the baseline sweat chloride value as a 
covariate. The test will be performed using the 1-sided maximum t-statistic of the individual 
t-statistics for the multiple prespecified contrasts at alpha = 5%, based on the treatment group 
means at Day 15.  
Further, adjusted means and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals of the treatment effect at 
Day 15, with 1-sided P values for all within-group and between-group comparisons, will be 
estimated within MMRM, in both parts.  
Additional details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP. 
12.3.4.2  Pharmacodynamic Effect through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B only) 
The absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through Day 29 (Part 2, Cohort 2B 
only) is also a secondary endpoint used to evaluate the PD objective of the study. The 
adjusted mean and 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the average treatment effect through 
Day 29 for the within-group and between-group comparisons in Part 2, Cohort 2B will be 
estimated within MMRM. 
12.3.5  Safety Analysis

dose of study drug through the end of the TE Period 
 Post-treatment AE: any AE that increased in severity or that was newly developed 
beyond the TE Period 
For AEs with missing or partial start dates, if there is no clear evidence that the AEs started 
before or after study drug treatment, then the AEs will be classified as TEAEs.

PE findings will be presented in an individual subject data listing only. 
12.3.5.7  Other Safety Analysis 
Not applicable. 
12.3.6  Interim and IDMC Analyses 
12.3.6.1  Interim Analysis 
Interim analyses for each cohort may be performed after all subjects in the cohort have 
completed the Day 15 Visit. The results of these analyses will be reviewed by a limited 
Vertex team. When an interim analysis is performed after all subjects in 1 part have 
completed the Safety Follow-up Visit, results from that part will be unblinded for full review 
by the Vertex study team. 
12.3.6.2  IDMC Analysis 
The safety of the TC will be monitored by an external, IDMC to ensure the safety of the 
subjects in the study. 
An IDMC will be formed before study initiation. The IDMC’s objectives, responsibilities, 
and operational details will be defined in a separate document (IDMC Charter), which will be 
finalized before the first subject is randomized in the study. The IDMC will conduct planned 
safety reviews of study data from all parts of the study as outlined in the IDMC Charter. 
12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analysis 
12.4.1  Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK analysis of VX-152, VX-661 and metabolite M1-6 61, and IVA and metabolite 
M1-IVA will be performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. Standard 
noncompartmental analysis may also be performed as data allow. Descriptive statistics will 
be used to summarize PK parameter values for all analytes. 
A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the CPAP.  
12.4.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
PD assessments to be included in PK/PD analyses may include sweat chloride, ppFEV 1, as 
well as other secondary endpoints such as CFQ -R. Comparison 
between postdose and predose values will be performed and expressed as a change from 
baseline.

l approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analysis. The Bayesian 
estimates of individual PK parameters from the final population PK model will be used to 
simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX-152, VX-661, IVA, or metabolite 
plasma concentrations will be used in the potential pharmacological response models to 
describe changes in each endpoint from baseline. Fixed- and random-effect parameter 
estimates and the a
ssociated asymptotic SEs will be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to summarize Bayesian estimates of individual PK/PD parameters obtained from the 
population PK/PD model.

13.1.1  Adverse Events 
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the 
event does not necessarily
 have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any 
newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity 
or freque
ncy) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1.

Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be documented as 
an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather 
than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a 
diagnosis, the abnorma
l study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine 
or decre
ased hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more 
of the following:
 
 Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
 Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
 A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of 
whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the 
investigator. 
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory 
value will be an S
AE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.

.3 Documentation of Adverse Events 
All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points: 
 For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, 
withdrawal of consent) 
 For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up 
Visit 
 For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest of 
o 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or 
o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug 
(see Section 8.1.6)
. 
All subjects will be que
ried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and 
source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the 
study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be 
documented for each AE: 
 Description of the event 
 Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
 Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
 Severity 
 Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Concomitant medication or other treatment given 
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. 
The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
August 2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life -threatening.” In 
consi
dering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that 
reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in 
the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined 
according to the definitions in Table 13-1.   

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 69 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                Table  13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Definition  
Mild (Grade  1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities  
Moderate (Grade  2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities  
Severe (Grade  3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities  
Life-threatening 
(Grade  4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death  
 
13.1.1.5  Adverse Event Causality 
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to 
the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled 
out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the in vestigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to 
be related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record).  
 
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken 
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action 
taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3.  
Table  13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to contin ue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event

An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13 -4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/Resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or sy mptoms  
Recovered/Resolved 
With Sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not Recovered/Not 
Resolved (Continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow -up) 
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given 
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was 
given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, 
hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of 
treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
 Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs 
after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to 
administration of the study drug) 
 Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home)  

Protocol VX16- 152-102, Version 3.0 Page 71 of 81 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                If a subj
ect has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurr
ed before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
before th
e subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled 
sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly 
not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considere
d to indicate an SAE. 
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may 
be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same 
as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. 
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
13.1.2
.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow-up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all 
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) 
will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . 
SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form 
(hereafter re ferred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that 
accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the 
investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study 
drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes 
unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study 
analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be 
documented as on
going. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is 
required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using 
the SAE Form. 
13.1.2.3  Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an 
SAE, reg
ardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE 
Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as 
it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated                                                                                13.1.2.4  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters 
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities and participating 
investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as 
applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be responsible for the submission 
of safety letters to central independent ethics committees (IECs).  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local institutional 
review board (IRB)/local IEC of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk 
to human subjects. 
13.2 Administrative Requirements 
13.2.1  Ethical Considerations 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the current ICH GCP Guidelines, which are 
consistent with the ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki, and in 
accordance with local applicable laws and regulations. The IRB/IEC will review all 
appropriate study documentation to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of the 
subjects. The study will only be conducted at sites where IRB/IEC approval has been 
obtained. The protocol, Investigator's Brochure, sample ICF, advertisements (if applicable), 
written information given to the subjects (including diary cards), safety updates, annual 
progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC by 
the investigator or Vertex, as allowable by local applicable laws and regulations. 
13.2.2  Subject Information and Informed Consent 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from the 
subject before study participation. The method of obtaining and documenting the informed 
consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH GCP and all applicable laws 
and regulations and will be subject to approval by Vertex or its designee. 
13.2.3  Investigator Compliance 
No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator 
and Vertex. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the 
investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will require 
IRB/IEC notification before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol 
modifications to the required regulatory authorities. 
When circumstances require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the 
protocol, the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If 
possible, contact will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures 
from the protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol 
deviation log.

The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study 
available for inspection by Vertex or its representative at the time of each monitoring visit 
and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and 
copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health 
authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and 
security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this 
protocol.  
13.2.5  Subject Privacy 
To maintain subject confidentiality and to comply with applicable data protection and 
privacy laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the 
study will identify subjects by assigned subject numbers and access to subject names linked 
to such numbers shall be limited to the site and the study physician and shall not be disclosed 
to Vertex. As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study 
is being conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all 
pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE 
forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in 
other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, 
including source documentation, for inspection. 
For sites participating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and associated regulations (“HIPAA”) an executed 
HIPAA authorization shall be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal 
representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA 
authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the 
site access to and use of the subject’s personally identifiable health information, 
authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA, and other parties 
requiring access under the protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such 
information may be used and for how long. 
13.2.6  Record Retention 
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP guidelines and/or 
applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study 
records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and 
Vertex will be notified. 
13.2.7  Study Termination 
At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any 
particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs 
may terminate the study at their center.

limited to: 
 Subject or investigator noncompliance 
 Unsatisfactory subject enrollment 
 Lack of adherence to protocol procedures 
 Lack of evaluable and/or complete data 
 Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects 
 Decision to modify drug development plan 
 Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority 
Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required. 
13.3 Data Quality Assurance 
Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the 
qualifications of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the 
investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study 
documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study 
participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site 
personnel using a secure, validated, web-based electronic data capture (EDC) application. 
Vertex will have read-only access to site-entered clinical data in the EDC application.  
Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator 
for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an 
audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database. 
13.4 Monitoring 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to 
comply with GCP guidelines. On-site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness 
and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters 
will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal 
visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the 
CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 
13.5 Electronic Data Capture  
Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.

responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data 
reported in the subject's CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate 
the subject's participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study 
procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. 
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible 
after information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user's identification information and the date and time of 
any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the 
CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the 
subjects for whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival 
CRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator's 
study file.

Protein With Minimal Function (Part 1) 
Per the study eligibility criteria, heterozygous F508del-CFTR  subjects in Part 1 must have a 
second CFTR  allele containing a mutation that is predicted to result in a CFTR protein with 
minimal function and not likely to respond to VX-661 and/or ivacaftor (IVA) therapy. These 
CFTR  mutations were defined using 3 major sources:  
 biological plausibility for the mutation to respond (i.e., mutation class) 
 evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient registry; 
accessed on 15 February 2016) 
o average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, and 
o prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% 
 in vitro testing 
o mutations resulting in baseline chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR 
were considered minimal function 
o mutations resulting in chloride transport <10% of wild-type CFTR following 
the addition of VX-661 and/or IVA were considered nonresponsive  
The clinical severity criteria (average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L and %PI >50%) do not 
apply to the individual subjects to be enrolled in this study, but were used to classify the 
mutation status on a population level. 
The list below represents acceptable mutations; however, this list may not include every 
eligible mutation, and investigators should contact the medical monitor regarding other 
mutations that may also meet study eligibility criteria.

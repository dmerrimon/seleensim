Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
In foot and ankle surgery, the prevention of postoperative hematoma in a confined 
space in the wound has a crucial impact on periop erative outcomes.  Th ere has been 
growing emphasis on the role of antifibrinolytics to minimize bleeding and the 
formation of postoperative hematoma .  Approximately 20% of all foot and ankle 
fractures are open. Excellent operative field without measurable bleeding remain 
prerequisite of most orthopedic procedures. Increase blood loss can increase the risk 
of infection, hematoma formation and wound complications. Presence of blood in 
synovium not only has direct corrosive effects but also causes increased in tra 
capsular pressure leading to capsular fibrosis culminating as ankyloses.  
                
Traditionally, t ourniquets are employed to optimize surgical field visualization 
thereby limiting operative duration and improving technical precision. There are 
several unwanted effects that can arise from  use of tourniquet like neurapr axia,  
vascular injury,  post operative swelling etc. Hence there is a growing interest in 
achieving the same operative goals  without the use of tourniquet.  
 
Antifibrinolytics can be utilized  to achieve a blood sparing effect. Its efficacy in 
reducing intra operative and post operative blood loss is well documented in cardiac 
surgery,  joint replacement surgery , and spin e surgery. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic 
antifibrinolytic drug tha t competitively blocks the lysine -binding sites of 
plasminogen, plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator, thereby delaying

(IV), oral , topical , as well as intra articular  routes of administration . The effects of 
IV administration  lasts 8-17 hours after the initial dose . Orthopedic surgeons have 
incorporated TXA into multiple elective surgeries as a means of reducing blood loss 
and transfusion requirements.  
 
Effectiveness o f Tranexamic acid  (TXA) in postoperative outcomes is unknown in 
foot and ankle surgeries. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of 
intraoperative doses of intravenous TXA in reducing post operative bleeding and 
hematoma formation  after foot and  ankle surgeries.  
 
 
1)Objectives  
Research Question : Does intraoperative administration  of intravenous TXA reduc e 
postoperative bleeding and hematoma formation after foot and ankle surgeries ? 
Primary outcome: The incidence of wound complications classified  as dehiscence, 
hematoma, necrosis and infection.  Wound healing time and length of stay will be 
evaluated.  The first follow up at surgeon’s office will be included.  
Secondary outcome:  The amount of intra operative and post operative blood loss 
during th e first 24 hours in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgeries. Post -
operative complete blood count (CBC), duration of surgery and intra operative fluid 
resuscitation will be recorded. Intraoperative and post operative narcotic 
consumption.  
 
2)Background  
See above.  Effectiveness of Tranexamic acid ( TXA) is u nknown in foot and ankle 
surgeries. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness of intravenous TXA in 
reducing post operative blood  loss during foot and ankle surgeries.

assessments will be done by the study team.  
 
Patients will be assigned randomly using a computer - generated  table of numbers to 
either TXA group (Tranexamic acid  group) or placebo (saline  group). Patients 
assigned to TX A group will receive 10mg/kg IV TXA in a 100cc normal saline bag  
at the time of induction and a second dose prior to skin closure. Patients in the 
placebo group will receive 100cc normal saline IV at the time of induction and a 
second dose prior to skin cl osure. Otherwise, the patient, surgeon, and 
anesthesiologist in the case will be blinded .   
 
a) Recruitment  methods:  Patients will be recruited and consented at the surgeons 
office or pre -operative  testing /Joint  clinic . 
 
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 Inclusion criteria:  ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class I -IV, age 18 -     
75.  
Exclusion criteria: ASA class V, patient refusal, patients  with known coagulopathy 
disorder, renal insufficiency, he patic dysfunction, serious cardi ac disease, patients 
receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant drugs, or an allergy to TXA or will be 
excluded.  
 
c)Number of Subjects  
 
We intend to recruit 200 patients.  
Based on a confidence level of 99% with a Z score of 2.58 , standard deviation of .5 
and a confidence inte rval of 10% our sample size should be 166 . For ease of 
statistical calculations we rounded up to 2 00 patient s. Literature search reveals only 
one previous study where TXA has been used in calcaneal fractures. Xie et al 
concluded  in a study with  90 patients  that TXA reduces post operative blood loss.  
We intend to use a higher sample size to see any statistical significance.

OVERALL RATIONALE FO R REVISED PROTOCOL 06:
The purpose of Revised Protocol  06 is to incorporate Steering Committee and invest igator 
feedback for modificat ion of selected study  eligibilit y criteria. This includes increasing the 
National Inst itute of Healt hStroke Scale (NIHSS) at randomization fro m ≤5 to ≤7 and permitting 
intravenous thrombo lytic therapy , as well as mechanical thrombectomy ,for the index event 
provi ded condi tions are met. These modified cri teria reflect a broader popul ation that is cl oser t o 
clinical practice. In addition, the internat ional normalized ratio (INR) threshol d prior to study 
treatm ent administration has been lowered from ≤ 1.7 to <1.5 for all partici pants to ensure the 
safet y of the study  populati on, which is now permitted to receive thrombo lytic therapy and/or 
mechanical thrombectomy for acut e treatm ent of  the index stroke . To accommodate for potenti al 
instances where the baseline study  MRI cannot be completed within 48 hours, the window for the 
baseline study  MRI has been expa nded to up to 72 hours after the onset of the index event with 
the condi tion that subjects will need to be dosed within the 48-hour rando mizat ion window. To 
accommodate for regional and institutional practi ces in study -related MRI acqui sition, the 
administ ration of contrast agents is permitted as per invest igator discret ion. Specific to COVID -
19, an exclusio n criterion was added for the safety  of study  participants and site personnel . In 
addition, exploratory  research was modified to include biomarkers rela
ted to severe acute 
respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) infect ion to support advancing the 
understanding of the impact of SARS -CoV -2 on the study  population, BMS -986177, and 
cardi ovascular di sease.
Based on site feedback ,the pharmacokinet ic and pharmacodynamic sampling requirements have 
been simplified to facilitate sample co llection. 
In addit ion,the SAE coll ection peri od has been extended through the fo llow
-up period in order to 
standardize post- randomizat ion SAE collect ion with NSAE collect ion. Previ ously , SAEs were to 
be co llected for 7 days after discontinuation of dosing.
In an effort to enable flexibilit y and preserve collect ion of key study assessments that may be 
impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic , instructions were added to provide guidance regarding 
study  assessments, including performance of the Day 90 MRI, collect ion ofother onsite
assessments that can be conducted remotely (eg,central  laboratory  tests), and rem otemonitoring 
considerations. 
Other changes are administrative changes such as typographical errors, clarificat ions, changes in 
termino logy, and alignment to other key  study  docum ents.
The changes made to the protocol are not anticipated to have a significant impact on the 
benefit -risk of  the tr ial parti cipants, and do not impact the integrit y of the study .
The table below highlights the key  changes made to the body  of the protocol . The changes made 
in the body  of the protocol  were al so implemented in the Synopsis, where applicable.

BMS -986177/JNJ -70033093 Factor XIa Inhibitor
1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title:
A Global,Phase 2, Rando mized, Doubl e -Blind, Placebo -Controlled ,Dose -Ranging Study  of 
BMS -986177, an Oral Factor XIa Inhibitor, for the Prevention of New Ischemic Stroke or New 
Covert Brain Infarct ion in Pat ients Receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel Following Acute Ischemic
Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)
AXIOMATIC- SSP: Antithrombotic Treatment with F actor XIa Inhibit ion to Optimize 
Management of Acute Thromboembo lic Events in Secondary  Stroke Prevention
Study Phase:
2
Rationale:
Bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) , is the major concern am ong clinicians when 
considering antithro mbotic therapy in patients with stroke and threatened stroke. A major advance 
of the past decade in anticoagul ation has been the introduction of selective oral direct thrombin 
and Factor Xa inhibitors (DOACs). The risk of ICH with DOACs is sharply  reduced compared 
with warf arin.
BMS-986177 (also known as JNJ-70033093) is a small molecule that binds and inhibit s the 
activated form of human coagul ation Factor XI (Factor XIa) wit
h high affini ty and select ivity. 
According to the scientific evidence accumulated to date, the inhibit ion ofFXI may provide a 
novel mechanism for systemic antithrombotic effects without increasing the risk of clinically 
significant bleeding in a variet y of condi tions predisposing to high risk of thrombotic events.
The rationale for this study  is that Factor XIa inhibit ion has the potenti al to reduce thrombin 
generat ion enough to prevent vascular occlusio n and embo lism wit hout impairing hemostasis. The 
following observat ions support this concept: (1) the highest levels of Factor XI activit y are 
associ ated with a heightened risk of ischemic stroke; (2) lower levels of Factor XI activit y are 
associ ated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke; (3) Factor XI deficiency is rarely associ ated with 
unprovoked major bleeding; (4) al though not done in participants with strok e, a Phase 2 study for 
VTE prophylaxis in participants post total knee replacement with another Factor XIa inhibitor 
provi des a proof -of-concept. The study  showed that reducing FXI levels to 20% or less than norm al 
with an antisense inhibitor of FXI synthesis reduced the risk of postoperative VTE compared to 
enoxaparin, without an increase in bleeding compared to enoxaparin .
The recent ly-reported POINT and CHANCE studies demonstrated that treatment with aspirin and 
clopidogrel  is more effect ive than aspirin alone in reducing the ri sk of  recurrent stroke. However, 
the residual risk for recurrent stroke remains high , even when patients are treated with combinat ion 
of aspirin and clopidogrel, emphasizes the cont inuing need for a more effect ive therapeut ic option.  
Two possible strategi es for achieving better efficacy  aremore potent antiplatelet therapy  or dual 
pathway  inhibi tion of  thrombus formati on.

BMS -986177 combined with antiplatelet therapy  has the potenti al to be safe and more effect ive
than anti platelet therapy  alone. Arecently co mpleted drug- drug interaction (DDI) studyin healt hy 
volunteers was conducted to assess the safet y and tolerabili ty of multiple-dose BMS -986177 
200mg given twice daily (BID) for 5 days with and without dual antiplatelet therap y. Clopidogrel 
was given as 300 mg on Day 1 followed by 4 days of 75 mg clopidogrel, and aspirin 325 mg was 
administered once daily [QD] for 5 days. There were no ser ious bleeding events reported from any 
of the 113 healthy participants , including 37 participants treated with DAPT + BMS -986177, in 
the DDI study .There were afew minor bleeding events , which showed no trend toward any 
treatm ent group . These preliminary findings are consistent wi th the noti on that FXIa inhibit ion is 
associ ated wi th a low risk of  bleeding, and support the proposed clinical tri al wi th BMS -986177, 
aspirin and cl opidogrel .
Finally , the rationale for treating all patientswith aspirin +clopidogrel  is based on the lack of 
credible clinical t rial data to support a net clinical benefit of ant icoagulation alone over antiplatel et 
therapy  for secondary  prevent ion of non-cardi oembo lic strokes.  As noted above, this si tuation is 
reflected in guidelines recommending antiplatel et therapy for secondary stroke prevent ion in this 
popul ation. The data summarized above support the hypothesis that inhibit ion of Factor XIa could 
be a promising target for antithrombotic therapy for stroke, potentially providing sufficient  
inhibit ion of thrombin generati on to prevent thrombotic vascular occlusion or embolizatio n 
without impairing hemo stasis .

Overall Design:
The study  is a m ulti-center, Phase 2, randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, dose-ranging 
trial. Eligible participants will be screened for potent ial inclusio n into the study as soon as possible 
after presentati on and rando mized within 48 hours of the index event.
Following signing of informed consent, participants willbe rando mized to receive BMS -986177 
or placebo, plus open -label uncoated aspirin 100 mg in combinat ion with clopidogrel  (a loading 
dose followed by maintenance doses) for the next 21 days. Participants will continue treatment 
from Day 22 through Day 90 with BMS-986177 or placebo, plus open -label 100-mg uncoated 
aspirin only. 
Aspirin and clopidogrel will be given open -label as a background therapy  according to the 
following scenarios:
1)Prior to signing informed consent :
Parti cipants who have received a single open -label  clopidogrel  loading dose of between 
300mg a nd 600 mg as standard -of-care pri
or to obtaining informed consent can be enro lled 
in the study . No addit ional loading dose of clopidogrel  is requi red for such participants
after randomizat ion. 
Following a standard -of-care clopidogrel  loading dose, the standard -of-care clopidogrel 
daily  dose of 75 m g will be taken the next day , and i t can be taken prior to randomizat ion. 
Parti cipants who report taking chronic clopidogrel  also requi re a 300-mg clopidogrel 
loading dose unless the i nvest igator can verify that the participant has taken the daily dose 
for at least the preceding 3 days.
2)Prior to randomizat ion and after signing informed consent :
Following si gning of informed consent, a 300 -mg loading dose of 
clopidogrel  and 100 mg 
aspirin may be assigned for immediate treatm ent upon consenting the participant and 
registering the participant in Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT), if considered 
clinically appropriate . Daily 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg da ily aspirin will be started the 
next day .
3)After rando mizat ion:
A clopidogrel  loading dose of 3 00 mg alo ng with 100mg aspirin will be administered after 
rando mizat ion on Day 1for participants who have not received anyclopidogrel  loading 
dose. 
For participants who have received at least 75 mg aspirin as standard of care before randomizat ion, 
and if this dose was taken on the same day as randomizat ion, then no addit ional aspirin is required 
on Day  1. In this case, 100 mg daily  aspirin shoul d be start ed in the morning of Day 2.
A baseline MRI will be performed within 48 hours of the onset of the index event, and prior to 
rando mizat ion. The first dose of double -blind study medication (BMS -986177 or pl acebo) should
be taken as soon as possible after the baseline MRI assessment, preferably  within 2 hours, but no

longer than 6 hours. If outsi de of the 6-hour post-MRI window, the invest igator should call the 
Medical Moni tor for guidance. In instances where the baseline MRI is completed after 48 hours 
from the onset of the index event, the first dose of study medicati on shoul d still be taken 
immediately  after randomizat ion and within 48 hours from  the onset of the index event.
BMS -986177 or placebo will be taken twice daily (BID), once in themorning (between
6AM -9AM) and again in the evening (between 6PM -9PM).
An MRI of the brain will be performed on Day 90 ± 6 days (based on randomizati on on Day 1) 
All participants shoul d remai n on study  treatm ent until theDay 90 MRI is performed up to Day 
96. 
Screenin g Period:
All study  assessments shoul doccur within the first 48 hours of the index event, following 
participant consent.
Within 48hours of the onset of  the index event, and prior to randomizat ion, participants will 
have a baseline MRI (may be same as clinical MRI) whenever possible .If the baseline MRI 
cannot be performed within 48 hours of the index event and before randomizat ion, it can be 
perform ed af ter randomizat ion but must be performed within 72 hours of the index event and 
up to 24 hours after randomization . In instances where the baseline MRI is completed after 
48hours from the onset of the index event, the first dose of study medicat ion shoul d still be 
takenimmediately after rando mizat ionwithin 48 hours fro m the onset of the index event.
Within 48 hours of the onset of theindex event, and prior to randomizat ion, all participants 
will have a Doppl er ultrasound, CTA, MRA ,or catheter angiography to assess for the presence 
of intracranial or cervical arteri al atheroscl erotic plaque , ulcerati on, or thrombus that is 
proximal to th e index lesio n. Use of available vascul ar imaging showing a qualifying lesio n 
prior to the stroke event is allowed for participants who cannot complete the vascular imaging 
within 48 hours of the index event.
At screening, the following will be obtained: physical  examinat ion, physical measurements, 
local clinical laboratory  tests(including pregnancy test for WOCBP), vital signs, ECG, and 
medical history .
The following functional/disease severit y assessments are to be completed at screening : 
ABCD2, NIHSS, m RSfor eligibilit y assessment.
Double -blind Treatment Period:
The double -blind treatment period will be fro m Day 1 to Day  90.
During the init ial phase of the study, a minimum o f 800 participants will be ran domized to one 
of the following 4 doses of BMS -986177: 25 m g daily  (QD ), 25 m g, 50 m g,or 100 m g twi ce 
daily (BID) , or pl acebo. Twenty -five percent (25%) of the parti cipants will be rando mized to 
the placebo arm and the rest of participants will be rando mized equally to the 4doses of 
BMS -986177.

All participants will be treated with open -label uncoated aspirin, 100 mg QD and clopidogre l, 
75 mg QD (after a single 300 mg clopidogrel  loading dose +aspirin 100 mg one day prior), 
for 21 days fo llowed by  aspirin alone from Day 22 to Day 90.
On Day 1, pri or to the init ial dose of study  medicatio n, the fo llowing will be obtained: centra l 
clinical laboratory  tests f or saf ety, PDsamples, expl oratory  biomarker samples, and optional 
pharmacogeno mic samples .
National Inst itutes of Healt h Stroke Sc ore(NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Montreal 
Cogni tive Assessment (MoCA), and Digit Symbol Substi tution Test (DSST; subtest of 
WAIS -IV) will be collected a t baseline (at randomization for NIHSS) ,on Days 21 and 90, and 
at the time of a new stroke .MoCA and DSST (subset of WAIS-IV) will be read by a third-
party  central  laboratory  blinded to treatment.
A Day 60 visit is requi red for central  clinical safety  laboratory  sample within a 7-day visit 
window for a pproximately 450 participants, after which the DMC will determine if such safet y 
laboratory  assessment will be continued, reduced, or discont inued. The DMC will review 
safet y data, including clinical laboratory  and any available imaging resul ts when 
approximately  
450participants have completed the Day 21 visit. The DMC will recommend
if further monitoring of Day 60 laboratory  samples is needed. The DMC recommendat ion 
regarding the Day  60 clinical  safety laboratory  sample will be communicated to invest igator s
by the st udy S ponsor.
A telephone contact is requi redon Day 60 if all the respect iveassessments have not been 
completed onsite.
Onsitevisits will be requi red on Days 21 and 90 (end-of-treatm ent visit). At these visits, the 
following will be obtained: central  laboratory  tests for safet y, PK, PD,and exploratory 
biomarkers. 
In the event participants are unable or not permitted to attend an onsite visit due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic , alternat ive measures can be considered to obtain requi red visit 
assessments as loc al regulatory  requi rements permi t.
The randomization of participants to the 200 -mg BID dose may occur in a staggered approach 
after a minimum o f 800participants have been randomized. The d ecisio n to proceed wi th the 
200-mg BID dose group will depend on the evaluati on of  the popul ation, the DMC revi ew of 
efficacy and safet y data, and
an assessment of whether it is safe to randomize participants to 
that dose group. When approximately  800 participants have been randomized, rando mizat ion 
for the pl acebo group will be used to achieve a 2:1 ratio rel ative to each treatm ent arm  by the 
end of the study .Once a decisi on to add the 200-mg BID dose group has been made, 
rando mizat ion will be revised to achieve a target 2:1:1:1:1:1 (pl acebo: 25 mg QD: 25 mg BID: 
50 m g BID: 100 m g BID: 200 m g BID) by the end of this study .
All participants will also have an MRI assessment on Day 90 ( 6 days) while cont inuing study 
drug treatment . 
In the event participants are unable or not permitted to attend the Day  90 visi t 
due to the COVID -19 pandemic , the Day 90 MRI may be performed at a local facilit y provided 
that the study -specific MRI protocol  is performed on a scanner pre-approved by the central 
imaging vendor. If theDay 90 MRI cannot be performed at a local facilit y, itmay be per formed 
when the participant is able or permitted to access the study  site.For these participants, it is 
understood that they  may not be taking study  medicati on past Day  96.

986177.
Follow -upPeriod:
To be di scharged from  the study, atelephone contact to assess efficacy  and saf ety events will 
be requi red for all participants. For participants compl eting treatment, this contact will be timed 
within 7 days after the end of the treatm entperiod and after the D ay 90 MRI. For parti cipants 
not completing treatm ent, an MRI is to be schedul ed at Day 90, with a telephone contact 
scheduled 7 day s after the Day  90 MRI
. If for any  reason a Day  90 MRI i s not obtained, then 
a telephone conta ct is to be performed at Day  97 ± 2.
Numb er of Participants:
Approximately  and up to 2350 participant s from approximately  30 countri es and approximately
380 clinical research sites will be rando mized using a compet itive enrollment approach.

Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An independent DMC , whose activit ies will be described in a charter, will mo nitor the study . The 
DMC will be comprised of experi enced clinicians, tri alists and statistical experts. The DMC will 
review efficacy  andsafety  data at designated times during the trial wit h the purpose of each review 
defined in the DMC charter. After approximately 450 participants have completed the Day 
21 visit, 
the DMC will recommend if the Day 60 central  laboratory  samples are still needed. The DMC 
recommendat ion regarding the Day  60 clinical  safety  laboratory  sample will  be communicated to
the invest igator by the study S ponsor.
The DMC will review efficacy and safet y data after a minimum of 800 participants have been 
rando mized, and assess whether it is safe t o randomize participants to the 200 -mg BID dose group .
A list of drug discontinuat ion criteria for individual participants will be provi ded in the study 
protocol . Such criteria will include serious bleeding. The DMC will use their clinical and statist ical 
judgment to evaluate pertinent trial data and may recommend early  terminat ion of an individua l 
study  arm or the entire trial for important safet y concerns that are felt to outwei gh potenti al 
benefits. Details of the DMC act ivities will be described in a DMC charter.

Statistical Considerations
Sample Size : The primary endpo int for this study is the incidence of events within a co mposite of 
new ischemic stroke during the treatment period and ne w covert brain infarction (FLAIR + DWI) 
detected by MRI at 90 days. Sample size calculati ons were performed for detecting a dose-
response effect with the MCP -MOD methodol ogy using simulat ions with the Dose -Finding 
package in Rstatistical analysis software . Simulations of 2500 clinical trials were performed, 
assuming a true incidence for placebo of 15%, a plateau shaped dose response relationship with 
maximum relat ive risk reduct ion of 32% for BMS -986177 100 or 200 mg BID relat ive to placebo, 
and reducti onsof 10%, 17.5%, and 27% for the 25 mg QD, 25 mg BID, and 50 mg BID doses, 
respectively . Candi date models included an Emax model, a logistic model, and an exponent ial 
model.
Using these assumpt ions, a total o f 2100 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1:1 ra tio to placebo and 
BMS -986177, 25 -mg QD, 25 -mg BID, 50 -mg BID, 100 -mg BID, and 200 -mg BID groups provide 
approximately  80% power to demonstrate a dose -response relationship, with a 1- sided ty pe I error 
of 0.049. Without the 200-mg group, a total  of 1800 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
placebo and BMS 986177, 25-mg QD, 25-mg BID, 50-mg BID, and 100-mg BID groups woul d 
provi de approximately 79% power to demonstrate a dose-response relationship with similar 
pattern, but risk reducti on of 32% forBMS -986177 50- or 10-mg BID relative to placebo and 
reducti ons of 17.5%, and 27% for the 25 -mg QD and 25 -mg BID doses, respectively. Allowing up 
to 10% of participants who do not have a clinical event and also do not have a Day 90 imaging 
assessment, approximately andup to 2350 participants may be randomized. The frequency and 
reasons for missing data will be evaluated in blinded fashio n during the course of the study .
Statistical Analyses : Dose -response relat ionship will be analyzed based on a generalized Mult iple 
Com parisons and Modeling (gMCP -Mod) analysis for the BMS -
986177 dose regimens, with 
placebo, and 25 mg QD as the lowest dose added to the ordered BID dose regimens. If a dose-
response relat ionship exists, then fitted estimates for the incidence of the primary endpo int will be 
calculated in each of the treatm ent groups using the selected dose-response models. An Emax 
model, a logistic model, and an exponent ial model will be used as the candi date models for the 
gMCP -Mod analysis.
Point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for the following event rates will be summarized 
by treatment group.

Clopidogrel Loading Dose and Aspirin XInteractive web/voic e response sy stem ( IRT) will dispense a 21 -day supply  of 75mg clopidogrel and 
100mg aspiri n, inclusive of the initial 300mg clopidogrel loading dose and 100 mg aspirin.
Upon consenting and registering participant in IRT, a 300mg loading dose and 100mgaspirin may 
be assigned for immediate treatment along with daily  75mg clopidogrel and 100 mg daily  aspirin, if 
considered clinically appropriate. For p articipants w ho have received at least 75 mg aspirin as standard 
of care before randomizatio n
,and if this dose was taken on the same day as randomization, then no 
additional aspirin is required on Day 1. In this case, 100mgdaily  aspirin should be started in the 
morning of Day 2.Participants who have received a singl e loading dose of open -label clopidogr el 
between 300mg to600mgas standard -of-care prior to obtaining informed consent can also be enrolled 
in the study. No additional loading dose of clopidogrel is required for such participants after 
randomization .Following a standard -of-care clopidogrel loading dose, the standard -of-care 
clopidogrel daily  dose of 75 mg may  be taken prior to randomization. Participants who report taking 
chronic clopidogrel also require a 300 mg clopi dogrel loading dose unless the i nvestigator can verify 
that the pa rticipa nthas taken the daily dose for at least the preceding 3 days.

3 INTRODUCTION
Stroke i s a leading cause of death and di sabili ty worl dwide. Ischemic brain infarct ion is the most 
commo n type of stroke (~80%). Primary brain hemorrhage is a less commo n cause of stroke 
(~20%) but is associ ated with considerable morbidity and mortalit y. Stroke incidence is strongly 
linked to age and stroke prevalence is increasing due to the ageing global population. 
Thromboembo lism is commo n to almost all types of ischemic stroke sso that inhibit ion of 
thrombosis is a pivotal intervent ion for stroke prevent ion. About 1.5 millio n people have ischemic 
strokes annually in North America and Europe and about 18 millio n peopl e worl dwide.1
The ri sk of  recurrent cerebrovascular events i s high in pat ients who have had a stroke or transient 
ischemic attack (TIA). The risk of recurrent stroke is particularly high during the initial 90 days 
following ischemic stroke or TIA. Pooled analyses of observat ional studi es completed in 2007,
suggested the early  risk of stroke was 9.9%, 13.4%, and 17.3% at 2, 30, and 90 days,  
respectively .2,3Devel opment of specialized acute stroke centers and prevent ive services have 
decreased the recurrence rate but it remains unacceptably high. In two recen t clinical trials that 
investigated pa tients with acute ischemic stroke, the risk of recurrent stroke was 7 to 12% despite 
treatm ent with aspirin and other secondary preventio n intervent ions.4,5In patients with acute TIA, 
the rate of subsequent ischemic s troke i s somewhat lower, but still high, 4 %to 9% at 90 day s.2,3,5
The clinical ,time
-based definit ion of TIA has been updated to now include imaging toexclude 
evidence of tissue damage ,but the traditional time-based definit ion is still commo nly used in 
practi ce.6Clinically defined TIA and stroke form part of a  risk continuum and risks of early 
recurrent stroke, MI and vascular de ath are similar .7,8,9
Accumulat ing evidence suggests that for patients wit
h strokes associated with large vessel 
atherosclerosis (CARESS10, CLAIR11) and for patients in who m treatm ent can be init iated wi thin 
12-24 hours after an acute minor stroke or TIA (CHANCE12, POINT13), treatm ent wit h aspirin 
and clopidogrel  is more effect ive than aspirin alone in reducing asymptom atic microembo lic 
signals and the risk of recurrent stroke.
A meta -analysis of data from the CARESS and CLAIR trials below (Figure 3-1) shows that the 
combinat ion of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than monotherapy in reducing the risk of 
ischemic stroke associated with large vessel atherosclerosis.

As shown in Table 3-1, t he risk of recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days with aspirin and clopidogrel 
was considerable in both CHANCE and POINT and the rate of bleeding was higher with 
combinat ion therapy  than wi thaspirin al one.

Despite the improved efficacy of aspirin and clopidogrel  compared to aspi rin alone, the residual 
high risk of recurrent stroke and the higher risk for bleeding with combinat ion therapy  highlight 
the need for a safe and more effective treatm ent opti on.
3.1 Stud y Rationale
A pooled analysis of individual patient data from all rando mized trials of aspirin vs.control  for 
secondary  prevent ion after TIA or ischemic stroke as a function of time after the index event, 
confirmed that medical treatm ent reduces the risk and severit y of early recurrent stroke and that 
aspirin was the key intervent ion.Intensificat ion of antiplatelet therapy  by adding a P2Y12 inhibitor 
to aspi rin treatm ent resul ted in increased efficacy , but at the cost of more bl eeding com plicat ions.
Facto r Xa inhibitors have recognized therapeut ic impact on thromboti c diseases through dose-
dependent inhibit ion of the tissue factor -activated coagulation process. Increasing doses of FXa 
inhibitors cause progressively more inhibit ion of hemostasis and efficac y, until bleeding risks limit  
further increases in FXa doses. Adding a FXa inhibitor to maximized antiplatelet treatm ent 
improves efficacy outcomes (as seen below wit h the COMPASS results) but ,again ,at the cost of 
additional bleeding which is a majo r concern among clinicians when consi dering antithrombotic 
therapy  in pat ients with stroke and threatened stroke .
3.1.1 Novel Antithr ombotic Mechanism of BMS -986177
BMS -986177 (also known as JNJ-70033093) is a small molecule that binds and inhibit s the 
activated form o f human coagulat ion Factor XI (Factor XIa) with high affinit y and select ivity. The

scientific evidence accumulated to date suggest thatinhibit ion of FXIamay provi de a nove l 
mechanism for inhibit ing intravascular thrombus formation with limited impact on hemostasis .14
The rationale for this study  is that Factor XIa inhibit ion has the potenti al to reduce thrombin 
generat ion enough to prevent vascular occlusion and embo lism without impairing hemostasis.
Whereas Factor Xa inhibitors block the tissue factor -activated coagulat ion process required for 
hemo stasis, Factor XIa inhibit ion blocks thrombus format ion through the “contact ”system, which
is not required for norm al hemostasis but appears to contribute to pathological thrombus formation.
The following observat ions support this concept : (1) the highest levels of Factor XIactivit y are
associ ated wi th a heightened risk of ischemic s troke15,16,17; (2) lower levels o f Factor XI activit y
are associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke18,19,20; (3) Factor XI deficiency israrely 
associ ated with unprovoked majo r bleeding21;(4) although not done in patients with stroke, a 
Phase 2study for VTE prophylaxis in patientspost total knee replacement provides a proof of 
concept. The study  showed that reducing FXI levels to 20% or less than normal wit h an ant isense 
inhibitor of FXI synthesis reduced the risk of postoperative VTE compared to enoxaparin, without 
an increase in bleeding compared to enoxaparin .14In patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, single 
doses of 100 mg and 300 mg BMS -986177 reduced clot formation in thehemodialysis circui ts, 
and was not associated with serious bleeding.22
The high residual risk for recurrent stroke seen in the POINT and CHANCE studies (see Table 3-
1),even when patients are treated withcombinat ion of aspirin and clopidogrel ,emphasize sthe 
continuing need for a more effective therapeut ic option. Two possible strategi esfor achieving 
better efficacy are: (1) more potent antiplatelet therapy. (2) dual pathway  inhibi tion of thrombo sis.
3.1.2 More Potent Antiplatelet Therapy
The SOCRATES tri al23tested the hypothesis that treatm ent wi th more potent antiplatelet therapy
with ticagrel or woul d be more effect ive than treatment wi th aspirin in pat ients with TIA or acute 
minor ischemic stroke. The trial compared ticagrel or (a direct -acting P2Y12 receptor inhibitor 
antiplatelet agent) vs.aspirin 100 mg/day . The 11% reducti on in the primary outcom e (stroke, 
myocardial infarct ion, cardi ovascular death) with ticagrel or compared to aspirin was not 
statist ically significant (p =0.07).
A pre-specified exploratory  subgroup analysis of the data from the SOCRATES tri a
l23showed a 
significant treatm ent-by-subgroup interacti on suggesting that the risk for the composite endpo int 
of stroke, myocardial  infarcti on, ordeath was lower with ticagrel or th an aspirin in patients with 
symptom atic ipsilateral stenosis than in those without ipsilateral stenosis in whom the risk for the 
composite endpo int was similar with ticagrel or and aspi rin. The invest igators suggested that this 
analysis provi des empi rical evidence of the importance of an understanding of the stroke 
mechanism and cause in the select ing therapy for early stroke prevent ion
3.1.3 Dual Mech anisms of Thrombosis Inhibition
Support for this strategy  was provided by the recent ly published resul tsof the Cardi ovascular 
Outcom es forPeople Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS24)trial in which 27,395

patients with stable coronary  artery  atheroscl erosis or peripheral artery  atheroscl erosis (but without 
recent stroke) were randomly assigned to receive rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily (BID) , rivaroxaban 
2.5 m g BID plus aspirin, or aspi rin alone. An analysis for the t ertiary outcome o f ischemic stroke 
or uncertain type of stroke showed a relative risk reduct ion of 49% (abso lute risk 
reducti on=0.7%) with low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin vs.aspirin alone (nominal p<0.001). 
Major bleeding increased by 70% (abso lute risk increase =1.2%) with rivaroxaban 2.5mg BID 
plus aspirin compared to aspirin alo ne.24
A recent ana lysis o f the patientsin CO MPASS who had a pri or stroke (3.8%=1,041) showed that 
the annual rate of ischemic stroke was reduced from 3.4% with aspirin alone compared to 0.7%
withrivaroxaban plus aspirin [HR =0.42 (0.19 -0.92), nominal p =0.03) ].25In addition to a 
reducti on in MACE , asubstant ialreduct ion in recurrent ischemic stroke in COMPASS was also 
observed indicat ingthat the combinat ionof antiplatelet therapy  with an anticoagulant has the 
potenti al to be more effective than antiplatelet therapy  or anticoagulat ion alone for secondary 
stroke prevention.
Although the combinat ion of a low dose of rivaroxaban combined with aspirin showed superior 
efficacy , the risk of bleeding increased more than the risk reduction for ischemic stroke. This result 
is attributable to the mechanism by which rivaroxaban and other Factor Xa inhibitors reduce 
thrombosis : dose -dependent inhibit ion of the tissue factor -activated coagulation process wh ich is 
requi red for hemostasis. Increasing doses of FXa inhibitors cause progressive lymore inhibit ion of 
hemo stasis which can predispose to bleeding. In contrast to FXa inhibit ion which impairs 
hemo stasis, FXIa inhibit ionblocks thrombus formation wi thout im pairing hemostasis. The rari ty 
of serious bleeding in people with severe FXI defici ency is consistent with the lack of a significant  
effect of severely reduced FXI activit y on hemo stasis.20
Accordingly , the co mbin ation of BMS-986177 with antiplatelet therapy  has the potenti al to 
provi de superi or efficacy for reducing thromboembo lic events without predisposing to serious 
bleeding.
3.1.4 Selection of Treatments
Identification o f the putative mechanism of stroke is crit icalfor select ing the treatment that is most 
likely to be effective. The totali ty of evidence from clinical tri als to date support the use of more 
intensive antiplatelet therapy  than treatm ent with aspirin alone to reduce the risk of stroke 
associ ated wi th atherosclerosis in the major cerebral arteries and aortic arch.
Accordingly , in this study , in a populat ion with acute ischemic stroke associated with large vessel 
atherosclerosis, the combinat ion of aspirin and cl opidogrel  will be used as a background thera py. 
The combination of a wide range of doses of BMS-986177 with aspirin and clopidogrel  is expected 
to provi de a robust dose -response relat ionship and to i dentify one or more doses that will provide 
improved efficacy  without an increased risk of bleeding that exceeds absolute risk reducti on for 
the com posite endpoint of new ischemic stroke and new covert brain infarct ion.

3.2 Background
3.2.1 Phase 1 and 2aStudies with BMS -986177
BMS -986177 is currently being invest igated in a number of studies in humans including: (1) single 
ascending and multiple ascending dose study; (2) drug-drug interacti ons with itraconazole, 
diltiazem, rifampin ,aspirin, and aspirin plus clopidogrel ; (3) clinical pharmaco logy studies of 
special popul ations including participants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing 
hemodialysis, participants with renal impairment, and participants with hepati c impairment; (4) 
relative bioavailabilit y and (5) Japanese PK study . To date, no dose -limiting safet y findings have 
been observed in these studies.
The first-in-human (FIH) study  withBMS -986177 invest
igated single oral doses between 4 - 500 
mg and multiple oral doses between 5 - 500 mg over a 14-day period. In the single -dose portion 
of the study, dose-proporti onalit y was observed between 20 -200 mg QD with no greater increase 
in exposure observed at 300 mg, believed to be due to solubility
-limited absorpti on. 
Co-administration of a high- fat diet at 200 m g and 500 m g was associ ated wi th ~1.2 -fold and ~2-
fold increases in exposure, respectively. Table 3.2.1 -

A multicenter, cross -over, randomized, Phase 2a proof -of-concept study  in participants
undergo ing hemodialysis for ESRD showed that single doses up to 300 mg of BMS -986177 were 
safe and well tol erated; no seri ous bleeding or other seri ous adverse events occurred. Exploratory 
efficacy  assessment showed that the extent of clot form ation in t he hemodialysis circuitwas similar 
with BMS -986177 and the active comparators (unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin). This result 
suggests that BMS -986177 has clinically meaningful antithrombotic activityat the doses tested .

BMS -986177 combined with antiplatelet therapy  has the potenti al to be safe and more effect ive 
than antiplatelet therapy  alone. Adrug-drug interacti on study  (CV010 02727) showed that 
BMS -
986177 200 mg BID taken with aspirin was safe and well tolerated over a 7-day period in 
healt hy participants, and bleeding time did not increase significant ly.In another drug-drug 
interact ion study  in healt hy participant s, BMS -986177 200 mg was given twi ce daily  (BID) for 5 
days, wit
h and without clopidogrel  and aspirin. Clopidogrel  was given as 300 mg on Day 1 
followed by 4 days of 75 mg clopidogrel , and 325 mg aspirin was administered once daily [QD] 
for 5 days. There were no serious bleeding events reported from any of the 113 healthy participants 
treated in this study28. A few minor bleeding events (e.g., contusion, venipuncture site bruise, 
gingival bleeding, and anal fissure bleeding) occurred in either subjects who received dual 
antiplatelet treatm ent plus BMS -986177, or in partici pants who received dual antiplatelet treatm ent

without BMS -986177, or in participant swho received mono antiplatelet treatment (either 
clopidogrel  or aspi rin) alone, indicating no trend towards any  treatm ent arm s. These findings are 
consistent with the no tion that FXIa inhibit ion is a ssoci ated with a low risk of bleeding, and support 
the proposed clinical trial wit h BMS -986177, aspi rin and cl opidogrel .
3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
Anticoagulationhas the potenti al to cause majo r bleeding which has been demonstrated in all
clinical trials (SPIRIT29, WARSS30, WASID31, ESPRIT32, ARISTOTLE33, RELY34, ROCK ET 
AF35, COMPASS). And the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulation is heightened by 
concomitant use of aspirin and other antiplatelet drugs (ARISTOTLE33, APPRAISE -236, 
ATLAS -237, COMPASS24). Concern about bleeding is a major obstacle to use of ant icoagulation, 
even when clinical trial data show that the absolute risk of bleeding is lower than the risk of 
thromboembo lic events .38
A number of scores based on clinical factors (HEMORRHAGES39, ATRIA40, and HAS -BLED41) 
have been devel oped to predict the risk of major bleeding. However, none of the currently available 
scores aresufficient ly accurate in predi cting majo r bleeding in patients with non-valvular atrial 
fibrillat ion (NVAF) to be used as a rationale to withhol d anticoagulati onto reduce the risk of 
thromboembo lic events, especially stroke .42In addition, some clinical factors (hypertensio n, 
stroke, renal impairment) included in bleeding scores also increase the risk of throm boembo lic 
events.
DOACs are a majo r advance in improving the safety  of anticoagulati on. The risk of intracranial 
hemorrhage, the most devastating kind of bleeding, i s at l east 50% l ower withDOACs com pared 
to warfarin in pat ients with NVAF.43
A recent publication describes uniform  definit ions of cardiovascular and stroke outcom es 
developed by the Standardi zed Data Collection for Cardiovascular Trials and Initiatives (SCTI) 
and the U.S. Food and Drug Administrati on (FDA) .44According to Hicks et al, “The aim is for 
clinical trials to apply the stroke definit ion to assess the clinically relevant consequences of 
vascular brain injury”.
In the context of the SCTI definit ion, a clinically meaningful benefit of treatmen t is not only to 
decrease the number of strokes but also to mitigate the clinical consequences of ischemic brain 
infarction. Since no single outcome measure can describe all the dimensio ns of brain infarct ion45, 
we plan to usemultiple instruments to assess the clinical consequences of brain infarction: 
National Inst itute of Healt h Stroke Scale/Scor e (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Montreal 
Cogni tive Assessment (M oCA), and Digit Symbo l Subst itution Test ( DSST; subtest of WAIS -IV).
The available preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that direct inhibit ion of Factor XIa by 
BMS -986177 has the potential to reduce the risk of thromboembo lic events with a lower risk of 
major bleeding than currently available DOACs, even in combinat ion with aspirin +clopidogrel , 
thus provid ing a favorable benefit/risk.

5 STUDY DESIGN
5.1 Overall Design
The study  is amulti-center, Phase 2, randomized, doubl e-blind, pl acebo -controlled ,dose-ranging
trial. Eligible participants will be screened for potent ial inclusio n into the study as soon as possible 
after presentation and rando mized within 48 hours of the index event .
Following signing of informed consent, participants will receive aspirin 100 mg and a single 
loading dose of clopidogrel  300 m g. Participants will then be rando mized to receive BMS -986177 
or placebo, plus open -label uncoated aspirin 100 mg in combinat ion with clopidogrel  75 mg QD 
for the next 21 days.Parti cipants will continue treatm entfrom Day 22 through Day 
90 with 
BMS -986177 or placebo ,plus open -label 100mg uncoated aspirin only.
An MRI of the brain will be perform ed on Day 90 ± 6 days (based on randomizat ion on Day 1). 
All part icipants should remain on study treatment unt il the Day 90 MRI is performed upto Day 96. 
The enro llment period for this trial will last approximately 36months.
Screening Period:
All study  assessments shoul doccur within the first 48 hours afterthe index event, following 
participant consent.

Abaseline MRI shoul d be acqui red within 48 hours of the index event and prior to 
rando mizat ion on Day 1. I f the baseline MRI cannot be performed within 48 hours of the index 
event and before rando mizat ion, it can be acquired after randomizat ion but must be performed 
within 72 hours of the index event and up to 24 hours after randomizat ion. In instances where 
the baseline MRI is completed after 48 hours from the onset of the index event, the first dose 
of study medicat ion shoul d still be taken immediately after randomizat ion within 48 hours 
from the onset of the index event.
Within 48 hours of the index event, and prior to rando mizat ion, all participants will have a 
Doppl er ultrasound, com puted tomography angiogram (CTA), magnet ic resonance angiogram 
(MRA) , or catheter angiography to assess for the presence of intracranial or cervical arteri al 
atherosclerotic plaque , ulcerat ion, or thrombusthat is proximal to the index lesion. Use of 
available vascular imaging showing a qualifying lesion prior to the stroke e vent is allowed for 
participants who cannot complete the vascular imaging within 48 hours of the index event.
At screening, the following will be obtained: physical  examinat ion, physical measurements,
local clinical laboratory  tests(including pregnancy test for WOCBP) ,vital signs, ECG, and 
medical history .
The following functional/disease severit y assessments are to be completed at screening for 
eligibilit y assessment : ABCD2, NIHSS, and mRS .
Double -blind Treatment Period:
The double -blind treatment period will be fro m Day 1 to Day  90.
During the init ial phase of the study, a minimum o f 800 participants will be rando mized to one 
of the following 4 doses of BMS -986177: 25 m g daily  (QD); 25 m g, 50 m g, or 100 m g twi ce 
daily (BID) ;or pl acebo. Twenty -five perce nt (25%) of  the parti cipants will be randomized to 
the placebo arm,and the rest of  the participants will be rando mized equally to the 4doses of 
BMS -986177.
All participant s will be treated with open -label uncoated aspirin, 100 mg QD ,and clopidogrel, 
75 mg QD(after a single 300-mg clopidogrel  loading dose +aspirin 100 mg one day prior), 
for 21 days ,followed by aspirin alo ne from Day 22 to Day  90.
On Day  1, pri or to the init ial dose of study  medicatio n, the fo llowing will be obtained: central
clinical laboratory  tests f or saf ety, PDsamples, expl oratory  biomarker samples, and optional 
pharmacogeno mic samples .
Assessments of stroke severit y, disabilit y, impact of stroke on daily activities, and cogni tive 
funct ion will be collected at times specified in Table 2-1andTable 2-2.
A Day 60 visit is requi red for central  clinical safety  laboratory  sample within a 7-day visit 
window for approximately 450 participants, after which the DMC will determine if such safet y 
laboratory  assessment will be continued, reduced, or discont inued. The DMC will review 
safet y data, including clinical laboratory  and any available imaging resul tswhen 
approximately 450participants have completed the Day 
21visit. The DMC will recommend
if further monitoring of Day 60 laboratory  samples is needed. The DMC recommendat ion 
regarding the Day  60 clinical  safety laboratory  sample will be communicated to i nvest igator s
by the study  Sponsor.
A telephone contact is requi redon Day 60 ifall the respect iveassessments have not been 
completed onsite.

Onsite visits will be requi red on Days 21 and 90 (end-of-treatm ent visit). At these visits, the 
following will be obtained: central  laboratory  tests for safet y, PK, PD,and exploratory 
biomarkers.
In the event participants are unable or not permitted to attend a n onsite visit due to the COVID -
19 pandemic , alternat ive measures can be considered to ob tain requi red visit assessments as 
local regulatory  requi rements permi t.
The randomiza tion of part icipant s to the 200 -mg BID dose may occur in a staggered approach
after a minimum  of 800 parti cipants have been randomized . The d ecisio n to proceed wi th the 
200-mg BID dose group will depend on the evaluati on of  the popul ation, the DMC review o f 
efficacy and safety data
,and an assessment of whether it is safe to randomize participants to 
that dose group.
When approximately 800 participants have been rando mized, rando mization for the placebo  
group will be used to achieve a 2:1 ratio relat ive to each treatment arm by the end of the study .
Once a decisio n to add the 200- mg BID dose group has been made, rando mizat ion will be 
revised to achieve a target 2:1:1:1:1:1 (placebo: 25 m g QD: 25 mg BID: 50 mg BID: 100 mg 
BID: 200 mg BID) by the end of this study .
All participants will also have an MRI of the brain performed on Day 90 ± 6 (based on 
rando mizat ion on Day 1) to accommodate scheduling and scanner availabilit y. Sites are 
encouraged to schedule the Day 90 MRI at the time of the baseline visit. All part icipants should 
remain on study  treatm ent until the Day 90 MRI 
is perform ed up to Day  96.In the event that 
participants are unable or not permitted to attend the Day 90 onsite visit due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, the Day 90 MRI may be performed at an external facility provided that the MRI 
protocol  and scanner have been pre -approved by the central  imaging vendor. In the event the 
Day 90 MRI cannot be performed wit hin the ± 6-day window, the MRI can be acquired outsi de 
the + 6-day window using the study  site oran external facilit y MRI scanner. For these 
participants, i t is understood that they  may not be taking study  medicat ion past Day  96.
Invest igators will determine the management of parti cipants who have a clinical  event during 
the study  and assess events , 
including those lacking an MRI .
A telephone contact to assess efficacy  and safet y events will be requi red for all participants.  
For participants co mpleting treatment, this contact will be t imed wit hin 7 days after the end o f 
the treatm entperiod and after the D ay 90 MRI. For parti cipants not com pleting treatm ent, an 
MRI i s to be scheduled at Day  90, wi th a telephone contact scheduled 7 day s after the Day  90 
MRI; if for any reason a Day 90 MRI is not obtained, then a telephone conta ct is tobe 
perform ed at Day  97± 2.
Any participant who discontinues study  drug treatm entfor any reason during the trial will 
requi re aDay 90MRI , followed by  the study  discharge telephone visit(Day  97± 2).
Parti cipants who permanent ly discontinue study  treatment early shoul d complete the end-of-
treatm ent assessments, except MRI, at time of study drug discontinuat ion. For these 
participants, the Day 90 MRI as well as Day 97 visit must be completed at the planned visit 
days. Other Day 90 visit assessments do n ot need to be perform ed if they already  were 
completed at the end-of-treatm ent visit. In addit ion, a follow-up telephone contact between
discontinuat ion and Day  90 MRI is encouraged for participants who permanent ly discont inue 
study  treatm ent early.

Rationale for Imaging Endpoints
Brain infarction detected by  MRI frequent ly occurs without focal neurological signs or symptoms
associ ated with acute stroke. The difference between clinically  diagnosed stroke and 
“covert /silent ” brain infarct ionsdetected by  MRI is not pathogenesis, but rather si ze and locati on 
(sparing motor and speech areas of the brain) of the lesio n. Covert ,MRI -detected brain infarct ions
can have clinically meaningful neurological consequences. Covert brain infarct ions,by definit ion,
do not produce symptoms of TIA or stroke but they can be associ ated with neurologic dysfunct ion
such as cogni tive impairment and gait abnormalit y.46,47,48Furtherm ore,covert brain infarct ions
areassociated wit
h an up to 5-fold increase in the risk of future stroke, even after adjust ment for 
other risk factors, and with an increased risk of dementia (HR =6.12, 95% CI:1.82 to20.54) 
independent ly of vascular risk factors and interim stroke.48,49,50Clinicians consider covert brain 
infarctions clinically relevant, and this is now reflected in the recent Am erican Heart Associ ation 
Scientific Statem ent on prevent ing stroke in patients with apparent ly “silent” cerebrovascular 
disease, offering guidance for clinical evaluation and management of these participants .48
MRI -detected brain infarct ion has been included as an endpoint in stroke prevention trials of 
transfusio n in sickle cell anemia51and closure of patent foramen ovale52and as an exclusive 
efficacy  endpoint for a neuroprotectant during endovascular intracranial aneurysm repair53.
In summary , MRI -detected brain lesions are an accepted measure of brain ischemia and tissue 
necrosis that can be used to assess efficacy  in a Phase 2dose-finding study  in participants with 
acute non-hemorrhagic strok e or TIA. The rate of new, covert ,MRI -detected brain infarct ions
(~12% at Day 90) is at least 2 -to 3-fold times higher than the cumulat ive rate of acute stroke (~ 5%
with aspirin and clopidogrel  at 90daysin the POINT tria
l13). Therefore ,the rate (~15%)of the 
composite endpo int of covert ,MRI -detected brain infarct ionand stroke should be sufficient to 
detect a treatment e ffect across doses in this dose -ranging study with a manageable sample size.
5.1.1 Data Monitoring and Other External Committees
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC )
An independent DMC , whose activi ties will  be described in a charter, will monitor the study  and 
be comprised of experienced clinicians, trialists, and statistical experts . The DMC will review
efficacy andsafet y data at designated times during the trial with the purpose of each review defined 
in the DMC charter. After approximately 450 participants have completed the Day 21visit, the 
DMC will recommend if the Day 60 central  laboratory  samples are still needed. The DMC 
recommendat ion regarding the Day  60 clinical  safety  laboratory  sample will  be communicated to
the invest igator by the study S ponsor.
The DMC will review efficacy and safet y data after a minimum of 800 participants have been 
rando mized, and assess whether it is safe to randomize participants to the 200-mg BID dose arm.
The DMC will use their clinical and statistical judgm ent to evaluate pertinent trial data and may 
recommend early terminat ion of an individual study  arm or the entire trialfor important safet y

5.4 Justification for Dose s
5.4.1 Identification of Effective Doses of BMS -986177
Ident ification of effective doses of BMS-986177 was based on inhibit ion of thrombus formatio n 
in a rabbit model of electri cally -induced thrombus in the caroti d artery  of rabbi ts (ECAT). The 
rabbit ECAT model has been calibrated against clinical resul ts in venous thromboembo lism 
prevent ion (VTEp) based on apixaban. In this model, targeting the concentrati on that led to 50%
reducti on inthrombus weight was correlated with the steady-state trough concentration of the 
clinical dose of apixaban. In therabbit ECAT model, BMS -986177 caused a dose-dependent  
decrease in both cl ot wei ght (Figure 5.4.1 -1) and preservat ion of blood flow wit hout a si gnificant 
increase in bleeding time
.  Th edose of BMS -986177 in humans that is equivalent to the EC50in 
the rabbit ECAT modelis 55 nM. Free fraction and Ki against human vsrabbi t factor XIa were 
used to estimate the human equivalent dose.

Equivalent Concentration Targets Based on B MS-986177
A Phase 2 study for VTE prophylaxis post total knee replacement provides t he only published data
on the clinical safet y and efficacy of reducing Factor XI activit y. Pat ients were treated for 36 days 
prior to surgery  with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce the level of Factor XI. The 
study  showed a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of VTE events compared to enoxaparin . 
Doses that did not reduce FXI levels to 20% or less of normal did not reduce the risk of VTE
events compared to enoxaparin .14
Figure 5.4.1 -2shows the dose-dependent decrease in FXI levels and clot wei ght observed in the 
rabbit ECAT model with ASO -induced inhibit ion of FXI. Based on the dose -dependent redu ction 
of FXI concentrations observed in the ASO VTEp study, a trough con centrati on of  approximately 
150ng/mL of BMS-986177 was necessary to achieve an antithrombotic effect equal to the 80% 
reducti on in FXI level in the rabbit ECAT model.Rabbit Plasma [ BMS -986177 ] nM10 100 1000 10000Thrombus Reduction (%) 020406080100

Figure 5.4.1 -2: Reduction in FXI Concentration Based on Factor XI Antisense 
Oligonucleotide (FXI ASO) Compound Used in Phase 2 VTE Study
Based on data obtained fro m healt hy participants , popul ation pharmacokinet ic modeling in dicates 
that doses likely to achieve the trough concentratio n targets based on apixaban and ASO for a 
VTEp study are between 50-200 m g QD and 25 -100mg BID. The data indicating coverage of 
the target concentrations in the rabbit ECAT model for both apixaban and the FXI inhibitor ASO, 
supports the potential for BMS -986177 to provide similar o r greater efficacy in pat ients.
Finally , a lower risk of bleeding is anticipated with inhibit ion of Factor XIa than with inhibi tion 
of Factor Xa, based on the mechanisti c rati onale for targeting the intrinsic pathway  via inhibit ion 
of Factor XIa and therefore testing high doses of Factor XIa inhibit ion is warranted for 
investigat ion of a maximize ddose-response .
5.4.2 BMS -986177 with Aspirin + Clopidogrel

BMS -986177 demonstrated that BMS -986177 may be administered with each antiplatelet agent 
separately  and in combinat ion withlow risk of  serious bl eeding.
The resul ts of the COMPASS trial24showed that,when combined with aspirin, a dose of 
rivaroxaban only 25% of that used for stroke prevent ion in participants with nonval vular atrial 
fibrillat ion (NVAF) reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by 51% compared to aspirin alone. The 
doses of rivaroxaban used in combinat ion with aspirin in COMPASS was half the dose of 
rivaroxaban used in VTEp. Assuming a similar synergist ic effect as observed with rivaroxaban 
and aspirin ,BMS -
986177 combined with aspirin in addit ion to cl opidogrel is expected to provi de 
a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio for secondary  stroke prevent ion.Based on the totalit y of this 
inform ation,50 - 150 mg QD or 25 - 50mg BID of BMS- 986177 are the likely ranges of 
efficacious doses for secondary  stroke prevent ion.However, invest igating a wide dose range to 
establish a robust dose -response curve forBMS -986177 is crit ical to confirm these predict ions.
Accordingly ,a dose-response design will be used to invest igate arange o f doses of BMS-986177 
co-administered with aspirin and clopidogrel  to ident ify the most favorable dose and dosing 
regimen for a secondary stroke prevent ion population for two reasons: (1) to evaluate the efficacy 
of BMS -986177 combined with aspirin and clopidogrel and (2) to establish a n accurate and precise
dose-respon se relationship for BMS -986177.
Dose strengths selected for capsule development of BMS -986177 in Phase 2are 25 and 100 mg.

Eligibilit y criteria for this study  have been carefully considered to en sure the safety  of the study 
participants. Therefore, all participants must fully  meet all  eligibili ty criteria.
6.3 Lifestyle Re strictions
Not applicable.
6.4 Screen Failures
Screen failures are defined as parti cipants who consent to parti cipate in the clinical study  but are 
not subsequently rando mized in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required 
to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards 
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requi rements, and to respond to queries from 
regul atory  authori ties. Minimal informat ion includes date of consent, dem ography , screen failure 
details, eligibilit y criteria, and any  serious AEs.
6.5 Retesting During Screening or Lead -In Period
This study  does not permi t the re-enrollment of a parti cipant who has discont inued the study  as a 
pre-treatm ent failure.
Retesting of laboratory  parameters and/or other assessment s during the screening period will not 
be permitted except for parameters that require a confirmatory  resul t.
The most recent result prior to randomizat ion is the value by which study  inclusio n will be 
assessed, as it repres ents the participant’s most recent clinical state.
7 TREATMENT
Study  treatm ent (aka study drug) is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed 
product(s), placebo or medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according 
to the study  randomizat ion or treatment allocat ion.
Study  treatment includes both Invest igational [Medicinal] Product (IP/IMP) and 
Non-invest igational [Medicinal] Product (Non -IP/Non -IMP) and can consist of the fo llowing:
An invest igationalproduct, also known as invest igational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study , including products already with a market ing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) different ly than the authori zed form, or used for an 
unauthori zed indicat ion, or when used to gain further informat ion about the authorized form. The 
investigat ional product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulat ions. The
investi gator is responsible for ensur ingthat investigat ional product is only dispensed tostudy 
participants . The invest igational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by
authori zed personnel accordin g to l ocal regulat ions.

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
This study will be using an Interactive Response Technol ogy (IRT) to centrally enroll  and 
rando mize all participants . Before the study  is initiated, each user will  receive log in informat ion 
and directions on how to access the IRT.
During the screening visit, the invest igative site will obtain the partici pant’s unique 5-di git 
participant number from the IRT system . Enrolled participants, inc luding those not dosed, will be 
assigned sequential  participant numbers starti ng with 00001, (eg,00001, 00002, 00003... 00010). 
The participant ident ificat ion number (PID) will ultimately  be comprised of the site number and 
participant number. For example, the first participant screened (ie , enro lled) at Site Number 1, will 
have a PID of  0001 00001. Once it is determined that the parti cipant meets the eligibilit y criteria 
following the screening visit, the invest igative site will obtain the participant’s unique 5-di git 
participant number fro m the IRT system.
Study  treatment will be dispensed at the study visits as listed in the Schedule of Activit ies (see 
Secti on 2).
This study  initially started wit
h placebo and 6 dose-schedule combinat ion (3 doses x once daily 
[QD] and twi ce daily  [BID] schedules), wi th 25% of  the parti cipants randomized to placebo. The 
rando mizat ion of participants t o the 200 -mg BID dose will be considered in a staggered approach
after a minimum of 800 participants have been rando mized. The DMC will review efficacy and 
safet y data and assess whether i t is safe to randomize parti cipants to the 200-mg BID dose group .
The target randomizat ion ratio by the end of this study, assuming addition of 200 m gBID, will be 
2:1:1:1:1:1 (placebo: 25 mg QD: 25 mg BID: 
50 mg BID: 100 mg BID: 200 mg BID). All 
participants will receive open -label aspirin 100 mg+open -label clopidogrel  300- mg single

loading dose followed by clopidogrel  75 m g once daily (QD) and aspirin 100 mg for 21 day s then
continue to receive open -label aspirin 100 m g for the duration of the study .
At all study  visits when study  drug is dispensed, each participant will be assigned a container
number by the IRT. Container numbers will be assigned non-sequent ially and will correspond to 
the numbers printed on the packages and bottles containing study  drug, and will be recorded on 
the appropriate electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). The IRT will be available 24 hours per day , 
7 day s a week.
7.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Participant
Study  drug may be administered in the clinical facility or self -administered by the participant or 
their caregiver at home. Caregivers will need to be properly instructed about study  medicat ion 
dosing requirements by the study  staff. The same caregiver should assist the participant wit h their 
daily  dosing.
Following signing of informed consent, participants will be rando mized to receive BMS -986177 
or placebo, plus open -label uncoated aspirin 100 mg in combinat ion with clopidogrel  (a loading 
dose followed by maintenance doses) for the next 21 days. Participants will continue treatment 
fromDay 22 through Day 90 with BMS-986177 or placebo, plus open -label 100 mg uncoated 
aspirin only. 
Aspirin and clopidogrel  will be given open -label as a background therapy  according to the 
following scena rios:
1)Prior to si gning informed consent:
Parti cipants who have received a single open -label  clopidog rel loading dose of between 
300mg a nd 600 mg as st andard -of-care prior to obtaining informed consent can be enrolled 
in the study . No addit ional loading dose of clopidogrel  is requi red for such participants 
after randomizat ion. 
Following a standard -of-care clopidogrel  loading dose, the standard -of-care clopidogrel 
daily  dose of 75 m g will be taken the next day , and i t can be taken pri or to randomizat ion. 
Participants who report taking chronic clopidogrel  also requi re a 300-mg clopidogrel 
loading dose unless the i nvest igator can verify that the participant has taken the daily dose 
for at least the preceding 3 days. 
2)Prior to randomizat ion and after signing i nformed consent:
Following si gning of informed cons ent, a 300 -mg loading dose of clopidogrel and 100 mg 
aspirin may be assigned for immediate treatm ent upon consenting the participant and 
registering the participant in Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT) , if considered 
clinically appropriate. Daily 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg daily aspirin will be started the 
next day .
3)After rando mizat ion:
A clopidogrel  loading dose of 300 mg alo ng with 100 mg aspirin will be administered after 
rando mizat ion on Day 1 forparticipants who have not received any clopidogrel  loading 
dose.

For participants who have received at least 75 mg aspirin as standard of care before 
rando mizat ion, and if this dose was taken on the same day as rando mizat ion, then no 
additional aspirin is requi red on Day  1. In this case, 100 mg daily aspirin should be started 
in the morning o f Day 2.
The first dose of double -blind study medicat ion (BMS -986177 or placebo) should be taken as soon 
as possible after the baseline MRI assessment, preferably within 2 hours, but no longer than 6 
hours. If outside o f the 6-hour post -MRI window, the i nvesti gator should call the Medical Monitor 
for guidance . In instances where the baseline MRI is completed after 48 hours from the onset of 
the index event, the first dose of study medicati on shoul d still be taken immediately after 
rando mizat ion and within 48 hours from the onset of the index event.
BMS-986177 or placebo will be taken twice daily (BID), once in the morning (between 
6AM -9AM) and again in the evening (between 6PM -9PM).
Open -label aspirin and clopidogrel  shoul d be taken QD in the morning (between 6AM - 9AM)  
with thedose of double -blind study  medicat ion.
Following the firs t dose of study  medicati on, the interval between Dose 1 and Dose 2 on Day  1is 
flexible to ensure a consistent AM-PM dosing schedul eafter Day 1
 dosing . The second dose of 
study  medicat ion (if outside the window o f 6AM -9AM or 6PM –9PM ) can be administ ered at a 
minimum of 6  hours post-dose or maximum of 15 hours post last dose. Three examples are 
provi ded below:
Parti cipant enters the study  and is administered study  medicat ion at 2:30AM . The next dose 
of study medicati on would be administered between 8:30AM and9AM (a 6-to6.5-hour 
window) on the same day. The participant would then receive the next dose between 6 PMand
9PM .
Parti cipant enters the study  and is administered study  medicat ion at 4AM. The next dose of 
study  medicat ion woul d be administered between 6PM and7PM(a 14-to15-hour window). 
Since the interval between 4AM and 9 AM is <
6 hours ,the participant must wait for the 
evening dose to be taken no more than 15 hours after Dose 1.
Parti cipant enters the study  and is administered study  medicat ion at 5PM. The next dose of 
study  medicat ion would be administered between 6AM and 8AM (a 13 -to 15 -hour window) .
Since the interval  between 5PM and 9PM is <6 hours, the participant woul d not receive the 
evening dose and must wait to administer th e second dose as a morning dose .
The flexibilit y in the schedule between Dose 1 and Dose 2allows the most ethical dosing of 
BMS -986177 to ensure the integrity of the study  while provi ding appropri ate exposure coverage 
during a high -risk peri od for a strok e.
Blinded study  medicat ion (BMS -986177 or placebo) will be provided by the Sponsor .Open -label 
aspirinwill be provi ded by the Sponsor . Participants will take onetablet each day  in the AM wit h 
their morning dose of blinded study  medicat ion.Open -label clopidogrel  will be provided by the

day supply at Day 1 and a 64-day re-supply of double -blind study  medicat ion at the Day  21visit.
The treatment period will last 90± 6 days, with the last doses of study medication taken on Day 
90or until the Day 90 MRI visit is completed, but no more than 96days, while continuing 
treatm ent.Participants who cannot complete the Day 90 MRI due to the COVID -
19 pandemic
shoul d continue treatm ent with study drug until the MRI is completed and until all other study 
assessments are completed, if at a later time. For these participants, it is understood that they may 
not be taking study  medicati on past Day  96 (see Secti on 9.2.12 ).
Study  medicat ion shoul d be taken at approximately the same time each dayonce a consistent 
AM/-PM dosing schedule is achieved .If a  participant misses a dose of study medicat ion, the 
missed dose should be taken as soon as possible and no later than 6 hours after the regular dosing 
time. If it is greater than 6 hours fro m the regular dosing t ime, the missed dose should not be taken. 
Instead, the next dose shoul d be taken at the regul ar time. Twice -daily dosing shoul d then be
resum ed.
7.4 Blinding
Blinding of treatm ent assignment is critical to the integri ty of this clinical  study . However, in the 
event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge o f the 
investigat ional product is critical to the participant's management, the blind for that participant 
may be broken by the investigator. The participant’s safet y takes priority over any other 
considerations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatm ent, the invest igator should 
determine that the unblinded informat ion is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the participant's 
immediate m anagement. In many  cases, parti cularly  when the emergency  is clearly not rel ated to 
the investigational product, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant 
is receiving act ive product. It is highly desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed wi th the Medical Moni tor, but the investigator al ways has ul timate authori ty for the 
decisio n to unblind. The principal invest igator shoul d only call in for emergency  unblinding 
AFTER the decisionto discont inue the participant 's study  medicat ionhas been made.
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency purposes is through the IRT system. I
n 
case of an emergency , the invest igator has unrestricted access to randomizat ion inform ation via 
IRT and can break the blind through the IRT system  without prior approval from the Spon sor. 
After the unblinding, the invest igator shall notify the Medi cal Monitoror Clinical Scientist . The 
method of unblinding for emergency purposes is described in the IRT Manual. Parti cipant and 
unblinded treatment informat ion and the reason for the blind being broken must be recorded on 
the appropriate study  status pa ge of the eCRF.
In cases of accidental  unblinding, contact the Medical Moni tor and ensure every  attem pt is made 
to preserve the blind. Any request to unblind a participant for non -emergency purposes shoul d be 
discussed wi th the Medical Monitor.

A separate analysis team  for the Sponsor, separate from t he clinical team  invo lved with the conduct 
of this study , will perform an administrative interim analysis (see Secti on 10.3.7 ), in order to 
facilitate subsequent program development.
Designated staff of Bristol-Myers Squibb Research & Devel opment , not involved in the study , 
may be unblinded (obtain the randomizat ioncodes) prior to database lock to facilitate the 
bioanalyt ical analysi s of pharmacokinet ic samples . A bioanalyt ical scient ist in the Bioanaly tical 
Sciences depart ment of Bristol -Myers Squibb Research & Devel opment (or a designee in the 
external central  bioanaly tical laboratory ) will be unblinded to (may obtain) the randomized 
treatm ent assignments in order to minimize unnecessary bioanalyt ical analysis o f samples , as well 
as provi de assist ance for analyses needed for DMC in scope of the DMC charter.
The Da ta Monitoring Committee (DMC; see Sect ion 5.1.1) will assess safet y on an ongoing basis, 
and will have access to unblinded treatm ent codes for individu al participants . An analysis team , 
including a reporting statistician and programming support, who are not invo lved with the conduct  
of the study , will  provide analyses to the DMC.
Except as noted above, other members of Sponsor Research and Devel opment personnel, as well 
as all vendors responsible for the conduct of the trial (protocol team) will remain blinded.
7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability

The ultimate decision to pe rform MRI in an individual participant in this study  rests with the site 
radiologist, the i nvest igator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.
7.8 Treatment After the End -of-Study
At the end ofthe study , the Sponsor will not continue to provide study treatm ent to 
participants/i nvestigators unless the Sponsor chooses to extend the study . The i nvest igator should 
ensure that the participant r eceives appropriate treatment forthe condi tion under study .
8 DISCONTINUATION OR INTERRUPTION CRITERIA
During the course of the study , situations may occur in which the invest igator considers a 
temporary  interrupti on or permanent discont inuation of study drug necessary. For treatm ent 
interrupti ons ≥48 consecut ive hours, the period of interruption should be noted and the invest igator 
shoul d docum ent on the CRF the time and date of interruption and restart of therapy, as well as 
the reason for interruption and measures taken to correct the event . An adverse event ( AE)should 
be reported , if applicable.
Guidance on dose interrupti ons or permanent discontinuat ions for selected events are described 
below. For an individual participant , dose interrupti ons may be more or less conservat ive than 
indicated below based on the clinica l judgment of the i nvest igator.
All part icipants who discont inue study treatm ent should comply wit h protocol specified fo llow-up 
procedures as outlined in Sect ion 2. The only  excepti on to this requi rement is when a parti cipant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow
-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  treatm ent is di scontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.

8.1 Bleeding
All study treatment must be discont inued immediately in participants with a majo r bleeding event 
(BARC Types 3 and 5).  Please refer to the Study Events Asses sment Manual  for definit ions/details 
related to BARC bleeding criteria.
Parti cipants with other than major bleeding or suspected bleeding shoul d be assessed for an 
underlying cause wit h appropriate laboratory testing (e.g., hematology, ultrasound, CT, MRI) . The 
date and time of onset of the bleeding event should be recorded on the CRF. Refer to Section 9.2.1
for measures to consider for management of a bleeding event.
8.2 Elevated Liver Function Tests
All participants will discont inue treatment with blinded study treatment immediately if criteria for 
drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are met (see Section 9.2.11 for details).
In addition, s top treatm ent wi th blinded study  treatment if:
ALT and/or AST >5x ULN for ≥7 consecutive days ,confirmed by repeat .
ALT and/or AST ≥10x ULN , confirmed by repeat .
Interrupt treatment with blinded study  treatm ent if:
ALT and/or AST >3x ULN ,confirmed by repeat.
Parti cipants wi th abnorm al liver funct ion tests shoul d be followed until  ALT/AST returns to <2x 
ULN or to baseline prior to considering re -start of treatment with blinded study  treatm ent, but not 
later than 14 days post- interrupti on.
8.3 Elective Procedures or Surgery
The ant icoagulant effects of BMS -986177 shoul d dissipate in 48 -72 hours after the last dose of 
the drug. Therefore, blinded study treatments must be stopped at least 48hours prior to an invasive 
procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding. The participant will re-start blinded study  medicat ion 
once the invest igator determines that hemostasis is secure andresuming treatm ent is safe, but no 
earlier tha n 24 hours after the procedure/surgery .
The interruption of aspirin or clopidogrel  treatment for elect ive procedures or surgery  should 
follow local practice.
8.4 Emergency Procedures
For participants receiving BMS -986177, the risk of bleeding with invasive procedures is unknown. 
At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of BMS -
986177 will not be reflected by INR values ,
but maybe reflected by prolongati on of aPTT. Currently ,there is no reversal agent for 
BMS -986177. However, the anticoagulant effect of BMS-986177 dissipates in 48 - 72 hours.
Refer to Section 9.2.1 for measures to consider for management of a bleeding event .
For participant with a new stroke during the study  period, the use of thrombo lytic therapy , 
mechanical thrombectomy (without stenting) ,or other standard -of-care therapy ,is to be 
implemented at the discretion of the i nvest igator , to include possibilit y of unblinding (see Secti on

986177 must be interrupted and restart of BMS-986177 is only permi tted if all of thefollowing 
condi tionsare m et: 
At least 24 hours have elapsed between end of IV thro mbolyt ic use/thrombectomy and first 
dose of study  medicat ion.
Clinical imaging has been performed to exclude any hemorrhagic transform ation of the 
new infarct.
Post-thrombo lytic therapy /post -thrombectomy  INR ≤ 1.5, aPTT ≤ 1.4 at the time of 
BMS -986177 restart.
No contraindications have been ident ified that in the opinio n of the invest igator would 
precl ude start of study  medicat ion (eg, large infarct volume, procedure -related bl eeding).
All other study  criteria are m et.
In addition, we recommend following local practice and considering fibrinogen > 150 mg/dL 
before init iation of study  treatm ent.
8.5 Other Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Parti cipants MUST di scont inue BMS -
986177 for any  of the f ollowing reasons:
Parti cipant’s request to stop study treatm ent. Participants who request to discontinue study 
treatm ent will remain in the study  and shoul d be encouraged to be followed for protocol -
specified follow-up procedures. The only except ion to thi s is when a participant specifically 
withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authori zed by 
participant to provide this informat ion.
Any clinical  AE, laboratory  abnorm ality or intercurrent illnes s which, in the opinio n of the 
investi gator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in the best interest of the 
participant .
Terminat ion of the study  or program  by Bristol -Myers Squ ibb (BMS) .
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of ei ther a psychiatric or physical (e.g. , infect ious di sease) illness. 
Note : Under specific circumstances, a participant who has been i mprisoned may be permitted
to con tinue as a parti cipant. Strict condi tions apply and Sponsor approval is required.
Severe non-compliance to protocol, as judged by  the i nvest igator and/or Sponsor .
Incorrect enrollment (i.e., the participant does not meet the required inclusion/exclusio n 
criteria) for the study , as determined after consultation with the Sponsor .
Pregnancy: the i nvest igator must immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy , 
notify the BMS M edical Monitor/designee of this event. See Section 9.2.7 .
Discontinuati on of  open -label clopidogrel  and/or aspi rin are at the discretion of the i nvest igator.
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify the BMS Medical 
Moni tor/desi gnee of this event. In the event a female participant becomes pregnant during a 
clinical trial, the study treatment must be discont inued immediately. Pleas e call the BMS Medical 
Moni tor wi thin 24 hours of  awar eness of the pregnancy. If the investigator determines a possible

investigator and the BMS Medical Mo nitor/desi gnee m ust occur.
All participants who discont inue study  treatm ent shoul d comply with protocol -specified follow-
upprocedures as outlined in Section 2. The only excepti on to this requirement is when a participant  
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow
-up or l oses the
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  treatm ent is di scontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
8.6 Discontinuation from the Study
Parti cipants who request to discont inue study  treatm ent will remain in the study  and shoul d be 
encouraged to continue to be followed forprotocol  specified follow-
up procedures. For these 
participants , the fo llowing visi ts must be conducted:
End-of-treatm ent assessments, except MRI, at the time of study  drug discont inuat ion.
MRI at Day  90 ( ±6 days) .In the event that parti cipants are unable or not permi tted to attend 
the Day 90 visit at the study  site dueto the COVID -19 pandemic, theDay 90 MRI may be 
perform ed at an external facilit y provi ded that the MRI protocol and scanner have been pre-
approved by the central  imaging vendor. In the event the Day 90 MRI cannot be performed 
within the ± 6-day window, the MRI can be acquired at any  time after Day  90 using the study 
site or an external  facility MRI scanner. For these parti
cipants, i t is understood that they  may 
not be taking study  medication past Day  96.
Aphone call visit Day  97 ± 2 (7 day s after Day  90 MRI)
In addit ion, a fo llow-up telephone contact between discontinuat ion and Day 90 MRI is encouraged 
for parti cipants who perm anently discont inue study treatm ent early .The only except ion to thi s is 
when a participant specifically  withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participa nt to provi de this informat ion.
For participants who withdraw consent for fo llow-up, there should be document ation of the reason 
for withdrawal. Study  staff shoul d explici tly seek inform ation about the possible contribut ion of 
AEs to th e participant ’s desire to withdraw and docum ent any AEs that are ident ified in the AE
section of the CRF.
Withdrawal of consent for treatm ent with study medicat ion shoul d be distinguished from 
withdrawal  of consent for follow-up visits, telephone contacts, or medical records checks. 
Parti cipants requesting withdrawal from follow-up shoul d be informed that withdrawal o f consent 
for follow-up will resul t in loss of important inform ation about the benefits and risks of 
BMS -986177.

Parti cipants shoul d notify  the investi gator of the decisio n to withdraw consent from future 
follow-up in writing, whenever possible .
The withdrawal  of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the 
investi gator, as to whether the wi thdrawal is from  further treatm ent wi th study  treatm ent only 
or also from study procedures and/or post-treatment study  follow-up, and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being collected , 
publicly  available informat ion shoul d be used to determine vital status only as appropri ately 
directed in accordance with loc al law.
If the partici pant withdraws consent for disclos ure of future informat ion, the Sponsor may 
retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent.
8.7 Post -Study Treatment Follow -up
Post-treatm ent fo llow-up is required to ass ess partici pant safety  and to preserve the integrit y of the 
study . Efficacy outcomes will also be collected during the foll ow-up peri od.If study  treatm ent is 
discontinued early, the participant is expected to complete the end -of-treatm ent assessments at the 
time of di scont inuat ion (Table 2-2) except MRI . For these parti cipants, a Day 90 MRI , as well as 
Day 97 visit, must be completed at the planned visit date s.In the event that participants are unable 
or not permitted to attend the Day 90 visit at the study  site dueto the COVID -19 pandemic, the
Day 90 MRI m ay be perform ed at an external facilit y provi ded that the MRI protocol and scanner 
have been pre-approved by the central  imaging vendor. In the event the Day 90 MRI cannot be 
perform ed wi thin the ± 6-day window, the Day 90 MRI can be acqui red at any  time after Day  90 
using the study site or an external facilit y MRI scanner. For these participants, it is understood that 
they may not be taking study  medicat ion past Day  96.
8.8 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to determine and report their ongoing 
status. This includes fo llow-up wi th persons authorized by  the participant.
Lost to follow-up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the participant after a minimum of three
docum ented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one 
registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records.
If at the participant has died, the site willuse permissible local methods to obtain date and cause 
of death.
If investi gator’s use of third -party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study has 
been included in the participan t’s informed consent, then the invest igator may use a Sponsor 
retained third-party  representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s contact 
inform ation or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow-up porti on of the 
study .
The site staff and representative will consult publicly  available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, to obtain updated contact informat ion.

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (see Sect ion 2). Protocol 
waivers or exempt ions are not allowed. All immediate safet y concerns must be discussed with the 
Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue 
or discontinue tr eatment.
Adherence to the study  design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essent ial and required for study  conduct. All screening evaluat ions must be completed 
and reviewed to confirm that potenti al partici pants meet all eligibilit y criteria before 
rando mizat ion. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all partici pants 
screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the parti cipant’s routine clinical  management ( e.g., blood c ount) 
and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized for screening or 
pre-treatment  
baseline purposes provi ded the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been 
perfo rmed wi thin the tim eframe defined in the Schedule of Act ivities.
9.1 Efficacy Assessments
All part icipants will have a study  MRI scan at baseline (Day  1) and Day 90,as described in Table 
2-1andTable 2-2.The baseline MRI shoul d be acqui red within 48 hours of the index event and 
prior to randomizat ion on Day  1. If the baseline MRI cannot be performed within 48 hours of the 
index event and before rando mizat ion, it can be acqui red after randomization but mustbe 
perform ed wit hin 72 hours of the index event and up to 24 hours after randomizat ion.If the study -
specific MRI cannot be acqui red atbaseline, a clinical (standard -of-care) MRI scan can be used 
provi ded that the clinical MRI protocol  and scanner have b een pre-approved by the central imaging 
vendor.
The first dose of study  medicat ion (BMS -986177 or pl acebo) shoul d be taken as soon as possible 
after the baseline MRI assessment, preferably wit hin 2 hours, but no longer than 6 hours. If outside 
of the 6 -hour post -MRI window, the i nvest igator should call the Medical Monitor for guidance. If 
the baseline MRI is completed after 48 hours from the onset of  the index event, the first dose of 
study  medicat ion shoul d still be taken immediately after randomizat ionwithin 48 hours from the 
onset of the index event.
The baseline MRI and the Day 90 MRI will be submitted to a central imaging vendor for analysis.
Details regarding MRI acquisit ion, including required sequences, slice thickness, and qualifying 
phantom  image( s)are presented in the CV010 -031 Imaging Manual . Sites must be trained and 
qualified prior to scanning the first study  participant.
9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Assessments

The fo llowing are secondary  efficacy  assessments :
Com posite ofnew ischemic non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardi al infarc tion, or all-cause
death
Locati on, number, and vo lume of new FLAIR +DWI l esions
National Insti tutes of  Heal th Stroke Scal e(NIHSS), Modified Rankin Scale (m RS), Montreal 
Cogni tive Assessment (MoCA), and Digit Symbol Subst itution Test (subtest of WAIS -IV) will 
be co llected at baseline (at randomizat ion for NIHSS) , on Days 21 and 90, and at the time of a 
new stroke event .MoCA and DSST (subset of WAIS -IV) will be read by a third -party central 
laboratory  blinded to treatm ent.
9.2 Safety Assessments
9.2.1 Bleeding
The main safety endpo int assessment is majo r bleeding (based onBARC Types 3 and 5
definit ions). Participants with bleeding or suspected bleeding will be assessed and treated 
according to usual  clinical  practice at each site. Severit y of bleeding will be classified according 
to BARC, ISTH and PLATO ( Refer to the Study  Events Assessment Manual for definitions and 
details for the bl eeding endpoints ).
Approach to a Participant with a Bleeding Event
If a participant has a bleeding event requiring intervent ion dur ing the study, the following measures 
shoul d be considered:
Discontinue the study  drug (refer to Secti on 8.1, Discontinuat ion of Study Drug).
Usual treatment measures for bleeding events, including local pressure , fluid replacement and 
hemodynamic support, and blood transfusio n,if indicated
Other causes besides antithrombotic medication can contribute to the seriousness of the 
bleeding event (e.g., rule out thrombocy topenia, disseminated intravascular coagul ation, and 
other coagulopathies, kidney and liver dysfunct ion, concomitant medicat ions, etc. ) and should 
be assessed and treated accordingly
Consult ation with a coagulati on/hematol ogyexpert
Possibilit y of unblindin g at the di screti on of  the i nvestigator (see S ection 7.4)
Current ly, there is no specific reversal  agent f or BMS -986177. Before considering the use of any 
pro-hemostatic agent, the benefit and risk for each individual participant shoul d be assessed, and 
consultation with a  hematologist shoul d be considered. Replacement therapy  with Factor XI 
concentrates is not recommended because the participan ts are not Factor XI deficient. 
BMS -986177 does not bind Factor XI but rather only binds to activated Facto r XI. Therefore, 
increasing circulating Factor XI is not likely to have a significant impact on BMS -986177 
pharmaco logy. In vitro studi es in human plasma demonstrated that addit ion of 4-factor activated

prothrombin concentrate complex (FEIBA , aPCC) or recombinant Factor VIIa (NovoSeven ) 
reduced the BMS -986177- induced prolongati on of the aPTT. In FXI-deficient participants , 
recombinant Factor VIIa has been used successfully  to prevent surgi cal bleeding without 
complicat ion. Therefore, if severe bleeding occurs that cannot be controlled by the above 
measures, or emergent surgery /invasive procedure is required, pro-hemostatic agents may be 
considered according to their package insert. 
At therapeutic doses, the anticoagulant effects of BMS-
986177 will not bereflected by 
internat ional norm alized ratio (INR) values but may be reflected by prolongat ion of aPTT. The 
anticoagulant effect of BMS -986177 di ssipates in 48 to 72 hours after the last dose.
Clopidogrel  and aspi rin inhibit pl atelet function and m ay also contribute to bl eeding. Parti cipants 
receiving clopidogrel  and aspirin shoul d be managed according to the local standard- of-care and 
the drug product label.
9.2.2 Adverse Events
The definit ionsof an AE or seri ous adverse event (SAE) can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported to the investigator by the participant (or, when appropri ate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's lega lly authorized representative).
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that meet the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontin ue before com pleting the study.
Conta cts for SAE reporting are specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.3 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The collect ion of non-serious AE (NSAE) information shoul d begin at randomizat ionuntil the 
time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). NSAE informat ion shoul d also be 
collected from the start of a  placebo lead-in period or other observat ional period intended to 
establish a baseline status for the participants.
Secti on 6 in the Invest igator ’sBrochure26(IB) represent sthe Reference Safety  Information (RSI) 
to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedi ted reporting. Following the partici pant’s written 
consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, m ust be 
collected, including those thought to be a ssoci ated wi th protocol -specified procedures.
All SAEs that occur during the screening perio d through the fo llow-up peri odmust be collected.
The investigator must report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure:
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate sectio n of the eCRF section.Labs perform ed 
locally for assessment of SAEs shoul d have reports faxed or scanned and emailed to  
.

All SAEswill be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendix 3 .
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of this being 
available.
Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek NSAEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the i nvest igator must prompt ly notify the Sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causali ty of NSAEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and repor ting/transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluation of a  participant. Care shoul d be taken not to introduce bias when 
collect ing NSAE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement  
in the context of known AEs, when appropri ate for the program or protocol.
9.2.5 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Non-serious AEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also required for NSAEs that cause interrupti on or discont inuat ion of study 
treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
All ident ified non -serious AEs m ust be recorded and described on the NSAE page of the CRF 
(paper or electronic). Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or 
laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
Invest igators should collect a Medical Release Form fro m all study participants to allow access 
to SAE information occurring at off -site medical  facili ties.
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condi tion stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwi se explained, or until the participant is lost to fo llow-up (as defined in Sect ion8.8).

Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory  authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of 
Federal Regulat ions 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse React ion) is a su bset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regul atory  authori ties 
and invest igators following local and glo bal guidelines and requirements.
9.2.7 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study  treatment it is subsequent ly discovered that a participant is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposu re, including during at least 5 
half-lives (4 days) after product administration, the invest igator must immediately notify the 
Sponsor Medical Moni tor/desi gnee of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form  to Sponsor Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3 .
If the invest igator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk rati o that warrants con tinuat ion of 
study  treatment, or re -initiation of study treatment, a discussio n between the invest igator and the 
BMS Medical Moni tor/desi gnee must occur. If, for whatever reason, pregnancy has ended, 
confirmed by negat ive serum pregnancy test, treatment ma y be resumed (at l east 3 weeks and not 
greater than 6 weeks after the pregnancy has ended), following approvals of 
participant/Sponsor /IRB/EC, as applicable.
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee tocollect any pregnancy surveillance 
inform ation from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for 
disclosure of this informat ion. Inform ation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
9.2.8 Overdose
For this study , the accidental  or intentional administration of any dose of BMS-986177 that is 
considered both excessive and medically important by the invest igator will be considered an 
overdose and should be reported as a SAE (medically important event).
The sponsor does not recommend specific interventio n for an overdose. There is no known antidote 
for overdose with BMS -986177 and no studi es have been performed to assess methods of reversing 
BMS -986177 absorption effects; however, in theory, act ivated c harcoal  may reduce the absorption 
of BMS -986177 if given early after administration of BMS -986177.
See Secti on 9.2.1 for management of serious bleeding.
Overdose of aspirin or clopidogrel  may increase the risk of bleeding. Follow the local product 
label for management of aspirin or clopidogrel overdose.

9.2.12 Magnetic Resonance Imaging
A baseline and Day 90 MRI of the brain are required for all partici pants randomized in the trial 
per study  guidelines. Allscans shoul d be acqui red in compliance with the study -specific MRI 
protocol  as outlined in the imaging manual provided by  the central  imaging vendor.
The baseline MRI shoul dbe acquired within 48 hours of the index event and prior to randomizat ion 
on Day 1. If the baseline MRI cannot be performed within 48 hours of the index event and before 
rando mizat ion, it can 
be acquired after rando mizatio n but must be performed within 72 hours of 
the index event and up to 24 hours after randomizat ion.If the study -specific MRI cannot be 
acqui red at baseline, a clinical (standard -of-care) MRI scan can be used provided that the clinical 
MRI protocol  and scanner have been pre -approved by  the central  imaging vendor.
A second MRI of the brain will be perform ed on Day 90 ± 6 days (based on randomization on 
Day 1) to accommodate scheduling and scanner availabilit y. Sites are encouraged to schedule the 
Day 90 MRI at the time of the baseline visit. All participants shoul d remain on study  treatm ent 
until the Day 90 MRI i s perform edup to Day  96. 
In case of early  study  drug discontinuation prior to D ay 90, a Day 90 MRI will st ill be required.
In the event that participants are unable or not permitted to attend the Day 90 visit at the study sit e 
dueto the COVID -
19 pandemic, the Day 90 MRI may be per formed at anexternal facilit yprovi ded 
thatthe MRI protocol  and scanner have been pre -approved by the central  imaging vendor. In the 
event the Day 90 MRI cannot be perform ed within the ± 6-day window, the Day 90MRI can be 
acqui red outside of the + 6-day window after Day 90 using the study  site or an external facilit y 
MRI scanner. For these participants, it is understood that they may not be taking study medicat ion 
past Day  96.
All MRI scans must be performed at qualified MRI facilit ies. More than one imaging facilit y can 
be utilized during conduct of the study  withpreference to perform baseline and Day 90 scans on 
the sam e scanner or of the same manufacturer, or minimally wit h the same magnetstrength as the

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Sample Size Determination 
The primary endpo int for this study  is the incidence of events within a co mposite of new ischemic 
stroke during the treatm ent period and new covert brain infarction (FLAIR + DWI) detected by 
MRI at 90 days. Sample size calculat ions were per form ed for detecting a dose -response effect with 
the MCP -MOD methodol ogy using simulat ions with the Dose -Finding package in Rstatistical 
analysis software . Simulati ons of 2500 clinical trials were performed, assuming a true incidence 
for placebo of 15%, aplateau shaped dose response relationship with maximum  relative risk 
reducti on of 32% for BMS -986177 100 or 200 mg BID relative to placebo and reductions o f 10%, 
17.5%, and 27% for the 25-mg QD, 25 - mg BID, and 50-mg BID doses, respectively. Candidate 
models included an E maxmodel, a logisti c model, and an exponenti al model.
Using these assumpt ions, a total o f 2100 participants allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and 
BMS -986177, 25 m g QD, 25 m g BID, 50 mg BID, 100 m g BID, and 200 mg BID groups would
provi de approximately 80% power to demonstrate a dose-response relationship, with a

allocated in a 2:1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo and BMS -986177, 25
-mg QD, 25-mg BID, 50-mg BID, 
and 100 -mg BID groups would provide approximately 79% power to demonstrate a dose -response 
relationship with similar pattern, but risk reducti on of 32% forBMS -986177 50 or 100 mg BID 
relative to placebo and reductio ns of 17.5%, and 27% for the 25-mg QD and 25-mg BID doses, 
respectively . Allowing up to 10% of participants who do not have a clinical event and also d o not 
have a Day 90 imaging assessment, approximately and up to 2350 participants may be randomized. 
The frequency and reasons for missing data will be evaluated in blinded fashio n during the course 
of the study .
10.2 Populations for Analyses
The analyses will use several populations as defined below:
1)All Enrolled Participants : Incl udes all partici pants who si gned informed consent.
2)All Rando mized Parti cipants /Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion: Includes all participants who 
were randomized to a treatment, regardless of whether they  received study  drug or not.  This 
popul ation will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned at randomization.
3)All Evaluable Participants : Includes All Randomized Participants ,as above, excluding those 
participants’ visits where relevant protocol deviat ions occurred. The relevant protocol 
deviat ions will be pre -specified in the SAP prior to database lock.
4)All Treated Participants : Includes all participants who received at least one dose of study 
medicat ion.  Thi s will  be the primary populat ion used in safety  analyses and will  be analyzed 
according to the treatment assigned at randomizat ion, except in the following cases:
If a participant received the same incorrect treatment throughout the study (unt il either Da y 
90 or discon tinuation of the study drug), then the participant will be analyzed based on the 
treatm ent received.

If a participant received study  drug from more than one treatm ent group, and none of the 
administrations were consistent with the assigned randomized treatment group, then the 
participant will be analyzed based on the first treatment received.
5)Pharmacodynamics (PD) Populat ion: A subset of the ITT Populat ion that includes participants 
with at least one PD endpoint assessed fo llowing the first dose of BMS -986177.
6)Pharmacokinet ic (PK) Population for BMS -986177 ,clopidogrel , and aspirin: Includes all 
participants treated with BMS -986177, clopidogrel , and aspirin, respectively, who also have 
at 
least one post -dose PK sample.
The primary  efficacy  data set will be the ITT populat ion.For the primary efficacy  endpo int 
analysis, the popul ationwill include all  Randomized Participants who:
have a primary endpoint event (a new ischemic stroke during the study period or a new covert 
brain infarct iondetected by  MRI onDay 90)
OR
have an evaluable MRI image onDay 
90.
For the primary endpoint, analys is will be performed using the Evaluable Participant data set as 
well as the Primary  Efficacy d ata set.
10.3 Statistical Analyses
The StatisticalAnalysis P lan (SAP) will be develo ped and finalized before the final database l ock 
and will describe the select ion of participants to be included in the analyses, and procedures for 
accounting for missing, unused, and spuri ous data. Below is a summary of planned statistical 
analyses o f the primary  and secondary  endpoints.
Except as otherwise noted, descript ive summaries will use data from all rando mized groups, while 
dose-response analyses of primary and secondary  endpo ints will use data from participants 
rando mized to placebo, 25 mg QD and 25 m g, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg BID groups.
A descri ptionof the participant popul ation will be included in the statistical output reported, 
including subgroups of age, gender ,and race.

MONITORING
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to ident ify potenti al issues to 
determine a schedule of on -site visi ts for targeted review o f study  records. 
Representatives of BMS must be allowed to visit all study  site locati ons peri odically to assess the 
data qualit y and study integrit y. On site orthrough other means of remote monitoring approved by 
the Sponsor and as local regulatory  requirements permit, they will review study  records and 
directly compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the 
investigator, and verify  that the facilit ies remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or el ectroni c 
files may  serve as the source documents:
In addi tion, the study  may be evaluated by  Sponsor or desi gnee internal auditors and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study  files, and study 
facilit ies. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.
The investigator must notify BMS prom ptly of any inspect ions scheduled by regulatory  authori ties, 
and prompt ly forward copi es of  inspect ion reports to Sponsor or designee.

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADV ERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent 
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, cons idered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, t he reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study intervent ion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervention 
or a concomitant medicat ion.
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospital).

DEFINITION OF SAE
If an event i s not an AE per definit ion above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious condi tions 
are met.
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the parti cipant was at ri sk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it we re 
more severe)
Requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospi talizat ion (see NOTE 
below)
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result in 
admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical proce dure
routi ne health assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy ill healt h and planned prior to entry into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative r eason)
admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies 
to oncology  protocol s)
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect

Is an important m edical event (defined as a medical event(s) that m ay not be immediately life-
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other seri ous outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 9.2.11 for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) 
Pregnancy and potenti al drug induced liv er injury (DILI) must follow the same transmissio n timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see section 9.2. 7for reporting pregnancies).
Any co mponent of a study  endpoint that i s considered related to study  therapy  should be reported 
as SAE (e.g., death is an endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be 
reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the rel ationship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study intervent ion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opinio n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion 
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-
up SAE reports must include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensit y or relationship to study  treatm ent or if new 
inform ation beco mes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours 
to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO S PONSOR OR DESIGNEE
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately wit hin 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs m ust be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
The requi red m ethod for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.
The paper SAE Report Form  is only intended as a back-up option when the electronic 
data capture (EDC) sy stem  is unavailable/not functi oning for transmissio n of the eCRF 
to BMS (or designee).
In this case, the paper form is transmitted via email  or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n
When paper forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site
Pregnancies must be recorded on a paper Pregnancy Surveillance Form and transmitted via

APPENDIX 4 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTE NTIAL DEFINITIONS AN D 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterilizat ion m ethods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy , and bilateral  oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingecto my
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over the age 
of 45years in the absence of other bio logical or physio logical causes. In addit ion, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type ofHRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal p roducts
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered 
postm enopausal.

Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effec tive contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstine nce is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated w ith the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the dura tion of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must conti nue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence 
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical stu dies.

bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficac y of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medicatio ns will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that c ould be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized.

APPENDIX 10 REVISED PROTOCOL SUM MARY OF CHANGE HISTO RY
Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 0 5, 24- Aug -2019
The purpose of revised protocol  05 is to simplify the study  design while maintaining scient ific 
rigor to attain trial object ives, minimize the number of study participants being exposed to the new 
investigat ional drug, reduce the burden on participants and study  centers, and streamline study 
procedures. Specifically, rand omization to t he once -daily  (QD) arms of 50 -, 100 -and 200 -mg dose 
arms will be closed for the study  while maintaining the 25- mg QD a rm and twice- daily (BID) dose 
arms (25, 50, 100 ,and 200 mg). Assessment of dose response remains the primary  object ive. Th e 
methodol ogy to achieve this will result from analysis of  data from placebo, 25 mg QD arms, and 
BID dose arms (25, 50, 100 ,and 200 mg) using MCP -MOD to assess dose response, which allows 
assessment of mult iple different dose -response patterns. Wit h fewe r study  arms primarily focused 
on one schedule, the sel ected randomizat ion is more closely  oriented to assessment of the overall 
dose-response relat ionship with some improved power for detection of a dose -response (from ~77 -
78% to 80%). The modificat ion ofthe randomizatio n to a non response- adaptive rando mizat ion 
will be completed while the study  is still in the init ial “burn -in” period, ie, prior to addit ion of the 
200-mg doses and prior to when the response -adaptive rando mization was to be initiated. 
Participants who have received 50-mg and 100-mg QD doses will continue treatm ent until they 
complete the study  period. Data acquired in these subjects will be used for descript ive analyses, 
popul ation PK/PD modeling, and exposure -response analysis.
Maintaini ng the 25-mg QD dose is of importance in this secondary  stroke prevent ion (SSP) tri al 
for several reasons: 25 mg QD represents the lowest total daily dose included in the study and thus 
presents unique informat ion in the context of dose -response co mpared t o 50, 100 ,or 200 m g QD; 
also, PK/PD modeling with assumpt ions around combinat ion dual ant iplatelet therapy  and exist ing 
data from direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC s) suggests there is potenti al for this dose of 
BMS -986177 to be efficacious in secondary  stroke prevent ion with a potenti al for lower risk of 
bleeding. The dose change will not all ow a separate dose-response assessment for QD; however, 
it is possible a QD dose can st ill be an option for Phase III based on modeling and simulat ion. The 
25 m g QD dos e plus the four BID doses will still be utilized in the exposure -response assessment. 
Popul ation PK/PD analysis and exposure -response outcom e modeling will be perform ed using 
data from  all randomized parti cipants, including those who received 50 or 100 mg QD, to support 
the modeling.
The changes made to the protocol  have no adverse impa ct on the saf ety or the benefi t-risk of  the 
trial parti cipants. Due to the reducti on in sample size, fewer patients will be exposed to the new 
investigat ional medicine. The s afety surveillanc e performed by the DMC and the S ponsor remains 
unchanged. The staggered appr oach for adding the highest 200 -mg BID dos e remains, ie , the DMC

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 03, 05- Apr-2019
The purpose of this amendment is to update the protocol  in consideration of feedback from the 
study  sites, Steering Committee, and regul atory  agencies. Key changes include: allowance of 
clopidogrel  loading doses of 300 mg to 600 m g pri or to si gning of  informed consent; rem oval of 
aortic arch atheroma >4 mm in thickness fro m vascular imaging criteria; clarifying that MRI is not 
requi red to determine study  eligibilit y; clarifying Day 1, pre-dose assessments to be completed, 
adding instructions for missed doses; providing guidance for the management of bleeding events; 
modificati on of the PK and PD sample collect ion window for the 12-hour post -first dose time point 
and the requirement of a 12 -and 24 -hour PK/PD sample co llection for TIA subjects on Day 1; and 
change in the SAE collect ion duration after discont inuat ion of study medication. Addit ionally, new 
appendices were added for strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. An exploratory  objective was 
added to assess the incidence and characteri stics of cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), hemorrhagic 
transformation of ischemic stroke and asymptomatic intracranial bleeding on Day 90 MRI.
No primary or secondary  object ives or endpoints have been changed from the original  protocol . 
Other changes are administrative changes that do not impact the integrity of the study , such as 
typographical errors or cl arificat ions and changes in termino logy.The changes made in the body 
of the protocol  were also implemented in the Synopsis, where applicable. The table below 
highlights the key  changes m ade to the body  of theprotocol starting at Secti on 2.

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 02, 31- Oct-2018
 
Key changes include the addit ion of a Day  60 central clinical 
laboratory  sample and review by the DMC after the first 450 subjects complete the Day 21 visit.  
The PK sampling schedule was changed for Day s 21 and 90; PD sample co llection changed to be 
consistent with the revised PK sample times and sample collection window. The BMS -supplied 
aspirin and clopidogrel designation was changed from non -Invest igational Product (Non -IP) to IP. 
INR was added to the blinded analytes on Days 21 and 90. Additionally, Appendix 3 (Adverse 
Events) was updated as part of standardi zation of AE collect ion procedures and details by the 
Sponsor.
No object ives or endpoints have been changed from the original protocol , except f or the rem oval 
of Barthel  Index. Other changes are administrative changes that do not impact the scient ific 
integrity of the study , such as typographical errors or clarificati ons and changes in termino logy. 
The changes made in the body  of the protocol  were also implemented in the Synopsis where 
applicable. The table below highlights the key changes made to the body  of the protocol starting

Overall Rationale for Revised Protocol 01, 20- Sept -2018
The purpose of this amendm ent is to update the protocol  in consideration of  
 further engagement with the Steering Committee (SC) and 
Key Opini on Leaders (KOLs) which provi ded new insights into the target populat ion and 
operati onal feasibilit y of the protocol  as initially written. Key changes include the scenarios for 
clopidogrel  use prior to randomizat ion and modification of clopidogrel loading dose from 600 mg 
to 300 mg. Some inclusio n/excl usion criteria were modified to better defi ne the target populat ion. 
The collect ion of Barthel  Index, to assess the impact of stoke on daily living, was removed from 
the protocol. The introducti on of the high-dose BMS 986177 groups was modified and will now 
be consi dered in a staggered fashio n after completion of up to 600 subjects and after DMC 
recommendat ion. The Day 90 MRI window was modified to reduce the probabilit y of having 
missing Day 90 endpo int data due to scheduling conflict for the MRI assessment. The PK sampling 
schedule was revised tominimize site-level impact on Day 1 and to rem ove PK assessments for 
clopidogrel  and aspirin at most study  visits.
No object ives or endpoints have been changed from the original protocol , except f or the rem oval 
of Barthel  Index. Other changes are administ rative changes that do not impact the scient ific 
integrity of the study, such as typographical errors or clarificat ions and changes in termino logy for 
“non -hemorrhagic stroke” to “ischemic stroke” and “silent” brain infarct ion to “covert” brain 
infarction .The changes made in the body  of the protocol  were also implemented in the Synopsis 
where applicable. The table below highlights the key changes made to the body of the protocol 
starting at Section 2.

clopidogrel  loading dose and scenarios 
related to use of clopidogrel prior to

Secti on 5.1: 
Study  Design 
and SynopsisRevised clopidogrel loading 
dose from 600 mg to 300 mg 
and clarified scenarios under 
which clopidogrel or other 
antiplatelet agents can be used 
prior to randomizat ion.
Updated study  schematic (Fi gure 
5.1-1) and clarified the Day 90 
MRI window.
The enro llment of participant to 
the 200 m g QD or BID 
BMS -986177 doses was also 
changed to be implemented in a 
staggered mannerClopidogrel  loading dose was reduced 
from 600 m g to 300 m g due to similar 
clinical outcomes between these two 
loading doses (i e, CHANCE vs. POINT) 
and concerns about site/country  
acceptabilit y since the study  is planned 
for global recrui tment.
The Day  90 MRI window was clarified 
to allow flexibilit y in an attempt to 
minimize Day  90 MRI data l oss.
As BMS -986177 has not been studied in 
this acute stroke populat ion in 
combinat ion with DAPT therapy , it is 
prudent for the Sponsor to take a 
staggered approach to ensure patient 
safet y. There fore, the high doses of 
BMS -986177 will not be started until 
some safety  data are obtained and 
reviewed by  the DMC.
Secti on 6:
Study  
Popul ationVarious inclusio n and exclusio n 
criteria were m odified to reflect 
feedback fro m SC.
Other changes were made to 
align with allowance for pre -
rando mizat ion treatment with 
clopidogrel  or other antiplatelet 
agents vis a vis clopidogrel  
loading dose scenarios.
Concomitant pantoprazole use 
was allowed.
Scenarios where UFH or 
LMWH were allowed for post -
stroke DVT prophylaxis prior to 
rando mizat ion.NIHSS score for qualifying event was 
changed from 7 to 5 based on 
feedback fro m SC. 
Addit ional risk factors for participants 
between 40 -54 years of age were 
removed because these factors have no 
added value in ident ifying the study  
popul ation but will increase site burden.
Use of addit ional ant iplatelet agents 
prior to randomizat ion were allowed and 
details were provided where needed to 
limit exclusio n of otherwise eligible 
patients.
Pantoprazole use was allowed as this 
PPI was thought to have the least impact 
on cl opidogrel  PK and rem ove a barri er 
to enrollment for participants who need 
treatm ent wi th acid -reducing agents

SYNOPSIS  
 
Study Number:  CNTX -CX-01-2015 -AML -1 
Title of Study:  A Randomized, Phase II Study of CX -01 Combined With Standard Induction  
Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
Indication:  Newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  
Number of 
Investigators and 
Study Centers:  The study will be conducted at approximately 25 sites in the United States.  
Development Phase:  Phase II  
Objectives:  Primary objectives  
The primary objectives are:  
• To assess whether 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (CX -01), administered 
at any or all studied dose levels in conjunction with standard induction 
therapy for AML increases the morphologic complete remission (CR) 
rate based on Interna tional Working Group (IWG)  criteria  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of CX -01, administered at two 
studied dose levels in conjunction with standard induction therapy for 
AML.  
 
Secondary objectives  
The secondary efficacy objectives are:  
To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in 
conjunction with standard induction and consolidation therapy for AML 
improves:  
• Event -free survival  (EFS)  
• Leukemia -free survival  (LFS)  
• Overall  survival  (OS)  
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR + CRi, which is CR without 
recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL  and/or 
platelet count  <100,000/μL).  
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 60-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 90-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• Neutrophil  recovery  
• Platelet  recovery.  
Study Population:  Newly diagnosed, treatment -naïve patients with de novo or secondary AML  
60 years of age or older.  
Methodology/ 
Study Design:  This is an exploratory phase II, open -label, randomized, multicenter, parallel 
group trial to determine whether there is evidence that the addition of either or 
both different dose levels of CX -01 to standard induction and consolidation 
chemotherapy has an  additive therapeutic effect in newly diagnosed AML 
patients when compared to patients receiving standard induction chemotherapy 
alone.  
 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard induction and 
consolidation chemotherapy plus lower or  higher dose CX -01 or standard 
induction and consolidation chemotherapy alone.  
 
During long term follow -up, relapse and OS data will be collected every 
3 months until death or until the end of study. The end of study will  occur  
approximately 18 months after the last patient is randomized.

A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will meet periodically to review the 
safety of the study.  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from time of informed consent and 
conti nue until 30 days after last study treatment is administered. Longer follow - 
up and collection of AEs may be required for patients who do not have an 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) recovery by Day 42 (i.e. until the recovery or  
until the reason for no recovery is diagnosed) after the last induction or 
consolidation cycle.  
Number of Patients 
(planned and  
analyzed):  Approximately 75 patients  
Study Medications:  Group 1: Idarubicin + Cytarabine, OR  
 
Group 2: Idarubicin + Cytarabine + plus lower dose CX -01 
(0.125 mg/kg/hour), OR  
 
Group 3: Idarubicin + Cytarabine + plus higher dose CX -01 (0.25 mg/kg/hour)  
Dose regimen:  For induction therapy, all patients will receive standard idarubicin + cytarabine 
chemotherapy. Patients randomized to Groups 2, and 3 will also receive CX -01. 
CX01 will be continually infused while idarubicin will be administered per 
institutional standar ds. Patient will be randomized to one of the following 
treatment groups:

 Re-induction therapy  
Patients who do not achieve leukemia -free state (<5% bone marrow blasts) on 
bone marrow aspirate performed between Days 14 -21 may receive a  
re-induction cycle with the same regimen (“7 + 3” ± CX -01) as outlined  above.  
 
If, in the Investigator’s opinion, the patient is not fit to receive full re -induction 
cycle of “7 + 3” ± CX -01, at the Investigator’s discretion the patient may 
receive  “5 + 2” ± CX-01 which  is 5 days of cytarabine  and 2 days of idarubicin  
± CX -01 as outl ined below:  
 
Group 1: Idarubicin + Cytarabine  
• Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day by slow (10 to 30 minutes) IV 
injection/infusion daily on Days 1and  2 
• Cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on 
Days  1-5. 
Group 2: Idarubicin + Cytarabine + plus lowe r dose CX -01 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/kg initial bolus on Day 1, 30 minutes after 
completion of administration of the first dose of idarubicin,  followed 
by CX -01 0.125 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on 
Days  1-5 
• Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day by slow (10 to 30 min utes) IV 
injection/infusion daily on Days 1and  2 
• Cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on 
Days  1-5. 
Group 3: Idarubicin + Cytarabine + plus higher dose CX -01 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/kg initial bolus on Day 1, 30 minutes after 
completion of administration of the first dose of idarubicin,  followed 
by CX -01 0.25 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on 
Days  1-5 
• Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day by slow (10 to 30 minu tes) IV 
injection/infusion daily on Days 1and  2 
• Cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on 
Days  1-5. 
 
Consolidation therapy  
If there are <5% bone marrow blasts in the bone marrow aspirate performed 
between Days 14 -21, a second bone marrow aspiration will be performed within 
1 week after ANC recovers to >1000/μL. If CR is documented, and depending 
on factors including, but not l imited to, European Leukemia Net genetic risk 
and co -existing conditions, patients may proceed to consolidation (if not 
proceeding to transplant). Patients who are not in CR at the end of re -induction 
will be taken off study and will complete Early Termina tion Visit.  
During consolidation, patients will continue in the same treatment group as 
assigned at randomization as follows:  
 
Group 1: Cytarabine  
• Cytarabine 1.0 gram/m2 over 3 hours, every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and 
5. 
Group 2: Cytarabine + lower dose CX -01 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/kg initial bolus on Day 1, 30 minutes after 
completion of the first 3 -hour infusion of cytarabine, followed 
immediately by CX -01 0.125 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV 
infusion on Days 1 -5 for a total of 120 hours of continuou s CX -01 
infusion

Evaluation: Efficacy  Bone marrow aspiration will be done between Days 14 -21. If LFS is 
documented, an aspirate will be repeated within 1 week after the ANC recovers 
to >1000/μL. Bone marrow aspirate will also be repeated approximately 42 days 
after of initiation of the inducti on cycle for patients who do not have recovery of 
ANC. Response will be evaluated based on IWG criteria.  
 
For patients with documented CR, confirmatory bone marrow aspirate slides 
will be submitted to the Sponsor or designee.  
 
Primary efficacy endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the morphologic CR rate based on IWG 
criteria.  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are:  
• EFS 
• LFS 
• OS 
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR +  CRi 
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day morta lity 
• 60-day mortality  
• 90-day mortality  
• Time to neutrophil recovery defined as days from the date of 
randomization until ANC recovered to  >1000/μL  
• Time to transfusion -independent platelet recovery defined as days from 
the date of randomization until the first day that the platelet count 
recovers to >100,000/μL (provided it is not as a consequence of 
platelet transfusion and provided platelets are the n maintained  at 
>100,000/μL for the five subsequent days without platelet transfusion).  
Evaluation: Safety  Key safety endpoints will be assessed by review of summaries of AEs which 
will include only treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), unless otherw ise 
stated. Adverse events will be categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) and 
Preferred Term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) dictionary (version 14.1), and will be graded according to National 
Cancer Institute -Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(NCI -CTCAE) version 4.03.

Statistical Methods:  Sample Size  
A total of 25 evaluable patients per arm will provide 71.8% power for each test 
comparing a dose with control via a Fisher's exact test at 1 -sided alpha = 0.15 to 
detect a difference between a control proportion 0.55 and an experimental dose 
proportion 0.8 0; these tests will be conducted in a fixed sequence: higher dose 
versus control first and lower dose versus control second, with the second test 
considered exploratory (failed) if the first test fails.  
 
Analysis populations  
The following populations will be considered for data summaries.  
Intent -To-Treat (ITT) : All randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they are randomized. The ITT Population 
will be the primary analysis set for the efficacy variables.  
 
Per Protocol (PP) : Supporting analyses will be conducted on the PP Population, 
comprising all patients randomized and treated without major protocol 
violations during the trial. This population will be documented before final 
database lock.  
 
Safety : All patients who receiv ed at least one dose of study treatment. Patients 
will be included in the analyses according to the treatment they received. The 
Safety Population will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  
 
Primary analysis  
The primary efficacy analyses will be  based on the ITT Population. Fisher exact 
test will be used to compare the proportion of CRs between each dose and 
control.  
 
Secondary analysis  
The primary analysis will be repeated using the PP Population as a supportive 
analysis. Complete response rates  and confidence intervals will also be reported 
for key subgroups (e.g., randomization strata). Analyses of EFS, LFS, time to 
neutrophil recovery, time to platelet recovery, and OS will be descriptive.  
Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates will be used to estimate the survival distribution 
for each arm and KM plots will be produced to accompany these analyses.  
Confidence intervals will be reported for medians and KM estimates. Duration 
of response will be analyzed  using a similar approach; the analysis will account 
for the competing risk of death and the survival distributions will be estimated 
as cumulative incidence functions.  
 
Mortality rate at Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90 will be reported using descriptive 
statis tics in a manner similar to the reporting of the morphologic CR rate. The 
time to neutrophil and platelet recoveries will be reported using the following 
descriptive statistics: N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and 1st and 3rd quartil es.

Statistical Methods:  Exploratory analysis  
Exploratory analyses will be descriptive.  
 
Safety analysis  
Safety analysis will be descriptive, based on the Safety Population and will 
involve examination of descriptive statistics and individual patient listings for 
effects of study treatment on clinical safety and tolerability. The safety 
assessment period is f rom the first dose of study treatment until 30 days 
following the last dose of study treatment.  
 
All AEs will be categorized by SOC and Preferred Term using MedDRA 
dictionary and graded according to NCI -CTCAE v4.03. Treatment -emergent 
AE summaries will inc lude NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 or higher AEs, and AEs 
resulting in discontinuation of study treatment, AEs resulting in death, deaths 
during the treatment period within 30 days of the last study treatment, deaths 
reported beyond 30 days that are considered study d rug-related, and the 
incidence of laboratory values with NCI -CTCAE Grades 3 or 4. Particular 
attention will be upon coagulation parameters and bleeding -related events. Vital 
signs and ECOG performance status, electrocardiograms, and laboratory 
parameters w ill be summarized  descriptively.  
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis  
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be descriptive.

 4. INTRODUCTION  
 
This is a phase II study to evaluate 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (CX -01), a low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) derivative with inhibitory effects on the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, 
a pathway that has been shown to be important in cancer  stem cell survival, proliferation, 
migration, and chemotaxis. It is proposed that the addition of CX -01 at two dose levels to 
idarubicin + cytarabine may be of benefit in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML).  
 
At present, CX -01 has been administe red to 189 adults and children in phase I and II trials 
in which a highly favorable safety profile was observed.  
 
4.1 Background  Information  
 
Heparin was discovered almost 100 years ago ( 1), and through most of its life has been 
employed as an anticoagulant to treat or prevent vascular thrombosis. However, because 
of heparin binding motifs on a host of proteins, this glycosaminoglycan has multiple 
pharmacologic effects that are not dependen t upon anticoagulation ( 2). In cancer, these 
non-anticoagulant actions, and most notably its ability to disrupt the CXCL12/CXCR4 
axis, offers an intriguing set of therapeutic possibilities for using heparin as adjunctive 
treatment to conventional therapy. These therapeutic possibilities are, however, severely 
limited by unacceptable anticoagulant effects at heparin doses required for relevant non - 
anticoagulant pharmacologic activity. This observation led to the development of  a low 
anticoagulant CX -01 that retains the broad range of biologic activities of heparin, with 
only a small fraction of its anticoagulant activities.  
 
Acute myelogenous leukemia afflicted 18,860 patients in the United States in 2014 and 
resulted in 10,460  deaths. Despite incremental advances ( 3,4), the mainstay of AML 
induction therapy continues to be variations on a 7 -day infusion of cytarabine and 3 days 
of an anthracycline (“7 + 3”), an appro ach three decades old ( 5). Relapses are believed to 
be due to quiescent CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells (LSCs) nestled in the marrow 
stromal niche, where they are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy.  
 
4.1.1 The CXCL12 /CXCR4 Axis in Cancer  Biology  
The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has recently been suggested as a new therapeutic target in 
lung cancer ( 6,7). CXCL12 (also known as Stromal Cell Derived Factor -1) was first 
described as a CXC chemokine produced locally within the bone marrow compartment 
that provides a homing signal for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by ligation of its  
G-protein coupled receptor (CXCR4) to the surface of HSCs. Ligation of CXCR4 
activates a nu mber of signaling pathways, in particular the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase 
(PI3K)/Akt pathway, which promotes stem cell survival, proliferation, migration, and 
chemotaxis ( 7). 
 
More recently, it has been appreciated that spl ice variants of CXCL12 are also produced 
in high concentrations in brain, lung, colon, heart, kidney and liver, and that these 
CXCR4 receptors are prominently expressed on the cell membranes of many cancer  cells,

 particularly cancer stem cell s (7). This emerging research supports a role for the 
CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in mediating the invasion/migration by cancer cells and cancer 
stem cells into the “fertile soil” sites commonly associated with metastasis. Thus, it is 
proposed that local production of CXCL12 within metastasis -prone sites promotes the 
chemotaxis of cancer cells and cancer stem cells into these sites through interaction with 
the CXCR4 on the membranes of cancer cells.  
 
In addition, the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis a ppears to be important in cancer cell  proliferation 
and neovascularization, and is intimately involved in recruiting cancer -associated 
fibroblasts (CAF) that provide the mesenchymal matrix support for growing tumors and 
further metastases ( 7). Thus, a major promoter of CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression 
within a tumor is its hypoxic core, which gives rise to hypoxia inducible factor  1α. 
CXCL12 is also produced abundantly by CAFs and inflammatory macrophages within 
the tumor. Once sti mulated by CXCL12, tumor cell associated CXCR4 becomes a major 
mediator of tumor cell interaction with extracellular matrix proteins (i.e., laminin, 
fibronectin, collagen), as well as a regulator of CD44 and integrin -mediated cancer and 
cancer stem cell ad hesion (though CXCR4 itself is not directly involved in cell  adhesion).  
 
4.1.2 The CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis in Acute Myeloid  Leukemia  
Normal CD34+CD38- HSCs migrate to and are anchored in the bone marrow by 
chemotactic signals produced by cells in the marrow stroma ( 8,9,10,11). Forem ost of 
these signals is the CXC chemokine CXCL12 (stem cell derived factor -1), which ligates 
chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on the HSC surface. This signaling activates directional 
Rho/Rac -mediated migration toward and attachment in the bone marrow environme nt 
through enrichment of pseudopodia with adhesion receptors such as very late antigen -4 
and others. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling also activates phosphatidylinositol -3-kinase and 
its downstream effector protein kinase B, providing enhanced survival ( 10). In the 
marrow, HSCs shuttle between an endosteal osteoblastic niche inducing quiescence and a 
sinusoidal endothelial vascular niche promoting proliferation and differentiation ( 8). 
Recent evidence sugg ests that quiescence in the endosteal niche is maintained by close 
association with megakaryocytes ( 12,13). Megakaryocytes negatively regulate HSC 
proliferation through secretion of platelet fac tor-4 (PF4), which also enhances integrin - 
mediated endothelial adhesion during bone marrow homing ( 14). 
 
There is substantial evidence that LSCs employ the same CXCL12 -, CXCR4 -, adhesion 
molecule -dependent mechanisms as norm al HSCs to home toward a marrow niche and 
maintain themselves in a quiescent, protected state ( 8,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23). 
CXCR4 is an unfavorable prognostic marker in AML ( 24,25,26,27,28), and its high 
expression on CD34+ AML is associated with the poor survival in patients with Fms -like 
tyrosine kinase -3 /internal tandem duplication mutations. Conversely, disrupting CXCR4 
signaling inhibits transmigration, survival and chemotherapy resistance in vitro 
(29,30,31,32) and tumor growth in AML xenografts ( 32,33,34,35). Clinical experience 
with the CXCR4 inhibitor Plerixafor in AML is just beginning ( 36,37). Short term daily 
subcutaneous administration of Plerixafor for up to 7 days for stem cell mobilization is 
well tolerated ( 38). However, cardiac toxicity arose when it was administered as a daily 
intravenous (IV) infusion or subcutaneous injection for 11 -14 days ( 39). This questions

 the safety of long term continuous blockade of CXCR4, a receptor also important in 
repair of injured tissues.  
 
An alternative approach to blocking CXCR4 signaling is direct interference with its 
ligand CXCL12. Heparin, a g lycosaminoglycan used as an anticoagulant, avidly binds to 
a cluster of cationic amino acids on the CXCL12 surface that overlaps with the CXCR4 
binding region ( 40,41). Heparin inhibition of CXCL 12 is diminished by removal of 6 -O, 
but not 2 -O sulfates ( 42), but is apparent only at concentrations of 20 U or approximately 
3 µg/mL ( 42,43), which exceed therap eutic heparin plasma levels for anticoagulation by 
10-fold ( 44). Low anticoagulant 2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH, also known as  
CX-01, Figure 6 —2) is a porcine intestinal heparin derivative that retains many heparin 
anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, CX -01 binds PF4 with affinity similar to 
heparin, but the CX -01/PF4 complex does not bind antibodies that produce platelet 
activation and med iate heparin -induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Furthermore, 
megakaryopoiesis is negatively regulated by PF4 and anti -PF4 blocking antibodies 
diminish chemotherapy -induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) in mice. CX -01 binds to and 
reverses biologic activities of PF4 and mitigates CIT in transgenic mice that overexpress 
PF4. 
 
Based on these considerations, we conducted a pilot study combining CX -01 with 
standard chemotherapy for the treatment of AML. Results, as described below, suggest 
that CX -01 increases the complet e remission (CR) rate and enhances count recovery. In 
addition, we show that CX -01 potently inhibits CXCL12 ligation of CXCR4 in vitro at 
concentrations that do not produce anticoagulation.  
 
4.1.3 Clinical Strategies to Block  CXCR4  
A number of strategies have been tested to block CXCR4, among these are AMD3100 
(Genzyme), BKT140 (Biokine Therapeutics), MSX -122 (Med Koo Biosciences), 
unfractionated heparin (UFH) and LMWH (various).  
 
AMD3100 (known as Plerixafor and Mozobil), has gained  Food and Drug Administration 
approval for the mobilization of stem cells. AMD3100, when used with another small 
molecule CXCR4 inhibitor, BKT140, acts synergistically with chemotherapy in human 
non-small cell lung cancer under experimental conditions ( 45,46,47) as well as against 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in vitro and in animal models ( 48,49,50,51). 
 
Short term daily subcutaneous administration of AMD3100 for up to 7 days in humans 
for stem cell mobilization is well tolerated ( 52), but when administered as a d aily IV 
infusion or subcutaneous injection for 11 -14 days, as an HIV treatment in humans, it was 
associated with cardiac toxicity ( 53,54). MSX -122, also developed for stem cell 
mobilization, is a partial CXCR4 antagonist which in animal studies appears to be 
tolerated in longer term regimens, however, MSX -122 has not as yet been tested in

Heparins are effective inhibitors of CXCL12. Recently, UFH has been shown to inhibit 
CXCL12 in a man ner not dependent on its anticoagulant activity ( 42). Binding of heparin

 produces a steric hindrance of CXCR4 binding to CXCL12 ( 55) when this negatively 
charged glycosaminoglycan binds to a concentration of cationic amino acids that overlap 
with the CXCR4 binding site ( 55). However, even greater effectiveness might be 
achieved using, CX -01, a low anticoagulant heparin, that would enable effective 
CXCL 12 blocking without the risk of anticoagulation.  
 
4.2 Study Rationale for CX -01 in  AML  
 
CX-01 is a rationally engineered complex carbohydrate derived from heparin that may 
represent a safer inhibitor of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis.  
 
Differential anticoagulant effect relative to heparin : Heparin is more than 200 fold more 
potent than CX -01 as an ant icoagulant. The anticoagulant effect of CX -01 begins to 
appear at a plasma concentration that is approximately 2 -fold higher than the plasma 
concentrations achieved in normal volunteer and patient studies (25 µg/mL); at these 
concentrations it is anticipat ed that CX -01 can be employed clinically with little if any 
anticoagulant effect ( 56). 
 
Reduced antigenicity relative to heparin : HIT is a potential clinical complication of 
heparin administration that results from the format ion of an antibody to the PF4/heparin 
complex, which in turn may cause thrombocytopenia and thromboembolism ( 57). CX -01 
binds PF4 with an affinity similar to heparin, but the CX -01/PF4 complex does not 
activate platelets beca use it does not bind HIT antibodies and, unlike heparin/PF4, does 
not stimulate additional antibody production ( 56,58,59). 
 
Platelet and white blood cell (WBC) recovery following chemotherapy : In patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, and in patients with 
AML receiving induction therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine, CX -01 appears to  
accelerate both platelet and WBC recovery after high dose chemotherapy. The 
acceleration of platelet and WBC recovery may be explained by a blocking effect of  
CX-01 on the inhibitory action of PF4 in marrow myeloid and megakaryocyte 
development after chem otherapy ( 60,61,62). In separate but related research, Cantex is 
collaborating with the National Institute of Health and other federal agencies to develop 
CX-01 as  a medical countermeasure to radiation poisoning, where refractory 
thrombocytopenia is a major concern.  
 
Thus, CX -01 may offer benefits to AML patients without the risks of other heparin 
derivatives, namely blocking of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis without the acc ompanying 
risks of anticoagulation or of HIT; it may also benefit AML patients receiving intensive 
chemotherapy by accelerating platelet and WBC recovery times.

 5. STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
This randomized, phase II study of CX -01 is designed to assess the effect of adding 
CX-01 at one of the two different dose levels to standard induct ion and consolidation 
therapy for newly diagnosed patients with  AML.  
 
5.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
The primary objectives are:  
 
• To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in 
conjunction with standard induction therapy for AML increases the morphologic 
CR rate based on International Working Group (IWG)  criteria  
 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of C X-01, administered at two studied dose 
levels in conjunction with standard induction therapy for  AML.  
 
5.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
The secondary efficacy objectives are:  
 
To assess whether CX -01, administered at any or all studied dose levels in conjunction 
with standard induction and consolidation therapy for AML improves:  
 
• Event -free survival  (EFS)  
• Leukemia -free survival  (LFS)  
• Overall survival  (OS)  
• Composite CR rate: incidence of CR + CRi, which is CR without recovery  of 
neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL and/or platelet  count  
<100,000/μL).  
 
• Duration of morphologic  CR 
• 30-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• 60-day mortality (in the i nduction  cycle)  
• 90-day mortality (in the induction  cycle)  
• Neutrophil recovery  
• Platelet  recovery.

 6. INVESTIGATION  PLAN  
 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  Description  
 
This is an exploratory phase II, open -label, randomized, multicenter, parallel group trial 
to determine whether there is evidence that the addition of either or both different dose 
levels of CX -01 to standard induction therapy (idarubicin + cytarabine) and  consolidation 
therapy has an additive therapeutic effect in newly diagnosed AML patients when 
compared to patients receiving standard induction chemotherapy alone.  
 
Approximately 75 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the following 
treatment groups:  
 
• Group 1 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine,  OR 
• Group 2 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine plus lower dose CX -01 (0.125  mg/kg/hour), 
OR 
 
• Group 3 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine plus higher dose CX -01 (0.25  mg/kg/hour)  
Eligible patients who meet the inclusion criteria a nd do not meet any of the exclusion 
criteria and have provided informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Each patient 
will participate in the study for approximately 18 months from the time of informed 
consent through final study contact, or until th ey withdraw from the study or the study is 
terminated by the Sponsor.  
 
Overall survival data will be collected every 3 months until death or until the end of study 
by the investigational sites. The end of study will occur approximately 18 months after 
the last patient is  randomized.  
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DS MC) will meet periodically to review the 
safety of the study (see Section 6.6.5 ). Details describing the DSMC process and 
procedures will be outlined in a separate DSMC Charter.  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from t ime of informed consent and continue until 
30 days after the last study treatment is administered. Longer follow -up and collection of 
AEs may be required for patients that do not have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
recovery within 42 days (i.e., until the recovery or the reason for no recovery is 
diagnosed) after the last induction or consolidation cycle.

 6.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control  Groups  
 
Approximately 75 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive standard 
induction and consolidation therapy with or without CX -01 at two different doses  (lower 
and higher  dose).  
The anthracycline/cytarabine regimen using idarubicin (9 -12 mg/m2 daily) is considered a 
standard therapy for the majority of newly diagnosed patients with AML ( 64). Complete 
remissions are achieved in approximately 5 0% to 75% of patients ( 65). Dosing studies 
with continuous infusion cytarabine demonstrated that 100 mg/m2 was as effective as  
200 mg/m2 (66,67). 
The need for p ost remission therapy, following successful induction therapy, has been 
established in a number of clinical trials. It is presumed that most patients still have 
residual disease after the completion of induction chemotherapy ( 68). The standard 
treatment option includes consolidation therapy with intensive cytarabine -based 
chemotherapy regimens or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

6.3.3 Withdrawal and Discontinuation of  Patients  
 
Patients are free to withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any 
time, without prejudice to further treatment. A patient’s participation in the study may 
also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or Spons or. 
 
The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator or Sponsor to discontinue a 
patient from treatment:  
 
• The patient was erroneously included in the study (i.e. was found to be  ineligible)  
• The patient experiences an intolerable or unacceptable  AE 
• The patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the  protocol  
• The patient participates in another investigational study without the prior written 
authorization of the Sponsor or its  designee  
 
• The patient’s participation in the study presents a sign ificant safety  concern.  
Patients who experience Grade 4 increases in AST, ALT or bilirubin (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT >20 x ULN; increase in total bilirubin to >10 x ULN) will be discontinued 
from the study, if the Investigator judges that the laborator y abnormalities are potentially 
related to study treatment. Patients discontinued for this reason will not be re -challenged 
and will be followed until resolution of abnormal liver function tests.  
 
Patients who are discontinued from study due to an AE will be closely monitored until 
the resolution or stabilization of the AE.  
 
Patients who received at least one dose of study drug and who are discontinued from 
treatment, but not withdrawn from the study, will be asked to complete all evaluations for 
early term ination (Early Termination/End of Study Visit).  
 
Patients who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

 6.4 TREATMENT OF  PATIENTS  
 
6.4.1 Treatments  Administered  
 
For induction therapy, all patients will receive standard idarubicin + cytarabine 
chemotherapy. Patients randomized to Groups 2 and 3 will also receive CX -01. CX -01 
will be continually infused while idarubicin will be administered per institutional 
standar d. 
 
Group 1: Idarubicin + Cytarabine

Group 2: Idarubicin + Cytarabine + plus lower dose CX -01 
 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/kg initial bolus on Day 1 only, 30 minutes after 
completion of administration of the first dose of idarubicin, followed by  CX-01 
0.125 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days 1 -7

completion of administration of the first dose of idarubicin, followed by  CX-01 
0.25 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days 1 -7 
 
• Idarubicin 12 mg/m2/day by slow (10 to 30 minutes) IV injection/infusion daily 
on Days 1, 2, and  3 
 
• Cytarabine 100 mg/m2/day by continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days  1-7. 
Re-induction  Therapy  
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will be performed between Days 14 -21 of the 
induction cycle. If bone marrow shows leukemia -free state, i.e. less than 5% blasts in a 
aspirate sample, no further chemotherapy will be given until recovery of blood counts. If  
the bone marrow shows more than 5% blasts, a re -induction cycle may be given as 
outlined above. If the Days 14 -21 marrow is indeterminate e.g., if there is a question of 
residual leukemia, a bone marrow aspirate may be repeated 7 days later for confirmati on. 
Re-induction will be given with the same assigned regimen (“7 + 3” ± CX -01) as

 Patient s in remission at the end of induction may proceed to consolidation therapy on 
study, depending upon factors including, but not limited to, European Leukemia Net 
(ELN) ( 70) genetic risk and co -existing conditions.  
 
Patients who are not in CR at the end of re -induction will be taken off study and will 
complete Early Termination Visit as per Table 6 —1. 
 
Patients who could benefit from and are eligible to undergo stem cell transplantation will 
go off the study at any ti me when transplant is feasible.  
 
Patients will receive up to two cycles of consolidation therapy on study, per NCCN 
guidelines, depending upon factors including, but not limited to, ELN genetic risk and co - 
existing conditions. A cycle of consolidation the rapy is defined as the time from initiation 
of chemotherapy on Day 1 until count recovery.  
 
Patients may start consolidation therapy anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks after the start of 
induction therapy based on treating Investigator judgment. Consolidation will  begin no 
sooner than 28 days from the start of induction therapy.  
 
Subsequent consolidation cycles may begin anywhere from 4 to 8 weeks after the start of 
the last cycle of consolidation based on treating Investigator judgment.  
 
Patients will receive cons olidation therapy in the same treatment group as assigned at 
randomization, as follows:  
 
Group 1: Cytarabine  
 
• Cytarabine 1.0 gram/m2 over 3 hours, every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and  5. 
Group 2: Cytarabine + lower dose CX -01 
 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/kg initial bolus on Day 1, 30 minutes after completion  of 
the first 3 -hour infusion of cytarabine, followed immediately by  CX-01 
0.125 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days 1 -5 for a total of 
120 hours of continuous CX -01 infusion  
 
• Cytarabine 1.0 gram/m2 over 3 hours, every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and  5. 
Group 3: Cytarabine + higher dose CX -01 
 
• CX-01 given as a 4 mg/ kg initial bolus on Day 1, 30 minutes after completion of 
the first 3 -hour infusion of cytarabine, followed immediately by  CX-01 
0.25 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days 1 -5 for a total of 
120 hours of continuous CX -01 infusion  
 
• Cytarabi ne 1.0 gram/m2 over 3 hours, every 12 hours on Days 1, 3, and  5.

 6.4.1.1  Transfusions  
 
• Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion will be administered according to  institutional 
guidelines  
 
• Platelet transfusions will also be given at the discretion of the treating Investigator 
based on clinical characteristics and patient  need.  
 
6.4.1.2  Dosing and Method of  Administration  
 
All chemotherapy and CX -01 doses will be calculated based on actual body weigh t at the 
beginning of each cycle of induction or consolidation therapy.  
 
Chemotherapy will be administered through a central venous catheter, such as a 
peripherally inserted central catheter, with two or three independent ports. This catheter 
may also be u sed for administration of blood products, IV medications and IV fluids.  
 
CX-01 bolus and continuous infusions may be administered in the same arm through a 
peripheral IV line; however, must be separate from the central line or port used for 
chemotherapy.  
 
6.4.1.3  Preparation of CX -01 Infusion  
 
The Investigator and pharmacist at the investigational site will ensure Good Pharmacy 
Practices are followed during the preparation of the CX -01 IV solution. The volumes and 
CX-01 concentration in the final CX -01 IV solutions  must be verified to be correct based 
on the patient’s actual body weight measured at the beginning of the  cycle.  
 
6.4.1.4  Preparation of CX -01 Intravenous Bolus  Dose  
 
The pharmacist will prepare the IV bolus resulting from the 4 mg/kg dose calculation 
with the amount of CX -01 from the appropriate number of 10 mL vials. Each 1 mL 
solution contains 50 mg CX -01 and must be further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride.  This 
calculated volume per patient (based on weight) will be added to 30 mL of 0.9% sodium 
chloride solution and the total volume administered IV over 5  minutes.  
 
6.4.1.5  Preparation of CX -01 Continuous Infusion  Dose  
 
The pharmacist will prepare each study treatment soluti on, adding the calculated amounts 
of CX -01 and 0.9% sodium chloride to an empty, sterile infusion bag. An IV infusion line 
will then be attached to the infusion bag, and the infusion set purged with the CX -01 
solution. A Luer lock (or similar) will then be  placed at the end of the set. As CX -01 
doses are weight based, the amount of CX -01 from the vials and saline solution will both 
vary by patient’s weight. Each 1 mL solution contains 50 mg CX -01. 
 
For each continuous infusion bag, an appropriate volume and  concentration of CX -01 
solution will be prepared such that the patient receives a continuous infusion at the dose

 of CX -01 assigned at randomization, 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour. The final volume of the 
CX-01 infusion will be 500 to 1000 mL/24 hours. The infusion bags will be prepared at a 
calculated CX -01 concentration based on the patient’s actual body weight.  
 
Based upon current stability testing data, CX -01 infusion solutions will expire at room 
temperature 72 hours after preparation and sho uld be stored in a refrigerator (2 to 8ºC) 
until used.  
 
If the IV infusion is interrupted for any reason, the time of infusion stop will be recorded, 
along with the reason. The IV infusion will be restarted as soon as possible, and the 
restart time recorde d. The planned cycle days of treatment administration will not be 
altered, nor will the concentration of the CX -01 solution be adjusted, to compensate for 
an interrupted CX -01 infusion.  
 
6.4.2 Investigational  Product  
 
CX-01 (2 -O, 3-O desulfated heparin [ODSH]) is an off -white to pinkish amorphous 
powder. CX -01 is a low anticoagulant, anti -inflammatory UFH derivative produced for 
human use compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). The structural 
formula  for the basic repeating unit that comprises CX -01 is provide d in Figure 6 —2.

Further details are provided in the IB ( 63). 
 
6.4.2.1  Packaging and  Labeling  
 
Idarubicin a nd cytarabine will be obtained from commercial sources. These treatments 
will be prepared by the investigational site pharmacy using standard institutional 
procedures according to the respective package insert for each agent.  
 
Adequate supplies of the study drug, CX -01, will be provided to each investigational site. 
The study drug (CX -01) was manufactured under cGMP and will be supplied by Sponsor 
and packaged in 10 mL sterile, single -use glass vials. The 10 mL vial contains 50 0 mg 
total CX -01 (50 mg per mL).  
 
Each vial will be labeled in English and in accordance with United States (US)

 requirements since all investigational sites participating in the study will be in US. Label 
text will be approved according to t he Sponsor’s agreed procedures. The lot numbers and 
expiration dates of the batches of CX -01 vials used in this study will be printed on the 
vial labels.  
 
For all vials, a system in accordance with cGMP will be used; ensuring each dose of 
study drug can be traced back to the respective bulk ware of the ingredients. A complete 
record of batch numbers and expiry dates of all study drug and labels will be maint ained 
in the Sponsor’s study file.  
 
6.4.2.2  Storage and  Stability  
 
The study medication must be stored in a secure limited access area according to local 
regulations. CX -01 vials should be stored at room temperature, preferably between 5ºC 
and 25ºC (41 F to 77ºF).  
 
Long term stability testing for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and final product 
(CX-01 vials) was conducted in compliance with FDA requirements. Results from these 
stability studies indicate that CX -01 API and CX -01product are stable for at leas t 
48 months when stored at room temperature. The API and final product studies are being 
conducted with current production material to confirm prior results and extend the study 
period to 72 months. A stability study of CX -01 in normal saline diluted for b olus dose 
concentration and continuous infusion concentration (in polyethylene bags) has 
confirmed stability of the drug product for at least 72 hours (the maximum period tested) 
at two concentration levels and at two temperature conditions (2ºC to 8ºC and  room 
temperature). This testing covers all the ranges for CX -01 concentration/dilution required 
when dosing for clinical trials.  
 
Since CX -01 vials are photo -stable, there is no need to protect from direct or indirect 
light.  
 
6.4.2.3  Study Drug Accountability, Re conciliation, and  Return  
 
Upon completion and termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used study 
drug must be returned to the Sponsor, or other authorized party if not authorized by the 
Sponsor to be destroyed at the site.  
 
All study drugs re turned to the Sponsor or other authorized party must be accompanied 
by the appropriate documentation and be clearly identified. Study drug may only be 
returned after drug accountability is completed. Returned supplies should be in their 
original containers  (vials that have clinical labels attached). Empty vials should not be 
returned to the Sponsor. Empty vials may not be destroyed until drug accountability is 
completed. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange disposal of all empty vials 
accordin g to institutional regulations. The return or destruction of unused study drug 
should be arranged by the site Monitor.

 6.4.2.4  Study Drug Handling and  Disposal  
 
The Sponsor will be responsible for assuring that the quality of the study drug is adequate 
for the duration of the study. It is the responsibility of the Investigator or designee to 
ensure that the study drug is only dispensed to the patient. The study dr ug must be 
dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local 
regulations. The Investigator or designee must maintain accurate records of the study 
drug receipt, dispensing information, and  disposition.  
 
If study drug is to  be destroyed at the site, it is the Investigator or designee’s 
responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for the disposal, drug 
accountability has been completed by the site Monitor, procedures for proper disposal 
have been established acc ording to applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional 
procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been documented and provided 
to the Sponsor or designee.  
 
6.4.3 Method of Assigning Patients to  CX-01 
 
6.4.3.1  Patient  Identification  
 
Each ne wly enrolled patient will be assigned a unique patient identification number using 
an Interactive Web/Voice Response System (IxRS). Patients will be randomized across 
all sites. Patients who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.  
 
6.4.4 Selection of Do ses in the  Study  
 
6.4.4.1  Selection of  Dose  
 
The selection of CX -01 dose for study in AML has been based upon the dual 
requirements to have sufficient drug administered to have potential activity but without 
clinically significant anticoagulation. The study dose chosen (4 mg/kg bolus followed by  
0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour for 5 or 7 days) fulfills both of these criteria. In addition, all 
doses are expected to result in serum levels of CX -01 which are significantly higher than 
the IC90 identified in preclinical studies for inhibition of CXCL12 -CXCR4 interaction.  
 
In a pilot study of CX -01 conducted on 12 patients with newly diagnosed AML, the 
addition of CX -01 to the traditional “7 + 3” regimen of cytarabine and idarubicin resulted 
in 11 of 12 patients achieving complete bone marrow remission after th e first cycle 
(92%). It was hypothesized that the increased rate of first cycle induction of remission 
was from blockade by CX -01 of CXCL12 (SDF -1)/CXCR4 -mediated homing of LSC in 
the marrow niche where they are protected from chemotherapy. The dose and re gimen of 
CX-01 in that trial were well tolerated without associated serious AEs (SAEs). Mean 
levels of aPTT remained largely in the mid -30 second range.  
 
In a prior study of continually infused CX -01 in patients with metastatic pancreatic 
cancer (Study PGX -ODSH -2011 -PC), CX -01 was administered as an IV bolus loading 
dose of 4 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.375 mg/kg/hour for 5 days. This

Incorporating Amendment 2

 dose was well tolerated and free from major AEs. However, measurement of aPTT in 
these patie nts demonstrated that aPTT was increased into the 40 to 45 second range in a 
limited number of patients. This is a range that is not overtly anticoagulant, but higher 
than the therapeutic range of aPTT (31.5 to 36 seconds).  
 
Therefore, the chosen dose (4 m g/kg bolus followed by 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour) 
represents a rational balance between effective dosing and safety in seriously ill patients 
with AML.  
 
6.4.4.2  Dose  Modifications  
 
No dose modification for cytarabine or idarubicin during induction will be allowed. 
However, dose reduction of cytarabine during consolidation is permitted according to 
institutional guidelines, or if in the Investigator’s opinion the patient cannot tolerate a 
higher dose.  
 
CX-01 Dose Modifications  
 
• CX-01 will be temporarily discontinued in patients who develop aPTT above 
45 seconds during continuous infusion of CX -01 and at least 8 hours after  the 
bolus dose of CX -01, until the aPTT is <35 seconds. CX -01 will then be resumed 
at a 50% dose reduction. If the aPTT rises above 45 seconds at the reduced dose, 
CX-01 will be permanently discontinued. If aPTT at the 50% reduced dose is  
<35 seconds, 4 hours or more after dose reduction, the dose can be escalated by 
25%. If the aPTT after dose escalation again rises above 45 seconds at the 
reduced dose, the CX -01 will be temporarily discontinued until the aPTT is  
<35 seconds, and then resumed at the previous 50% dose reduction.  
 
• Abnormal liver  function:  
o If Grade 1 increases in AST, ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g.,  increase in 
AST or ALT from ULN to 3.0 x ULN; increase in total bilirubin from 
ULN to 1.5 x ULN), the frequency of liver function testing will be 
increased, if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities  are 
potentially related to study trea tment. No reduction of dose is  required  
 
o If Grade 2 increases in AST, ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT to >3.0 to 5 x ULN; increase in total bilirubin from >1.5  to 
3 x ULN), the frequency of liver function testing will be increased  to 
≥once a week, if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities 
are potentially related to study treatment. No reduction of dose is required  
 
o If Grade 3 increases in AST, ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g., increase in 
AST or ALT to >5.0 to 20 x ULN;  increase in total bilirubin from >3.0 to 
10 x ULN) and if the Investigator judges that the laboratory  abnormalities 
are potentially related to study treatment, study drug must be stopped. 
Frequent laboratory evaluations (more than once weekly) will  be

 conducted until liver function tests return to Grade 1 or baseline value. 
Study treatment will be resumed after liver function tests return to Grade 1 
or baseline value provided administration of chemotherapy is in progress. 
If resumption of study treatment is considered for subjects who have 
experienced Grade 3 increases in AST, ALT, or bilirubin liver function 
will be monitored at least daily during CX -01 infusion  
 
o If Grade 4 increases in AST, ALT, or bilirubin occur (e.g., increase in 
AST o r ALT to >20 x ULN; increase in total bilirubin to >10 x ULN)  and 
if the Investigator judges that the laboratory abnormalities are potentially 
related to study treatment, the patient must discontinue study treatment 
immediately and will not be re -challenge d. The patient will be followed 
until resolution of abnormal liver function  tests.  
 
• Renal  function:  
If the calculated creatinine clearance drops below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 prior to or 
during dosing with CX -01, the dose of CX -01 will be held until the creatinin e 
clearance rises above 30 mL/min/1.73m2. 
• For any other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities that appear to be related to CX -01 during 
either the induction or consolidation cycles, CX -01 will be interrupted until the 
AE resolves to Grade 1 or less, and then resumed at 0.125 mg/kg/hour provided 
administration of chemotherapy is in progress. If CX -01 is interrupted for greater 
than 72 hours, the patient will be discontinued from treatment. If the AE recurs  at 
a level of Grade 3 or higher, the CX -01 will be  discontinued.  
 
This study will utilize the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.03 for AE and SAE reporting. A copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4.03 can be downloaded: ( http://safetyprofiler  
ctep.nci.nih.gov/CTC/CTC.aspx ). 
 
6.4.5 Prior and Concomitant  Medications  
 
The Investigator must record the use of all concomitant medications taken d uring 30 days 
prior to signing informed consent and for the duration of the study until the Safety 
Follow -Up Visit, both prescribed and over -the-counter, in the source documents and 
electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients should be discouraged from st arting any new 
medication, both prescribed and over -the-counter, without consulting the Investigator 
unless the new medication is required for emergency.  
 
6.4.5.1  Permitted Concomitant  Medications  
 
Refer to Section 6.4.1.1  for transfusion parameters. Treatment for disease -related 
symptoms and drug -related toxicities are expected as standard of care and should be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and eCRF.

 The use of myelopoietic growth factors (G -CSF and GM -CSF) is allowed, consistent 
with the Investigator’s clinical judgment and institutional guidelines.  
 
6.4.5.2  Prohibited Concomitant  Medications  
 
Patients are not permitted to take those medications specified in the exclusion criteria 
(Section 6.3.2 ). 
 
The following medications are prohibited:  
 
• Any anticoagulation therapy (with the exception of heparin flushes). CX -01 IV 
bolus doses may cause a slight transient increase of aPTT (to  approximately  
60 seconds) for less than 1 hour, while the continuous IV infusion at the doses to 
be used in this study, based upon previous studies, will raise the aPTT to the ULN 
or to a lev el (approximately 35 to 45 seconds) that is not of clinical significance. 
CX-01 may, however, potentiate the anticoagulation effect of UFH, LMWH or 
anticoagulants if administered concomitantly. Therefore, concomitant 
administration of CX -01 with other anti coagulants will not be permitted in 
patients participating in this study other than as heparin flushed to maintain IV 
line patency.  
 
• Any investigational therapeutic  agents.  
6.4.6 Treatment  Compliance  
 
Since all treatments are administered at the clinical site by site personnel, the Investigator 
or designee must maintain accurate records of all study treatments, including dates of 
study drug receipt; quantities received and dispensed, and lot numbers. In  addition, the 
study treatment must be noted in the patient’s medical records and eCRF, with the date 
and time of administration and dose of each study treatment.

(<5% bone marrow blasts) on bone marrow aspirate performed between Days 14 -21 may receive a re -induction cycle with the same regimen (“7 + 3” ± 
CX-01). If in the Investigator’s opinion, the patient is not fit to receive full re -induction cycle of “7 + 3” ± CX -01, at the Investigator’s discretion the 
patient may receive “5 + 2” ± CX -01 which is 5 days of cytarabine (Days 1 -5) and 2 days of idarubicin (Days 1 and  2). 
4. CX-01 administered  at a dose of 4 mg/kg  as an initial  bolus on  Day 1 only,  30 minutes  after completion  of administration  of the first dose of idarubicin.  
5. CX-01 administered at a dose of 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg/hour as a continuous 24 -hour IV infusion on Days  1-7. 
6. Height obtained at Screening only. Actual body weight will be m easured at the beginning of each cycle to calculate treatment  doses.  
7. Hematology  must  include  the following:  hemoglobin,  ANC,  and platelets.  All other  hematology  assessments  should  be performed  only if standard  of care 
and/or clinically indicated. Hematology samples will be collected daily until discharge and weekly thereafter until  recovery.  
8. Note: blood samples for PT/INR, aPTT and anti -Xa levels will be collected 12 hours after the bolus dose of  CX-01. 
9. Anti-Xa sam ples will be collected only on Days  1-8. 
10. PT/aPTT will be collected daily on Days 1 -8, and on Day 9, Day 11, and Day  13. 
11. Chemistry (and comprehensive metabolic panel) includes BUN, serum creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phospha tase. Samples will be 
collected daily until  discharge.  
12. At selected sites, blood samples for steady -state PK analysis will be collec ted during the induction cycle from the first six randomized patients assigned 
to CX -01 on Days 3 and 5 at a single time  point.  
13. For females of childbearing potential only. All female patients will have a urine pregnancy test at Screening; positive urine  tests must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy  test. 
14. Bone  marrow  aspirates  and/or  biopsies  are not performed  weekly.  If the patient’s  peripheral  blood  is negative  for persistent  AML:  a bone  marrow  aspirate 
and/or biopsy will be performed (once) between Days 14 -21 to determine the need for re -induction. Bone marrow biopsy may be necessary if sufficient 
spicules  are not available  on aspirate.  Bone  marrow  aspirate  at baseline  and follow -up should  inclu de analysis  by flow cytometry  and cytogenetic  analysis. 
Bone  marrow  (or peripheral  blood  if bone  marrow  is unavailable)  should  be sent to the institution’s  local  cytogenetic  laboratory  for analysis.  For patients 
with documented CR, confirmatory bone marrow aspirate slides will be submitted to the Sponsor or designee. If count recovery has not occurred by Day 
42, a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be performed to evaluate disease status, unless presence of  persistent AML in peripheral  blood.  
15. Count recovery is defined as ANC of >1000/μL and a platelet count  >100,000/μL.  
16. During long term follow -up, relapse and survival data will be collected every 3 months until death or until the end of study. The end of stu dy will occur 
approximately 18 months after the last patient is  randomized.

• Assessment of  AEs 
• Assessment of concomitant  medications.  
6.5.5 Safety Follow -Up Visit  
 
Patients will complete a Safety Follow -Up Visit approximately 30 days after completion 
of the last induction or consolidation cycle. See Table 6 —1 for clinical assessments 
performed at this visit. Longer follow -up may be required for patients who do not ha ve an 
ANC recovery by Day 42 (that is, until the recovery or until a reason for no recovery is 
diagnosed) after the last induction or consolidation cycle.

 6.5.6 Early Term  Visit  
 
In case of early termination, the following will be conducted (see Ta ble 6 —1 for details) 
and all results will be documented:  
 
• Hematology  
• PT/INR, aPTT, and anti -factor Xa  
• Chemistry  
• AE Assessment  
• Concomitant  medications  
• Fibrinogen, D  dimer  
6.5.7 Long Term  Follow -Up 
 
After Safety Follow -Up Visit, the relapse and survival data will be collected every 
3 months.  
 
Each subject will participate in the long term follow -up for approximately 18 months 
from the time of informed consent until death or until the end of the study (for the 
definition of end of study, see Section 6.1). 
 
Investigational sites are expected to make every effort to obtain long term follow -up data. 
This level of diligence is necessary to ascertain the patient’s health status , and thus avoid 
lost to follow -up status for efficacy assessments. Follow -up may require:  
 
• Permission for study personnel to contact an alternative person (e.g., family, 
spouse, partner, legal representative, or physician) even if only by  telephone  
 
• Permi ssion for study personnel to access and review the patient’s medical 
information from alternative resources (e.g., doctors notes, hospital  records)  
 
Attempts to contact patients must be documented in the patient’s source documents and 
in the eCRF. The sour ce documents for OS may be sent remotely to the site Clinical 
Research Associate for review and verification (ensuring patient identifiers are redacted 
except for study number and initials).  
 
6.6 EFFICACY AND SAFETY  VARIABLES  
 
6.6.1 Appropriateness of  Measurements  
 
The safety and efficacy measurements used in the evaluation of the study endpoints are 
widely used and recognized as reliable, accurate, and conform to standard of care.  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.: 
CNTX -CX-01-2015 -AML -1 
Protocol Version 3.0  
Incorporating Amendment 2  
JAN 13, 2017  Page 52 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 Response will be evaluated according to IWG criteria (see Appendix A ), which has been 
published and validated and is appropriate for use in this study.  
 
6.6.2 Efficacy  Assessments  
 
6.6.2.1  Primary Efficacy  Assessment  
 
The primary endpoint is the rate of patients in each treatment group achieving 
morphological CR based on IWG criteria during the induction and re -induction phases of 
the treatment. Morphologic CR is defined as ANC >1000/μL, platelet  
count >100,000/μL, <5% blasts in an bone marrow aspirate sample, no blasts with Auer 
rods, and no evidence of extramedullary disease (see Appendix A ). 
 
6.6.2.2  Secondary Efficacy  Assessments  
 
6.6.2.2.1  Event -Free  Survival  
 
Event -free survival is measured from the date of randomization until treatment failure 
(e.g., failure to achieve composite complete morphological remission during the 
induction or re -induction phase of the study lasting up to 60 days, relapse from CR, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first).  
 
6.6.2.2.2  Leukemia -Free  Survival  
 
Leukemia -free survival is only assessed in patients who achieve composite CR and is 
measured from the date of randomization until disease relapse or patient death from any 
cause, whiche ver occurs first.  
 
6.6.2.2.3  Overall  Survival  
 
Overall survival is measured from the date of randomization until death from any cause.  
 
6.6.2.2.4  Composite Complete Remission  Rate 
 
Complete remission rate includes CR, CR without recovery of platelets (CRp) and CRi as 
defined by IWG criteria ( Appendix A ) during the induction and re -induction phases of 
treatment.  
 
6.6.2.2.5  Duration of Morphologic Complete  Remission  
 
Duration of morphologic complete response is measured from the achievement of CR to 
detecti on of relapse.  
 
6.6.2.2.6  30-Day, 60 -Day and 90 -Day Mortality  
 
Thirty -day, 60 -day, and 90 -day mortality are the rate of death during 30 days, 60  days, 
and 90 days, respectively, from the first day of induction  treatment.

Incorporating Amendment 2  
JAN 13, 2017  Page 53 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 6.6.2.2.7  Neutrophil and Platelet  Recovery  
 
Time to neutrophil recovery is measured from the date of randomization until ANC 
recovers to >1000/μL.  
 
Time to transfusion -independent platelet recovery is measured from the date of 
randomization until the first day that the platelet count recovers to >10 0,000/μL 
(provided it is not as a consequence of platelet transfusion and provided platelets are then 
maintained at >100,000/μL for the five subsequent days without platelet transfusion).  
 
6.6.3 Safety  Assessments  
 
Key safety endpoints will be assessed by review  of summaries of AEs which will include 
only treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), unless otherwise stated. Adverse events will be 
categorized by System Organ Class (SOC) and preferred term using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictiona ry (version 14.1), and will be 
graded according to NCI -CTCAE version 4.03.  
 
6.6.3.1  Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Adverse events will be collected 
from the time of informed consent and continue until 30 days after the last study 
treatment is administered. Longer follow -up and collection of AEs may be required for 
patients who do not have an ANC recovery by Day 42 (i.e., until the recovery or until a 
reason for no recovery is diagnosed) after the last induction or consolidati on cycle.  
 
For the purpose of this study, the terms toxicity and AE are used interchangeably.  
 
6.6.3.2  Definitions  
 
6.6.3.2.1  Definition of an Adverse  Event  
 
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom, or disease) in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for 
participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or casually 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.  
 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician 
treating the  subject should not be recorded as an AE (however, the condition for which 
the surgery is required may be an AE).  
 
In the following differentiation between medical history and AEs the term “condition” 
may include abnormal symptoms, diseases, laboratory, or  vital sign findings.  
 
• Conditions that started before signing of ICF and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of ICF are recorded as medical history  (e.g.,  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.:

Protocol Version 3.0

 seasonal allergy without acute complaints)  
 
• Conditions that started before signing of ICF and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of ICF, at unchanged frequency  and/or 
intensity, are recorded as medical history (e.g., allergic  pollinosis)  
 
• Conditions that started or deteriorate d after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as  AEs.  
 
 
Abnormal laboratory and other abnormal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, lead to treatm ent discontinuation or are otherwise considered clinically 
relevant by the Investigator. In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the 
condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the 
procedure itself. In a case of  fatality, the cause of death is considered as the AE, and the 
death is considered as its outcome.  
 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are considered to be an AE 
only if they worsen after starting study drug and are clearly not related to cytarabine 
and/or idarubicin toxicities, or to AML that is not yet in remission. Abnormal  laboratory 
values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs and symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
 
Information about all AEs, whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by the 
Investigator or designee questioning, or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded, as appropriate.  
 
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine:  
 
• The severity grade based on NCI -CTCAE version 4. 03 (Grade 1 to  5) 
• The relationship to the study drug(s) (see Section 6.6.3.2.6 ). A relationship 
between the AE and the underlying AML, the dose -intensive chemotherapy,  and 
CX-01 treatment, will be assessed  
 
• The duration (start and end dates or continuing at final  contact)  
• Action taken (no action taken, study drug dosage adjusted/tem porarily 
interrupted, study drug permanently discontinued due to this AE,  concomitant 
medication taken, non -drug therapy given, hospitalization/prolonged 
hospitalization, see Section  6.6.3.2.7 ) 
 
• Whether it constitutes an  SAE . 
All AEs will be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug

 treatment as listed in the dose modification section of the protocol (Section 6.4.4.2 ). 
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the event, completion 
of the patient’s participation, or study termination, or the Investigator or designee and 
Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, whichever occurs first.  
 
Assessments should be made at  each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the relationship to the study drug, the intervention required to treat it, 
and the outcome.  
 
Common side effects known for CX -01 are provided in the IB ( 63). All AEs will be 
immediately recorded in the patient’s source documents.  
 
6.6.3.2.2  Definition of an Serious Adverse  Event  
 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose either:  
 
• Results in  death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires patient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization. 
Note: Hospitalization for the purpose of administration of induction or 
consolidation treatment will not be considered an  AE 
 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity (disability is  defined 
as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life  function)  
 
• Is congenital anomaly or birth  defect  
• Is another medically important serious event as judged by the  Investigator.  
Note: The term ‘ life-threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
Hosp italization is defined as the patient being hospitalized overnight, or the patient’s 
hospital stay being prolonged for at least an additional overnight stay. Hospitalizations 
for safety reasons, e.g., an overnight stay to avoid a repeat journey, or patient s 
undergoing a preplanned hospital procedure, will not be considered an SAE. 
Hospitalizations or prolongation of hospitalization for a procedure will be noted in the 
eCRF. Hospitalization for the purpose of administration of induction or consolidation 
treatment will not be considered an AE.  
 
Important medical events that may result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize t he patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Cantex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
CX-01 Clinical Study Protocol  Protocol  No.: 
CNTX -CX-01-2015 -AML -1 
Protocol Version 3.0  
Incorporating Amendment 2  
JAN 13, 2017  Page 56 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 Examples of such medical events included allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room  or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Instances of death or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the 
Investigator at any time af ter cessation of the study treatment and considered by the 
Investigator to be possibly related to the study treatment, will be reported to the client.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE should 
be reported as an S AE in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
defin ition above.  
 
Any AE leading to death from any cause while a patient is receiving treatment on this 
protocol or up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment which is felt to be related 
to the study drug must be reported as an SAE.  
 
Toxicities which  fall within the SAE definitions listed above must be reported as an SAE 
regardless if they are felt to be treatment related or not, with the exception of 
hospitalization for induction, re -induction or consolidation treatment for AML. Toxicities 
unrelated to treatment that do NOT fall within the SAE definitions above, must be 
documented as AEs in the patient’s source documents and eCRF.  
 
6.6.3.2.3  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse  Reactions  
 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not 
listed in the IB. Suspected adverse reactions means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational 
New Drug (IND) safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
 
6.6.3.2.4  Follow -up of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse  Events  
 
Adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabili zation of the event, completion 
of the patient’s participation, or study termination, or the Investigator or designee and 
Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary, whichever occurs first.  
 
Serious AEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, or the Investigator 
or designee and Sponsor agree that follow -up is no longer necessary.  
 
All AEs will be immediately recorded in the patient’s source documents.  
 
6.6.3.2.5  Assessment of  Severi ty 
 
The severity grade will be based on the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. An electronic copy of 
the CTCAE Version 4 can be downloaded fr om: http://safetyprofiler -

6.6.3.2.6  Causality  Assessment  
 
The Investigator must assess and document causal relationship between an SAE and the 
study drug on the basis of his/her clinical judgment using the following definitions. The 
causality assessment must be made based on the available information and can be 
updated as new information becomes available.  
 
Is there a “reasonable possibility” the drug caused the AE (meaning there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE)?  
 
• Yes 
• No. 
Could the AE be explained by underlying disease or o ther drugs or chemicals?  
 
• Yes 
• No. 
6.6.3.2.7  Action Taken Regarding the Study  Drug  
 
• No action taken : no change in treatment  dosage  
• Dose reduction : study drug dosage adjusted/or and  reduced  
• Drug interrupted : study drug temporarily  stopped  
• Drug withdrawn : study drug permanently  stopped  
• Specific treatment instituted : other concomitant medication or non -drug therapy 
administered in response to an AE.  
 
6.6.3.2.8  Adverse Event  Outcome  
 
• Recovered/resolved : the patient fully recovered from the AE with no  residual 
effect  observed  
 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae : the residual effects (e.g., symptoms  or 
pathology) of the AE are still present and  observable  
 
• Not recovered/not resolved : the AE itself is still present and  observable  
• Fatal : the patient dies as a result of the  AE

 • Unknown : outcome of the AE is  unknown.  
6.6.3.3  Pregnancy  
 
Although not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the Investigator or their 
designee to report any pregnancy in a patient or the patient’s sex ual partner that occurs 
during the study. All patients who become pregnant must immediately discontinue the 
study drug and be withdrawn from the study. The patient will be followed to 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. This information is important f or both drug 
safety and public health concerns. If a patient is found to be pregnant after the study 
treatment was administered, the Investigator should report this to the CRO and Sponsor 
immediately and document using the Pregnancy Form.  
 
The Investigator  must make every effort to follow the patient until completion of 
pregnancy. If the outcome of pregnancy meets the criteria for classification of an SAE, 
the Investigator must follow the procedures for reporting SAEs outlined in Sec tion 6.6.4.  
 
6.6.3.4  12-lead Electrocardiogram  
 
A standard resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening and at the end of 
induction (Day 7). Additional 12 -lead ECGs may be obtained at the Investigator’s 
discretion or if clinically indicated.  
 
6.6.3.5  Left Ventricular Ejection  Fraction  
 
An echocardiography or MUGA scan will be performed during Screening to determine 
the patient’s cardiac ejection fraction for eligibility in the study.  
 
6.6.3.6  Laboratory  Assessments  
 
The time points at which these samples will be collected are shown in the Schedu le of 
Study Procedures (Table 6 —1) and ( Table 6 —2). Assessments will be performed and 
evaluated locally.  
 
The following clinical laboratory assessments will be performed:  
 
• Hematology panel : hemoglobin , ANC, and  platelet  
• Chemistry (comprehensive metabolic panel) : ALT, AST, total  bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase , BUN, and serum  creatinine  
 
• Coagulation panel : anti -factor Xa, PT, aPTT,  INR.  
Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value should be immediately re -checked 
whenever possible, for confirmation before making any decision for the concerned 
patient. It should be documented as an AE/SAE per protocol requirement.

JAN 13, 2017  Page 59 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 A urine pregnancy test will be conducted at Screening for all females of childbearing 
potential to confirm absence of pregnancy. Positive urine test results must be confirmed 
by serum pregnancy test. Results will be analyzed locally. Pregnancy tests may be  
performed at other visits at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
 
6.6.3.6.1  Bone Marrow  Aspirate/Biopsy  
 
To evaluate disease status, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy if needed will be done 
within 28 days before starting therapy. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy wi ll also be 
performed between Days 14 -21 to determine the need for re -induction chemotherapy (see 
Section 6.4.1 ). Subsequent bone marrow examinations are specified in Section 6.5.1 . 
Bone marrow aspirate at baseline and follow -up should include analysis by flow 
cytometry and cytogenetic analysis. Bone marrow (or peripheral blood if bone marrow is 
unavailable) should be sent to the institution’s local cytogenetic laboratory for analysis . 
 
For patients with documented CR, confirmatory bone marrow aspirate slides will be 
submitted to the Sponsor or designee.  
 
6.6.3.7  Vital Signs and ECOG Performance  Status  
 
Measurement of vital signs will include an assessment of heart rate, BP, height, and 
weight . Height will be measured once during Screening. Weight will be measured at the 
beginning of each cycle to calculate treatment doses. Vital signs may be repeated for 
clinically significant abnormal findings at the discretion of the Investigator.  
 
Eastern C ooperative Oncology Group performance status will be collected at Screening 
Visit only (see Appendix B ). 
 
6.6.3.8  Physical  Examination  
 
All abnormal findings on physical exam will be documented in the source documentation 
and eCRF. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs, if applicable.  
 
6.6.4 Reporting Serious Adverse  Events  
 
All SAEs will be collected from the time of informed consent until 30 days after the last 
study treatment and regardless of study drug relationship, must be reported by facsimile 
to the CRO within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The facsimile report should 
include all available information requested on t he SAE form (refer to Key Study 
Personnel page for fax number to report SAEs).The SAE form will collect data 
surrounding the event, e.g., the nature of the symptom(s), time of onset in relation to 
initiation of therapy, duration, intensity, and whether or not therapy was interrupted or 
discontinued. The Investigator’s assessment of the probable cause of the event will also 
be included. In addition, relevant medical history, concomitant medications, laboratory 
and diagnostic reports, and procedures, as well as all pertinent medical information

 related to the event, will also be collected.  
 
The CRO will forward SAE queries directly to the site requesting incomplete or missing 
information. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to be diligent in providing this 
information back to the CRO as soon as it is available. Initial reports of SAEs should not 
be left on telephone voicemails. Always fax SAE reports and follow -up with a telephone 
call if needed.  
 
All sites will follow their institutional requ irements for submission of SAEs to their IRB.  
 
6.6.4.1  Expected Adverse Events  
 
Myelosuppression and its associated complications due to underlying leukemia and/or 
intensive anti -leukemia therapy are expected events during therapy for AML.  
 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for the treatment of the following 
events that are known to be associated with myelosuppression from leukemia and/or 
intensive leukemia therapy, are also considered to be expected. These events still need to 
be recorded as AEs on the eCRF:  
 
• Fatigue, weakness and/or shortness of breath associated with  anemia  
• Febrile  neutropenia  
• Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal  bleeding  
• Bacteremia, sepsis, or other  infections  
• Neutropenic colitis.  
Death due to progression of AML and/or its associated complications are expected in the 
patient population and are liste d in Appendix E . Deaths should be reported with 
Investigator’s assessment of causal ity. 
 
Appendix E also contains a list of known/expected AEs for cytarabine and idarubicin. 
The IB contains expected events known for CX -01 (63). 
 
6.6.4.2  Investigator’s Notification of the  Sponsor  
 
All Investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspects of the 
Investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs. This information, including all relevant 
contact details, is summarized in the Investigator site file. This information w ill be 
updated as needed. Serious AEs occurring during the study must immediately (within 
24 hours of Investigator’s awareness) be reported per Sec tion 6.6.4  to the recipient 
detailed in the manual.  
 
Serious AEs occurring after the protocol -defined observation period will be processed by

events (e.g., SUSARs) according to all applicable regulations. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designee will send SUSARs to a site once the site initiation visit has occurred and will 
stop sending SUSARs to a site once the last subject End  of Treatment Visit for that site 
(30 days after last dose) occurs.  
 
6.6.5 Data and Safety Monitoring  Committee  
 
A DSMC will serve as a monitoring advisory group for the study. The primary role for 
the DSMC will be to examine the safety and efficacy throughout the duration of the 
study.  
 
The DSMC will be created to further protect the rights, safety, and well -being o f patients 
who will be participating in the study by monitoring their progress and their results. The 
DSMC comprises qualified scientists, who are not Investigators in the study and not 
otherwise directly associated with the Sponsor. The DSMC will be descr ibed in detail in 
the DSMC Charter.  
 
The DSMC will monitor data during the study. All activities of the DSMC will be 
documented.  This documentation  will contain  data summaries  and analyses  provided  to the 
committee as well as minutes of any ad -hoc meetings, as  necessary.  
 
6.6.6 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Steady -state PK samples will be collected at selected sites only. Pharmacokinetic samples 
will be collected during the induction cycle on Days 3 and 5.  
 
The first 6 p atients assigned to a CX -01 dose level (low; 0.125 mg/kg/hour, intermediate;  
0.25 mg/kg/hour, and high doses; 0.325 mg/kg/hour) will have PK’s drawn (consistent 
with the original protocol which included 4 dose groups).

Protocol Version 3.0  
Incorporating Amendment 2  
JAN 13, 2017  Page 62 of 89  CONFIDENTIAL   
 The same 6 patients tha t participate in Day 3 PK sampling will have one additional blood 
sample drawn on Day 5 of treatment. The PK samples may be drawn before the CX -01 
infusion is stopped to change the CX -01 bag and tubing. All PK blood samples must be 
drawn from the opposite arm to the CX -01 IV infusion.  
 
The site will document actual dates and times of sample collection in the source 
documents and eCRF. Any reason for missed or lost samples should be recorded.  
 
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be processed and may be batch shipped for analysis 
to a bioanalytical laboratory. Full details of sample handling and shipment can be found 
in the Study Operations Manual (also refer to Appendix F for details).  
 
6.7 Data Quality  Assurance  
The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee performs quality control and assurance checks on all 
clinical studies that it conducts. Before enrolling any patients in this study, the Sponsor or 
Sponsor’s designee and the I nvestigator will review the protocol, the IB, the eCRFs and 
instructions for their completion, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the 
procedure for reporting AEs and SAEs. The Sponsor’s designee will monitor the conduct 
of the study at the s ite and will verify eCRFs against source documents. Additionally, the 
Sponsor’s designee will use automated validation programs to help identify missing data, 
selected protocol deviations, out -of-range data, and other data inconsistencies. Requests 
for dat a clarification or correction will be electronically provided to the Investigator for 
resolution.  
 
In accordance with ICH GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected 
for audit by representatives from the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee. Ins pection of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy drug storage areas, laboratories, etc.) and review of study - 
related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the  protocol, 
ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory  requirements.  
 
6.8 Statistical  Methods  
 
6.8.1 Determination of Sample  Size 
 
A total of 25 evaluable patients per arm will provide 71.8% power for each test 
comparing a dose with control via a Fisher's exact test at 1 -sided alpha = 0.15 to detect a 
difference between a control proportion 0.55  and an experimental dose proportion 0.80; 
these tests will be conducted in a fixed sequence: higher dose versus control first and 
lower dose versus control second, with the second test considered exploratory (failed) if 
the first test fails.  
 
6.8.2 Patient Popu lations  Analyzed  
 
The analysis sets that will be used for statistical analyses are as follows:

treatment to which they are randomized. The ITT Population will be the primary analysis 
set for the efficacy variables.  
 
Per Protocol (PP) : Supporting analyses will be conducted on the P P Population, 
comprising all patients randomized and treated without major protocol violations during 
the trial. This population will be documented before final database lock.  
 
Safety : All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patient s will be 
included in the analyses according to the treatment they received. The Safety Population 
will be used in the analyses of all safety endpoints.  
 
6.8.3 General  Considerations  
 
The following is an overview of the statistical analysis methods to be used in  this study. 
Details on the statistical analyses will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

OR 
 
• Group 3 : Idarubicin + Cytarabine plus higher dose CX -01 (0.25  mg/kg/hour)  
Unless stated otherwise, descriptive summary statistics will include frequency counts  and 
percentages for categorical variables and  number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum and the 1st and 3rd quartiles for 
continuous  variables.  
 
The final analysis will be done when the last patient completes the study treatment, all 
assessments for disease response, and a Safety Follow -Up Visit approximately 30  days 
after termination of study treatment. All patients will be followed for OS for at least 
18 months. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS; the version used will be 
specified in the  SAP.

 6.8.7 Extent of Study Drug Exposure and  Compliance  
 
Extent of study drug exposure will be summarized for the entire study treatment period 
and by cycle. Exposure variables will include d uration of study treatment, number of 
dose reductions, number of treatment delays, number of treatment cycles, and dose 
intensity relative to dose levels specified in the protocol.  
 
6.8.8 Efficacy  Analysis  
 
6.8.8.1  Primary Efficacy Outcome  Measure  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT Population as defined in 
Section 6.8.2 . Fisher exact test will be used to compare the proportion of CRs between 
each dose and control.  
 
6.8.8.2  Secondary Efficacy Outcome  Measures  
 
The primary a nalysis will be repeated using the PP Population as a supportive analysis. 
Complete response rates and confidence intervals will also be reported for key subgroups 
(e.g., randomization strata). Analyses of EFS, LFS, time to neutrophil and platelet 
recovery , and OS will be descriptive. Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimates will be used to 
estimate the survival distribution for each arm and KM plots will be produced to 
accompany these analyses. Confidence Intervals will be reported for medians and KM 
estimates. Duratio n of response will be analyzed using a similar approach; the analysis 
will account for the competing risk of death and the survival distributions will be 
estimated as cumulative incidence functions.  
 
Mortality rate at Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90 will be reported using descriptive statistics 
in a manner similar to the reporting of the morphologic CR rate. The time to neutrophil 
and platelet recoveries will be reported using the following descriptive stat istics: N, 
mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum, and the 1st and 3rd quartiles.  
6.8.9 Subgroup  Analysis  
 
Subgroup analyses will be defined in the SAP. All results from these analyses are deemed 
to be exploratory. Exploratory analysis will be descriptive.  
 
6.8.10  Safety  Analysis  
 
Safety analysis will be descriptive based on the Safety Population and will involve 
examination of descriptive statistics and individual patient listings for effects of study 
treatment on clinical safety and tolerability. The safety assessment per iod is from the first 
dose of study treatment until 30 days following the last dose of study treatment.

 and graded according to NCI -CTCAE v4.03. Treatment -emergent AE summaries will 
include NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 or higher AEs, and AEs resulting in discontinuation of 
study treatment, AEs resulting in death, deaths during the treatment period within 30 days 
of the last study treatment, deaths reported beyond 30 days that are considered  study  
drug-related, and the incidence of laboratory values with NCI -CTCAE Grades 3 or  4. 
Particular attention will be upon coagulation parameters and bleeding -related  events.  
 
6.8.10.2  Clinical Laboratory  Assessments  
 
Clinical laboratory assessment will be summarized using frequency tables, shift tables, 
and descriptive statistics. Frequency tables and shift tables will be presented by

and definitions w ill be specified in the SAP.  
 
7. RISKS AND  BENEFITS  
 
The potential risks associated with participation in this study are minimal based on 
available safety data. Such risks are limited to unforeseen adverse interactions between 
idarubicin + cytarabine and CX -01. Heparins, as a class are associated with abnorm al 
LFTs, which are generally reversible and of little clinical importance.  
 
Study participants may benefit from participating in the trial if, by mobilizing AML stem 
cells from the protective environment of the bone marrow or through other mechanisms, 
the addition of CX -01 at either of two dose levels results in an enhanced cytotoxic effect 
of idarubicin + cytarabine, although such benefit is not guaranteed.  
 
For further details concerning warnings, precautions, and contradictions, refer to the 
appropriate section of the IB ( 63).

 8.10 Clinical Study  Report  
 
A clinical study report (CSR) will be prepared following the completi on of the study.  
 
8.11 Confidentiality  
All unpublished information that the Sponsor gives to the Investigator shall be kept 
confidential and shall not be published or disclosed to a third party without the prior 
written consent of the Sponsor.  
 
When the Sponsor generates reports for presentations to regulatory agencies, one or more 
of the Investigators who has/have contributed significantly to the study may be asked to 
endorse the final report.  
 
The Investigator shall not make a patent applicatio n based on the results of this study and 
shall not assist any third party in making such an application without the written 
authorization of the Sponsor unless otherwise specified in the CSA.  
 
8.12 Records  Retention  
 
Essential documents must be retained for lon ger than 5 years after completion of the 
study, 2 years after the final marketing authorization in an ICH region or until at least  
2 years have elapsed since the discontinuation of clinical development of the study drug. 
If it becomes necessary for the Spo nsor or the Competent Authority to review any 
documentation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such records.  
 
Study files may be discarded upon written notification by the Sponsor. To avoid error, the 
Investigator must contact th e Sponsor before destroying any records or reports pertaining 
to the study, to ensure that retention is no longer required. Other source documents, such 
as patient’s medical records, must be retained for the maximum period of time permitted 
by the hospital  or institution and until such time when the Investigator is informed by the 
Sponsor that there is no further need to do so.  
 
In addition, in accordance with the Investigator agreement, the Sponsor should be 
contacted if the site’s Principal Investigator p lans to leave the investigational site so that 
appropriate arrangements can be made.

10. APPENDICES  
 
APPENDIX A – Acute Myeloid Leukemia Response Criteria  
 
The IWG consensus criteria for treatment response in AML will be used to evaluate 
response to treatment.  
 
Definitions of Remission  
 
Morphologic complete remission (CR) : ANC >1000/μL, platelet count >10 0,000/μL,  
<5% bone marrow blasts, no Auer rods, no evidence of extramedullary disease.  
 
Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) : CRi, which is CR 
without recovery of neutrophils and/or platelets (ANC may be <1000 μL and/or platelet 
count <100,000/μL).  
 
Partial remission (PR) : ANC >1000/μL, platelet count >100,000/μL and at least a 50% 
decrease in the percentage of marrow aspirate blasts to 5 to 25%, or marrow blasts <5% 
with persistent Auer rods.  
 
Progressive Disease  
 
Progressive disease (PD) is defined as any one of the following:  
 
• More than 50% increase in bone marrow blast % from best assessment (with a 
minimum threshold of 20% blasts in the  marrow).  
 
• >50% increase in circulating malignant blasts (with absolute blast s >1000/μL).  
• Development of biopsy -proven extramedullary leukemia (if the patient has 
extramedullary disease at baseline then PD will be defined by blood and  marrow 
criteria or if new sites of extramedullary disease  appear).  
 
In patients who present with i nitial marrow blast percentage sufficiently high to preclude 
the ability to base disease progression on a >50% increase in marrow blast percentage; 
disease progression should be based on peripheral blood criteria or development of 
extramedullary leukemia.  
 
Stable Disease  
 
Patients who fail to achieve CR, CRi or PR and who do not have criteria for PD will be 
defined as having stable disease. If the patient dies prior to response assessment at the 
end of Cycle 1, then they will be classified as “Indeterminate ”.

 Reappearance of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood; or >5% blasts in the bone 
marrow not attributable to another cause (e.g., recovery of normal cells following 
chemotherapy -induced aphasia); or appearance or reappearance of extramedullary disease 
and the bone marrow blast percentage is >5% but < or equal to 20%, than a repeat bone 
marrow performed at least 7 days after the first marrow examination and documenting 
bone marrow blast percentage is >5% is necessary to establish relapse.

correlate with one - and two -year patient survival: class A: 100 and 85%; class B: 80 and 60%, and class C: 
45 and  35%.

 APPENDIX F – Blood Sample Handling  
 
Blood sample collection procedure, and sample process, storage and shipment  
 
• The study site will be provided with 4.5 mL tubes with 3.2% trisodium  citrate  
• Draw and fill the 4.5 mL tube containing 3.2% trisodium citrate ( completely  fill 
with blood to minimize citrate  dilution)  
 
• Within 30 minutes of collection, centrifuge tube for 15 minutes at 3000 g at 16°C/ 
60.8ºF. Blood samples must be kept on ice until they are centrifuged (a delay 
in centrifuging and separating plasma should not exceed one hour because 
the platelet factor leaches out of platelets and binds CX -01 resulting in 
erroneous CX -01 values)  
 
• Using a plastic pipette, transfer 2 mL of plasma from the tube into two provided 
cryogenic vials; 1 mL in each tube. Each of the two 1 mL -cryogenic vials must be 
labeled:  
 
"CX-01 concentration " and will also include: The sample #, patient's 
randomization/S tudy ID #, Initials, Study site #, Protocol # (CNTX -CX- 
01-2015 -AML -2) and collection date/time.  
 
• Labeled 1 mL/cryogenic tubes must be stored immediately in a -60°C to 80°C 
freezer  
 
Once the full set of blood samples from a patient is complete, all the res ulting vials must 
be shipped under cryogenic conditions (dry ice) to the bioanalytical laboratory (see Study 
Operations Manual for name of lab and notification number).  
 
Please call the bioanalytical laboratory to notify them prior to shipments. Please shi p 
specimens via FedEx only on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday to prevent thawing and 
sample loss.

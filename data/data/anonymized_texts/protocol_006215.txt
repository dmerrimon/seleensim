WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
This is a research study.  We invite you to participate in this research study because you  are scheduled to 
have spinal surgery and will receive anesthesia including drugs to reduce pain.  Many different drugs are used in anesthesia and surgery including drugs to relieve pain. One commonly used drug is methadone. Methadone works quickly and lasts longer than other pain medications such as morphine. Methadone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Ad ministration for treating pain in adults. 
Previous studies have shown that adults and adolescents are similar in how their bodies handle methadone used for pain during surgery. The purpose of this research study is to determine if administration of the drug methadone during surgery will reduce pain and reduce the amount of pain medications after surgery  in adolescents and children .  A second purpose of this research study is to 
understand how well methadone controls pain, how long it last and how long it takes for children and adolescents to metabolize  (get rid of ) methadone from their bodies.  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
If you and one of your parents decide for you to participate in this study your anesthesia will be  exactly 
the same as if you were not in the study . In addition to other pain medication you may also receive a 
dose of methadone during your surgery. If you do not receive methadone you will receive other pain

 This is a randomized study.  You will be randomly placed into 1 of 3 groups depending on when you are enrolled to the study.   
 
Study Cohorts:  If you are enrolled in one of the Methadone cohorts you will be randomized to receive a dose of methadone in the operating room.  The methadone dose will depend on your weight.  Treatment Cohort: If you are enrolled in the methadone treatment cohort 1, you will be randomized to receive intravenous (IV) methadone HCI during your surgery.   Control Cohort: If you are enrolled in the control cohort you will be randomized to receive a standard 
opioid pain medication, not methadone, by IV during surgery.  This will be the only time you receive methadone for this study. 
 
Before your surgery and every morning for up to 6 days following the procedure (if you are still in the hospital), a member of the research team will ask you questions about your comfort level and any pain that you may experience. A numeric scale and pictures to depict how you are feeling will be used to help assess your comfort level and what you consider acceptable for treating any discomfort. You may be provided with an electronic tablet to answer questions about how you are feeling. Your parents will also be asked to use the tablet to answer questions about your overall wellbeing following your surgery. We also want to know if you experience side effects such as sleepiness, itching and nausea.  
 
To understand how long it takes methadone to disappear from the body, we need to draw blood several times after the methadone is given. We will take a total of about 3 tablespoons of blood over 4 days.  We will use the arterial line placed (routine standard of care) after you are asleep in the operating room  to 
draw the blood for the first 24 hours. For the remaining samples, we will continue to collect a blood 
sample every morning for up to 4 days after your surgery from an IV (intravenous) catheter or collect samples with routine blood draws.  Your urine will be collected in a container that is provided for up to four days. Each day the research staff will provide a new container and will collect the container from the previous day. 
 
We will collect information from your medical record such as demographic data, pain medication use 
and information from your hospital stay. 
 
We would also like for you and your primary caregiver to complete a short questionnaire about your 
pain and its effects on your family before your surgery.  The questionnaire will take approximately 5 
minutes. 
 
Will you save my samples or research data to use in future research studies?   
As part of this study, we are obtaining blood samples  from you. The samples we collect will be saved 
and labeled with a code and will not contain any personal identifiers , such as your name. If you agree, 
we would like to use your blood for other research projects going on now and in the future. These future 
studies may provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding pain. I t is unlikely th at

you give up any property rights you may have to the se samples. There are no plans to provide financial 
compensation to you for allowing us to store your samples. Your blood samples may be used to develop

 You will also be asked to have blood collected and used for genetic testing. The purpose is to obtain 
DNA (the blue print for a person’s genetic makeup ) to help us learn about the genes (the part of DNA 
that tells your body how to make proteins) associated with pain.  We will look at the genes which may affect how long methadone lasts. Only personnel involved with this research project will have access to the DNA sam ples. You will not be told the results of the gene tests because they are experimental, and 
because we don’t know of any conclusive links between these genes and the risk of disease or any adverse events from drug therapy. If you agree, we will take approximately one teaspoon of blood either from your arterial line or from an IV at the same time as other blood sample collections. We will store 
your DNA for at least ten (10) years.  Your DNA  will be given a code number and contain no personal 
identifiers . Your DNA samples may be used to develop investigational tests, treatments, drugs, or 
devices that are not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?  
Approximately 75 people will take part in this study conducted by investigators at Washington University.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
If you agree to take part in this study, your involvement will last six  days  or until discharged from the 
hospital, whichever comes first.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
You may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In addition to 
these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this study.  
Methadone:  
The risks listed below can a lso happen with  other pain medications. 
Likely:  Some people can get sick to their stomach (nausea) or throw up (vomit) after methadone.   
Less likely:  Methadone can possibly decrease your breathing rate, or cause sleepiness when several doses are given.  However these have not been a problem with the single dose we will give you, which 
has been used safely before.  
Rare:  Serious decreases in breathing rate or heart rate can happen in patients given many, very high doses for several days when first starti ng methadone.  You will receive only one dose.

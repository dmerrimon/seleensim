This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. 1. Background 
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII), or  pump therapy, allows for insulin to be delivered 
continuously into the body, as opposed to delivery at sp ecific times. Rapid-acting insulin is infused into 
the body at constant/basal rates throughout a 24-hr period via the insulin pump which mimics normal 
insulin secretion from the pancreas. Additional rapid-acting insulin can be delivered in boluses to 
compensate for anticipated fluctuations in blood glucose in response to meals.  
 
Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is al so an important part of the management of Type 1 
diabetes.  Careful attention to blood glucose values th roughout the day allows patients to more precisely 
adjust insulin dosages. However, because SMBG va lues are taken only at specific time points and 
measure brief instances of time within a 24-hour period, there are limits to the usefulness of this 
information. The “snap-shot” effect of SMBG proves to be a challenge for tracking of blood glucose (BG) 
trends which can be overcome through the addition of c ontinuous interstitial glucose monitoring to the 
SMBG regimen. 
 
Current methods of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) include the use of subcutaneous glucose 
sensors worn by the user which convert glucose from  the subject’s interstitial fluid into an electronic 
signal, the strength of which is proportional to the am ount of glucose present in the fluid.  The Paradigm® 
System, which received market approval from FD A on April 7, 2006 (P980022/S013), combined the 
technology of the Paradigm Insulin Pump (Models 522/722) with that of the MiniMed Guardian® REAL-Time Clinical device. The Paradigm System repres ents a combination of innovative therapies for the 
treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus: Pump therapy in conjunction with continuous interstitial glucose 
monitoring, as well as SMBG to perfect treat-to-glycemic–target approach.  
 In this study, the sensor is attached to a transmitte r which sends interstitial glucose information to the 
study Pump via radio signals. The pump screen is the data collection/user interface of the system and 
provides continuous real-time glucose values to the us er, as well as high/low glucose alerts set according 
to the individual patient’s needs. The Diabetes Cont rol and Complications Trial (DCCT) convincingly 
established the benefits of tight glucose control in the avoidance of long-term diabetic complications. 
However, a pitfall of the aggressive management of diabetes using intensive insulin regimens is an increased frequency of hypoglycemi a. Surveys investigating the pr evalence of hypoglycemia have 
provided some alarming results. The DCCT reported a threefold increase in severe hypoglycemia and coma in intensively treated patients versus c onventionally treated patient s [DCCT Research Group, 
1991]. 
 
For many individuals with diabetes, episodes of se vere hypoglycemia are the major obstacle to the 
achievement of euglycemia and the prevention of long-term complications. Hypoglycemia is frightening to 
patients and their families. It has been estimated that  about 55% of severe hypoglycemic episodes occur 
during sleep. Acutely diminished brain function du ring a hypoglycemic episode poses potential physical 
danger to the patient. In addition, recurrent hypogl ycemia may impose long-lasting damaging effects on 
the brain, resulting in impairment of memory or other cognitive functions.   
 
In addition to adversely affecting cognition, re current hypoglycemia also impairs the body’s defense 
mechanisms against hypoglycemia, creating a viciou s cycle for the patient. Normally, hypoglycemia 
triggers a series of hormonal and neural responses designed to restore glucose concentration towards normal, to maintain brain metabolism.  A component of  this counter-regulatory response is the secretion 
of epinephrine, which generates “neurogenic” sympto ms (e.g., palpitations, sweating, and anxiety) that 
serve to warn the patient of the drop in blood glucose.   The patient can then take action (i.e., eat) to help 
reverse the hypoglycemia.  After an episode of severe hypoglycemia the body’s  natural responses are 
impaired further increasing the patient’s risk of another hypoglycemic episode. 
 
Terms regarding TS used in this protocol:  
 
 Threshold Suspend (TS) refers to low glucose suspend which allows for the suspension of insulin 
when a preset sensor glucose threshold has been set.

2. Devices and Supplies 
2.1 Names and Intended Use of Devices  
2.1.1 Medtronic MiniMed® 530G Pump (MMT-551, MMT-751) – Investigational  
The Medtronic MiniMed® 530G Pump model (MMT-551, MMT-751) used in this 
study is an approved device in the United States. This insulin pump is equipped 
with a number of features to actively manage the user’s glucose levels. The Threshold Suspend (TS) feature automatic ally stops insulin delivery based on a 
low Sensor Glucose Value (SGV). The TS  feature is only available when the 
pump is used in conjunction with cont inuous glucose monitoring (CGM) which 
consists of a subcutaneous glucose sensor and transmitter to communicate 
sensor glucose readings to the insulin pump. 
2.1.2 Paradigm Remote Control/Programmer (MMT-503) – Approved under 
510(k) K001829  
The Paradigm Remote Controller is a hand-held, reusable accessory device that 
uses radio frequency to transmit a signal to Paradigm Infusion Pumps for limited pump programming.  Using this accessory, a pump user can program a normal 
bolus, suspend or restart the pump. The device is considered an accessory to 
the Paradigm Infusion Pump family 
2.1.3 Medtronic MiniMed Enlite™  Glucose Sensor (MMT-7008) – 
Investigational  
The Medtronic MiniMed Enlite Sensor is a sensor that is similar in design and 
materials to the Medtronic MiniMed Glucose Sof-Sensor. The sensor includes a 
microelectrode with a thin coating of gl ucose oxidase beneath several layers of 
biocompatible membrane. It is intended to penetrate the skin at a 90-degree angle and is smaller than the Medtroni c MiniMed Glucose Sof-Sensor. An 
introducer needle penetrates the skin surface and provides support for the 
sensor microelectrode during insertion. The electrode tubing maintains the 
electrode structure by providing support during and after subcutaneous insertion. 
The sensor continuously c onverts small amounts of glucose from the subject’s 
interstitial fluid into an electronic signal, the strength of which is proportional to the amount of glucose present in the blood. The electrode is composed of 
embedding, signal-conducting and insulating layers. 
2.1.4 Medtronic MiniMed MiniLink®  2 REAL-Time Transmitter (MMT-7713) – 
Investigational  
The MiniLink 2 is an investigational small transmitter device. The hardware of this 
transmitter is identical to MiniLink tr ansmitter approved under (PMA supplement 
approval number P980022/S018). The only difference between the two devices is the addition of the Artifact Detecti on software feature. Once the sensor has 
been inserted, the MiniLink 2 is connected directly to the sensor where it receives 
the electronic signal from the sensor el ectrode, converts signals into glucose 
data, and transmits the data to the pump. When a sensor is attached to the 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 11 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. MiniLink 2, it enters an initialization period. After two hours, it begins to 
periodically transmit glucose data to the pump, using a radio signal. 
 The MiniLink 2 contains a rechargeable battery, sensor electronics, and a radio 
frequency (RF) transmitter. A fully charged battery provides up to 14 days of 
transmitter use. The system includes a battery charger that will recharge the

Guide. 
2.1.5 Medtronic CareLink® Therapy Management Software for Diabetes 
(MMT-7334) – Investigational – referred to as CareLink Clinical in the 
protocol  
Carelink Clinical is an Internet based software system which allows data to be 
viewed and is easily evaluated by the su bject and his/her physician but should 
not be used by research site or subject for data analysis or diabetes 
management. A Personal Computer (PC) is used to access CareLink Clinical via 
the Internet, which then allows subjects/parents/caregivers to upload data from Medtronic MiniMed insulin pumps and a range of system-supported, third-party 
blood glucose meters. Carelink Clinical was developed for use by clinical trial 
subjects only. The data contained in CareLink Clinical is accessible to users using a standard browser, e.g., Microsof t® Internet Explorer on an Internet 
enabled PC. 
  
CareLink Clinical uses standard Secu re Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL 
transmission protocol invokes encryption on both ends of the transmissions and is the standard for all security based syst ems. The encryption remains in effect 
whether the data is moving to and from the client and server in the United States, 
or to and from a client in another country to the United States. The data is secure 
behind a three tier industry standard architecture, which places the database behind three different firewalls, where each firewall separates a tier: 
 
1. The internet to the web server; 
2. Web server to the application server; 
3. Application server to the database server. 
This software has been developed especially for use in clinical trials. 
2.1.6 Medtronic MiniMed charger ( MMT-7705) – FDA approval P980022/S018  
This charger will used to charge the Mi niLink 2 transmitter. The MiniLink 2 
contains a non-replaceable, rechargeable battery that can be recharged as 
needed. The charger has a green light to indicate the charging status and a red 
light that indicates problems during charging. Before using MiniLink 2, it must be fully charged, which will take up to 8 hou rs. A full charge lasts for up to 14 days 
of continuous use. After 14 days of use, the MiniLink 2 will fully recharge in less 
than 2 hours.  
2.1.7 Medtronic MiniMed Test plug (MMT-7706) - FDA approval 
P980022/S018  
The Test Plug operates as a sensor simulator creating signal current at a level 
that is within the range of an in-vivo sensor during normal operation.

The Enlite Serter is an insertion device used to ensure correct placement of the 
Medtronic MiniMed Enlite Glucose Sensor. Th e Serter injects the sensor into the 
insertion site when the button is released.   
2.1.9 Medtronic MiniMed CareLink™ USB (MMT-7305) - FDA approval 
K070438  
The Medtronic CareLink USB (510 (k) clearance number K070438) is indicated 
for use commercially by patients at home and for clinicians in a medical office 
setting as a means of facilitating communication between Medtronic diabetes therapy management devices that use Pa radigm-compatible RF telemetry and a 
personal computer that uses data ma nagement application software. The 
CareLink USB device will enable data from the Medtronic MiniMed® 530G to be 
uploaded to CareLink Clinical. 
2.1.10 Bayer CONTOUR™ Next Link Blood Glucose Meter (HMS 9740) – FDA 
approval K110894 
The Bayer Contour Next Link RF enabl ed BG Meter measures a subject’s 
capillary blood glucose level, which is then used to calibrate the pump. The 
Medtronic MiniMed
® 530G pump uses the calibration point in the real-time 
algorithm which calculates the sensor gl ucose values that are displayed to the 
subject. In a normal setting, the result of the SMBG reading is transmitted to the pump via radiofrequency (RF) and can be stored in its memory as a glucose 
calibration point. The pump asks the user every time if the user wants to use the linked meter BG for calibration. If accept ed, the glucose value will be stored in 
the pump’s memory as a calibration point.  
 
3. Objective and Hypothesis  
3.1. Study Objective  
 
The study objective is to demonstrate that home us e of Threshold Suspend (TS) is not associated with 
glycemic deterioration in pediatric patients with  type 1 diabetes, as measured by change in A1C.  
3.2. Study Hypothesis  
Change in A1C is defined as A1C measured at the en d of 12-month study period minus A1C measured at 
the baseline visit. The hypothesis is  mathematically expressed as: 
Ho: µ ≥  0.4%  
Ha: µ < 0.4%   
 
Where 0.4% is the pre-specified non-inferiorit y margin, µ is the mean of change in A1C (%). 
 
4. Study Design 
 This study is a longitudinal, multi-center trial that  aims to observe the Threshold Suspend (TS) feature 
with a sensor-augmented insuli n pump in patients 7–15 years with  Type 1 diabetes. The study will

6. Statistical Methods and Data Analysis  
6.1. Sample Size Calculation  
   6.1.1 Sample Size for Primary Endpoint 
The overall mean change in A1C from baseline to the end of study will be 
estimated and compared by a non-inferiority test with an A1C margin of 0.4% 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 15 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. and a significance level of 0.025 (one-si ded). The null hypothesis will be rejected 
if the one-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit of the mean change in A1C is less 
than 0.4%  
The hypothesis is mathematically expressed as: 
Ho: µ ≥ 0.4%  
Ha: µ < 0.4%   
 
Where 0.4% is the pre-specified non-infe riority margin, µ is the mean of change 
in A1C (%).  
 
Assuming the mean of change in A1C from baseline to the 12-month follow-up visit is zero, the standard deviati on of change in A1C is 1%, SAS power and 
sample size calculator shows that a to tal of 100 subjects will provide over 95% 
power to detect the non-inferiority with a margin of 0.4% and with one-sided type 
I error of 0.025. 
   6.1.2 Overall Consideration  
The above calculations suggest a sample size of 100 subjects who complete the study. For the drop-out rate, a conserva tive estimate of 20% is adopted (based 
on STAR3, IDE G060159, the percentage of subjects not completing study in the 
SAP group is 9.3%); assume 65% of subjects would wear the system most of the 
time. Then a total of 193 subjects needs to be recruited. In general, a number of 
200 will be eligible to participate in the study, with up to 300 subjects enrolled. 
 
6.2. Study Populations  
6.2.1. Intention to Treat (ITT) Population  
The Intention to Treat (ITT) population will include all enrolled subjects. 
6.2.2 Completed Case (CC) Population 
The Completed Cases (CC) population is all subjects who complete the trial.  
6.2.3 Efficacy Population  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the CC population.   6.2.4 Safety Population  
The Safety Population will be the ITT population (include all enrolled subjects). 
 
6.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
6.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
A mixed effects model be used to produce the estimate and confidence interval 
of the overall mean change in A1C while accounting for inter-site variability. The 
97.5% upper confidence interval of A1 C will be calculated and compared to the 
0.4% non-inferiority margin. As for endpoi nt analysis, the proposed mixed effects 
model using all A1C measurements has more power than the model only using 
Change in A1C from baseline to one-year visit.

7. Institutional Review Board  
This protocol, any subsequent amendments to this pr otocol, the Informed Consent form, subject material 
and any form of subject recruitment information (e .g. advertisements) relating to this study will be 
approved by the responsible IRB in accordance with 21  CFR Part 56.  The study will not start until IRB 
approval has been granted, the Sponsor has cleared t he Investigational Center to begin the study, and 
the investigational clinical staff has been appropriately trained to conduct the study. Copies of all relevant correspondence between the Investigational Center and the IRB will be retained on-site with copies 
forwarded to the Sponsor for their files.  
 
8. Subject Confidentiality 
8.1 Subject Identification  
The identity of the subjects may not be disclosed, unle ss required by law, to any persons not immediately 
involved in the study or the study procedures. All correspondence between the Investigational Center and 
Medtronic that refers to individual study subjects will use unique identifiers that are specific to each

This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. subject in lieu of subject names. Furthermore, all subject names will be redacted from reports, safety 
updates, and source documents that ar e forwarded to the Medtronic. 
8.2 Subject Database Assignment  
In the Oracle Clinical database, the Investigational Centers will be identified numerically, i.e. from 01 to 25 
(depending on center number). At the Screening visit, In vestigational Center staff will assign each subject 
a sequential ID number that corresponds to a pr e-defined casebook in the Oracle database.   
Each case book will contain all rele vant Case Report Form s for each subject. Subjects will be assigned a 
unique 9-digit identifier that will be structured such th at the first 3 digits correspond to the study number 
(287), the next 3 digits correspond to the Investigat ional Center number, and the final 3 digits correspond 
to the subject number. An example of a typical subject’s unique identifier is shown in the following 
example: The numerical sequence 287001001 translates into: Study number (287), Investigational Center 
number (001), Subject number (001).  
 
All study documents, eCRFs and correspondence will use this identifier sequence in lieu of a subject’s 
name or initials. 
8.3 Informed Consent  
Informed Consent/ Assent will be obtained in accordan ce with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 
Title 21, Part 50. Prior to entry into the study the California Experimental Subject’s Bill of Rights (if 
applicable), the IRB- and Medtronic-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF)/Assent, and the HIPAA Authorization Form will be given to each subject. Subjects/parents/caregive rs will be offered the 
opportunity to review these documents away from the Investigational Center. Pediatric subjects 7-15 
years of age should provide informed assent to participate in this research even if their parents or guardians have given permission for their participation through informed consent. A subject’s participation 
in study procedures cannot start before the consent process has been properly executed. 
9. Investigator Responsibilities 
This study will be conducted at up to 20 Investigational Centers where all study-re lated activities will take place; at 
each center, the study will be led by a principal Investigator. Per 21 CFR 56. 102, an Investigator is “an individual 
who actually conducts a clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subj ect) or, in the event of an investigation conducted by a 
team of individuals, is the responsible leader of that team.”  Specific responsibilities of the principal investigator are 
described in 21 CFR 812.100 and in the FDA guidance document dated October, 2009 (see Regulatory Binder).

Investigational Center will be responsible for making adequate source documentation available to  the sponsor to verify subject eligibility.  
 General 
Standard Care: 
It is expected that subjects will continue to undergo their routine diabetes care as 
per clinic standard.  During routine quar terly visits data collection for the study 
will be obtained by the designated staff.  
 
General  
Investigational Center staff will: 
 Obtain informed consent/Assent from subject/parent/caregiver  
o Subjects 7-15 years should provide assent in addition to Informed 
Consent from parent/caregiver 
 Assess eligibility of subjects to participate in the study 
 Collect demographic information and baseline characteristics, including 
age, gender, race, ethnicity and medical diagnosis, duration of diabetes 
(Screening eCRF). 
 Record concomitant medications on appropriate CRF 
 Obtain blood sample(s) to complete required screening A1C test, if all 
eligibility criteria (excluding those in volving blood test results) are met: 
Note: All collected blood specimens will be sent to and tested by a 
NGSP certified Central Laboratory.  A1C testing must follow 
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) standards. This A1C will be used for data analysis. 
 Obtain blood samples to complete required screening tests, i.e.TSH (also 
T3, T4 if TSH is abnormal), Creatinine 
 Perform screening labs including urine or serum pregnancy test 
 Subjects may be rescreened up to a maximum of two times if they do not 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of their original screening 
 Register subjects in CareLink Cl inical (see Investigator/Coordinator 
binder for details) and upload insulin pump 
 Disburse devices and supplies (e.g., pump, transmitter, glucose sensors, 
Bayer meter, meter strips, ketone strips) to each study subject  
 Administer the following questionnaires: 
o Hypoglycemia awareness questionnaire 
 Score of 4 or more is impaired awareness. It means that 
subjects with this score will be assigned to the impaired hypoglycemic awareness cohort.  
 Score of 3 or less is aware.  It means that subjects with 
this score will be assigned to the intact hypoglycemic awareness cohort. 
o EQ-5D Youth  
o Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS) – Child/Teen  
o Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS) – Parent 
 
 Tell subject/parent/caregiver that they should call site as soon as possible

 Enter eCRFs into the study database as appropriate. 
 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 27 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. Device Disbursement 
Investigational Center staff will: 
 Disburse devices and supplies (e.g., pump, transmitter, glucose sensors, 
Bayer meter, meter strips, ketone strips)  
 
Training and Instructions 
Notes:  
1. All device training for this study should be consistent with the training 
plan in place for patients who receive a new study pump system 
through commercial channels.  
a. Subjects should only use the Bayer meter  
2. Training on study procedures will be performed  
Designated Training staff will: 
 Train subject/parent/caregiver on the use of the Medtronic study pump.  
o Subject/parent/caregiver will be instructed to record carbohydrate 
intake and exercise into the insulin pump as part of the study requirements
  
 Train subject/parent/caregiver on how to upload the pumps as part of 
study requirements.  
o Uploads of all study pumps into CareLink Clinical should occur 
every 21 days throughout the study.  
o Subject/parent/caregiv er will receive an automated reminder (e-
mail, text, or voice message) twice a month to remind them to 
upload pumps. 
o In addition to the 21 day upload requirement, 
subject/parent/caregiver will be instructed to upload the pumps prior to each study visit. Investigational Center staff will again upload pump data at the time of the visit. 
 Instruct subject/parent/caregiver per User Guide to calibrate the study 
pump at least every 12 hours after the second calibration.  For best calibration results per User Guide,  subject/parent/caregiver will be 
instructed to calibrate 3-4 times, spread throughout the day.  
 Instruct subject/parent/caregiver to use the Bayer Contour Link meter for 
all calibrations 
 Instruct subject/parent/caregiver to test blood glucose per User Guide at 
least 4 times per day 
o Although the pump has multiple safe ty alarms, it cannot notify the 
subject if the set is leaking or the insulin has lost its potency. It is 
essential, therefore, that the subj ect test his or her blood glucose 
levels at least 4 times per day. If the subject’s blood glucose is out of range, he/she should check the pump and the infusion set 
to ensure that the necessary amount of insulin is being delivered. 
 Instruct subject/parent/caregiver on the use of the Sensor dislodgement 
Diary 
 
o Subject/parent/caregiv er will be instructed to record sensor 
dislodgement occurrences in the Sensor dislodgement Diary. 
 Discuss glucose sensor wear requirement.  
o Glucose sensors should be worn throughout the course of the 
study 
 Train subject/parent/caregiver on the use of CareLink Clinical which 
includes that this application should only be used to upload the study pump and not for data analysis or diabetes management.  
 Instruct subject/parent/caregiver to use either Humalog or Novolog 
insulin 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 28 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date.  Instruct subject/parent/caregiver to  contact the Medtronic 24hr HelpLine 
in the event they experience pr oblems with their study devices. 
 Instruct subject/parent/c aregiver to test for ur ine ketones daily and to 
record results in CareLink Clinical.  
o Urine ketone test strips will be provided by sponsor free of charge 
to subjects.  
o The urine ketone strips will not be tracked by sponsor. 
 Instruct subject/parent/c aregiver to report all adverse events as soon as 
possible. This would include any new medical problem or deterioration of 
an existing medical problem, such as sickness or glycemic problems. If 
necessary refer subject/parent/caregive r to the subject’s own providers 
or an emergency facility for treatment.

 Enter eCRFs into the study database as appropriate 
 “Remove and return all study devices and supplies from subjects 
per Section 11 of the protocol.” 
 Discharge subject from the study 
 Return or Disposal of Study Devices 
 At the end of Visit 5, the investigatio nal center is expected to accept and 
retain all devices as described in Table 2 and store them in a secure 
environment. If containers/units/dev ices are missing, document the 
reasons in the eCRF. If discrepancies between amounts used by 
subjects and amounts expected to be returned exist, document the 
reasons in the eCRF.  
 All devices, as described in table 2, will be returned by subjects to the 
investigational center and then to t he sponsor.  Devices provided to the 
investigational center may be returned as subjects complete the study, at 
the end of study or upon sponsor requ est. The quantity received by the 
investigational center and the quantity returned to sponsor should be equal. The investigational center will provide details of the disposition of all unreturned devices in the eCRF.  
 
Used glucose sensors are not expected to be returned by subjects to the investigational center and therefore are not expected to be returned to 
the sponsor.  
 
Other consumable devices (i.e., reservoirs, infusion sets, alcohol wipes, 
Study Meter supplies, overtape, et c.), supplies or materials may be 
returned to the sponsor or retained by investigational center for 
educational purposes only, or may be disposed of properly by the 
investigational center staff.    
Disposable devices and supplies that have been used by a subject will 
be disposed of properly by the subject or the investigational center staff 
during the conduct of the study. Th is would include glucose sensors, 
meter testing strips and supplies, reservoirs, infusion sets and adhesive overtape.    
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 31 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. All study devices that were requir ed to be entered into the study 
database are required to be accounted for as described herein prior to 
return to sponsor or at the end of the study.  
10.6 Minimizing subject withdrawal  
It may be reasonable to expect that subjects will not consistently comply with study requirements during the study. In this study, continuous sensor wear is a key component in the collection of TS safety data.  
For this reason, the strategy will be to select in vestigational centers that  have the experience and 
expertise to manage subjects for an extended period of time in the context of a clinical study. 
Furthermore, as a means of providing encour agement to study subjects, the following will be 
implemented: 
Subjects will be provided  devices and supplies (e.g., glucose sensors, meter strips, ketone strips) that 
need replenishing free of charge  at every study visit.  
 
10.7 Subject Withdrawal  
Subject/parent/caregiver may choose to withdraw from  the study at any time by  notifying Investigational 
Center staff of their intent.  
 
If a subject chooses to end his or her study participati on or if a subject is removed from the study at the 
Investigator’s discretion, the reason for terminati on must be documented both in source documents and 
on the appropriate eCRF.  
 
A subject will be withdraw n from the study by the investigator if: 
 
 In the opinion of the Investigator, the subjec t’s health or safety would be compromised by 
continuing in the study 
 In the opinion of the Investigator, it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue participation 
in the study 
 During the course of the study, subject has 2 ep isodes of DKA (see definition in section 14.4) 
 During the course of the study, subject exper iences 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia  
 During the course of the study, subject begins abusing illicit drugs.  
 During the course of the study subject begins abusing prescription drugs.  
 During the course of the study subject begins abusing alcohol. 
 During the course of the study subject begins using pramlintide (Symlin).     
 During the course of the study, subject receives red blood cell transfusion or erythropoietin.       
 During the course of the study, subject takes any oral, injectable, or IV steroids. 
 
Documentation of the reason( s) leading to subject withdrawal will be  kept in the subject’s source file. 
10.8 Study Closure  
Upon completion of the study, when all subjects hav e completed their visit schedules, all eCRFs have 
been entered and all related queries have been resolved, Medtronic and/or its designees will notify the 
Investigational Center of its intention to close out the study and a close-out visit will be conducted.    The 
Monitor will ensure that the Investigator’s regula tory files are up-to-date and complete and that any 
outstanding issues from previous visi ts have been resolved. Othe r issues that will be reviewed at this visit 
include discussing retention of study files, possibility of Investigational Center audits, and notifying the 
IRB of study closure.

The investigational center will promptly notify the sponsor of any device hand ling violation that might 
impact either the safety and welfare of subjects or data integrity. 
 Please note that study devices which were provided to subjects through commercial channels (ie. Early 
protocol version which allowed study devices thr ough commercial channels)  do not apply to device 
accountability section.     
12. Quality Assurance and Control 
12.1 Monitoring Plan 
Monitoring will be conducted to ensure the protection and safety of human subjects, the quality and 
integrity of the clinical data, and compliance with the protocol.  The Monitoring Plan will be updated and 
revised as needed due to changes in documents or processes.  The review of processes and documents 
will be ongoing throughout the course of the study. Th e most recent version of the Monitoring Plan will 
take precedence over any previous versions.  
 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 34 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. Employees of the Sponsor, or its designees, who have received appropriate training, will serve as the 
Study Monitor(s). Monitoring visits will be conducted based on Medtronic’s Standard Operating 
Procedures and the needs of the study. Quality documents will be fo llowed for the conduct of all activities 
related to monitoring for this study.    
 
Site Qualification and Initiation Visits will be complete d prior to enrollment of the first subject.  Interim 
study monitoring activities will include an inspection  of completed study docu ments, source document 
verification and reporting, verification of database ac curacy and completeness.  All subjects enrolled in 
the trial will be monitored and the eCRF data verifi ed against the subjects’ source documents.  Following 
each monitoring visit, a report will be prepared and submi tted to the Sponsor.  From initiation of the study 
to the final close out visit, the Study Monitor(s) will assume primary respon sibility for communications 
between the Study Investigators and the Sponsor. 
 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that Investigational Center staff is appropriately 
trained to manage the protocol.  Initial and ongoing Inve stigational Center training will be provided during 
the Site Initiation Visit, subsequent monitoring visits , and regular Investigational Center contact.  All 
Investigational Center staff must complete and si gn the Study Training Record(s) and maintain the 
record(s) in the Investigational Center regulatory bi nder.  Prior to enrollment of the first subject, all 
Investigators and study coordinators who will be part icipating in enrollment, eCRF completion, device 
insertion/application, device training, and consen ting subjects must complete the Sponsor-required 
training. 
 
All monitoring visits and visits from the Sponsor to the Investigational Center will be recorded using the 
Site Visit Sign-In Log and co-signed by Investigational Center staff.  The log will be kept in the Investigational Center regulatory binder and the original will collected at the end of the study and 
submitted to the sponsor.  
12.2 Quality Audits 
Medtronic reserves the right to conduct quality audits at the Investigational Centers in order to verify 
adherence to external regulations as well as inte rnal policies and procedures, to assess adequacy and 
effectiveness of clinical policies and procedures, to assure compliance with critical study document 
requirements, to confirm integrity and accuracy of c linical study data and to protect the safety, rights and 
welfare of study subjects. 
12.3 Investigational Center Disqualification  
Medtronic and/or the IRB retain the right to disqua lify an Investigational Center and remove all study 
materials at any time. Specific instances, which may precipitate Investigational Center disqualification, 
include but are not limited to:  
 Unsatisfactory subject enrollment  with regard to quality and quantity. 
 Persistent non-compliance to protocol procedur es on the part of an Investigator/Investigational 
Center. Inaccurate, incomplete, and/or untimely data recording on a recurrent basis. 
 The incidence and/or severity of adverse experiences  in this or other studies indicating a potential 
health hazard caused by the device. 
 
A written statement fully documenting the reasons for such a termination will be provided to Medtronic, 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other regulatory authorities, as required. 
12.4 Protocol Deviations  
A deviation is any instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unint entionally, the requirements of the 
protocol. It is expected that the Investigator will conduct this clinical tr ial in compliance with the protocol 
and all applicable regulations governing the conduct of clinical research involv ing human subjects. Failure 
to do so could result in one or all of the following:  
 observation in the monitoring report 
 deviation to document the event 
 corrective action plan 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 35 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date.  site disqualification  
 notification to the regulatory authorities depending on the severity of the deviation  
 
The investigator is responsible for protecting the safe ty and welfare of the clinical research subjects.   
 
Compliance with Protocol:  
The Investigator or person designated by the invest igator will document and explain any deviation from 
the approved protocol that occurs du ring the course of the clinical trial. The date and reason for each 
deviation will be documented. (CFR 21 812.140 Records)  
 The investigator should not implement any deviation fr om, or changes of, the protocol without agreement 
by the sponsor and prior review and documented ap proval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of an 
amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative as pects of the trial (e.g., change of monitor(s), change 
of telephone number(s)). 
 
The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion. As soon as possible, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted: 
 
(a) To the IRB/IEC for review and approval/favorable opinion; (b) To the sponsor for agreement and, if required; 
(c) To the regulatory authority(ies). 
 
21 CFR 812.150 (4) states “….except in such an emergency, prior approval by the sponsor is required for changes in or deviations from a plan, and if thes e changes or deviations may affect the scientific 
soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or we lfare of human subjects, FDA and IRB in accordance 
with 21 CFR 812.35(a) also is required”.   
 
Emergency deviations must be reported to the spon sor and IRB within 5 days. The following examples 
are deviations that could impact subject safety, affect  the integrity of study data and/or affect subject’s 
willingness to participate in the study. These deviat ions are significant and require immediate sponsor 
notification upon investigator awareness:  
 
 
 Failure to obtain informed consent, i.e., ther e is no documentation of informed consent 
 Informed consent obtained after initiation of study procedures 
 Enrollment of a subject who did not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Performing study procedur e not approved by the IRB 
 Failure to report serious adverse event to the IRB and sponsor 
 Investigational study device dispens ed without obtaining informed consent 
 
13. Device Complaints and Troubleshooting 
 
The Medtronic 24 Hour Help Line (HL) or appropriate investigational center staff will be consulted for 
device troubleshooting (e.g. assistance is nee ded by subject to operate their device(s)). If 
subject/parent/caregivers call the HL, they are instructed to notify the HL operator that they are currently 
participating in a clinical research study. All device complaints that are r eported to the HL will be 
documented by the HL staff.  
 
The investigational center will be provided with a copy  of all HL calls for their subjects. The HL calls 
should be reviewed for investigational center staff awareness for the possib ility of an AE. If an AE is 
detected the investigational center staff will also complete an AE eCRF.   
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 36 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date.  
All device deficiencies reported directly to the invest igational center staff by a subject should either be 
reported to the HL by the subject or investigational center staff. A device deficiency is any communication 
that alleges inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, 
or performance. NOTE: Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
 All Device returns will follow the 24 HL procedures. To return a study device as part of a complaint the 
investigational center and or subject are to call the 24 HL.   Descriptive discussion of device performance is sues and complaints will be performed.   
 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to abide by the device malfunction & complaint reporting requirements stipulated by the reviewing IRB and the sponsor.

Department, in Northridge, California will monitor and manage adverse event reporting for the study.  
 A complete description of the event including treatment and interventions provided by medical 
professionals will be included on the AE eCRF. It is expecte d that the investigator will provide the sponsor 
with the necessary medical records to support the adverse event.  
Throughout the co urse of the study, Investigatio nal Center staff will make all efforts to remain alert to 
possible reportable adverse events or untoward fi ndings. Reports of adverse events will be requested 
from subjects/parents/caregivers at each visit and adverse event eCRFs will be completed as required. 
Investigational Center staff will assess the intensity of each adverse event and its relationship to study 
procedures or devices. 
 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 38 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. Adverse events that are assessed to have a relationship to a study procedure or study device will be 
analyzed by the Human Factors group at Medtronic Diabetes to determine whether or not there is a 
connection to mis-use of the device(s) or user error.   
 
Events that are moderate and severe in intensity, all SAE, SADE and UADE that have not resolved at the 
time of the subject’s discontinuation or completion of  the study will be followed until the medical outcome 
is determined or until no further change in the condit ion is expected. All adverse events that have not 
resolved will have a final status of ‘ongoing’. 
Adverse Events reported to sponsor: 
The Investigator or designee will repo rt all adverse event s to the sponsor: 
 
 Adverse Events not related to the study device or study procedure 
 Adverse Events related to the study device 
 Adverse Events related to study procedures 
 UADE (Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect) 
 All SAE (Serious Adverse Events) 
 Severe Hypoglycemia 
 DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis) 
 A pre-existing medical condition will only be document ed as an adverse event if the condition worsens 
during the course of the subject’s participation in  the study. Non-serious Adverse events should be 
entered on the appropriate Electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF) within 14 days of subject report to the 
site. For serious adverse events, reporting is require d to sponsor within 24 hours of site awareness.  
14.3 Review of Severe Hypoglycemia and DKA.  
Severe hypoglycemia, and DKA will be adjudica ted by the Clinical events committee (CEC) 
comprised of external physicians.  The adjudi cation will include device relatedness and whether 
the event was considered to be serious or not. The CEC may use Carelink reports, medical 
records and information on CRF to make determination.   
14.4 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  (ISO14155: 2011) 
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or  injury, or untoward clinical signs (including 
abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or  other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device. Note 1: This definition includes events related to t he investigational medical device or the comparator. 
Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical 
devices. 
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) (ISO 14155: 2011) 
Any untoward and unintended response to a medical device.  
Note 1: This includes any adverse event resulting from  insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use, the deployment, the implantation, the inst allation, the operation, or any malfunction of the 
medical device. 
 Note 2: This includes any event that is a re sult of a use error or intentional misuse.   
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  (ISO 14155: 2011) 
An adverse event that  
(a) Led to a death 
(b) Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 39 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date.  resulted in life threatening illness or injury, 
 resulted in a permanent impairment of  a body structure or a body function 
 required in-patient hospitalization* or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 resulted in medical or surgical intervention to  prevent permanent impairment to a body structure 
or a body function  
(c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
*Inpatient Hospitalization is defined as: 24 hour ac ute admission to the hospital based on urgent medical 
need rather than elective admission. 
Note: A planned hospitalization for pre-existing conditi on, or a procedure required by the CIP, without a 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a serious adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)  (ISO 14155: 2011) 
Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of t he consequences characteristic of a serious adverse 
event.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) (21 CFR 812.3(s)) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, 
or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem as sociated with a device that  relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of subjects. 
 
Severe Hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person (due to altered consciousness) 
to actively administer carbohydrate, gluc agon, or other resuscitative actions.  
This means that the subject was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat his or 
her self, was unable to verbalize his or her needs, and was incoherent, disori ented and/or combative. 
 These episodes may be associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma. Plasma glucose measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery attributable 
to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is  considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration.  (adapted from the
 American Diabetes Association 
Workgroup on Hypoglycemia, 2005)   
 
“Severe Hyperglycemia” is defined as Hyperglycemia (blood glucose >300  mg/dL ) with blood glucose 
ketones >0.6mmol/L or accompanied by symptoms of nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. 
 
“Diabetic Ketoacidosis/DKA” is defined as: Hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL or 
greater than 13.9 mmol/L) with either low serum bi carbonate (less than 15 mEq/L) and/or low pH (less 
than or equal to 7.24) Anion gap (greater than 12) and either ketonemia or ketonuria and requiring 
treatment within a health -care facility. (American Diabetes Associati on-Diabetes Care, Volume 27, 
Supplement 1, January 2004 ) 
14.5 Device or Procedure Relatedness:  
The relatedness of the event to the study device or procedures will be determined for each adverse 
event. Subjects participating in this study have type 1 diabetes and it is expect ed that due to the disease 
subjects will have adverse ev ents that are part of thei r disease. It is expected th at the investigator will 
assess all events to determine if the event was related to the disease or  if the event was related to the 
device or study procedure. An adverse event is not au tomatically related to the study device or procedure 
simply because the subject is wearing the device and participating in the study. The event should be 
reviewed to determine if the device or study procedure could have possibly caused the event and 
therefore is related to the study device or procedure.   
The investigator will review all elements surroundi ng the event to properly determine relatedness – this 
would include the subjects/parents/caregivers de scription of the event, study device downloads and 
medical records (if applicable) from the treating fa cility. These records will be made available to the 
CEP287 Version: C Medtronic Confidential Page 40 of 44 
This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. sponsor and the Clinical Events Committee at the request of the sponsor. The following definitions should 
be considered when determining the relationship of  the event to the device or study procedure: 
 
Definite – clearly related to the device or procedure 
Probable – likely related to the device or procedure 
Possible – may be related to the device or procedure Unlikely – doubtfully related to the device or procedure 
Not Related – clearly not related to the device or procedure 
 If the investigator determines the ev ent meets the definition of definit e, probable or possible the event 
should be considered related and the Yes box on the AE eCRF would be checked for the question related to. If the investigator determines the event meets th e definition of unlikely, not  related or unknown the 
event should be considered unrelated and the NO  box would be checked on the AE eCRF for the 
question was the event related to.  
14.6 Event Intensity (severity):  
Mild:  Transient, needing no special treatment, and/or does not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activity.  Moderate: Low level of inconvenience or concern to  the subject and may interfere with daily 
activities, but is usually improved by simple therapeutic remedy.  
Severe*:  Interrupts a subject’s daily activity and typically requires intervening treatment. 
 
Please Note*: The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  Severe is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific ev ent (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial 
infarction); the event itself, however, may be of rela tively minor medical significance (such as severe 
headache). This is NOT the same as “serious” whic h is based on the definition of “serious criteria” 
which have been provided.  
14.7 Clinical Events Committee  
A clinical events committee consisting of external physicians with an expertise in Endocrinology and the 
management of Type 1 diabetes including CGM will be convened. The CEC will review all reports of: 
 Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
 Severe Hypoglycemia 
 Serious Adverse Event 
 Serious Adverse Device Effect 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
 
The CEC will assess these events to determine agree ment or disagreement with the investigator 
determination of the event. The investigator will be notified of any disagreem ent in assessment of an 
event by the CEC.

15. Administrative Considerations 
15.1 Document Storage and Retention  
The Sponsor and Investigator will retain all records and documents pertaining to this study. They will be 
available for inspection by the appropriate regulatory agencies. In addition, the Investigator will retain the 
source documents from which the information entered  on the eCRF was derived. These records are to be 
retained in a secure storage facility maintained by the Investigational Center until 2 years after approval of 
the above-listed study devices or term ination of the study, whichever is longer. The Investigator should 
not dispose of these records wi thout the approval of the Sponsor . 
15.2 Data Handling  
All data required for analysis will be captured on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) using Oracle Clinical’s 21 CFR Part 11 compliant Remote Data  Capture (RDC) module. Original eCRFs will not be 
used as source data and supporting documentati on will be required. Electronic device data will be 
collected from the study pump using Medtronic CareLi nk Clinical, which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.  
 
The Investigator will ensure that all eCRFs are completed promptly, completely, and accurately. 
Information on case report forms must conform to the information in the source documents.  Medtronic 
will provide detailed instructions to assist with CRF completion. In the event of data discrepancies, 
Investigational Centers will be asked to resolve que ries electronically in the RDC system; otherwise, 
irresolvable data-related issues will be routed to the S ponsor for review and final disposition. An audit trail 
is maintained in Oracle Clinical to capture any corrections or changes  of the eCRFs. System backups for 
data stored in the Oracle Clinical system will be consistent with Medtr onic standard procedures.

This document is electronically controlled. Printed co pies are considered uncontrolled past the print date. Medtronic will only consider eCRFs to be comple te when all discrepancies between source data and 
eCRF have been resolved and eCRF content has been re viewed by a Study Monitor. In addition, specific 
eCRFs must also be reviewed and electronically sign ed by the Investigator, indicating his/her agreement 
with the accuracy of all recorded data. It is expected that the Investigator and his/her staff will cooperate 
with the monitoring team and provide any missing data in a timely manner. 
15.3 Data Preparation  
Prior to data extraction, all collected data will undergo a final verification by Data Management.  Documentation of this verification will be maintained in the sponsor study files.   Upon the completion of 
the verification, data will be extracted and transferred to the appropriate personnel for analysis.   
15.4 Training of Clinical Staff  
Training of the Investigational Center staff on the conduct of the study and system being studied will be 
initiated before the protocol is implemented.  All participating physicians and coordinators will be 
familiarized with the system. Specific Investigationa l Center staff will be trained on each of the system’s 
components. Training will contain both lecture a nd hands-on experience. 
15.5 Study Binders  
A Regulatory Binder and an Investigator/Coordinator  Manual will be provided by the Sponsor to be 
maintained by Investigational Center staff.  At a minimum, each Regulatory Binder will include: 
 
 Study Contact Sheet

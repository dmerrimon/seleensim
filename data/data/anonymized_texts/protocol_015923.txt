PRODUCT NAME/NUMBER: TLC599 (Lipid-based Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Sustained Release 
Formulation) 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: TLC599A3005 
DEVELOPMENT PHASE: Phase 3 
PROTOCOL TITLE: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-and Active-controlled Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety ofTLC599 in Patients with Osteoarthritis of the Knee 
INDICATION: Osteoarthritis of the knee 
PLANNED STUDY SITES: Approximately 45 to 50 study sites in the United States and Australia 
OBJECTIVES 
Primary Objective : 
• To evaluate the efficacy ofa single intra-articular (IA) dose ofTLC599 in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) 
of the knee 
Secondary Objective s: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of repeat doses ofTLC59 9 in patients with OA of the knee 
• To evaluate the safety of single and repeat IA doses of TLC599 in patients with OA of the knee 
RATIONALE 
Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disorder of the articular cartilage associated with hypertrophic 
bone changes. Treatmen t for OA primarily involves a non-pharmacological combination of exercise and lifestyle 
modification, pharmacological treatment, supplementation with glucosamine or chondroitin sulphate, and 
surgical joint replacement. Among pharmacological treatments, corticosteroids have both anti-inflammatory and 
anti-angiogenic properties , and they are routinely given via inject IA injection for the treatment of chronic knee 
joint diseases to relieve pain, reduce inflammat ion, and improve mobility. 
IA corticosteroid injection is a commonly used treatment with an excellent safety profile. A limitation of IA 
injection with corticosteroids is the modest duration of treatment effect, which often lasts for only 2 to 4 weeks. 
Repeat injections are possible in the same joint, but there are limited data on the safety and duration of the 
effectiveness of this procedure. Thus, there is a pressing need for a more sustained duration of an IA 
corticosteroid injection. 
Taiwan Liposome Company (TLC) is developing TLC599, a sustained release liposomal formulation of 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) for the treatment of OA. DSP, an injectable form of dexamethasone, is 
formulated with lipid excipients to allow a sustained release of DSP lo maintain therapeutic concentrations of 
dexamelhasone in the joint space for an extended period of time. The formulation of TLC599 is specifically 
designed to provide both immediate-release DSP and long-acting Iiposomal form of DSP, providing both 
short-term and sustained pain and symptom relief for up to 6 months in patients with knee OA pain. To date, 
TLC has completed 2 studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single-dose IA injection of TLC599 in 
patients with knee OA. Based on data from both trials, TLC599 with 12 mg DSP demonstrated a rapid onset of 
OA pain and symptom relief, with sustained therapeutic benefit up to 6 months with a single IA injection. 
METHODOLOGY 
Study Design: 
• This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active comparator-controlled pivotal study . 
• Efficacy and safety of2 doses ofTLC599 will be evaluated in comparison with Placebo and DSP through 
Week 52. 
• Approximately 500 adult patients with moderate to severe pain due to OA of the knee will be randomized 
in a 2: I: I ratio to receive TLC599 12 mg (Group A), DSP 4 mg (Group B), or Placebo (normal saline) 
(Group C) via IA injection into the designated index knee at Baseline (Injection I). 
• At Week 24, patients will receive blinded Injection 2 per their randomly assigned dosing regimen (Group 
A, B, or C) via IA injection into the index knee. Patients who received TLC599 12 mg (Group A) or DSP 
(Group B) for Injection I will receive blinded TLC599 I 2 mg for Injection 2 and those who received Placebo 
for Injection I (Group C) will receive Placebo for Injection 2.

• All patients will be followed for a total of 52 weeks, regardless of whether or not they receive Injection 2. 
Patients who do not receive Injection 2 at the Week 24 Visit will be encouraged to continue in the study 
through the entire 52 weeks of follow-up.

Study Procedure s: 
• Patients will be screened for eligibility at Visit I (Screening); procedures will include, but is not limited to, 
medical history and concomitant medication review, knee pain assessments , knee radiographs, physical 
examination, and clinical laboratory assessments. Initial eligibility for pain in each knee will be assessed 
using a patient-reported numeric rating scale (NRS) (rating of average pain over the previous 24 hours). 
• Patients will be trained on the use of diaries, accurate pain reporting, and appropriate expectations for a 
clinical trial. 
• During the screening period, patients will complete daily diaries including assessme nts of pain in each knee 
by NRS as well as rescue medication use. Every evening, patients must score their average pain in each knee 
by NRS over the previous 24 hours. The diary must be completed for at least 5 of the last 7 days of the 
screening period before returning to the study site for Visit 2 (Baseline/Day I). 
• At Visit 2 (Baseline/Day I), after baseline assessments, eligibility will be confirmed and the index knee will 
be determined, and eligible patients will be randomized in a 2: I: I ratio lo receive TLC599 12 mg (Group A), 
DSP 4 mg (Group B), or Placebo (Group C) via IA injection into the index knee (Injection I). 
• Patients will return to the study site at Week 1, Week 2. Week 4, and every 4 weeks through Week 24 to 
complete efficacy and safety assessme nts as applicable. 
• At Week 24, patients (see Criteria for Injection 2 [Week 24)) will receive blinded Injection 2 via IA injection 
into the index knee according to their randomly assigned dosing regimen: TLC599 12 mg (Groups A and 
B) or Placebo (Group C). 
• Patients will continue to return to the study site every 4 weeks through Week 52 to complete efficacy and 
safety assessments as applicable. 
• Patients who receive Injection 2 al Week 24 will also return to the study site at I week (Week 25) and 
2 weeks (Week 26) after Injection 2. 
• Patients who do not receive Injection 2 will continue to be followed through Week 52. Patients who do not 
complete the study through Week 52 will complete early termination procedures. 
VISIT STRUCTURE: There will be up to 19 study visits, including Screening (Visit I), Baseline 
(Day I/Visit 2), Week I (Visit 3), Week 2 (Visit 4), and 6 visits occwTing every 4 weeks from Week 4 (Visit 5) 
through Week 24 (Visit 10), Week 25 (Visit 11), Week 26 (Visit 12), and every 4 weeks from Week 28 (Visit 
13) through Week 52 (Visit 19). Week 25 (Visit 11) and Week 26 (Visit 12) will only be required for patients 
who receive Injection 2 at Week 24 (Visit I 0). 
STUDY DURATION: Duration of patient participation will be up to 56 weeks, including a Screening period 
of up to 4 weeks before randomization, Injection I Period of24 weeks and Injection 2 Period of28 weeks.

STATISTICAL METHODS 
General Statistical Consideration s: Confidential 
All efficacy and safety data will be listed and descriptively summarized by injection (Injection 1 or Injection 2) 
and treatment group (Group A, B, or C). Continuous variable summaries will include the number of patients, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum , and maximum. Categorica l 
variables will include the frequency and percentage of patients in each category. All statistical assessme nts will 
be 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
Database lock and unblinding will occur after the last patient in the study has completed the study. 
Analysis Populations: 
• Safety Population (SAF): The Safety Population includes all patients who receive any dose of study drug; 
the population will be determined for each study period. The SAF population will be the primary 
population for safety evaluation. 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS includes all randomized patients who receive Injection I. The 
FAS population will be the primary population for efficacy analysis. as well as for descriptive summarie s 
other than safety (demographic and baseline. disposition, protocol deviations. medical history, etc.). 
• Per Protocol Population (PP): The PP Population includes all patients who receive 2 doses of study drug, 
have primary efficacy evaluation at Weeks 12. 24. and 36. and do not have important protocol deviations 
affecting primary efficacy evaluation. 
• Modified Per Protocol (mPP): The mPP Population includes all patients who receive the first dose of 
study drug. have primary efficacy evaluation at Weeks 12 and 24, and do not have important protocol 
deviations affecting primary efficacy evaluation. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
Analysis of Primmy and Key Seconda1y Endpoints: 
Efficacy variables will be descriptively summarized by treatment group and by injection period within each 
group, based on the FAS population. unless otherwise specified. For all the continuous variables. the normalized 
numbers will be used for analysis, where applicable, unless otherwise specified. 
The overall type I en-or rate will be controlled for primary and key secondary endpoints using hierarchical testing 
based on a fixed-seque nce procedure . If statistical significance is declared for the primary analysis. formal 
statistical inference will continue at the 0.05 level for the secondary endpoints in the defined sequence until a 
non-significant result is reached. All other P values from key secondary endpoints, after a non-significant P value 
is reached, as well as other additional endpoints. will be considered exploratory. 
An analysis of covariance (AN COVA) model with treatment group as fixed effect and baseline value of the 
endpoint (when applicable) as covariates will be perforrned for the primary and key secondary continuous 
endpoints. 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to estimate sensitivity estimators and to assess the robustness of efficacy 
results. 
Additiona l Endpoints: 
Additiona l endpoints and subgroup analyses will also be tested at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level. 
The analysis of all continuous and categorical additional endpoints will be performed using an A NCO YA model

Safety Analvsis: Confidential 
Safety variables include physical examination, vital signs assessments (heart rate, respiratory rate, sitting blood 
pressure, and temperature), clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry. urinalysis), HbA I c, 
morning serum cortisol, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). knee radiograp hs, 
concomitant medications/therapies, AEs, and signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Medical history and 
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and concomitant 
medication will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug (WHO Drug) Global Dictionary. 
Continuous safety data will be summarized by visit and include changes from baseline. Continuous data will 
also be converted to categorical values where possible (i.e., below, within, and above normal ranges) and 
summarized in shift from baseline tables. Categorical safety data collected by visit will be summarized showing 
the counts and percentages in each category at each visit, as well as shifts from baseline as appropriate. 
Interim Analysis: 
An interim analysis will not be performed. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
This is a 3-arm parallel-group randomized controlled study. Approximately 500 patients will be randomized in 
According to these assumptions. 500 patients will be randomly assigned in a 2: I: I ratio to ensure that the study 
is well powered for primary and key secondary endpoints to be tested via the fixed-sequence testing method.

a Screening procedures may occur at any time during the Screening period unless otherwise specified . Patients who fail screening because of a mild infectious illness present 
at the Baseline or Screening, may be rescreened after the infection has resolved with approval of the medical monitor. Documented diagnosis ofOA in the index knee can 
be completed as part of study screening. 
b Patients who cannot attend the Week 24 visit within the visit window because of restrictions resulting from COYID-19 , will be encouraged to return to the site before 
Week 28 to complete the Week 24 visit assessments , if feasible. However, Injection 2 may only be administered within the allowed visit window. 
c These procedures and visits (Week 25 and Week 26) are only required for patients who receive Injection 2 and will take place at 1 and 2 weeks after Injection 2, 
respectively . 
d Visit 3 (Week I) to Visit 19 (Week 52) should occur at the specified time point relative to Visit 2 (Day I/Baseline), except Visit 11(Week25) and Visit 12 (Weck 26). 
e Heart rate, respiratory rate, sitting blood pressure, and temperature will be measured after the patient has been in a sitting position for 5 minutes. 
f A posterior-anterior X-ray radiograph will be performed for both knees in standing fixed-flexion (approximately 20 degrees), as applicable. For the Week 24 and Week 52 
visits, the posterior-anterior X-ray radiograph may be performed within 14 days before the visit. 
g The 12-lead ECG will be performed after the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes. 
h If the patient is potentially eligible based on currently available data except laboratory abnormalities , the assessme nts may be repeated once only to reassess eligibility. 
Only glucose (fasted state) will be tested in the Visit 2 (Baseline) visit before 9 AM and before study drug administra tion (Injection I). 
Pregnancy tests perfonned only for women of childbearing potential . Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at Screening; urine pregnancy tests will be perfonned before 
dosing at Visit 2 (Baseline/Day I) and Visit I 0 (Week 24, only required for patients receiving Injection 2); and performed at EOS (Week 52) or ET. 
k Serum samples for measurement of cortisol should be collected before 9 AM (and before study drug administration for !Jtjection 1 and lnjection 2 at Visit 2 [Day I] and 
Visit I Q_[Week 24 l, respectively). A ~erum cortisol_yalue <l_µg/dL ~Scree ning cannot be retested. 
m Training and assessment of knowledge on pain ratings, allowable rescue medication, and entering data into the diary will be conducted at Screening, Baseline, Week 12, 
Week 24, and Week 36; and as needed throughout the study. 
n A diary will be used daily to collect responses from patients on index knee pain over the previous 24 hours. Training regarding entering data into the diary will be given. 
Patients will first be asked to score their average pain in each knee by NRS over the previous 24 hours at the initial Screening visit. After the first Screening visit (Visit I), 
the diary must be completed for each knee in the evening daily for at least 5 of the last 7 days of the screening period before returning to the study site for Visit 2 
(Day I/Baseline). After randomization , the patient will record their response on index knee pain in the diary every evening throughout the study until the last day prior to the 
EOS/ET visit. Sites should monitor patient compliance of diary entries regularly throughout the 52 weeks. If a patient is not compliant, the site should contact the patient as 
soon as non-compli ance is observed . 
o Procedures for those receiving Injection 2. The patient should be checked for the criteria listed in Section 6.6.3 before study drug administratio n. 
p Initial rescue medication bottle will be dispensed at Screening and as needed. Between Screening and EOS/ET, patients will record the previous 24-hour use of 
acetaminophen rescue medication daily into the diary. Rescue medication will be reviewed at every study visit.

4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background and Rationale Confidential 
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disorder of the articular cartilage associated 
with hypertrophic bone changes. Treatment for OA primarily involves a non-pharmacological 
combination of exercise and lifestyle modification , pharmacological treatment, supplementati on 
with glucosamine or chondroitin sulphate, and surgical joint replacement. Among pharmacological 
treatment s, corticosteroids have both anti-inflamm atory and anti-angiogenic properties, and they 
are routinely given via inject intra-aiticular (IA) injection for the treatment of chronic knee joint 
diseases to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and improve mobility. There are several Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved corticosteroids for IA use, including dexamethasone, 
methylprednisolone, betamethasone , and triamcinolone. However , when effective, the mean 
duration of benefit may be relatively short, often lasting for only 2 to 4 weeks. 1 Furthermore , 
repeated injections of corticosteroids may increase the risk of local and systemic side effects, 
including pericapsular calcification, tendon rupture, skin atrophy/depigmentation , steroid 
arthropathy, joint infection, facial flushing, hypersensitivity, and hyperglycemia. Common 
practice is to use IA corticosteroids no more than once every 3 months. 
Dexamethasone is a highly potent glucocorticoid whose action is mediated by the binding of the 
corticosteroid molecule to receptors located within sensitive cells. The physiological function of 
glucocorticoid is complex and may include a number of mechanisms such as modification of 
movement and function of leukocytes, reduction of vascular permeabi lity, and reduced 
prostaglandin synthesis.2 TLC599 is a drug product designed to improve the stability of 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) through formulation with the BioSeizer platform 
technolog y. DSP is the pro-drug of dexamethasone and has been approved for indications of 
endocrine disorders, rheumatic diseases, and dermatologic, allergic, or ophthalmic diseases 
through intravenous or intramuscular administration route. Also, DSP is used to treat the synovitis 
of osteoa1thritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gouty arthritis through lA or soft tissue administration 
route and keloid, localized inflammation of lichen planus, psoriatic plaques, granuloma annulare 
or discoid lupus erythematosus may be treated through intralesional administration route. 
BioSeizer is a proprietar y, lipid-based drug delivery system developed by Taiwan Liposome 
Company (TLC), which can entrap both small molecules and large molecules and then slowly 
release these therapeutic agents. The release profile of compounds or proteins can be adjusted by 
modulating the concentration of phospholipids (PLs). By prolonging the local residence time of 
therapeut ic agents, TLC599 in turn reduces treatment frequency and risk to maximize the clinical 
benefit. Therefore, TLC599 provides an ideal, safe, and long-acting DSP delivery for the treatment 
inOA. 
4.2. Clinical Experience 
Two clinical studies for treating knee osteoarthritis with TLC599 via IA route at different dose 
levels (Study TLC599A 1001 in Taiwan and Study TLCA599A2003 in Taiwan/Austra lia) were 
completed. TLC599A IOOI was completed and TLCA599A2003 was completed, and the clinical 
study report was prepared for submission. Another pharmacokin etic study of TLC599 
(TLC599A2004) filed under the US Investigational New Drug (IND) is currently in the patient 
recruitment phase.

TLC599A3005 Confidential 
Study TLC599A I 00 I (Clinicaltrials.gov No: NCT0280 3307) was the first study to administer 
TLC599 by IA injection in patients with OA of the knee and there were no significant safety signals 
detected. It was a randomized, open-label study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of 
TLC599 dose levels of 6 mg and 12 mg DSP, with 20 patients per dose group. 
TLC599A2003 (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) was a randomized Phase 2a study 
with single IA injection of either TLC599 at 2 dose levels or Placebo (normal saline) on Day 0, 
with a follow-up period of24 weeks. A total of 75 patients were administered with I of the 3 study 
treatment s. 
4.3. Non-clinical Experience 
Local treatment of TLC599 by IA administration showed markedly sustained inhibitory activity 
in animal models of inflammatory diseases. The TLC599-induced amelioration of 
collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was evaluated in 2 rat studies. Following a single intra-plantar 
dose administration of DSP solution ofTLC599 in rats with CIA, the hind-paw swelling decreased 
in animals treated with either unformulated DSP treatment or TLC599. However, swelling 
recurred earlier for unformulated DSP treatment (Day 22) compared to TLC599 (Day 26). A 
similar outcome was obtained following repeat-dose administration, though the duration of 
anti-arthritic effects associated with TLC599 persisted for a longer period following repeat vs. 
single doses. 
Also, TLC599 did not cause significant toxic effect locally and systemically after IA 
administration in single-and repeat-dose studies in rabbits and dogs. 
The toxic findings of 
TLC599 after IV administration to rats are comparable to those of DSP without significant 
additional toxic findings and delayed toxicities.

6. STUDY DESIGN 
6.1. Overall Study Design and Plan Confidential 
This is a Phase 3 randomized , double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-contro lled pivotal 
study. Approximately 500 adult patients with moderate to severe pain due to OA of the knee who 
meet all entry criteria will be enrolled and randomized into in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive TLC599 
12 mg (Group A), DSP 4 mg (Group B), or Placebo (normal saline) (Group C) via IA injection 
into the designated index knee at Baseline (Injection I). At Week 24, patients will receive 
Injection 2 per their randomly assigned dosing regimen (Group A, B, or C) via IA injection into 
the index knee (see Section 6.6.3 for Criteria for Injection 2). Patients who received TLC599 
12 mg (Group A) or DSP (Group B) for Injection I will receive blinded TLC599 12 mg for 
Injection 2 and those who received Placebo for Injection 1 (Group C) will receive Placebo for 
Injection 2. 
All patients will be followed for a total of 52 weeks, regardless of whether or not they receive 
Injection 2. Patients who do not receive Injection 2 will be encouraged to continue in the study 
through 52 weeks of follow-up. Efficacy and safety of 2 doses of TLC599 will be evaluated in 
comparison with Placebo and DSP through Week 52. 
To enter the study, patients must be at least 40 years of age and have documented diagnosis ofOA 
in the index knee based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for Classification 
of Idiopathic OA of the knee (the ACR diagnostic criteria is provided in Appendix A). Patients 
will not be eligible if they have unstable index knee joint as determined by the investigator based 
on physical examination (with or without buckling or giving way) because of an acute injury 
(defined as injury within 6 months, e.g., anterior cruciate ligament injury or tear). 
The study duration is expected to be up to 56 weeks for each patient, including a Screening period 
of up to 4 weeks before randomization, Injection 1 Period of 24 weeks and Injection 2 Period of 
28 weeks. 
Patients will return to the study site at Week 1, Week 2, and every 4 weeks through Week 52 
post-dose to complete efficacy and safety assessments as applicable. Patients who receive 
Injection 2 will return to the clinic for 2 additional follow-up visits (Week 25 and Week 26). 
Efficacy will be assessed by WOMAC , numeric rating scale (NRS), 
and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at the time points 
indicated in the schedule of events (Section 1.1 ). 
Safety will be assessed by physical examination, vital signs measurements (heart rate, respiratory 
rate, sitting blood pressure and temperature) , clinical laboratory assessments (hematology , 
chemistry, urinalysis), HbA le, morning serum cortisol, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), knee radiograph s, concomitant medications /therapies, adverse events 
(AEs), and signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. 
All AEs observed by the study personnel or reported by the patient during the study (after the 
patient has signed the informed consent form [ICF] through the End of Study [EOS]/Early 
Termination [ET] visit) will be documented. 
Patients who do not complete the study through Week 52 will make every effort to complete 
ET procedures.

6.2. Rationale and Discussion of Study Design 
IA corticosteroid injection is a commonly used treatment with an excellent safety profile. A 
limitation of IA injection with corticosteroids is the modest duration of treatment effect, which 
often lasts for only 2 to 4 weeks. Repeat injections are possible in the same joint, but there are 
limited data on the safety and duration of the effectiveness of this procedure. Thus, there is a 
pressing need for a more sustained duration of an IA corticosteroid injection. 
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-and active-controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety ofTLC599 in patients with OA of the knee. The duration of follow-up after an 
IA injection for this study (up to 52 weeks) is somewhat longer than typical OA studies ( 12 to 
16 weeks) as the duration of effect from the study drug is expected to be longer. Additionally, a 
second injection in the same index knee will be administered where appropriate at Week 24 to 
assess the safety and effective ness of repeat dosing. The planned efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
endpoints for single and repeated dosing of TLC599 are appropriate for evaluating its sustained 
pain relief through an extended period of up to 52 weeks follow-up monitoring.

6.7. Patient Withdrawal from the Study 
All patients will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice. The investigator should make every reasonable 
attempt to keep patients in the study; however, patients must be withdrawn from the study if they 
withdraw consent to participate. Patients who do not receive Injection 2 do not need to be 
withdrawn and will be encouraged to continue in the study through 52 weeks of follow-up. If a 
patient does not receive Injection 2, it will not be considered a protocol deviation. Investigators 
must attempt to contact patients who fail to attend scheduled visits by telephone or other means to 
assess the possibility of an AE being the cause of withdrawal. Should this be the cause, the AE 
must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section 9.2. 
A pa1ticipant should be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occurs: 
• Pregnancy 
• Significant study non-compliance 
• Lost to follow-up 
• A surgical procedure or IA drug administration in the index knee 
• Lack of therapeutic effect that is intolerable or otherwise unacceptable to the patient 
• If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs such 
that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant 
• The investigator or the Sponsor stops the study for any reason 
If important restricted medication deviations occur, they should be discussed with the medical 
monitor before withdrawing the patient from the study. 
The investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss any non-compliance or safety 
concerns before withdrawing a patient from the study. 
The reason for participant withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the eCRF. Patients who 
sign the ICF, are randomized, and receive study drug, and subsequently withdraw, or are 
withdrawn from the study, will not be replaced.

7. TREATMENTS 
7.1. Identification of Study Drugs Confidential 
Packaging, labeling, and dispensing information for TLC599 are provided in the pharmacy 
manual, available as a separate document. 
The active comparator, DSP, will be supplied to study centers. The vial of DSP for injection 
contains DSP solution at the concentration of 4.0 mg/mL. DSP should be stored at 20°C to 25°C 
(68°F to 77°F) (see USP Controlled Room Temperature) in accordance with the package insert. 
Protect from freezing, sensitive to head. Do not autoclave. 
Placebo will be supplied to study centers. The vial of Placebo contains 0.9% normal saline. Normal 
saline should be stored below 25°C (77°F) or in accordance with the package insert. 
7.2. Treatment Administration 
Study drug will be administered in a blinded manner via IA injection into the index knee: 
Study Drug (TLC599): 
• Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) 12 mg with l 00 mM phospholipid (PL) ( 1 mL) 
Reference Drug (DSP): 
• DSP 4 mg (I mL) 
Placebo: 
• Normal saline (1 mL) 
Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2: I: I ratio to one of the following treatment groups 
(Group A, B, or C). 
Treatment Assignment for Injection 1 and Injection 2 
Group Injection I (Day I) Injection 2 (Week 24) 
A TLC599 TLC599 
B DSP TLC599 
c Placebo Placebo 
Guidance and recommendations for the study drug injection procedure are provided in the 
pharmacy manual. 
The index knee for study drug administration will be determined before randomiza tion at Visit 2 
(Baseline). The index knee is selected primarily based on the documented diagnosis of OA, 
Kellgren-Lawrence grade, NRS score at the initial Screening visit, and average daily NRS score 
before randomization. Therefore, the index knee can only be identified at the Baseline visit. The 
study drug injection may be administered using ultrasound-guided needle placement, depending 
on the facility available at each study site. If imaging-guided injection is not used, then 
confirmation of location of the needle within the index knee joint may be verified by aspirating 
Final Version 5.0. 09-Mar-2022 Page 42 of I 00 
Taiwan Liposome Company . Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
joint fluid. If there is a substantial effusion within the knee joint, the effusion should be aspirated, 
when possible, such that the estimated remainin g joint fluid in the knee is approximately 
5 to I 0 mL. The amount of joint fluid aspirated should be recorded . If it is part of the site's standard 
practice, pre-injection analgesics may be administered. However, nothing other than the study drug 
may be administered into the IA space. All medications used should be recorded in the concomitant 
medication record. 
Post-procedur e observation for patient safety can be per the investigator's discretion. Patients 
should not take a hot bath or shower, or expose the injected knee to external heat, within 12 hours 
after the injection. 
7.3. Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
The study drug injection will only be given on Day I (Injection I) and Week 24 (Injection 2) if 
the patient meets the eligibility criteria (Sections 6.6. l through 6.6.3). 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Not applicable. 
7.5. Treatment Compliance 
All injections at the study site should be under the surveillance of appropriate study personnel. 
Injection procedure details will be recorded in the patient's eCRF. 
7.6. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
In this parallel-group randomized study, patients who meet study eligibility criteria will be 
randomly assigned in a 2: I: I ratio to 12 mg TLC599, 4 mg DSP, or Placebo (normal saline). The 
randomization schedule will be computer generated using a permuted block algorithm and will 
randomly allocate study drug to randomization numbers. The randomization numbers will be 
assigned sequentially through a central interactive web response system (I WRS) as patients meet 
the eligibility criteria. Study center will not be a blocking factor in the randomization schedule. 
The randomization schedule will be prepared by before the start of the study. 
No one involved in the study performance will have access to the randomization schedule before 
official unblinding of treatment assignment. No patient will be randomized into this study more 
than once. 
7.7. Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment 
All patients, investigators, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study, including data 
management, will be blinded to treatment assignment, with the exception of a specified unblinded 
statistician and programmer from who will have access to the randomization 
code, the unblinded medical monitor, and the unblinded pharmacist or designee and unblinded 
injector at each study site. The unblinded study personnel will not participate in study procedures 
or data analysis before unblindin g of the study data to all study-related personnel. The patient 
treatment assignment for Injection I will remain blinded until the last patient has completed the 
study. The procedure for treatment blinding is presented in the pharmacy manual. 
Study personnel will make every effort to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize 
bias in the conduct of the study. Treatment unblindin g is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 43 of 100 
Taiwan Liposome Company, Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the 
patient's treatment assignment. 
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor, if possible. For emergency 
unblinding, study personnel will use the IWRS to obtain unblindin g information. If the investigator 
is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he/she must notify the medical monitor 
as soon as possible about the unblindin g incident without revealing the patient's treatment 
assignment. 
The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for treatment unblinding on the 
appropriate eCRF for that patient. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator must 
discuss the event with the medical monitor before unblindin g the patient's treatment assignment. 
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual patient, study personnel will be notified of 
that patient's treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining 
patients in the study. The overall study blind will not be compromised. [fa patient's treatment 
assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The 
investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor and the sponsor. 
Overall unblinding will take place only after database lock has been achieved. 
7.8. Rescue Medication 
Acetaminophen rescue medication may be used and will be provided to and managed by the study 
sites. The daily allowed acetaminophen dosage is up to 3 g/day. No acetaminophen is allowed 
within 24 hours before study visits. 
will provide the appropriate package insert for the acetaminophen rescue 
medication to be used during the study to each investigator. 
The name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication must be recorded daily in the diary with 
the indication recorded as "rescue medication." 
7.9. Concomitant Medications 
Patients may continue to receive any ongoing prescription medications, dietary supplement, or 
exercise program of the knee that they were receiving at the time of Screening, unless otherwise 
prohibited (See Prohibited Therapies, Section 7.10), and which are recorded in the source 
document and appropriate eCRF. These medications, or their doses, should not be changed during 
the course of the study unless under the direction of the prescribing physician. 
7.10. Prohibited Therapies 
All concomitant medications used (including over-the-counter medications and herbal 
supplements) will be recorded in the source document and on the appropriate eCRF. 
The following therapies are prohibited after the informed consent is signed, and throughout the 
study, unless otherwise specified: 
• IA corticosteroid in any joint 
• IA hyaluronic acid in any knee joint 
• Systemic corticosteroids (topical use allowed except on the index knee) 
• Acetaminophen within 24 hours prior to Baseline and subsequent study visits 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 44 of I 00 
Taiwan Liposome Company , Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
• Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs within 14 days before the Baseline visit and throughout 
the study (topical use allowed except on the index knee) 
• New initiation of duloxetine, pregabalin and gabapentin (a patient may continue the prior use 
of these drugs during the study) 
• Platelet-rich plasma or other prolotherapy 
• Opioid use is not permitted, with the exception ofhydrocodo ne, oxycodo ne, or tramadol, which 
may be used with the following limitations: 
o Any combination analgesic containing an opioid is prohibited 
o However, episodic use ( <4 days per week) of hydrocodone , oxycodone, or tramadol is 
permitted 
o The use of any opioid (including hydrocodon e, oxycodone, or tramadol) within 24 hours 
before the Baseline visit and subsequent study visits is prohibited 
• Any chemotherapeutic or systemic immunosuppressant agents for inflammatory diseases 
• Anti-coagulants, including warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or dabigatran 
(low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and other anti-platelet medications allowed) 
• Live attenuated vaccine 
• Any investigational therapy 
• Physical and occupational therapy or new rehabilitation program in index knee 
• Acupuncture or any surgical or invasive procedure on either knee (including study knee joint 
synovial fluid aspiration except prior to study drug administration) 
• Oral cannabidiol (CBD) in any form; inhalation is allowed and topical use is allowed except 
on the index knee 
Patients receiving excluded therapies during the screening period will be treated as screen failures 
and ineligible for randomization. If a patient uses any prohibited medication or treatments 
mentioned as above after study drug administration during the study period, it will be defined as a 
protocol deviation. Whether such protocol deviation is considered as significant study non­
compliance leading to withdrawal will be based on the investigator 's judgment after consulting the 
sponsor and the blinded medical monitor. 
7.11. Dispensing and Storage 
Details regarding dispensing and storage of study drug are provided in the pharmacy manual. 
7.12. Drug Accountability 
The investigator or designee must maintain adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, 
return, or other disposition of the study drugs, including the date, quantity, batch or code number, 
and identification of patients (patient number) who received the study drugs. The investigator wi II 
not supply the study drug to any person except those named as sub-investigators on the Form 
FDA 1572, designated study personnel, and patients in this study. The accountability will be 
performed by separate unblinded monitors during the time that blinding is required. 
Upon completion of the study, the study drugs (partly used, unused, and empty packaging) must 
be left in the original packaging and returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction, unless the 
sponsor makes other arrangements for local destruction.

8. STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS 
Patients must provide written informed consent before any study-related procedures are initiated, 
including the cessation of prohibited concomitant therapy. 
For the timing of assessments and procedure s throughout the study, refer to the schedule of events 
(Section I. I). Throughout the study, every reasonable effort should be made by study personnel to 
follow the timing of assessments and procedures in the schedule of events for each patient. If a 
patient misses a study visit for any reason, the visit should be rescheduled as soon as possible. 
8.1. Study Visits 
Study assessments throughout the study should occur in-person at the study site. If a patient cannot 
attend a study site visit because of restrictions resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), 
phone visits may replace in-person site visits and should occur per protocol schedule and within 
the regular visit window when possible (see Section 8.1.1). Patients who cannot attend the 
Week 24 visit within the visit window because of restrictions resulting from COVID-19, will be 
encouraged to return to the site before Week 28 to complete the Week 24 visit assessments, if 
feasible. However, Injection 2 may only be administered within the allowed visit window. 
8.1.1. Phone Visits 
On the scheduled day of the phone visit, site staff shall contact the patient by phone and conduct 
all study procedures that do not require direct physical contact (e.g., laboratory tests, physical 
examinations, radiograph s, etc.). Adverse event and concomitant medication review should occur 
as per usual procedure. 
Patients with symptoms of potential adrenal insufficiency should be encouraged to visit the study 
site for a laboratory test. If the study site is closed for patient's visiting, the patient should be 
referred to a local laboratory, urgent care, primary care physician, or emergency room for testing 
and/or follow-up as appropriate. 
Prior to the phone call, the site staff will activate visit date in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system. Site staff should enable the Patient Diary Activation for the site visit in interactive response 
technology. Site staff will confirm with the patient that assessments have populated. If the daily 
diary is not functioning during the call, the site will need to manually document the patient's 
responses on paper assessments. Then contact their assigned CRA for instructions on how to enter 
responses into the EDC manually. 
If the study site is closed, site staff will work from home calling patients and use the EDC website 
provided -https://login.imed idata.com/login . There is no change in username /password. The 
process for entering the date of visit is the same whether or not the user is working from the office. 
Site staff should remain in contact with the Principal Investigator and keep them aware of the 
patients' condition to ensure patient safety. The authorized investigator should be responsible for

8.4. Assessments 
8.4.1. Efficacy Confidential 
8.4.1.1. Western Ontario & McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (V3.1) 
The WOMAC is a widely used, self-administered assessment used to measure pain, stiffness, and 
physical function in patients with OA. Jt is considered to be a reliable and valid instrument.3•4•5 It 
comprises 24 questions, each on a 0-4 Likert scale (total score on a 0-96 scale) with assessment 
based on the previous 24 hours. The 3 sub-scale scores of Pain (5 items, total sub-scale score on a 
0-20 scale), Stiffness (2 items, total sub-scale score on a 0-8 scale), and Difficulty Performing 
Daily Activities (Physical Function) (17 items, total sub-scale score on a 0-68 scale) are added 
together to determine the WOMAC Composite score. Composite and sub-scale scores of WOMAC 
will be normalized to a scale of 0-4 for analysis. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse 
pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. 
The WOMAC is provided in Appendix C. 
8.4.1.2. Patient Global Impression of Change 
The PGIC is a self-administered instrument that measures patients' rating of overall improvement 
with treatment on a 7-point scale including "veiy much improved," "much improved," "minimally 
improved," "no change," "minimally worse," "much worse," or "veiy much worse." 
The PGIC assessment is provided in Appendix D.

Taiwan Liposome Company, Ltd. 
TLC599A300S Confidential 
8.4.1.4. Numeric Rating Scale 
The NRS is an I I -point scale from 0 to I 0. On this scale, 0 =no pain and 10 =the worst possible 
pain. The NRS will be assessed as the average pain over the last 24 hours. 
Every evening, the patient will rate his or her knee pain intensity using the following question on 
a daily patient diary for the previous 24 hours: "On a scale from 0 to 10, where "zero" represents 
"no pain" and "1 O" represents "the worst possible pain," how would you rate the average pain that 
you have been feeling in your knee over the last 24 hours?" 
8.4.1.5. Rescue Medication Use 
Patients may take the rescue medication provided by the study site for pain of the index knee as 
needed, except within 24 hours before a planned study visit. Acetaminophen is provided as the 
only allowed rescue medication. The name and dosage regimen must be recorded in the patient 
diary with the indication of"rescue use" specified. The daily allowed acetaminophen dosage is up 
to 3 g/day. 
8.4.2. Safety 
Patient safety will be evaluated by physical examination, vital signs assessments (heart rate, 
respiratory rate, sitting blood pressure, and temperature), clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, chemistry, urinalysis), HbA le, morning serum cortisol, 
12-lead ECG, knee radiographs, concomitant medications/therapies, AEs, and signs and symptoms

9. ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1. Definitions 
9.1.1. Adverse Events Confidenti al 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality of the disease or condition. (Worsening of a 
pre-existing condition is considered an AE.) 
9.1.2. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening 
NOTE: The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the study drug, 
or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the condition or 
event as an SAE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the study drug 
during pregnancy ~ an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a patient that has 
received a study drug is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the study drug(s) 
interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. 
• Is an important medical event 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, 
development of drug dependency, or drug abuse. 
9.1.3. Treatment-emergent Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as treatment emergent if the first onset or worsening at the time of or following 
the sta1t of treatment with study drug through the Fol low-up Visit or ET, whichever occurs first. 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 57 of 100 
Taiwan Liposome Company, Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
9.2. Event Assessment and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be 
explained by a known cause (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment 
indicates that further evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final outcome of an 
AE must be reported in the patient's medical record and recorded on the eCRF page. 
9.2.1. Collection 
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE described previously. At each visit, the patient will be allowed 
time to spontaneously report any issues since the last visit or evaluation. The investigator will then 
monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non-leading questions, such as the following: 
• "How are you feeling?" 
• "Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?" 
• "Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?" 
Any clinically relevant observations (including laboratory abnormalities) made during the visit 
will also be considered AEs. All AEs observed by the study personnel or reported by the patient 
during the study (after the patient has signed the ICF through the EOS/ET visit) will be 
documented. 
9.2.2. Evaluation 
9.2.2.1. Severity of Adverse Events 
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as: 
Mild 
Moderate 
Severe Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeuti c 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living. 
Usually alleviated with additiona l specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the patient. 
Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significant ly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity 
whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria. 
9.2.2.2. Seriousness 
The investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria.

Taiwan Liposome Company , Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
9.2.2.3. Action(s) Taken 
Action taken may consist of the following: 
Not applicable Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
Unknown Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
Other action taken Specify other action taken. 
9.2.2.4. Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation wi 11 be classified as: 
• Recovered/reso I ved 
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae 
• Recovering/resolving 
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Fatal* 
• Unknown 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than I AE is judged to be 
possibly related to the patient's death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. 
Although "fatal" is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death 
should be reported as SAEs. 
9.2.2.5. Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE's relationship to the study drug. The 
categories for classifying the investigator's opinion of the relationship are as follows: 
Not related An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship 
to study drug administration (e.g., no temporal relationship to drug 
administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
investigation shows that the drug was not administered; another cause was 
proven.) 
Unlikely 
related 
Possibly related An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
study drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbabl e, and in 
which other drugs, events, or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations. 
An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study drug, 
but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or events. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 59 of 100 
Taiwan Liposome Company. Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confidential 
Probably 
related An AE with evidence to suggest a causal relationship , and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory 
test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
intervention , is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(de-challenge). Re-challenge information is not required to fulfill this 
definition. 
Definitely 
related An AE occurring in a plausible time relationship to study drug administration 
and that cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or events. 
The response to withdrawal of the drug (de-challenge) is clinically reasonable. 
9.2.3. Documentation 
All AEs that occur within the period of AE follow-up for the study must be documented in the 
eCRF with the following information , where appropriate . (The AE follow-up period for the study 
is described in Section 9.2.) 
• AE name or term 
• When the AE first occurred (start date and time) 
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of "ongoing'") 
• Severity of the AE 
• Seriousnes s (hospitalization , death, etc.) 
• Actions taken 
• Outcome 
• Investigator opinion regarding the AE relationsh ip to the study drug(s) 
• Whether it is an AE of special interest (AES!) and whether it is an AE which is a potential 
symptom or sign of adrenal insufficiency (AEAI) (see Section 9.3.1) 
9.2.4. Treatment of Adverse Events 
Adverse events that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards 
of care. The decision about whether the patient may continue in the study will be made by the 
sponsor after consultation with the investigator and/or medical monitor. 
If AEs occur in a patient that are not tolerable, the investigator must decide whether to stop the 
patient's involvement in the study and/or treat the patient. Special procedure s may be 
recommended for the specific study drug, such as the collection of a serum sample for determining 
blood concentrations of study drug, specific tapering procedures , or treatment regimens, as 
appropriate . 
For double-or triple-blinded studies, it is not necessary to unblind a patient's treatment assignment 
in most circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see Section 7.7 
for a description of the unblindin g procedures.

9.2.5. Reporting 
9.2.5.1. Serious Adverse Events Confidential 
Any SAE must be reported by the investigator if it occurs during the clinical study or within 
30 days of receiving the study drug, whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the 
investigational product. A copy of SAE forms and supporting documents must be emailed within 
24 hours to the attention of the safety officer at: 
At the time of first notification, the investigator or designee should provide the following 
information, if available: 
• Protocol number 
• Repo1ter (study site and investigator) 
• Patient's study number 
• Patient's year of birth 
• Patient's gender 
• Date of first dose of study drug( s) 
• Date of last dose of study drug(s), if applicable 
• Adverse event term 
• Date of occurrence of the event 
• A brief description of the event, outcome to date, and any actions taken 
• The seriousness criteria( on) that were met 
• Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
• Relevant medical history information 
• Relevant laboratory test findings 
• Investigator's opinion of the relationship to study drug(s) ("Is there a reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the SAE? Yes or No?") 
• Whether and when the investigator was unblinded as to the patient's treatment assignment 
Any missing or additional relevant follow-up information concerning the SAE should be sent to 
the sponsor/sponsor representative via the same contact details above as soon as possible on a 
follow-up SAE Report Form, together with the following minimal information (initial report, AE, 
date of occurrence, patient identification, study identification, study drug, and site number); this 
will allow the follow-up information to be linked to the initial SAE report. 
Specific information may be requested by 
via email communication.

The investigator is required to comply with applicable regulations (including local laws and 
guidance) regarding the notification of his or her health authorities , institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC), principal and coordinating investigator s, study 
investigators , and institutions. Each investigator is obligated to learn about the reporting 
requirement s for investigators in his or her country. The study monitor may be able to assist with 
this. 
9.3. Special Considerations 
9.3.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
and patients should be 
closely monitored should these AEs occur. 
These events will be followed closely during the study and considered AESis. 
9.3.1.1. Potential for Adrenal Suppression 
Transient cortisol reduction is a well described physiologic response in patients who receive IA 
cortisol injection s and should not necessarily be considered an AE. Laboratory evidence of adrenal 
insufficiency should be assessed in conjunction with clinical signs and symptoms. 
Patients and investigators will be educated about symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and an 
assessment of clinical signs and symptoms indicating potential adrenal insufficienc y will be 
performed as part of AE evaluation at every visit or contact. 
Patients will be provided a wallet card identifyin g the potential risk for adrenal insufficienc y and 
asked to carry it at all times. This card should include the patient's identifying informati on, contact 
information for the investigator , and should note the potential need for emergency glucocorticoid 
therapy in the setting of shock, surgery, etc. 
Morning serum cortisol as measured by the central laboratory will be blinded to the patient, site 
staff, and blinded study team members (except Screening, Day I [pre-dose], and Week 20); results 
will be reviewed by a separate unblinded medical monitor. 
If there is clinical evidence of adrenal insufficiency that may compromise the patient's safety, the 
investigator should use a local laboratory to obtain a cortisol level or 
and/or refer the patient to his or her primary care physician or to an endocrinologist. The 
investigator may also contact the blinded medical monitor to discuss the patient's case and request 
review of prior cortisol values. 
The unblinded medical monitor will monitor all serum cortisol values. If sustained cortisol 
suppression is observed beyond 4 weeks following an injection , or any other cortisol values are 
seen that might appear to compromise patient safety, the unblinded medical monitor may contact

the investigator to review the patient's condition including any potential signs or symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency and discuss potential follow-up laboratory testing. 
9.3.2. Pregnancy 
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the need 
to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study 
participation. 
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of birth control unti I at least 
6 months after the last dose of study drug. Acceptable and effective methods of birth control for 
this study include: 
• Absolute sexual abstinence (no sexual intercourse or genital contact with a male partner) 
• Monogamous partner who is vasectomized 
• Use of double-barrier contraception 
• Use of an approved insertable, injectable, transdermal, or combination oral contraceptive for 
greater than 2 months prior to Screening. 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted before administration of the study drug on every woman of 
childbearing potential. A woman who is found to be pregnant at Screening will be excluded from 
the study and considered to be a screening failure. 
After participation in the study, women should be asked to contact the investigator or study staff 
immediately if pregnancy occurs or is suspected. The investigator is responsible for following the 
pregnancy until delivery or termination.

11.2. Analysis Populations Confidential 
The following analysis populations are planned for this study: 
Safety Population (SAF): The Safety Population includes all patients who receive any dose of 
study drug; the population will be determined for each study period. Injection 1 Period reporting 
will require that Injection 1 has been received; Injection 2 Period reporting will require that 
Injection 2 has been received. The SAF population will be the primary population for safety 
evaluation . 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The FAS includes al I randomized patients who receive Injection 1. The 
FAS population will be the primary population for efficacy analysis, as well as for descriptive 
summaries other than safety (demographic and baseline, disposition , protocol deviation, medical 
history, etc.). 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 67 of I 00 
Taiwan Liposome Company, Ltd. 
TLC599A3005 Confident ial 
Per Protocol Population (PP): The PP Population includes all patients who receive 2 doses of 
study drug, have primary efficacy evaluation at Weeks 12, 24, and 36, and do not have important 
protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy evaluation. 
Modified Per Protocol (mPP): The mPP Population includes all patients who receive the first 
dose of study drug, have primary efficacy evaluation at Weeks 12 and 24, and do not have 
important protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy evaluation. 
The PP and mPP population s will be used for supportive analysis of selected efficacy endpoints. 
For the PP population, patients must have a valid WOMAC Pain assessment at Baseline, Week 12, 
Week 24, and Week 36; for the mPP population, patients must have a valid WOMAC Pain 
assessment at Baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. (A valid assessment is within the analysis visit 
window and not excluded due to an intercurrent event as described in Section I I .3 .3. I). 
Important protocol deviations are determined in accordance with the protocol deviation guidance 
plan. Membership in the PP and mPP analysis populations will be determined after blinded data 
review of important protocol deviations affecting primary efficacy evaluation before database lock 
and study unblindin g. 
If a patient is randomized incorrectly or is administered the incorrect study drug, analyses of the 
FAS population will be based on the assigned treatment, whereas analyses of all other populations 
will be based on the actual treatment received. 
11.3. Statistica l Analyses 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP) that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted will be written before database 
lock. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2-sided, and a difference 
resulting in a P value of :S 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All other P values from 
key secondary endpoints, after a non-significant P value is reached as well as other additional 
endpoints, will be considered exploratory. 
Summary statistics will be provided for the variables described in the following subsections. 
Continuous variable summaries will include the number of patients, mean, standard deviation 
(SD), first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum , and maximum. Categorical variables will 
include the frequency and percentage of patients in each category. 
11.3.1. Study Patients and Demographic s 
11.3.1.1.Disposition and Withdrawals 
The numbers of patients screened, failed screening, randomized, receiving Injection I or 2, 
completing, and withdrawing , along with reasons for withdrawal and timing of withdrawal, will 
be tabulated overall and by treatment group. Reasons for not receiving Injection 2 will also be 
tabulated. The number of patients in each analysis population will be reported.

TLC599A30 05 
11.3.1.2.Protocol Deviations Confidential 
Protocol deviations will be identified and important deviations will be classified before unblindin g 
and will be summarized or listed as appropriat e. Important protocol deviations affecting primary 
efficacy evaluation will be used to assess patient inclusion into PP and mPP populations. 
11.3.1.3.Demographic s and Other Baseline Characteristics 
These analyses will be conducted for all analysis populations. 
Demographic variables will include age, sex, race, weight, BMI, and region. Baseline patient 
characteristics will include medical history, including confirmation ofOA diagnosis and time since 
diagnosis, Kellgren-Lawrence Grade, normalized WOMAC scores, and average daily pain. 
11.3.2. Exposure and Compliance 
All patients will receive up to 2 study drug injections at the study site under the surveillance of 
appropriate study personnel and, therefore, no compliance will be calculated. Injection procedure 
details and study drug batch or lot number(s) will be recorded in the patient's EDC system and 
summarized or I isted as appropriate. 
11.3.3. Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy variables will be summarized by treatment group and by injection period within each 
group using the FAS population, unless otherwise specified. For all the continuous variables, the 
normalized numbers will be used for analysis, where applicable, unless otherwise specified. 
The overall type J error rate will be controlled for primary and key secondary endpoints using 
hierarchical testing, based on a fixed-sequence procedure. 
lf statistical significance is declared for the primary analysis, formal statistical inference will 
continue at the 0.05 level for the secondary endpoints in the defined sequence until a non­
significant result is reached. All other P values from key secondary endpoints, after a non­
significant P value is reached, as well as other additional endpoints, will be considered exploratory. 
11.3.3.1.Primary Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis and estimation of the primary estimand will be based on the FAS 
population, the mPP population, and the PP population. 
The primary estimand is the difference in mean change from Baseline in WOMAC Pain score at 
Week 12 between TLC599 vs. Placebo (as defined in the Treatment Assignment Table in 
Section 7.2). The endpoint and intercurrent events for the primary estimand are defined as follows: 
• Endpoint: Change from Baseline in WOMAC Pain score at Week 12 
• Intercurrent Events: 
Final Version 5.0, 09-Mar-2022 Page 69 of 1 00 
Taiwan Liposome Company , Ltd. 
TLCS99A3005 Confidential 
An ANCOV A will be performed with treatment group as a fixed effect and Baseline WOMAC 
Pain score as a covariate. Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing intermittent and 
post-withdrawal WOMAC Pain scores considered to be missing at random. Post-withdrawal 
missing data due to lack of efficacy, AE, or surgical procedure/IA drug administration in the index 
knee will be assumed to be MNAR; all other missing and post-withdrawal data will be assumed to 
be MAR. 
The ANCOVA model will be 
conducted on each imputation and the results will be combined using Rubin's rules in SAS PROC 
MIANALY ZE. 
The least-squares mean comparing TLC599 to Placebo along with the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval, will be used to estimate the treatment difference. 
Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to estimate sensitivity estimators and to assess the 
robustness of efficacy results, including: 
• A sensitivity analysis using a tipping point procedure to assess the robustness of the multiple 
imputation results. 
• A mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach will be used as a sensitivity 
analysis for the primary endpoint. Treatment group, study visit (as a categorical variable) and 
Final Version 5.0. 09-Mar-2022 Page 70 of 100

TLC599A3005 Confidential 
site will be modeled as fixed effects, with a treatment-b y-visit interaction and baseline 
WOMAC Pain score as a covariate. Patient will be included as a random effect. Prior to 
implementing the model, MNAR data due to intercurrent events will be imputed using BOCF 
and non-missing data affected by the use of intercurrent medication s and procedures will be 
replaced using BOCF, as described for the primary analysis method. The MMRM will 
include both observed and BOCF imputed data. 
If further sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint is performed, it will be described in the SAP. 
Descriptive summarie s (such as mean, standard error, first quartile, median, third quartile, 
minimum , and maximum) will also be provided for the primary endpoint. 
11.3.3.2. Secondary Analyses 
Continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same methodology as for the primary 
endpoint, unless otherwise indicated. 
For analysis of categorical secondary endpoints, the difference in the predictive marginal proportions 
will be the basis of comparison between treatment groups. 
The corresponding 95~Cf and P value will also be 
presented. 
11.3.3.3.Exploratory Analyses 
For additional endpoints derived using the baseline prior to Injection 1, descriptive statistics for 
each variable will be presented for each visit until the end of study and summarized by treatment 
group and by injection period within each group. For additional endpoints derived using the 
baseline prior to Injection 2, descriptive statistics for each variable will be presented by treatment 
group. Efficacy endpoints relative to Injection 2 baseline will only be analyzed for patients who 
receive Injection 2. 
The analysis of all continuous additional endpoints will be performed using an AN COY A model 
as described for the single-dose primary endpoint. 
Categorical exploratory endpoints will be analyzed using the same methodology as the categorical 
secondary endpoints. 
P values from additional endpoints will be considered nominal and no adjustments for 
multiplicity will be made. 
Subgroup analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be performed by age (<65 or 2:65 
years), sex, race (Caucasian or non-Caucasian), and Kellgren-Lawrence grade (2 or 3). Further 
details will be provided in the SAP. 
Mean value, mean change, and percent change from baseline in WOMAC Pain and weekly 
average daily pain will be plotted over time. 
A cumulative distribution plot of percent change in WOMAC Pain by treatment group will be 
produced for each time point from Injection I Baseline through Week 52 Patients who 
discontinue treatment are defined as non-responders with 0% improvement (no change from 
Baseline).

11.3.4. Safety and Tolerability Analyses Confidentia l 
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the SAF population (as defined in Section 11.2). 
Safety variables include physical examination, vital signs assessments (heart rate, respiratory rate, 
sitting blood pressure, and temperature), clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, chemistry, 
urinalysis), HbA le, morning serum cortisol, 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), knee radiographs, concomitant medications/therapies, AEs, and signs and symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency. Medical history and AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and concomitant medication will be coded using the World 
Health Organization Drug (WHODrug) Global Dictionary. 
The safety data will be descriptively summarized by treatment group within each injection period. 
The safety profile following the first and second injections will be evaluated through the 
examination of the following comparisons: 
I. Group A versus Group B for safety data collected following Injection 2. 
2. Safety data in Group A, collected following Injection I versus Injection 2. 
Continuous safety data will be summarized by visit and include changes from baseline (Injection 
I and/or Injection 2 Baseline). Continuous data will also be converted to categorical values where 
possible (i.e., below, within, and above normal ranges) and summarized in shift from baseline 
tables. Categorical safety data collected by visit will be summarized showing the counts and 
percentages in each category at each visit, as well as shifts from baseline as appropriate. 
11.3.4.1.Adverse Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities terminology will be used to classify all AEs with 
respect to system organ class (SOC) and PT. 
Treatment-emerge nt AEs are defined as AEs with onset at the time of or following the start of 
treatment with study drug through EOS or ET, whichever occurs first. 
The number and percentage of patients with A Es will be displayed for each treatment group by 
SOC and PT. Summaries of AEs by severity and relationship to study drug will also be provided. 
Serious AEs and AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug will be summarized separately in 
a similar manner. Patient listings of AEs, SAEs and AEs causing discontinuation of study drug 
will be produced. 
11.3.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Descriptive summaries (mean, SD, first quartile, median, third quartile, minimum , and maximum) 
of actual (absolute) values and changes from Baseline values and GeoMean percentage change (if 
appropriate) will be presented for clinical laboratory values by treatment group and time point. 
The number of patients with clinical laboratory values categorized as below, within, or above 
normal ranges will be tabulated showing change from Baseline (shift tables) for each clinical 
laboratory analyte by treatment group and by time point. Pre-and post-treatment values will also 
be presented with analysis summary of mean changes from Baseline. 
Laboratory values that are outside the normal range will also be flagged in the data listings, along 
with the correspon ding normal ranges.

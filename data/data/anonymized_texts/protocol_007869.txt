Title of study: Economic burden associated with nintedanib non-adherence among 
Medicare beneficiaries with IPF
Rationale 
and background:Recent systematic reviews found links between medication non-
adherence and higher healthcare spending ( Cutler et al., 2018 ) and 
elevated risks of inpatient hospitalization and mortality ( Walsh et al ., 
2019 ).  To our knowledge, however, there have been no studies 
examining the association between non-adherence and economic burden specific to nintedanib, antifibrotics, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
A prior study by this team quantified nintedanib adherence 
trajectories using group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) and identified characteristics of patients associated with membership in each trajectory group.  A handful of existing studies examine associations between medication non-adherence as measured from GBTM and coincident or subsequent health care resource use, although none were specific to the setting of interest here.  This study seeks to build on our prior study and fill that gap in knowledge.  We expect the findings from this study to be highly relevant to clinicians and payers to help optimize care in a cost-effective manner.
Research question and objectives: 1) Assess the association between nintedanib adherence trajectory group 
(as measured from a GBTM) and health care resource use, with a focus on inpatient hospitalization, among patients with IPF.
2) Assess the association between a patient’s nintedanib 
adherence trajectory group (as measured from a GBTM) and their medical costs among patients with IPF.
Study design: This is a non-interventional, retrospective cohort study.

Population: The study sample will consist of community-dwelling Medicare 
beneficiaries with IPF who initiate treatment with nintedanib.
Variables: The main exposure will be a five-category measure of adherence 
trajectory to nintedanib in the year following initiation.
Outcomes will reflect inpatient hospitalization (any and number of 
days) and health care spending for both all-cause and IPF-related care.
A range of covariates will be measured during the baseline period and 
at the index date, including baseline patient demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity), residential location, clinical characteristics (e.g., comorbidity index, IPF-related health care costs and use), and all-cause health care costs and use.
Data sources: This study will use administrative enrollment and claims data from the 
U.S. federal Medicare program for beneficiaries aged 65 years and 
older who were continuously enrolled in Original Medicare insurance 
coverage, including Parts A, B and D.  The study will use Medicare 
data covering the period from October 1, 2013, through December 31, 
2020.
Study size: Based on our prior study, the sample for analysis of the primary 
outcomes will consist of 1,798 Medicare beneficiaries with IPF who initiated nintedanib between October 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. The sample available for the secondary outcomes will be smaller by an unknown amount due to loss to follow-up.
Data analysis: Mean health care cost and use outcomes will be compared between 
pairs of nintedanib adherence trajectory membership categories using a 
regression modeling framework.  Unadjusted means will be compared first using an “empty” linear regression model specification (with no covariates or weights).  Adjusted means will then be compared using a “doubly robust” generalized linear model (GLM) specification.  
Potential confounding by observed covariates will be addressed in two 
ways to achieve double robustness.  The first way will be to calculate observation-level inverse propensity weights that balance covariates

7. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
It is taken as self-evident in the medical community that medication non-adherence leads to 
negative outcomes; as C. Everett Koop said, “Drugs don’t work in patients who don’t take them” ( Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005 ).  Recent systematic reviews of the published literature 
found links between medication non-adherence and higher spending ( Cutler et al., 2018 ) and 
elevated risks of inpatient hospitalization and mortality ( Walsh et al., 2019 ).  To our 
knowledge, however, there have been limited studies examining the association between non-adherence and economic burden specific to nintedanib, antifibrotics, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
Measuring medication adherence is difficult.  There are several approaches to measuring 
adherence, each with its own strengths and limitations ( Forbes et al., 2018 ).  A common 
method in real-world settings, such as prescription drug claims databases, is the proportion of days covered (PDC), which is defined for a specific medication as the number of days 
supplied divided by the total number of days in the study period ( Anghel et al., 2019 ).  
Although PDC is useful in that it offers in a single number a metric of medication adherence over a predefined period, its simplicity masks any heterogeneity in adherence between patients and specifically does not capture changes in individual patient adherence over time.  
An alternative approach is to use group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) to detect 
trajectories of medication adherence over time and identify clusters of individuals who follow similar longitudinal adherence patterns ( Nagin and Odgers, 2010 ).  GBTM has been used to 
understand adherence to medications in several therapeutic areas ( Alhazami et al., 2020 ).  
Longitudinal evaluation of medication adherence using GBTM can yield more informative classifications compared to traditional methods such as PDC ( Franklin et al., 2013 ).
A prior study by this study team quantified nintedanib adherence trajectories using GBTMs 
and identified characteristics of patients associated with membership in each trajectory group.  Individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who initiated nintedanib during 10/1/2014–12/31/2018 were identified in 100% Medicare claims and enrollment data.  The sample consisted of community-dwelling older adults ( ≥66 years) with continuous coverage 
in Medicare Parts A, B and D for one year before (baseline) and after (follow-up) starting nintedanib.  PDC was calculated for each of 12 consecutive 30-day months based on nintedanib claim fill dates and days’ supply.  PDC was dichotomized, with PDC ≥0.8 
considered adherent.  A series of GBTMs of adherence was estimated to identify the best-fitting specification.  Patients were then grouped based on their estimated adherence trajectories.  Associations between baseline patient characteristics, including demographics, comorbidities, and health case use, and group membership probabilities were quantified as odds ratios using fractional multinomial logit modelling.
In thas study, the best-fitting GBTM had five adherence trajectory groups: highly adherent 
(43.1%), medium adherent (11.9%), gradual decliners (10.4%), intermediate decliners (13.2%), and rapid decliners (21.5%) ( Figure 1 ).  The principal factors associated with higher 
odds of being in at least one of the lower-adherence groups were older age, female sex, race and ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, and taking an additional medication during baseline.

A handful of existing studies examine associations between medication non-adherence as 
measured from GBTMs and coincident or subsequent health care resource use.  Dillon et al. (2019 ) found lower GBTM-based adherence to antihypertensive medications was associated 
with a higher rate of visits to general practitioners but not hospitalizations in Ireland.   Franklin et al. ( 2015 ) found lower GBTM-based adherence to statin medications was 
associated with higher risk of clinical events as measured by a composite of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, revascularization, a cerebrovascular event and heart failure in a large commercial insurance claims database in the United States.  A pair of studies by Lo-Ciganic and colleagues used Medicaid claims data from Pennsylvania.  They found lower GBTM-based adherence to buprenorphine led to higher risk of hospitalization and emergency department (ED) visits ( Lo-Ciganic, Gellad, et al., 2016 ), and lower GBTM-based adherence 
to oral hypoglycemic medications led to higher risk of diabetes-related hospitalizations/ED visits.
This study seeks to fill the gap in knowledge about the potential association between 
adherence to nintedanib and patients’ health care resource use and spending.  We expect the findings from this study to be highly relevant to clinicians and payers to develop actionable strategies to improve adherence to nintedanib.

9. RESEARCH METHODS
9.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a non-interventional cohort study using existing administrative data from the U.S. 
Medicare program. There will be no comparison groups nor any exposure variables.  As shown in Figure 2, the study sample will consist of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries with IPF who initiated treatment with nintedanib between 10/01/2014 to 12/31/2018.  To allow for a one-year baseline period and two-year follow-up period for all beneficiaries who initiated nintedanib between 10/01/2014 and 12/31/2018, the span of data 
will be from 10/01/2013 to 12/31/2020.
Figure 2. Study design schematic
9.2 SETTING
9.2.1 Study sites
The study will use 100% Medicare claims and enrollment data from the U.S. Medicare 
program on community-dwelling beneficiaries continuously enrolled in traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare insurance coverage for inpatient hospital, skilled nursing and outpatient facility services (Part A), physician and other professional services (Part B), and outpatient prescription drugs (Part D). 
The enrollment file contains monthly information on individuals’ enrollment in each part of 
Medicare, demographic information, residential location (at the 5-digit ZIP Code level), and date of death.  
Claims data are available for all medical services covered by the program and are organized 
into data files based on the nature and source of the claim.  The Inpatient, Outpatient, and SNF files include institutional claims from hospitals for inpatient and outpatient services and from nursing homes for short-stay “skilled” admissions, respectively.  The Carrier file includes fee-for-service claims submitted by professional providers, including physicians, physician assistants, clinical social workers, nurse practitioners.  (Claims for some organizational providers, such as free-standing facilities are also found in the Carrier file.  Examples include independent clinical laboratories, ambulance providers, free-standing ambulatory surgical centers, and free-standing radiology centers.)  Separate files include claims for durable medical equipment, home health visits and hospice care.

9.3 VARIABLES
9.3.1 Exposures
The exposure will be a categorical variable indicating which of the five nintedanib adherence 
trajectory groups a patient was most likely to belong, given their 12-month pattern of nintdanib claims as estimated from the GBTM.  The groups (and their prevalence in the sample) are highly adherent (43.1%), medium adherent (11.9%), gradual decliners (10.4%), intermediate decliners (13.2%), and rapid decliners (21.5%).
9.3.2 Outcomes
The primary outcome will be total all-cause medical costs, which will be calculated as the 
sum of total amounts paid (by payers and patients) for all medical services.  Types of medical services covered by Medicare include inp atient facility, outpatient f acility, skilled nursing 
facility, home health care, hospice, durable medical equipment, and clinician office visits (and other services covered under the Part B benefit).  This outcome will exclude spending on outpatient pharmacy (as covered under the Part D benefit).  
The secondary outcomes will be:
1. Total IPF-related medical costs, which will be calculated as the sum of total amounts 
paid (by payers and patients) for all medical services for an IPF-related reason (at least one IPF diagnosis code).
2. All-cause inpatient hospitalization 3. IPF-related inpatient hospitalization.
9.3.3 Covariates
Study covariates are listed here and will be measured at the index date or during the 12 
months prior.
Variable Description
Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics
AgeAge as of index date in years rounded to the nearest 
whole number will be calculated based on the 
difference between the beneficiary’s birth date and 
index date. 
Age groupAge group will be a categorical variable for age 
defined as one of 65–74, 75–84, 85+.
FemaleFemale will be a binary indicator for whether the 
beneficiary was female as indicated on the enrollment record covering the index date.
RaceRace will be a categorical variable for the 
beneficiary’s self-reported race/ethnicity taking the

Variable Description
categories Non-Hispanic White, Black or African-
American, Other, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and unknown race from the enrollment record covering the index date.
Census regionCensus region will be a categorical variable defined 
by categorizing the beneficiary’s state of residence into Census regions (Northeast, South, Midwest, West) from the enrollment record covering the index date.
Index yearIndex year will be a categorical variable defined as 
the year of the index date and will take the values, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 or 2018.
Social deprivation indexSocial deprivation index will be a continuous 
variable ranging between 0 and 100 representing the Social Deprivation Index for the beneficiary’s residential ZIP Code as calculated by the Robert Graham Center.  Social Deprivation Index “is a composite measure of seven demographic characteristics collected in the American Community Survey (ACS): percent living in poverty, percent with less than 12 years of education, percent single parent household, percent living in rented housing unit, percent living in overcrowded housing unit, percent of households without a car, and percent non-employed adults under 65 years of age.”  This version was calculated in 2015 using data from 2015 and updates the original version created by Butler et al. ( 2013 ).  
Higher values for the Social Deprivation Index indicate more social deprivation.
Clinical characteristics
Combined comorbidity indexThe combined comorbidity index will be a 
continuous comorbidity score ranging from 0 to 26 as measured from comorbidity diagnosis codes in any position on inpatient, outpatient and Carrier claims that occurred during the baseline period.  The combined comorbidity score is based on research by Gagne et al. ( 2011 ) and Sun et al. ( 2017 ) to identify 
the conditions in the union of the two most-popular comorbidity indexes used in administrative claims data, the Charlson index and the Elixhauser index.  For a sample of Medicare beneficiaries, Gagne et al. (2011) found that a subset of 20 conditions predicted mortality at 30, 60, 90 and 180 days, and 1 year more accurately than either of the two indexes

on their own.  Moreover, unlike the Charlson and 
Elixhauser indexes, Gagne et al.’s ( 2011 ) combined 
index is not conditioned on inpatient hospital admission.  The 20 conditions in Gagne et al.’s (2011) combined comorbidity index (with their weights in parentheses) include: - Metastatic cancer (5), - Congestive heart failure (2), - Dementia (2), - Renal failure (2), - Weight loss (2), - Hemiplegia (1), - Alcohol abuse (1), - Any tumor (1), - Cardiac arrhythmias (1), - Chronic pulmonary disease (1), - Coagulopathy (1), - Complicated diabetes (1), - Deficiency anemia (1), - Fluid and electrolyte disorders (1), - Liver disease (1), - Peripheral vascular disease (1), - Psychosis (1), - Pulmonary circulation disorders (1), - HIV/AIDS ( −1), and 
- Hypertension ( −1).
Pulmonary hypertensionA binary indicator for whether the beneficiary had a 
diagnosis code for pulmonary hypertension on at least one inpatient, outpatient or Carrier claim that occurred during the baseline period.
Gastroesophageal refluxA binary indicator for whether the beneficiary had a

9.4 DATA SOURCES
The study will use data from the federal Medicare program on elderly beneficiaries 
consistently enrolled in traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare insurance coverage for hospital (Part A), physician (Part B) and pharmacy (Part D) claims.  As of October 2021, there were over 36 million beneficiaries in traditional Medicare.  The study will focus on enrollment and claims data from October 1, 2013, through December 31, 2020.  Access to these data has been obtained by  through the .
This data source was selected for multiple reasons.  First, Medicare data capture the 
preponderance of IPF cases.  In a study reported by Ipatova et al. ( 2019 ), 76% of patients on 
nintedanib or pirfenidone were ≥65 years of age.  Second, Medicare claims are 
comprehensive in their inclusion of covered services, including outpatient prescription drugs (through Medicare Part D).  Third, there is comparatively little turnover among Medicare beneficiaries compared with commercial insurance enrollees, which means that it is possible to follow Medicare beneficiaries for longer periods on average and more patients will qualify for a study requiring a given minimum continuous coverage period.  Fourth, Medicare claims were used in the prior study of nintedanib adherence, so it is natural to continue using them for this study.

9.5 STUDY SIZE
In the prior study, there were 18,733 Medicare beneficiaries with at least one claim for 
nintedanib between 10/01/2014 and 12/31/2018.  After sample selection criteria were applied, the final analytic sample consisted of 1,798 patients ( Figure 3 ).

9.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
Data manipulation and analysis will be conducted by .  Pursuant to 
requirements guiding participation in the  Innovator program,  staff will access the Medicare claims and enrollmentdata only through the .  As such,  will not directly possess any beneficiary-level  data, and the only data to be downloaded from the  will be summary-level statistics.
Data security will be assured along two dimensions.  First, the data will reside only in  
secure environment.   staff have completed a rigorous identity verification process to gain access to the .   prohibits any patient-level data from

being copied from the ; only aggregated data based on at least 11 patients is allowable.  
Second, only a limited set of patient identifiers will be present in the data, including residential ZIP Code and full dates of health insurance enrollment and claims and subject’sbirth and death dates.  The unique patient ID used by  is a synthetic identifier, and no 
study staff will have access to the linking file to real subject identifiers.
Additionally, study documents, including synopsis, protocol, and final results as well as 
publications, will be archived on the  Team site.
9.7 DATA ANALYSIS
9.7.1 Main analysis
Descriptive statistics of the covariates will be calculated stratified by the five categories of 
patients’ adherence trajectory group membership, after assigning patients to the group for which they had the highest posterior probability of membership as estimated in the GBTM (from the prior study).  Tests of joint equality across groups will be computed using ANOVA and nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis rank tests for continuous measures and χ
2tests for 
categorical measures.
Mean outcomes will be compared between pairs of nintedanib adherence trajectory 
membership categories (referent group: highly adherent) using a regression modeling framework.  Unadjusted means will be compared first using an “empty” linear regression model specification (with no covariates or weights) that makes standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity of unknown form.  Adjusted means will then be compared using a “doubly robust” generalized linear model (GLM) specification that also uses heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.  More detail about the double-robustness is provided below.
The functional form of the GLM will be selected for each outcome based on its observed 
distribution in the data.  The binary outcome of “any hospitalization” will likely be modeled with logistic regression.  The non-negative “total LOS” outcome may be modeled with a quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson model if the proportion of patients with zero days of hospitalization is sufficiently low (less than 10%), or a two-part model (e.g., logistic model of any hospitalization vs. none and a simultaneously estimated Poisson model of total LOS conditional on having positive LOS) if not ( Belotti et al., 2015 ).  Similarly, if the “total 
medical costs” outcome has a pile-up at zero, a two-part model will be estimated; if not, a GLM with a log link and a distribution family decided by application of the modified Park test will be estimated ( Manning, 1998 ).
Potential confounding by observed covariates will be addressed in two ways, thus leading to 
“doubly robust” estimates.  The first way is to calculate two sets of observation-level weights that balance covariates across exposure categories: inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) and weights derived from a marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS) procedure ( Hong, 2012 ; Linden, 2014 ).  To generate the weights, a multinomial 
logit model of nintedanib adherence trajectory group category will be estimated as a function of the covariate roster.  Predicted probabilities (i.e., propensity scores) for each category will be generated from the model results and used to calculate both the IPTW and MMWS

BI Study Number 1199-0520 c42255024-02

weights.  Because multiple exposure categories are to be compared, the weights will provide 
estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE) (and not the average treatment effect on the treated [ATT]).  
The second way confounding will be addressed is through regression adjustment; that is, 
observed covariates will be added to the GLM specification.  Combining weighting with regression adjustment yields a double robustness property that attenuates bias in the case when either the treatment model (i.e., the multinomial logit model of exposure category) or the outcome model (i.e., the GLM of the health care resource use or spending outcome) is misspecified ( Linden et al., 2016 ).
To facilitate interpretability, the regression model results will be transformed back to the 
scale of the outcome variable.  Average marginal effects and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated using the delta method.  Data preparation will be performed using SAS 9.4 ( ) and data analysis will be conducted using Stata 17 () .
9.8 QUALITY CONTROL
Regarding quality control procedures around the data, the Medicare administrative data 
collection occurred in the past and access to the data is being provided by . No additional insight into the data collection procedures is available beyond that which has been published by . As a result, we are relying on quality control measures implemented by 
 during data collection.
Regarding quality control procedures around the analyses, the following quality assurance 
and quality control measures will be applied to all programming that executes data extraction and transformation by

9.9 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS
The study has several limitations, including:
!The data source consists of administrative claims data, which do not include 
important determinants of health care resource use and cost outcomes that may be correlated with the adherence exposure, such as IPF disease severity.
!Although the outcomes should be measured accurately, the adherence exposure is 
necessarily based on prescription fill data from claims and may mismeasure actual nintedanib use.
!Sample selection bias may arise from the design decision to exclude patients who do 
not have at least 12 months of follow-up data after nintedanib initiation for primary outcomes (and 24 months for secondary outcomes).
!Generalizability may be limited to IPF patien ts who are continuously covered under 
fee-for-service Medicare, including Parts A, B and D.

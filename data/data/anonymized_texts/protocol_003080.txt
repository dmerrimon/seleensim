Current  Stimulation  (tDCS)  and Cognitive  Training  for Executive  Dysfunction  in 
Adult  Survivors  of Childhood  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia

Brief  Overview:  A common  and potentially  debilitating  late effect  of childhood  cancer  
treatment  is neurocognitive  impairment,  frequently  in the domain  of executive  dysfunction,  
which  can limit educational  attainment,  employment,  and quality  of life. Among  the 
survivors  of childhood  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  in the SJLIFE  cohort,  the 
rate of executive  function  impairment  has been  shown  as high as 58.8%,  with moderate  to 
severe  impairment  rates  as high as 33.5%,  and risk for impairment  increased  with time 
from  diagnosis.  Given  the potential  of pervasive  impact  of neurocognitive  impairment  
on daily  life, interventions  directed  at reducing  neurocognitive  dysfunction  among  
childhood  cancer  survivors  with long-term follow -up are needed.  Transcranial  Direct  
Current  Stimulation  (tDCS),  a form  of non-invasive  brain  stimulation,  is a potentially  
useful  tool to enhance  cognitive  function.  tDCS  involves  modulation  of cerebral  cortex  
excitability  by the application  of weak  direct  current  through  the scalp.  
Researchers  at St. Jude Children's  Research  Hospital  want  to evaluate  the influence  of 
tDCS  and cognitive  training  on cognitive  performance  in long-term survivors  of childhood  
ALL.  
Intervention:  Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulation  
In phase  I, the short -term effect  of tDCS  intervention  will be evaluated  in the clinical  
setting  using  a randomized  cross -over trial. The survivors  will be randomized  to receive  
either  the tDCS  intervention  at the current  dose level  of 1mA  or Sham  for 15 minutes  on 
day 1, with the other  treatment  given  on day 2 (i.e. those  who got tDCS  intervention  on 
day 1 will get sham  on day 2 and vice versa).  The tDCS  intervention  will be delivered  by 
the Soterix  Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulator  Clinical  Trials  (1x1-CT).  
Neurocognitive  testing  using  the NIH Toolbox  will be conducted  within  two hours  of 
completing  stimulation  each day. 
In phase  II, the feasibility  and potential  efficacy  of self-administration  of the tDCS  
intervention  paired  with cognitive  training  will be evaluated  over 5 weeks.  Research  
participants  will be taught  to use the mobile  tDCS  device  and will be provided  one to take 
home.  The device  will be programmed  by the investigators  in advance  to control  the 
intensity  and duration  of the stimulation.  The research  participants  will use the device  
twice  per week  as directed,  and will be required  to obtain  a unique  access  code from  the 
investigators  prior  to each stimulation  session.  Each  stimulation  session  will be monitored  
using  FaceTime  on an institutional  iPad given  to the participants.  Within  two hours  of 
completing  each tDCS  session  participants  will complete  20 minutes  of cognitive  training  
using  a mobile  app installed  on the iPad.  Neurocognitive  testing  will be conducted  pre- 
and post- intervention  using  remote  assessment.  
Study  Design:  Pilot study  
Sample  Size:  45 research  participants  
Data  Management:  Data management  for this study  will be supervised  by the 
Neuropsychology  Research  Team  Clinical  and Survey  Research  Center  in the 
Department  of Epidemiology  and Cancer  Control.     Statistical  analysis  will be provided

locally  by the Biostatistics  Department  at St. Jude Children’s  Research  Hospital.  
Human  Subjects:  There  is low risk to participants  related  to the tDCS.  Potential  side 
effects  include  redness and slight tingling  at the  site of stimulation,  and all side effects  are 
reversible.  Recent  meta -analyses  show  side effects  to occur  no more  frequently  than 
placebo  conditions.  Time  commitment  could  be seen as a burden  and some  of the questions  
may make  the participant  uncomfortable.  Adverse  events  will be monitored,  reported,  
and treated  accordingly.

2.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
2.1 Background  
 
With  recent  advances  in treatment  the survival  rate of childhood  cancer  exceeds  
80%,1 such that 1 in 640 young  adults  in the United  States  is estimated  to be a 
pediatric  cancer  survivor.  A common  and potentially  debilitating  late effect  
of childhood  cancer  treatment  is neurocognitive  impairment,  particularly  
executive  dysfunction,  which  can limit  educational  attainment  and 
employment.2 
 
Prevalence  estimates  of neurocognitive  dysfunction  range  from  20% to 80% 
of the population  of cancer  survivors,  depending  on the diagnoses,  treatment,  
cognitive  assessment  procedure,  and definition  of impairment.3-6 Treatments  
such as cranial  radiation,  antimetabolite  chemotherapy  (i.e. methotrexate)  and 
corticosteroids  increase  the risk of neurocognitive  impairment.3,7-9 A recent  
study2 among  the survivors  of childhood  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia  (ALL)  
in the SJLIFE  cohort  showed  that the rate of neurocognitive  impairment  to be 
as high as 58.8%  for executive  functions,  the most  common  domain  of 
impairment,  with moderate  to severe  impairment  rates  as high as 33.5%.  
Furthermore,  risk of impairment  increased  with time from  diagnosis.  Across  
individual  skills,  moderate  to severe  impairment  (defined  as a score  <7th 
percentile  compared  to the normal  population)  rates  of 25%,  18%,  and 3.5%  
were  seen for cognitive  flexibility,  cognitive  fluency  and working  memory,  
respectively.2 Neurocognitive  impairment  impacts  multiple  areas  of adult  
functioning,  including  educational  attainment3, employment,3 health  
behaviors,10 quality  of life11 and social  functioning.3,12 Given  the potential  of 
pervasive  impact  of neurocognitive  impairment  on daily  life, interventions  
directed  at reducing  neurocognitive  dysfunction  among  long-term survivors  of 
childhood  cancer  are needed.  Even  though  many  studies  have  characterized  
neurocognitive  impairment  in long-term survivors  of childhood  cancer,  
limited  research  has focused  on developing  interventions  to improve  these  
well-established  late effects.13-15 Thus  there  is a strong  need  for intervention  
studies  that will improve  the neurocognitive  impairment  among  these  
survivors.  
2.2 Rationale:  
 
Cognitive  training  has been  used in an attempt  to improve  neurocognitive  
impairment  in cancer  survivors.  We recently  completed  a pilot study  of a 
cognitive  stimulation  trial to improve  function  in adult  survivors  of childhood  
cancer.  Twenty -one survivors  completed  six months  of regular  cognitive  
exercises,  with pre- and post-neurocognitive  testing.  Compared  to an equated

reference  group  tested  at a similar  interval,  those  who completed  training  
exercises  demonstrated  significant  improvement  in cognitive  flexibility  and 
processing  speed.  However,  the effect  sizes  were  relatively  small  and, given  
the long-standing  nature  of the impairment,  extended  training,  more  intensive  
training, or an additional intervention to  support  the training may be necessary  
to enhance  effects.  
 
A potentially  useful  tool to enhance  cognitive  intervention  is transcranial  
Direct  Current  Stimulation  (tDCS).  tDCS  involves  modulation  of cerebral  
cortex  excitability  by the application  of weak  direct  current  to the scalp16. 
tDCS  is a technique  that applies  safe, low level  direct  current  through  large  
pads on the scalp  to stimulate the  underlying  brain  region,  with current  level  < 
0.10 C/cm2 (as a reference,  tissue  damage  occurs  at levels  of ~ 200 C/cm2 or 
higher).16 The schematic  below  demonstrates  the manner  in which  the tDCS  
intervention  is delivered  to the participants.  
 
 
 
A cross -over study  of tDCS  on working  memory  using  healthy  volunteers  
showed  that tDCS  modulated  working  memory  performance  (measured  by 
letter  n-back)  by altering  dorsolateral  prefrontal  cortex  (DLPFC)  brain  activity  
in a polarity -specific  way,  in that anodal  tDCS  enhanced  the performance  
related  to working memory.17 Another study18 in healthy  volunteers  found that 
anodal  tDCS  of DLPFC  or the primary  motor  cortex  (M1)  increased  
performance  on a cognitive  or motor  task, respectively.18 
 
tDCS  is also a safe method  for enhancing  cortical responsivity.  A recent  meta - 
analysis19 looked  at over 200 studies  for adverse  events  (AE)  related  to active

tDCS  and found  that 56% of studies  reported  mild AEs and no studies  
reported  more  than mild  AE’s. The  most  common  AE’s  reported  were  itching,  
tingling,  mild headache,  and discomfort,  however,  none  of the AE’s  differed  
in frequency  between  the placebo  (sham  application)  and active  treatment  
groups.  Levels  of less than 2 mA of current  over 5-20 minutes  for 1-10 days 
has been  used in various  studies  without  significant  adverse  events.  In 
addition,  clinical  studies  have  demonstrated  efficacy  of tDCS  intervention  in 
reducing  neurocognitive  impairments  among  patients  suffering  from  strokes,20 
depression,21,22 psychosis,  and Alzheimer’s  disease23. However,  the usefulness  
of tDCS  has not been  evaluated  in long-term adult  survivors  of childhood  
cancer  exhibiting  neurocognitive  impairments.  Since  these  adults  have  likely  
experienced  neurocognitive  impairment  for many  years,  we believe  the 
application  of tDCS  will enhance  their ability  to benefit  from  cognitive  training.  
 
We propose  to conduct  a pilot study  to assess  the feasibility  and potential  
efficacy  of a 5-week  tDCS  intervention  paired  with cognitive  training  to 
improve  executive  function  in long-term adult  survivors  of childhood  ALL.  
Stimulation  and training  will be conducted  at home  twice  per week  for five 
weeks.  However,  prior  to initiating  the home  trial, we propose  to conduct  a 
trial in the clinic  in order  to evaluate  the short -term effect  of tDCS  on measures  
of executive  function.  This clinic -based  trial will also provide  participants  with 
on-sight  experience  with tDCS  under  direct  observation  prior  to beginning  the 
home -based  intervention  under  remote  observation.

3.3 Research  Participant  Recruitment  and Screening  
 
We propose  to utilize  the SJLIFE  alumnus  dataset  to identify  evaluable  adult  
long-term ALL  survivors.  Following  review  of the SJLIFE  patient  database,  
we have  identified  333 participants  with documented  executive  function  
impairment.  Participant  eligibility  will be identified  through  hospital  admission  
records  and consultations  with the SJLIFE  study  team  prior  to the patient’s  
SJLIFE  clinic  visit.  Individuals  eligible  for this study  will be mailed  a letter  to 
introduce  the study  and inform  him or her that they are eligible  for enrollment.  
The letter  will state that an interviewer  will be contacting  them  within  two 
weeks  to discuss  the study  and inquire  about  their desire  to participate.  A 
second  letter  and a second  phone  call will be attempted  two to four weeks  after 
the original  letter  if no initial  response  is received.  
 
A requirement  of ALLSTIM  eligibility  is to be a participant  in the SJLIFE  
study.  Patients  will be assessed  for the capacity  to consent  as part of SJLIFE  
recruitment.  If a participant  is assessed  to be competent  to consent  for SJLIFE,  
they will be competent  to consent  for ALLSTIM.

4 DESIGN  AND  METHODS  
 
4.1 DESIGN AND STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
The proposed  study  will be conducted  in two phases.  In Phase  I, the short - 
term effect  of tDCS  on performance  on measures  of executive  function  will be 
evaluated  over a two-day period.  After  assessing  the effect  in Phase  I, and 
providing  participants  with a directly  observed  experience  with tDCS,  the 
feasibility  of self-administering  tDCS  over long-term (5 weeks  with two 
sessions  per week)  using  a mobile  tDCS  device  and its potential  efficacy  will 
be evaluated  in Phase  II. The 5-week  intervention  will be paired  with cognitive  
stimulation  using  the Lumosity  Brain  Games  program  (www.lumosity.com ). 
This program  involves  cognitive  exercises  designed  to enhance  executive  
function  and processing  speed,  to be performed  on an institutionally  
provided  iPad.  Cognitive  stimulation  activities  can be completed  in 15-20 
minutes  per session.  The study  schema  is displayed  in the Figure  below:

A cross -over randomized  trial will be used in Phase  I. The survivors  will be 
randomized  to receive  either  the tDCS  intervention  at the current  dose level  of 
1mA  or Sham  for 15 minutes  on day 1 and then on day 2 the other  treatment  
will be provided  (i.e. those  who got tDCS  intervention  of day 1 will get sham  
on day 2 and vice versa).  The tDCS  intervention  will be delivered  by the 
Soterix  Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulator  Clinical  Trials  (1x1-CT). The 
effect  of one session  to tDCS  is expected  to last for about  two hours  thus 
conducting  the second  session the  next day will provide  sufficient  time for the 
“wash -out” and good  justification  for using  a cross -over design.  
 
In phase  II, the feasibility  and efficacy  of long-term (5 week)  self- 
administration  of the tDCS  intervention  will be evaluated  in concurrence  with 
self-administered  cognitive  stimulation.  In this phase  the research  participants  
will be taught  to use the mobile  tDCS  device and will be provided with one to 
take home.  The device  will be programmed  by the investigators  in advance  to 
control  the intensity  and duration  of the stimulation.  The research  participants  
will use the device  twice  per week  as directed.  Before  each session,  the 
participant  will use an institutionally  provided  iPad for video  conferencing  
with the study  center  to obtain  a unique  access  code  to start the tDCS  device  
and ensure  proper  device  placement.  Each  stimulation  session  for each 
participant  will have  a unique  access  code.  An AE evaluation  will be 
conducted  by a trained  study  team  member  every  week.  Research  participants  
will complete  remote  neurocognitive  testing  via the iPad before  and after 
phase  II. 
 
4.2 STUDY  PROCEDURES:  
 
4.2.1 Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulation  – Clinical  System  
 
The system  used for stimulation  is the Transcranial  Electrical  
Stimulation  1x1 Clinical  Trials  Device  manufactured  by 
Soterix  Medical.  This system  allows  for double -blinded  
application  of the intervention  or sham  treatment.  The 
intervention  consists  of a direct  current  of 1 mA applied  for 15

minutes.  The sham  procedure  provides  the same  small  current  
during  ramp  up to imitate  the intervention,  but the current  is 
discontinued  after ramp  up and no intervention  is provided.  
 
Direct current  is transferred  by a pair of saline -soaked  sponges,  
with the anode  attached  to the left frontal  region  (F3) and the 
cathode  attached  over the right  eyebrow  (Fp2).  Participants  
will be randomized to receive the intervention  on day 1 and the 
sham  on day 2 or vice versa.  Within  two hour of completing  
the intervention  and sham,  participants  will complete  the NIH 
Toolbox  Cognitive  Battery  on both days.  
4.2.2 Transcranial  Direct  Current  Stimulation  – Mobile  System:  
 
The mobile  transcranial  direct  current  stimulation  system  is 
manufactured  by  Soterix  Medical   and consists  of  a  battery  
pack,  control  unit and a self-positioning  headband  with 
sponges.  Participants  will be given  the device  after completing  
the clinical  portion  of the study  and trained  in correct  usage.  
Participants  will complete  two stimulation  sessions  per week  
for 5  weeks.  The sessions  will  provide  1  mA  DC for  15  
minutes  in the same  manner  as the clinical  system.  Participants  
will be supplied  iPads  for the cognitive  stimulation  training,  
and the iPad will be used to monitor  correct  tDCS  usage.  The 
tDCS  unit requires  a unique  code  for each stimulation  session.  
Study  staff will use video  conferencing  to confirm  correct  
electrode  placement,  then provide  the code  to initiate  treatment.  
Each  session  will be monitored  for compliance  and to assess  
any adverse  events.  
4.2.3 Cognitive  Training:  
 
Survivors  who complete  phase  I and continue  to phase  II will 
begin  the 5 week  cognitive  stimulation  program.  Participants  
will use the supplied  iPad to complete  online  cognitive  
stimulation  training  within  one hour of every  at-home  tDCS  
session.  The cognitive  training  program  was developed  by 
Lumosity  (see Appendix  for description  of Lumosity  program)  
and involves  training  of attention,  processing  speed,  working  
memory,  and executive  function  skill using  cognitive  tasks.  
Participants  will be asked  to engage  in training  for 20 minutes  
a day, two days per week.  Five cognitive  tasks  will be 
presented  during  each training  session. Survivors will  complete  
5-weeks  of stimulation  and training.  The Lumosity  program  
records  the day and time of training  and performance  on the 
training  activities  for each participant,  and these  records  are 
available  to study  staff via internet.  Adherence  to training  and

change  in performance  following  stimulation  sessions  will be 
examined.  
 
At the end of the 5-week  intervention,  participants  will mail 
back  the iPad  and tDCS  device  in a postage -paid and addressed  
FedEx  box provided  to them  at their study  visit.  
 
4.3 Adverse  Event  Monitoring:  
 
Reports  of adverse  events  will be monitored.  Adverse  events  will 
be surveyed  at the beginning  of each video  conference,  with 
symptoms  reports  for the prior  stimulation  session.  Adverse  event  
information  will be collected  by participant  reporting  and direct  
questioning  using  the patient  report  of incidence  of side effects  
(PRISE),  frequency  and intensity  of side effect  rating  (FISER),  
and global  rating  of side effects  burden  (GRSEB).  The PRISE  
form  assesses  the presence  of side effects  for a variety  of 
biological  systems.  For each of the nine organ/function  systems  
(gastrointestinal,  nervous  system,  heart,  eyes/ears,  skin,  
genital/urinary,  sleep,  sexual  functioning,  and other),  the 
participant  indicates  the presence  of a side effect,  and if present,  
the tolerability  of the side effect  (tolerable  or distressing).  The 
FISER  and GRSEB  assess  three  domains  of side effect  impact:  
frequency,  intensity,  and burden.  Each  domain  is rated  on a 7- 
point  Likert  scale  (i.e. Frequency,  ranging  from  no side effects  to 
present  all the time;  Intensity,  ranging  from  no side effects  to 
intolerable;  and Burden,  ranging  from  no impairment  to unable  to 
function  due to side effects).  Reliability  and validity  have  been  
reported.  
 
 
5 REQUIRED EVALUATIONS,  TESTS,  AND OBSERVATIONS  
 
5.1 Pre-Study  Evaluations  
 
5.1.1 Baseline  Neurocognitive  Evaluation  
 
SJLIFE  Evaluation:  All participants  in SJLIFE  undergo  
neurocognitive  testing  as part of the SJLIFE  parent  protocol.  This 
evaluation  involves  assessment  of intelligence,  academic  skills,  
processing  speed,  attention,  working  memory,  long-term memory,  
and executive  functions.  Specific  tests include:  
 
 Wechsler  Abbreviated  Scale  of Intelligence  
 Woodcock -Johnson -III: Tests  of Achievement  
 Letter -Word  Identification

 Calculation  
 Wechsler  Adult  Intelligence  Scale -Third  
Edition  
 Digit  Symbol -Coding  
 Symbol  Search  
 Digit  Span  
 Trail  Making  Test 
 Conners ' Continuous  Performance  Test-II 
 California  Verbal  Learning  Test-II 
 Brief  Symptom  Inventory  
 Verbal  Fluency  Test 
 Test of Memory  and Learning  Visual  
Selective  Reminding  
 
We will use this testing,  which  is already  ongoing,  to identify  
survivors  who are eligible  for this study  (<10th percentile  on Digit  
Span  Backward,  Trail  Making  Part B, or Verbal  Fluency).  
 
 
5.2 Evaluations  During  Therapy  
 
5.2.1 NIH  Toolbox  – Cognitive  Battery  
We will use the three  tests from  the Cognitive  Battery  of the 
NIH Toolbox24 to evaluate  the acute  effect  of tDCS  on 
executive  function.  These  three  measures  have  a computerized  
format  and are nationally  standardized.  Testing  will occur  post- 
intervention  (total  2 times)  during  phase  I. 
 
NIH Toolbox  Dimensional  Change  Card  Sort Test (DCCS):  
The DCCS  specifically  taps cognitive  flexibility,  with 
performance  generally  increasing  through  childhood  and then 
declining  across  the adult  age. A total of 40 trials  require  4 
minutes.  Scoring  is based  on a combination  of accuracy  and 
reaction  time.  This combination  score  is then converted  to a 
scale  score  with mean  of 100 and SD of 15, where  higher  
scores  indicate  higher  levels  of cognitive  flexibility.  
 
NIH Toolbox  Flanker  Inhibitory  Control  and Attention  Test:  
The Flanker  taps inhibitory  control  and attention,  the capacity  
for new learning  and information processing  in novel  situations  
– measure,  in which  performance  reaches  a peak  in early  
adulthood,  and then tends  to decline  across  the life span.  A 
total of  40  trials  require  4  minutes.  Scoring   is  based  on  a  
combination  of accuracy  and reaction  time,  this combination  
score  is then converted  to a scale  score  with mean  of 100 and

SD of 15, where  higher  scores  indicate  higher  executive  
function.  
 
NIH Toolbox  List Sorting  Working  Memory  Test:  List Sorting  
is tapping  both information  processing  and storage,  with 
performance  tending  to peak  in early  adulthood  and then 
declining  across  the life span.  The raw score  obtained  is 
converted  to Age-Adjusted  to the national  norms.  Higher  
scores  on each of these  indicate  higher  levels  of working  
memory.  This task assesses  working  memory  and requires  the 
participant  to sequence  different  visually - and orally -presented  
stimuli.  The list scoring  task takes  approximately  7 minutes  to 
administer.  List Sorting  is scored  by summing  the total number  
of items  correctly  recalled  and sequenced  on Lists -1 and -2, 
which  can range  from  0-26. 
 
5.2.2 Gray  Oral  Reading  Test 
The Gray  Oral Reading  Test (GORT)  will be used to measure  
reading  comprehension.  The GORT  is one of the most  widely  
used measures  of oral reading  fluency  and comprehension  in 
the United  States.  Participants  will be asked  to read a set of 
passages  and recall specific details  from the stories.  Responses  
to the test require  literal  as well as inferential  comprehension,  
the latter  of which  involves  executive  function.  Two stories  
will be given  each day, one day from  Form  A and one day from  
Form  B. Raw scores  will be calculated  for total accuracy,  and 
compared   within   participants.   Total    testing    time   will 
be approximately  5 minutes  after each clinical  tDCS  session.  
 
5.2.3 Woodcock  Johnson  Understanding  Directions  
The Woodcock  Johnson  Understanding  Directions  is a measure  
of listening  comprehension.  The task requires the participant  to 
listen  to a series  of complex  instructions  and then follow  the 
directions  by pointing  to various  objects  in a colored  picture.  
Directions  require  sequential  and logical  reasoning,  
components  of executive  function.  Four  complex  instructions  
will be administered  each day, from  alternate  test forms,  and 
raw scores  will be calculated  and compared within  participants.  
Total  testing  time will be approximately  5 minutes  after each 
clinical  tDCS  session.  
 
 
5.2.4 Remote  Assessment  Procedures  
We have  recently  completed  a pilot study  to evaluate  the 
accuracy  of remote cognitive  assessment,  using  web and phone  
based  procedures.25   We will employ  these  procedures  prior  to

and following  the initiation of phase  II of the trial. Specifically,  
the following  tests will be administered:  
 
Televideo -based  assessment : 
Neurocognitive  testing  will be conducted  via video  
conferencing  with the iPad.  At a scheduled  time,  an examiner  
will contact  the participant.  The following  clinical  measures  
will be administered:  
 
 Digit  Span  Test 
 Verbal  Fluency  Test 
 Oral Trail  Making  Test 
 CCSS  Neurocognitive  Questionnaire

7 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
7.1 Reporting  Adverse  Experiences and Deaths  to St. Jude IRB 
 
Only  “unanticipated  problems  involving  risks  to participants  or others”  
referred  to hereafter  as “unanticipated  problems”  are 
required  to be reported  to the St. Jude  IRB promptly,  but  
in no event  later  than  10 working  days  after  the investigator   
first  learns   of  the  unanticipated   problem.  
 
 
Revision  0.2, dated:  11-12-15 
Protocol  document  date:  11-12-15 IRB approval  date:

Page  13  
  
Regardless  of whether  the event  is internal  or external  (for 
example,  an IND safety  report  by the sponsor  pursuant  to 
21 CFR  312.32),  only adverse  events  that constitute  
unanticipated  problems  are reportable  to the St. Jude  IRB.  
As further  described  in the definition  of unanticipated  
problem,  this includes  any event  that in the PI’s opinion  
was:  
 Unexpected  (in terms  of nature,  severity,  or frequency)  given  (1) 
the research  procedures  that are described  in the protocol -related  
documents,  such as the IRB-approved  research  protocol  and 
informed  consent  document,  as well as other  relevant  information  
available  about  the research;  (2) the observed  rate of occurrence  
(compared  to a credible  baseline  for comparison);  and (3) the 
characteristics  of the subject  population  being  studied;  and 
 
 Related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research;  and 
 
 Serious;  or if not serious  suggests  that the research  places  subjects  
or others  at a greater  risk of harm  (including  physical,  
psychological,  economic,  or social  harm)  than was previously  
known  or recognized.  
 
Unrelated,  expected  deaths  do not require  reporting  to the IRB.  Though  death  
is “serious”,  the event  must  meet  the other  two requirements  of “related  or 
possibly  related”  and “unexpected/unanticipated”  to be considered  reportable.  
Deaths  meeting  reporting  requirements  are to be reported  immediately  to the 
St. Jude IRB,  but in no event  later than 48 hours  after the investigator  first 
learns  of the death.  
 
The  following  definitions   apply  with   respect   to  reporting   adverse  
experiences:  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event:  Any adverse  event  temporally  associated  
with  the subject’s  participation  in research  that meets  any 
of the following  criteria:  
 results  in death;  
 is life-threatening  (places  the subject  at immediate  risk of 
death  from  the event  as it occurred);  
 requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization;  
 results  in a persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;

 results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  or 
 any other  adverse  event  that, based  upon  appropriate  
medical  judgment,  may jeopardize  the subject’s  health  and 
may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one 
of the other  outcomes  listed  in this definition  (examples  of 
such events  include:  any substantial disruption  of the ability  
to conduct  normal  life functions,  allergic  bronchospasm  
requiring  intensive  treatment  in the emergency  room  or at 
home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
inpatient  hospitalization,  or the development  of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse),  a congenital  anomaly/birth  
defect,  secondary  or concurrent  cancer,   medication  overdose,  
or is any medical  event  which  requires  treatment  to prevent  
any of the medical  outcomes  previously  listed.  
Unexpected Adverse Event:  
 Any adverse  event  for which  the specificity  or severity  is 
not consistent  with the protocol -related  documents,  
including  the applicable  investigator  brochure,  IRB 
approved  consent  form,  Investigational  New  Drug  (IND)  or 
Investigational  Device  Exemption  (IDE)  application,  or 
other  relevant  sources  of information,  such as product  
labeling  and package  inserts;  or if it does appear  in such 
documents,  an event  in which  the specificity,  severity  or 
duration  is not consistent  with the risk information  included  
therein;  or 
 The observed  rate of occurrence  is a clinically  significant  
increase  in the expected  rate (based  on a credible  baseline  
rate for comparison);  or 
 The occurrence  is not consistent  with the expected  natural  
progression  of any underlying  disease,  disorder,  or condition  
of the subject(s)   experiencing  the  adverse  event   and  the 
subject’s  predisposing  risk factor  profile  for the adverse  
event.  
 
Internal  Events:  Events  experienced  by a research  participant  
enrolled  at a site under  the jurisdiction  of St. Jude  IRB for 
either  multicenter  or single -center  research  projects.

Page  15  
  
External  Events:  Events  experienced  by participants  enrolled  at a 
site external  to the jurisdiction  of the St. Jude  Institutional  
Review  Board  (IRB)  or in a study  for which  St. Jude  is not 
the coordinating  center  or the IRB of record.  
 
Unanticipated  Problem  Involving  Risks  to Subjects  or Others:  An 
unanticipated  problem  involving  risks  to subjects  or others  
is an event  which  was not expected  to occur  and which  
increases  the degree  of risk posed  to research  participants.  
Such  events,  in general,  meet  all of the following  criteria:  
 unexpected;  
 related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research;  
and 
 suggests  that the research  places  subjects  or others  at a greater  
risk of harm  (including  physical,  psychological,  economic,  
or social  harm)  than was previously  known  or recognized. 
An unanticipated problem  involving  risk to subjects  or others 
may exist  even when actual  harm does  not occur  to any 
participant.  
 
 
Consistent  with  FDA  and OHRP  guidance  on reporting  unanticipated  
problems  and adverse  events  to IRBs,  the St. Jude  IRB 
does  not require  the submission  of external  events , for 
example  IND safety  reports,  nor is a summary  of such  
events/reports  required;  however,  if an event  giving  rise to 
an IND safety  or other  external  event  report  constitutes  an 
“unanticipated  problem  involving  risks  to subjects  or 
others”  it must  be reported  in accordance  with  this policy.  
In general,  to be reportable  external  events  need  to have  
implications  for the conduct  of the study  (for example,  
requiring  a significant  and usually  safety -related  change  in 
the protocol  and/or  informed  consent  form).  
 
Although  some  adverse  events   will qualify  as unanticipated   problems  
involving  risks  to subjects  or others,  some  will not; and 
there  may be other  unanticipated  problems  that go beyond  
the definitions  of serious  and/or  unexpected  adverse  events.  
Examples  of unanticipated  problems  involving  risks  to 
subjects  or others  include:  
 
 Improperly  staging  a participant’s  tumor  resulting  in the participant  
being  assigned  to an incorrect  arm of the research  study;

Page  16  
  
 The theft of a research  computer  containing  confidential  subject  
information  (breach  of confidentiality);  and 
 The contamination  of a study  drug.  Unanticipated  problems  
generally  will warrant  consideration  of substantive  changes  in the 
research  protocol  or informed  consent  process/document  or other  
corrective  actions  in order  to protect  the safety,  welfare,  or rights  of 
subjects  or others.  
 
All anticipated  Grade  III or IV adverse  events  will be reported  to the IRB in the 
continuing  review  report  and/or  summary.  The study  teams  will monitor  accrual  
and toxicities  every  six months.  
 
 
7.2 Recording  Adverse  Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
 
All serious  adverse  events  will be recorded  in the source,  database  and/or  case 
report  form.  Adverse  events  unrelated  to the trial will not be recorded  unless  they 
are grade  III or above  (CTCAEv4).  Adverse  events  that are related  to the trial will 
be captured  in the source  document,  database  and/or  case report  form.  Adverse  
events  related  to the trial will be collected  until the time the study  completes.  
 
 
 
 
8 DATA  COLLECTION,  STUDY  MONITORING,  AND  
CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
8.1 Data  Collection  
Data  for this study  will be managed  by the Neuropsychology  Research  Team  in 
the Department  of Epidemiology  and Cancer  Control.  Data  collected  at   
baseline  and follow -up assessments  will be entered  by optical  scanning.  The 
optical  scanning  program  has the capacity  for designer  specific  error  checks,  
flagged  at the time the questionnaires  are scanned.  After  data are scanned,  they 
are processed  and converted  into a SAS (Cary,  NC) format  where  a second  error  
check  is completed.  Data  from  neurocognitive  tests are double -entered           
into a separate  secure  Access  database  and compared  for accuracy.  All data 
mismatches  will be reviewed  by two members  of the survey  center  staff and 
compared  to the original  documents  (when  applicable)  for resolution.  NIH 
Toolbox  data will be stored  on remote  computer  servers  and will be completely  
de-identified.  Data  from  the tDCS  mobile  units  and the cognitive  training  
(Lumosity)  will be downloaded  and processed  by the study  team  using   
software  provided  by the product  manufacturers.

8.2 Study  Monitoring  
 
The study  team  will hold monthly  meetings  and review  case histories  or quality  
summaries  on participants.  The PI and study  team  will be responsible  for 
ensuring  protocol  compliance.   Continuing  reviews  by the IRB and CT-SRC  
will occur  at least annually.  
 
This study  is associated  with an Investigational  Device  Exemption  (IDE)  and 
will be monitored  by the St. Jude Clinical Research  Monitors  accordingly.  The 
monitors  will review  up to 15% of the study  participants  semi -annually  for 
appropriateness  of the informed  consent  process,  eligibility,  adverse  event  
recording  and participant’s  status.   Additional  information  may be monitored  at 
the request  of the Internal  Monitoring  Committee  (IMC),  the IRB,  or other  
institutional  administration.  
 
Source  document  verification  of eligibility  and informed  consent  for 100%  of 
St. Jude participants  will be performed  by the Eligibility  Coordinators  within  5 
working  days of completion  of enrollment.  The Clinical  Research  Monitor  will 
review  all SAE  reports  and other  applicable  essential  regulatory  documentation.  
The Monitor  will generate  a formal  report  which  is shared  with the Principal  
Investigator  (PI), study  team,  and the Internal  Monitoring  Committee  (IMC).  
 
8.3 Confidentiality  
Confidentiality  will be maintained.  Data forms  will be kept in locked  file 
cabinets,  in locked  offices,  accessed  only by study  staff on an “as needed”  
hierarchical  basis.  All electronic  files will stored  on a password  protected  
computer  and identifying  information  will be stored  in separate  electronic  files 
and linked  by participant  number.  Data  files downloaded  for statistical  
analyses  will not contain  personal  identifiers.  
 
The medical  records  of study  participants  may be reviewed  by the St. Jude 
IRB,  FDA,  clinical  research  monitors,  etc. 
 
 
 
9 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The sample  size justification  will be based  on evaluating  the primary  
objective,  as that objective  is the basic  design  of how the intervention  will be 
delivered  in a subsequent  randomized  controlled  trial should  this pilot study  
prove  feasible.  We will consider  the trial to be feasible  if at least 50% of the 
survivors  are able to complete  5 sessions  (tDCS  along  with cognitive  
stimulation)  successfully  out of 10.  Any participant  who completes  Phase  I,

but is unwilling  to participate  in Phase  II due to the tDCS  procedure  will be 
counted  towards  failure.  In the testing  of hypothesis  framework  we would  like 
to test the null hypothesis  H0:P≤0.5  vs. H1:P1>0.7.  Then,  using  Simon’s  two- 
stage  Minimax  design  with type I error  rate =0.05  and power  (1-)=0.8  we 
have  the following  stopping  rules.  As an additional  measure  of feasibility,  the 
consent  rate must  be >50%  among  all participants  approached  to participate.  
Study  staff will track  study  enrollment,  and the study  statistician  will make  the 
determination  for study  continuation.  
 
In the first stage  we will recruit  23 survivors  and if the number  of survivors  
who complete  at least 5 sessions  is at least 13 then we will proceed to the next 
stage  and recruit  an additional  14 survivors  and if at least 24 survivors  out of 
37 complete  at least 5 sessions  then the tDCS  trial would  be considered  
feasible.  However,  since  we expect  that roughly 20% of the survivors  may not 
initiate  the trial after leaving  the institution  (i.e. may not provide  any 
information  at all for objective  1.1.1)  we anticipate  replacing  these  survivors  
and, thus,  a total of 45 survivors  will be needed  for evaluating  the Phase  II 
objective.  Participant  accrual  will cease  when  37 participants  agree  to 
participate  in Phase  II. 
 
With  37 survivors  recruited  for phase  I of the study,  we will have  roughly  
97.7%  power  for objective  1.2.1  to detect  an improvement  of 0.65 in 
standardized  units,  respectively,  with type I error  =0.05.  
 
Analysis:  
 
Objective  1.1.1:  The feasibility of the 5-week tDCS  intervention  will be 
evaluated  using  Simon's  two stage  Minimax  design  with stopping  rules  
described  above.  
 
Objective  1.2.1:  The improvement  in scores  on symbol  digit coding,  Stroop  
test, shifting  attention  test, digit span and verbal  fluency  from  baseline  to 5- 
week  follow  up will be done  using  matched  pair one sample  t-tests.  In addition,  
the improvement  in EF measures  over the 5 week  period  will also be evaluated  
using  longitudinal  methods  and implemented  using  PROC  MIXED  or PROC  
GEE  in SAS 9.3. 
 
Objective  1.2.2:  The improvement  in the scores  on the NIH Toolbox  Card  
Sort,  Flanker  and Working  Memory  tasks  between  tDCS  and sham,  will be 
done  using  matched  pair one sample  t-test. 
 
 
It will be important  to monitor  for AEs in both phases  of the study  as well.  
Thus,  in an “ad hoc”  manner  using  one sided  95% confidence  bounds  we will 
monitor  for all grade  3 or higher  adverse  events  (All types  of AE's  included)

which  are related  to study  interventions.  Among  the 45 patients  enrolled in  the 
study,  if at any time point  at least 5 patients  (≥5) have  grade  3 or higher  
toxicity,  the 95% lower  confidence  limit would  be 0.059  suggesting  that the 
true AE rate could  be higher  than 5% which  would  be unacceptable,  the 
feasibility  of the 5 week  intervention  would  be questionable  and a 
consideration  will be given  to stop or amend  the trial.

10 OBTAINING  INFORMED  CONSENT  
Participants  will be briefly  introduced  to the study  during  the consent  process  
for SJLIFE  and told there  is a possibility  they may qualify  for this study.  
Eligible  participants  will be identified  after the completion  of the 
neurocognitive  testing  done  as part of the SJLIFE  protocol.  The participant  
will be informed  they are eligible  to participate  in this protocol  at that time.  A 
member  of the study  team will  explain  the study  and review  the potential  risks  
and benefits.  The study  team  will assure  that the potential  participant  
understands  what  the research  study  involves  and the potential  risks  when  the 
participant  agrees  to participate.  Upon  agreeing  to participate,  the consent  
form  will be signed  by the subject  and/or  guardian  and investigator/designee.  Anticipated  Primary  Completion  Date:  December  1, 2016

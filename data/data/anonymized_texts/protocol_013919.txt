Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   1 Introduction  
1.1 Background  
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS -CoV -2)) has spread rapidly since its recent identification in patients with severe 
pneumonia in Wuhan, China and resulted in a worldwide pandemic (COVID -19).  G iven the 
burden of disease, effective treatments are urgently required.  
 
The 2 019-nCoV has affinity for cell s in the lower respiratory tract and can replicate there, 
causing radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract lesions in patients who do not present 
with clinical pneumonia. There seem to be three major patterns of the clinical course of 
infection: mi ld illness with upper respiratory tract presenting symptoms; non -life-threatening 
pneumonia; and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that 
begins with mild symptoms for 7 –8 days and then progresses to rapid deterioration and ARD S 
requiring advanced life support.  
 
In clinical and epidemiological data from the Chinese CDC regarding 72,314 case records, 
providing an important illustration of the epidemiologic curve of the Chinese outbreak, the 
overall case -fatality rate (on confirme d cases) was 2.3%.  Of note, the fatal cases were 
primarily elderly patients, in particular those aged ≥ 80 years (about 15%) and 70 to 79 years 
(8.0%). Approximately half (49.0%) of the critical patients were affected by preexisting 
comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and 
oncological diseases died.  
 
In one of the first reports on the disease, Huang et al. illustrated that patients (n = 41) suffered 
from fever, malaise, dry cough, and dyspnea. Chest computerized tomography (CT) scans 
showed pneumonia with abnormal findings in all cases. The clinical sp ectrum of COVID -19 
varies from asymptomatic or pauci -symptomatic forms to clinical conditions characterized by 
respiratory failure that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care 
unit (ICU), to multi -organ and systemic manifestati ons in terms of sepsis, septic shock, and 
multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS). In an initial report, about a third of patients 
required ICU care and 15% of cases were fatal. Similarly, in a more recent report of 201 
hospitalized patient, 41.8% deve loped acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 
52.4% of these patients die.   
 
In Italy, the case -fatality rate has been reported at 7.2%. Furthermore, in an initial US 
experience of 21 critically ill patients, 11 had died at the time of publication,  and only 2 
survived transfer out of the ICU, highlighting the need for effective treatments before patients 
become critically ill.   
 
Among the severe clinical manifestations, there are severe pneumonia and ARDS. Although 
the clinical course of the disease  seems to predict a favorable tr end in the majority of patients;  
in a percentage of cases still to be defined , after about a week, there is a sudden worsening of 
clinical conditions with rapidly worsening respiratory failure and MOD /MOF . Criteria for 
defin ition of specific subpopulations are defined:  
  Confidential  Page 7 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   • Severe Pneumonia . Fever is associated with severe dyspnea, respiratory distress, 
tachypnea (> 30 breaths/min), and hypoxia (SpO2 < 90% on room air). However, the fever 
symptom must be interpreted carefully as  even in severe forms of the disease, it c an be 
moderate or even absent.  
• Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  The diagnosis requires clinical and 
ventilatory criteria. This syndrome is suggestive of a serious new -onset respiratory failure or 
of worsening of an already -identified respiratory picture. Different forms of ARDS are 
distinguished based on the degree of hypoxia.  The reference parameter is the PaO2/FiO2: a 
ratio ≤ 315 is suggestive of ARDS.  
 
 Mild ARDS: 200 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg. In  non-ventilated patients or in 
those managed through non -invasive ventilation (NIV) by using positive end -
expiratory pressure (PEEP) or a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ≥ 5 
cmH2O.  
 Moderate ARDS: 100 mmHg < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg.  
 Severe ARDS: PaO 2/FiO2 ≤ 100 mmHg.  
 
Unfortunately, no drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat human coronaviruses. 
Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of 2019 -nCoV, 
including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide -based therapies, peptides, 
interferon and small -molecule  therapies . Although the potential repurposing of existing 
antiviral agents to treat COVID -19 is already moving into  clinical trials, new interventions 
based on drugs directly active on the virus itsel f are likely to require months to years to 
develop.  
 
Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID -19 might 
have a cytokine storm syndrome , leading to pneumonia, respiratory failure, need for 
mechanical ventilation, and often  death . The identification of hyper -inflammation and 
treatment using existing therapies that are either in clinical development or approved in 
other indications with understood safety profiles is a relevant option to address the 
immediate need to reduce th e rising mortality  and need for ventilatory support .  
 
In light of  pathological findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, 
timely and appropriate use of drugs aimed at reducing inflammation in a targeted way, 
together with ventilator suppo rt, should be considered for patients with hyper -inflammation  to 
prevent and treat ARDS  development . A cytokine profile resembling secondary 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) is associated with COVID -19 disease severity, 
characterized by increased interleukin (IL) -2, IL -7, granulocyte -colony stimulating factor, 
interferon -γ inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1 -α, and tumor necrosis factor -α. Predictors of fatality from a recent 
retrospective, mu lticenter study of 150 confirmed COVID -19 cases in Wuhan, China, 
included elevated ferritin (mean 1297.6 ng/ml in non -survivors vs 614.0 ng.ml in survivors ; 
p<0.001) and IL -6 (p<0.0001) suggesting that mortality might be due to a dysfunctional 
hyper -inflam matory res ponse while clearing the virus ( i.e. a hyperinflammatory state driven 
by the host, not the virus ).  
  Confidential  Page 8 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020    
In hyper -inflammation, immunosuppression is likely to be beneficial. In fact, in a subgroup 
analysis of a randomized controlled trial, patients with sepsis and organ dysfunction or hyper -
inflammation had improved survival with IL -1 receptor antagonism, and  this therapy has not 
been associated with adverse events, even at high doses. A multicenter, randomized controlled 
trial of tocilizumab (IL -6 receptor blockade, licensed for cytokine release syndrome), has been 
approved in China in patients with COVID -19 pneumonia and elevated IL -6 
(ChiCTR2000029765).  
 
In our study, we aim to enroll patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia and hyper -
inflammation to identify the subgroup of patients for whom immunosuppression could 
prevent worsening of pulmonary status, inc luding the need for ventilatory support, with the 
aim ultimately to improve mortality.   
 
Rationale for mavrilimumab  
GM-CSF strongly activates macrophages and is considered to be a pro -inflammatory 
cytokine. GM - CSF production is associated with tissue infl ammation. GM CSF -derived 
signals are critically involved in the differentiation of macrophages and in the proliferation 
and activation of other immune cells. GM -CSF-activated macrophages produce pro -
inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor ( TNF), IL -1β, IL -6, IL -23 and IL -12. 
In addition, GM -CSF receptor activation triggers stimulation of multiple downstream 
signaling pathways, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 5 (STAT5), the mitogen -activated pr otein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the 
phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, all relevant in activation and differentiation of 
myeloid cells.  
 
Under physiologic conditions, levels of circulating GM -CSF are low, but levels are elevated 
in inflammatory con ditions. Several cell types can serve as a source of GM -CSF, including 
fibroblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, 
and cancer cells, with most production occurring locally at the site of inflammation. Th is in 
turn exacerbates the inflammatory reaction via cytokine pathways that have been termed the 
colony stimulating factor network. GM -CSF can be induced by inflammatory cytokines and in 
turn increases production of pro -inflammatory cytokines, thus functio ning as a feed -forward 
inflammatory amplifier.  
 
Zhou et al (2020) recently reported elevated levels of GM -CSF in the lungs of patients with 
COVID -19, specifically showing that, after the 2019 -nCoV infection, CD4+T lymphocytes 
are rapidly activated to becom e pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM -CSF, etc. 
The cytokine environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high 
expression of IL -6 and accelerates the inflammation. The authors further contend that these 
aberrant and excessive imm une cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers 
and play an immune -mediated damaging role, causing lung dysfunction  and rapid  mortality.  
 
GM-CSF signals through GM -CSF-R, which consists of a specific ligand -binding α -chain 
(GM CSF -Rα) and a signal -transducing β -chain (GM CSF -Rβ) that is common to IL -3 and 
IL-5 receptors. Hence, GMCSF -R signaling can be specifically targeted with antibodies 
  Confidential  Page 9 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   directed at GM -CSF-Rα. Mavrilimumab is an anti -GM CSF -Rα monoclonal antibody (human 
isoform IgG4) previo usly developed by MedImmune and now in development by Kiniksa 
Pharmaceuticals that has been shown to inhibit the GM -CSF signaling axis in humans and 
improve clinical outcomes measures in a Phase 2 program in Rheumatoid Arthritis.  
 
 
1.2 Purpose  
The purpose of this p rospective, proof -of-concept Phase 2, multicenter , blinded, randomized 
placebo controlled study is to demonstrate that early treatment with  mavrilimumab  prevents 
progression of respiratory failure in patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia and clinic al and 
biological features of hyper -inflammation . These results will lead to an d inform a Phase III 
randomized placebo -controlled trial.   
2 Objectives and endpoints  
Primary Objective  
To demonstrate that early treatment with mavrilimumab  prevents progression of respiratory 
failure in patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia and clinical and biologica l features of 
hyper -inflammation . 
 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate mortality  
• To evaluate the duration of hospitalization  
• To evaluate safety of mavrilimumab  
 
 
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the  proportion of subjects ali ve and off of oxygen at day 14.   
When  hospitalized patients are off of oxygen, this will be documented as an oxygen saturation 
>90% for at least 5 minutes at rest. For patients that ar e discharged before day 14, a telehealth 
visit will be performed at day 14. For patients discharged off of oxygen before day 14, the day 
14 visit will assess that they are off of oxygen. For patients who are discharged on oxygen 
before day 14, the decision  to discontinue oxygen will be based on standard clinical care 
according to the health provider who prescribed oxygen therapy. The day 14 telehealth visit 
will assess whether the patient remains on oxygen , and “off of oxygen ” will be defined as no 
suppleme ntal oxygen use for at least the previous 24 hours.

Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary end -point s are alive at day 28 , and  the proportion of subjects alive and without 
respiratory failure at 28 days. Respiratory failure is defined as needing mechanical v entilation, 
non-invasive ventilation, or high -flow oxygen.  
 
 
Exploratory Endpoints   
 Mortality at day 14  
 Mortality at day 60  
 Proportion of patients in each category  according to the following ordinal scale at day 
7, 14, 21, and 28 : 
1. Not hospitalized  
2. Hospitalized, no supplemental oxygen  
3. Hospitalized, on supplemental oxygen  
4. Hospitalized, requiring nasal high -flow oxygen or non -invasive ventilation  
5. Hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation or both  
6. Death  
 Freedom from mechan ical ventilation  
 Duration of hospitalization  
 Change in SOFA score at day 7, day 14, day 21, and day 28, or until discharge  
 Reduction in CRP at day 7 and day 14 (understanding that labs may be obtained until 
patient discharge)  
 Time to negative SARS -CoV2 RNA  levels in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs  
 Worst value for PaO2/FiO2 (or SaO2/FiO2 if PaO2 not available) at day 3, day 5, day 
7, day 14, day 21 and day 28, or until discharge  
 Safety including number of adverse events and serious adverse events  
 
3 Study design  
This prospective, proof -of-concept Phase 2, multi -center, blinded randomized placebo -
controlled study is designed to demonstrate t hat early treatment with mavrili mumab prevents 
progression of respiratory failure in patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia and clinical and 
biological features of hyper -inflammation  while gathering data to support a larger Phase III 
randomized controlled trial.  
The study population includes patients who meet criteria of impending mechanical ventilation.   
  Confidential  Page 11 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   Enrollmen t: The study will be performed in approximately 4 months total, starting from the first 
patient enrolled with enrollment expected to complete within 2 months.  
Follow -up period: The follow -up period is 60 days for each patient enrolled.  
A total of 60  patien ts will be randomized using  a 1:1 allocation ratio: 30 subjects will receive 
mavrilimumab at 6mg/kg  IV, and 30  subjects will receive placebo infusion.  The investigator, 
clinical team, and subject will be blinded to treatment assignment.   
Participants will  be identified by regular review of hospitalized COVID19 patients to evaluate 
for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will then be approached in the standard manner 
by study investigator and coordinator/research nurse.  
Research interventions will take place in the hospital in accordance with privacy standards.   
The study team is informed on all study procedures and requirements with daily meeting s and 
the opportunity to continuously update through secure channels.  
In th is multicenter consortium, each participating site will have their own IND for patients 
enrolled at their site. However, data collection, data analysis, and randomization scheme will 
be performed at one site, Cleveland Clinic C5 Research.  
4 Rationale  
4.1 Ration ale for study design  
We aim to enroll patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia and hyper -inflammation  to 
identify the subgroup of patients for whom immunosuppression could prevent worsening of 
pulmonary status, including the need for ventilatory support, wi th the aim ultimately to improve 
mortality.  
4.1.1  Rationale for choice of background therapy  
Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID -19 might have 
a cytokine storm syndrome. The identification and treatment of hyper -inflammat ion using 
existing therapies with understood safety profiles that are either in clinical development or 
approved in other indications is a relevant option to address the immediate need to reduce the 
rising mortality.  
Mavrilimumab is an anti -GM CSF -Rα monoc lonal antibody (human isoform IgG4) previously 
developed by MedImmune and now in development by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals that has been 
shown to inhibit the GM -CSF signaling axis in humans and improve clinical outcomes measures 
in a Phase 2 program in Rheuma toid Arthritis.  
4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment  
Preliminary, publicly  available data suggest  efficacy of mavrilimumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg IV . 
However, these results are from an open -label study, and the results from our Phase II 
randomized, placebo controlled trial may inform the design and dose  for larger studies.   
 
  Confidential  Page 12 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   In a Phase 1 single -ascending -dose (SAD) study, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of mavrilimumab 
were tested at doses of 0.01 -10 mg/kg  in patients with mild -to-moderate RA.  Mavrilimumab 
was well -tolerated in a single IV injection up to 10 mg/kg in subjects with mild to moderate 
RA at all dose levels. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulations from studies in 
subjects with RA, coupled with the PK data form the Phase 1 st udy, indicate that a single dose 
of  ≥3 mg/kg will provide EC90 (the concentration that leads to 90% maximal response) for 
the RA endpoint ACR50 (American College of Rheumatology 50% response criteria; data on 
file) for up to 22 days. Therefore, at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg, the pharmacologic profiles indicated 
sustained peripheral inhibition of the GM -CSF-Rα signaling axis for at least three weeks.  
 
In preclinical studies, the potential systemic effects of mavrilimumab (CAM -3001) have been 
investigated in a 4 -week an d an 11 -week repeat dose cynomolgus monkey study. There were 
no effects attributable to intravenous (IV) administration of CAM -3001 (mavrilimumab) in 
doses up to 100 mg/kg/week for 4 weeks in a study conducted in accordance with Good 
Laboratory Practice (G LP). In an 11 -week exploratory (non -GLP) study, there were no effects 
attributable to IV administration of CAM -3001 (mavrilimumab) following 10 mg/kg/week, 
and the no observed adverse event level (NOAEL) was 100 mg/kg/week. An 
immunocytochemistry screen to  test in vitro binding of CAM -3001 (mavrilimumab) to a panel 
of normal human tissues revealed no non -specific or unanticipated binding of the antibody.  
Reference for further details on safety studies in animals and humans is made to the 
investigator broch ure.  
 
However, with regards to mitigation of the aberrant immune response in the setting of 
COVID -19, it is unclear whether blockade of GM -CSF in the lung is required in addition to 
abolition of signaling in the periphery. Studies with the mavrilimumab su rrogate anti -mouse 
GM-CSF-Rα antagonistic antibody, CAM -3003, were performed to interrogate the pulmonary 
vs peripheral pharmacodynamics of ascending single and repeat doses. Single doses of 3 -30 
mg/kg delivered intra -peritoneally showed no pharmacodynamic  effects in the lungs (as 
assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid assay), despite the 3 mg/kg dose 
demonstrating complete receptor occupancy (RO) in the periphery. Pharmacodynamic effects 
in the lungs, measured by IL -6 induction from BAL cells (72% ± 11% inhibition), were seen 
following only repeated daily doses of 30mg/kg. In contrast, daily administration of 3 mg/kg 
did not affect IL -6 induction of BAL cells. This indicates repeated, very high doses (≥10x 
required to completely block the signaling axis in the periphery) are required for the anti -GM-
CSF-Rα antibody to have an inhibitory effect on alveolar macrophages. Interestingly, 
Campbell et al also indicate that significant pharmacodynamic effects of the antibody on the 
lung cells could be observ ed after 5 daily doses of 30mg/kg CAM -3003 (53%±23% 
inhibition). The authors also indicate that PK studies using BAL measurements to quantify 
portioning in the lung lumen underestimate the partitioning due to dilution with the lavage 
fluid.   
  
Of further note, these studies were done in mice without underlying lung pathology, and the 
translatability of these studies in normal mice to humans with COVID -19 pneumonia is unclear. 
Nevertheless, these data suggest that a dose higher than that needed to achieve 1 00% RO in 
circulation may be required in order to achieve therapeutic concentrations in the lung. In current 
COVID -19 patients , it is likely that the inflammatory process afflicting the lung of severe 
  Confidential  Page 13 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   pneumonia patients with hyper -inflammation may lead to a higher ratio of penetration than 
observed in animal studies, thus allowing for potentially direct inhibitory effects on macrophages 
which have already migrated in the lungs.  
 
Taken together, a dose of up to 10 mg/kg (the highest tested in humans) may be  required to confer 
significant pharmacodynamic effects in the lung to inhibit cytokine storm and prevent further lung 
damage. Supported by the safety data provided by the Phase 1 study, it would be reasonable to 
administer a single dose of mavrilimumab at  levels up to 10 mg/kg in an attempt to provide 
desired pharmacodynamics in COVID -19 patients, where direct inhibition of GM -CSF in the lung 
may be a requirement. Hypothetically, a dose of 3 mg/kg may be sufficient and reasonable to be 
tested, but only if higher  proposed dosages in the study are found not to be safe (very close safety 
monitoring is proposed). Given the lethality of pulmonary complications from COVID -19, the 
Sponsor /Investigator , with input from COVID -19 treating physicians, is proposing tha t, in Phase 
2, higher doses (higher than 3 mg/kg, given that this dose is apparently sufficient to completely 
block the signaling axis only in the periphery) be tested first. The IV route of administration is 
supported by Phase 1 ( Burmester  2011) safety of  SAD study in RA patients. As a precaution, the 
IV infusion of mavril imumab in the COVID -19 Phase 2  study will be administered at slower rates 
than those applied in the SAD study.  
 
4.3 Risks and benefits  
To date, there are no adverse events with a recognized c ausal relationship to exposure to 
mavrilimumab. However, there are a number of hypothetical risks that can be extrapolated from 
the mechanism of action. In particular, GM -CSF antagonism may interfere with immune 
response to infections. It is unknown how li kely these effects are to occur, but their frequency  
may be lower with a one -time dose as compared to a longer duration to treat a chronic disease.   
Frequent side effects:  
 Nausea (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self -limiting)  
 Nasopharyngitis  (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self -limiting)  
 Headache (approximately 1 in 10 subjects, self -limiting)  
Rare but potentially life -threatening adverse reaction:  
 Severe hypersensitivity reactions: While these have not been reported with 
Mavrilimumab, such reactions (including anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, 
cytokine release, and endotoxemia) have been observed after administration of other 
monoclonal antibodies. These reactions may be severe and may result in death.  
 Leukopenia resulting in an increas ed risk of opportunistic infections. Mavrilimumab 
reduces the number of neutrophils. In some patients the reduction may be such to expose 
to additional (opportunistic) infection.  
Additional potential side effects (of unknown frequency):  
 Pulmonary alveolar  proteinosis (PAP): studies have linked blockage of GM-CSF, the 
target of Mavrilimumab, with PAP. While the use of Mavrilimumab has not been 
  Confidential  Page 14 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   associated with the development of PAP in patients , a potential risk for this complication 
with Mavrilimumab  use may exist.  
 While  the use of Mavrilimumab has not been associated with the development of cancer, 
drugs that modul ate the immune r esponse may increase the risk of cancer.  
 Impaired response to vaccines. Drugs that reduce the immune response, like 
Mavri limumab can impair the immune response to vaccine.  
 Antibodies that inactivate the study drug thus losing its efficacy  
 
In general, the risk to subjects in this trial may be minimized by compliance with the eligibility 
criteria and study procedures, close clinical monitoring, as well as periodic review of all safety 
data by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC).  
Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve 
unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy wer e to occur during the study, and agree that in order 
to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the 
exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the subject will not reliably comply, they should 
not be e ntered or continue in the study.  
The benefit a patient might have by participating in the study is the close monitoring of their 
condition and optimization of treatment of known risk factors during the full duration of the 
study.  
There may be unknown or un foreseen risks associated with study participation.

13. Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception 
during dosing of investigation al drug. Such methods include:  
 Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
subject ). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation 
methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods o f contraception  
 Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without 
hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks before 
taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the rep roductive 
status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment  
 If male and sexually active, must have documented vasectomy or must practice birth   
control and not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months a fter study drug 
admi nistration.  
 Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of 
contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy 
(failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone 
contraception  
In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a 
minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.  
Women are considered post -menopausal  and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age 
appropriate history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with

of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed 
by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child beari ng potential.  
If local regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above to prevent pregnancy, 
local regulations apply and will be described in the ICF.  
6 Treatment  
A total of 60  patients will b e enrolled  across all sites : 30 subjects will receive mavrilimumab 6 
mg/kg IV, and 30 subjects will receive placebo infusion. No patient will receive more than one 
dose. Additional patients may be enrolled upon agreement of the investigators depending on 
speed of enrollment and availabi lity of study drug.  
6.1 Study treatment  
6.1.1  Investigational drug  
Dosing will be based on actual body weight  and is administered IV  via a syringe infusion pump .  
For investigation: 6 mg/kg mavrilimumab will be infused on a pump.  
  Confidential  Page 17 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   For placebo: A similar infusion of the provided diluent will be used as placebo . 
In preliminary experience with mavrilimumab  in COVID -19, no infusion reactions have been 
reported, and pre -medication will not be required. In the event of an infusion reaction, the 
following interventions can be considered if needed: NaCl 0.9% IV infusion at 500 mL/hr, 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, hydrocortisone sodium succinate 100 mg IV, epinephrine 1mg/mL 
0.3 mg intramuscular.

No additional treatment beyond invest igational drug are included in this trial.  
6.1.3  Treatment group  
Eligible s ubjects will be ass igned at the baseline visit to the  treatment group  in a consecutive 
fashion.  
6.2 Other treatment(s)  
6.2.1  Concomitant therapy  
No formal drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with mavril imumab.  
Medication classification  used by the subject prior to randomization will  be recorded in the 
eCRF  pages.  
 
Concomitant medications to track include: antipyretics, antibiotics r elated to secondary 
infections , and all investigational off -label therapi es for COVID -19 for each subject (e.g. 
chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, anti -IL-6, corticosteroids, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir) 
along with time, dose, and duration of their administration . Other concomitant medications  
will be recorded at b aseline and  daily thereafter  while patient is hospitalized  until Day 7, at 
Day 14, Day 21 and Day 28.  This information will be included in the final study report.  
6.2.2  Prohibited medication  
No data are available on either the effects of live vaccination or the secondary transmission of 
infection by live vaccines in patients receiving mavrilimumab . Therefore, live vaccines should 
not be given concurrently.  
Treatment with cell -depleting biolog ical therap ies (e.g., anti -CD20) , cell -depleting biological 
therapies (such as anti -tumor necrosis factor [TNF], anakinra,  treat ment with alkylating agents , 
treatment with cyclosporine A, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or mycophenol ate mofetil 
(MMF).   If a patient is on a nti-Interleukin [IL] -6 [e.g. tocilizumab], or abatacept] prior to 
enrollment  they are excluded , however it may be permitted after enrollment if the investigator 
deems it clinically necessary.  
6.2.3  Subject numbering  
Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.)  based on central 
randomization , that is assigned when the patient is first enrolled for screening and is retained as 
the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial.  Upon 
  Confidential  Page 18 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. 
available.  
6.2.4  Treatment assignment, randomization  
After meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent, patients will be 
randomized us ing a 1:1  allocation ratio to one of the two study arms . Randomization will be 
centralized through REDcap Cloud at C5 research at the Cleveland Clinic.  Randomization will 
be stratified by site.  
6.3 Treatment blinding  
Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and the clinical trial team will 
be blinded to treatment. Only the Research Pharmacist and members of the Data Monitoring 
Committee will have access to the treatment assignments. If the clin ical team decides that 
unblinding the patient is essential for subsequent significant clinical management, then the 
patient may be unblinded after discussion between the clinical team and the Prin cipal 
Investigator . 
6.4 Preparation and dispensation  
Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging as described in the pharmacy 
manual.  
A unique medication number is printed on the study medication label.  
Each study site will be supplied with study drug and corresponding diluent/placebo. Clinical 
lots o f KPL -301 drug product and corresponding diluent/placebo have been manufactured in 
different container formats; KPL -301: accessorized pre - filled syringes [APFS] and 
Diluent/Placebo: vials. The drug product is supplied with a diluent; the diluent will be u sed as 
the matching placebo. The deliverable or extractable volume for APFS and the vials is 1.0 mL, 
each. The Pharmacy Manual contains all the information about drug preparation.   
APFS and vials are to be stored by the GMP pharmacy facility and investiga tor at 2 -8 degrees 
Celsius at which temperature the product is viable until its listed expiry date.

function), troponin, NT -proBNP, albumin, total protein, c oagulatio n profile, D -dimer, 
fibrinogen , LDH, CRP, serum ferritin, IL -6, quantiferon  (optional) , serum lipid panel 
(triglycerides) , 2019 -nCoV test . 
On-treatment measurements (as noted in the schedule of activities):  
 Complete blood count (CBC), serum bioche mical tests (including renal and liver 
function), albumin, total protein,  coagulation profile, D -dimer , LDH, CRP, serum 
ferritin, IL -6, 2019 -nCoV test  
 
7.2.2  Pregnancy assessments  
All pre -menopausal women who are not surgically sterile will have a urine or serum pregnancy 
test performed at  the screening visit , at the investigator’s discretion . Pregnancy testing is not 
required for post -menopausal women.   
 
8 Study discontinuation and completion  
8.1 Discontinuation  
8.1.1  Discontinuation of study treatment  
Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped earlier 
than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the subject or the investigator.  
The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if, he/sh e believes that 
continuation would negatively impact the subject's well -being.  After study treatment 
discontinuation, patient should remain in the study, unless he/she withdraws consent (Section 
9.1.2), preferably in writing.  
Study treatment must be discon tinued under the following circumstances  
 Confidential  Page 25 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
   Subject/guardian decision  
 Pregnancy  
 Use of prohibited treatment  
 Any situation in which study participation might result in a safety risk to the subject  
 Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator prevents the subject 
from continuing study  drug administration  
If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort 
to understand the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study  treatment 
and record this information.   
Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the 
study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS t hey withdraw 
their consent . Where possible, they should return for the assessments indicated  in the 
assessment schedule , understanding that this may  often not be possible with an ongoing 
COVID -19 pandemic , and therefore telehealth visits may be performed . If they fail to 
return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, and 
letter ) should be made to contact the subject/pre -designated contact as specified in the lost to 
follow -up section. This contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule.  
If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular 
telephone contact with the subject, or with a person pre -designated by the subject. This 
telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study vi sit schedule.  Patient’s vital 
status can also be verified by the study site upon contact with patient’s primary care physician 
or other sources according to local rules and regulations.  
After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated vi sits, the following data 
should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:  
 new/concomitant treatments  
 adverse events/ serious adverse events  
8.1.1.1  Replacement policy  
Subjects who are enrolled but not randomized  will be replaced.   
8.1.2  Withdrawal of informed consent  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any 
time. Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a subject:  
 Does not want to participate in the study anymore  
And 
 Does not allow  further collection of  personal data  
It is encouraged that patient provides withdrawal of consent in writing.  
In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to with draw his/her consent and 
 Confidential  Page 26 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
  record this information.  Patient’s vital status can be verified upon contact with patient’s primary 
care physician or other sources according to local rules and regulations . 
Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed u nless safety findings require 
communicating or follow -up. 
All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final 
evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the 
assessment table.  
Investigative sites  will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data 
resulting from the analysis of a subject’s samples until the time of withdrawal) according to 
applicable law:  
All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further 
testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form.  
8.1.3  Lost to follow -up 
For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without st ating 
an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show "due diligence" by 
documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone 
calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until  the end 
of the study while  due diligence has been completed.  
8.1.4  Early study termination by the sponsor  
The study can be terminated by the Sponsor/ Investigator at any time. Reasons for early 
termination:  
 Unexpected, significant, or u nacceptable safety risk to subjects enrolled in the study  
 Decision based on recommendations from applicable board(s) after review of safety and 
efficacy data  
In making the decision to terminate, the Sponsor/ Investigator will always consider the subject 
welfare and safety. Should early termination be necessary, subjects mu st be seen as soon as 
possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of 
additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate cons ideration is given to 
the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local 
regulation will be responsible for informing IRB of the early termination of the trial.  
8.2 Study completion and post -study treatment  
Study comp letion is defined as when the last subject finishes their Study Completion visit, and 
any repeat assessments associated with this visit have been documented and followed -up 
appropriately by the Investigator, or in the event of an early study termination de cision, the date 
of that decision .

  9 Safety monitoring and reporting  
9.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements  
9.1.1  Adverse events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnorm al laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a 
medi cinal (investigational) product.  
The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and 
identifying adverse events.  
Qualified  medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions 
or pro blems.  
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
the subject during or between visits or through physical exa mination findings, laboratory test 
findings, or other assessments.  
Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or 
diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) 
(if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2 ): 
1. The severity grade : 
 mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities  
 moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities  
 severe: prevents normal activities  
 
2. Its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression 
of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causality 
will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this  guidance is that the symptoms of a 
lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by the trial drug, they 
happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of 
underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by an analysis of cohorts, not on a 
single subject  
3. Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved must be reported.  
4. Whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2  for definition of SAE) and which 
seriousness criteria have been met  
5. Action taken regarding with study treatment.  
All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the 
following:  
 Confidential  Page 28 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
   Dose not changed  
 Drug interrupted/withdrawn  
 Its outcome  
a. not recovered/not resolved;  
b. recovered/resolved;  
c. recovering/resolving,  
d. recovered/resolved with sequelae;  
e. fatal; or unknown.  
Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history of the subject.  
Adverse even ts (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.  
Adverse event monitoring should be  continued for at least 60 days following the last dose of  
study treatment.  
Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to 
be permanent (e.g. Continuing at the end of the study), and assessment must be made at each 
visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of a ny changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB).  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria:  
 they induce clinical signs or symptoms  
 they are considered clinically significant  
 they require therapy  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values , which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with 
the underlying dis ease.  
9.1.2  Serious adverse events  
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following 
criteria:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH -E2D Guid elines).  
 Confidential  Page 29 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
   results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless 
hospitalization is for:  
 routine treatment or monitorin g of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease or 
peripheral vascular disease).   
 elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
 social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s 
general condition  
 treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission  
 is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might je opardize the subject or might 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be 
considered as “medically significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse.  
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other 
seriousness criteria are not met.  
Any sus pected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.  
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse 
event irrespective if a clinical event has occu rred.  
9.1.3  SAE reporting  
To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the subject has 
provided informed consent and until the last study visit  must be reported to Sponsor/ Investigator  
within 24 hours  of learning of its occurren ce.  
 
The investigator/sponsor will report all serious, unexpected adverse events as an IND safety 
report to the FDA no later than 15 calendar days after the investigator/sponsor’s initial receipt 
of this information.  Fatal or life -threatening unexpected experiences for which there is a 
possibility that the experience may have been caused by the drug will be reported by the 
investigator/sponsor to the FDA by telephone or facsimile transmission no later than 7 
calendar days after receipt of this information . An annual report which includes summaries 
of all IND safety reports will be submitted to the FDA each year in the annual report and to 
 Confidential  Page 30 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
  Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals (IMP/Drug Manufacturer) by the investigator/sponsor. Investigator  is 
responsible for evaluating  all safety information available, and notify FDA and all investigators 
in an IND safety report of potentially serious risks from this clinical trial or any other source as 
soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor/investigator receives the 
safety information and determines that the information qualifies for reporting.   
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a C MO & PS Department 
associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for heal th authority 
reporting. Kiniksa  may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators 
involved in any study with the same study tr eatment that this SAE has been reported.    
Suspected and Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported 
to FDA.  
Any SAEs experienced after the Completion Study should only be reported to 
sponsor/investigator  
9.1.4  Pregnancy reportin g 
Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be 
reported to sponsor /investigator within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, 
details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, 
or maternal and/or newborn complications.  Newborn will be followed up just until birth 
according to guidelines as there was nothing observed in any studies that would suggest a fetal 
development risk.  
Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported.  
9.1.5  Reporting of study treatment errors  
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administ ration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or 
consumer.  
Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in 
the eCRF irrespective of whether or not associate d with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only 
if associated with an SAE.  
 
 
9.1.6  Data Monitoring Committee  
This study will include a data monitoring committee (DMC) which will function independently 
of all other individuals associated with the conduct of this cl inical trial, including the site 
investigators participating in the study. The DMC will assess at defined intervals the progress 
 Confidential  Page 31 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
  of a clinical trial, safety data, and critical efficacy variables and recommend to the 
sponsor/investigator whether to continue , modify or terminate a trial.  
Summary reports will be provided to a DMC after the first 5 subje cts have been reviewed, after 
15 subjects have been reviewed, and after every 10  subsequent patients.   
Specific details regarding composition, responsibilities , data monitoring and meeting 
frequency, and documentation of DMC reports, minutes, and recommendations will be 
described in a separate charter that is established between the sponsor/investigator and the 
DMC.

  Data management will be coordinated by C5Research  at the Cleveland Clinic . Data will be 
entered into a secure dedicated REDc ap cloud database, and data analysis will be performed by 
C5Research.  
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic 
Case Report Forms (eCR F). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web -
enabled software that conforms  to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.  Investigator site staff will not 
be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs 
check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered 
data by the investigator staff.  
The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data (recorded on CRFs  and 
entered  into eCRF) is complete, accurate , and that entry and updates are performed in a timely 
manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate . 
After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving 
at the investigational site.  
All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation and verification.  
9.3 Site monitoring  
The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of  
case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source doc uments in the 
subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the 
subject (a signed copy is given to the subject).  
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency with the data  capture and/or data entry. Additional checks of the consistency of the 
source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No 
information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed.  
10 Data analysis and statistical methods  
10.1 Analysis sets  
All patients who provide informed consent  and are randomized  will be included in the analysis.  
Specifically, patients who are randomized and do not receive study medication/placebo and 
patients who have the study infusion discontinued before completion will remain in the 
intention -to-treat analysis.  However, we may also perform a secondary, exploratory modified 
intention to treat analysis that would include all patients that actually rec eive study drug or 
placebo.  As noted above , for patients who are lost to follow -up, due diligence will be 
performed, and given the importance of reliable estimates of the treatment effect for planning 
futures, every effort will be made to document respira tory status and survival as outlined in the 
primary and secondary endpoints.     
 Confidential  Page 34 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
   
10.2 Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics  
The number and percentage of patients who completed the study, who discontinued the study 
and the reason for discontin uation will be presented for all patients. The frequency (%) of 
patients with major protocol deviations as well as the criteria leading to data exclusion from 
analysis will be presented in separate tables, if applicable. Finally, the number of enrolled 
patients by site will be presented descriptively.  
Baseline value is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior to the first dose of study drug 
unless specified otherwise.  
Demographic and background characteristic variables will be summarized using descr iptive 
summary statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized using n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile), minimum, and maximum. Categorical 
variables will be summarized using frequency and percentage.  
 
10.3 Analys is of the primary and secondary endpoint s 
Based on preliminary  case-control data of patients with severe COVID -19 pneumonia  treated 
with mavrilimumab, we estimate that 4 0% of patient s in the placebo group will  meet the primary 
endpoint  compared to 80% of treated patients . A sample size of 30 patients per arm (60 total) 
will provide at least 80% power to detect this difference using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 .  
The results of our study will inform treatment effect to aid in the planning of larger studies. The 
primary efficacy analysis will be on an intention -to-treat basis and include all patients who are 
randomized.  Use of supplemental oxygen and vital status will be assessed daily up to day 14 . . 
Patients will be considered to have met the  primary endpoint if the patient is alive at day 14 and 
has not used supplemental oxygen for at least 24 hours, regardless of whether or not the patient 
is still in the hospital (i.e. success=1). All other patients will be counted as not meeting the 
primar y endpoint (i.e. success=0), including deaths on or before day 14 and patients for whom 
information cannot be ascertained (eg.lost to follow -up, withdrew consent, or otherwise missing 
information on the primary endpoint at day 14). This is analogous to imp uting the worst case 
scenario for missing data.   
 The primary analysis will report the number and percentage of patients meeting the primary 
endpoint. The chi -square statistic will be used to test the difference between the two treatment 
groups. The time to freedom from supplemental oxygen will also be displayed geographically 
with a  Kaplan Meier curve. A two -sided p value of < 0.049 will be considered statistically 
significant  for the primary endpoint , though as noted, an important aspect of this study is  to 
better define the magnitude of the treatment effect of our clinical outcomes to appropriately 
power larger studies.   
The secondary endpoint s are  is the proportion of patients alive  at day 28 (i.e. success=1), and 
the proportion of patients alive  and wi thout respiratory failure at day 28 (i.e. success=1). Similar 
to the primary analysis, patients not meeting  the this criteria  in each of the secondary endpoints  
will be considered a failure (i.e. success=0), including deaths on or before day 28 and patient s 
 Confidential  Page 35 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
  for whom information cannot be ascertained (e .g. lost to follow -up, withdrew consent, or 
otherwise missing information on the secondary endpoint at day 28). This is analogous to 
imputing the worst case scenario for missing data.   
The probability of pati ents achieving the secondary endpoint successfully will also be estimated 
using Kaplan -Meier estimates and displayed with survival curves.  In addition, w e do not plan 
to adjust for multiple hypothesis testing in our secondary and exploratory endpoint s. Therefore, 
these results will be displayed as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals. These intervals 
should not be regarded as definitive for treatm ent effects . Finally , we plan to analyze the 
comparison between mavrilimumab 6 mg/kg versus placebo af ter all patients have reached day 
14 (or have died or been discharged prior to day 14) to expeditiously inform whether a larger 
study should be undertaken.   
 
10.3.1  Adverse events  
All information obtained on adverse events will be summarized in tabular format.  
A subject with multiple adverse events of the same type is only counted once towards the total 
of that event.  
All deaths and serious adverse events will be tabulated.  
All AEs, deaths and serious adverse events will be provided in patient listings.  
 
11 Ethical  considerations and administrative procedures  
11.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance  
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance 
with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with ap plicable 
local re gulations US CFR 21, and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  
11.2 Responsibilities of the investigator and IR B 
Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from  
the Institutional Review Board  (IRB) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, 
consent form updates, subject recruitment p rocedures  and any other written information to be 
provided to subjects.  
The protocol will be registered in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrial s.gov . In 
addition, after study completion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will 
be submitted for publication and posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results . 
This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on 
study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of subjects should be 
administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Investigators  will apply due diligence 
 Confidential  Page 36 
   
 
Mavri Covid 19 Protocol_ 3.0_ 25June 2020   
  to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the 
conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an 
amendment is agreed upon by sponsor/investigator and approved by the FDA and IRB, where 
required, it cannot be implemented.  
12 Protocol adherence  
This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on 
study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safe ty of subjects should be 
administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Investigators ascertain they will 
apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation 
would improve the conduct of the study this  must be considered a protocol amendment, and 
unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Kiniksa and approved by the IRB/IEC and health 
authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented.  
12.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any change or addition to the protocol can on ly be made in a written protocol amendment that 
must be approved by Kiniksa, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to 
implementation.  
Only amendments that are required for subject safety may be implemented immediately 
provided the health  authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the 
reviewing IRB/IEC is notified.  
Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is 
expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of an y subject included in this 
study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, Kiniksa  should 
be notified of this action and the IRB at the study site should be informed according to local 
regulations.

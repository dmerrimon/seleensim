Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 1000  subjects  
  
Study 
Population  Male and female subjects, 18 through 80  years of age (inclusive), with pain that is moderate 
or severe on the verbal categorical rating scale (VRS) and ≥4 on the NPRS after an 
abdominoplasty  
  
Investigational 
Drug  Active substance: VX-548 
Activity: voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) inhibitor  
Strength and route of administration: 50-mg tablets and matching placebo for oral 
administration  
  
Reference Drug  Active substance: HB/APAP  
Activity: opioid analgesic  
Strength and route of administration: 5-mg/325 -mg capsules (over -encapsulated tablets) and 
matching placebo for oral administration  
  
Study Duration  Excluding the Screening Visit, each subject will participate in the study for 3  days plus a 
Safety Follow -up Visit 14  ± 2 days after the last dose of study drug.  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 in treating acute pain after an abdominoplasty 
(Figure  2-1). 
On Day 1, subjects will undergo a standard (“full”) abdominoplasty procedure (as defined in 
Section  8.1). After surgery completion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3  treatment 
groups if: (1)  the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) th e subject’s 
pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a 
subject does not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within 4 hours after surgery completion, 
the subject will not be eligible for this study.  
Approximately 1000 subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX -548 
(100 mg first dose, then 50 mg every  12 hours [q12h]), HB/APAP (5  mg/325  mg every 
6 hours [q6h]; opioid reference), or placebo ( Table  2-1). Randomization will be stratified by 
site and baseline NPRS (<8 versus ≥8). To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the 
same number of tablets and capsules q6h in a double -dummy desi gn.

HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; VRS:  verbal 
categorical rating scale  
Notes: After surgery completion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups if: (1) the 
subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate or 
severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on  the NPRS. If a subject does not meet the 
VRS and NPRS criteria within 4 hours after surgery completion, the subject will not be eligible 
for this study. Figure is not drawn to scale.  
 
Table  2-1 Study VX22 -548-105 Treatment Groups  
Treatment  Active Dose  Number of Subjects  
VX-548 100 mg first dose, then 50 mg q12h  400 
HB/APAP  5 mg/325  mg q6h  400 
Placebo  – 200 
HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; q6h: every 6 hours; q12h: every 12  hours  
Notes: To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and capsules in a 
double -dummy design. VX -548 active or VX -548 placebo tablets will be administered to all 
subjects q12h as follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 12, 24, and 36 hours after the first dose of 
study drug. HB/APAP active or HB/APAP placebo capsules will be administered to all subjects 
q6h as follows: 0  hours (first dose) and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 hours after the first dose 
of study drug.  
Subjects will report their pain intensity on the NPRS at each scheduled time point through 
48 hours after the first dose of study drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
Ibuprofen ( 400 mg orally q6h as needed ) is permitted as a rescue medication for pain relief 
upon the subject’s request starting any time after the first dose of study drug through 48  hours 
after the first dose of study drug. Subjects are encouraged to wait 90  minutes afte r the first 
dose of study drug to request rescue medication, and subjects should generally not receive 
rescue medication unless their NPRS score is ≥4.  
  
Assessments  Efficacy:  NPRS, use of rescue medications, and PGA of study drug  
Safety:  AEs, clinical l aboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, standard 
12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations  
Other:  DNA blood sample (optional) and PK parameters of VX -548 and  
  
Statistical 
Analyses  Assuming a standardized effect size of 0.40 for VX-548 compared to placebo  and 0.25 for 
VX-548 compared to HB/APAP , 338  evaluable subjects per group for VX -548 and 
HB/APAP and 169  evaluable subjects for placebo will provide more than 90% power for the 
primary endpoint of VX -548 versus placebo on SPID48 and 90% power for the key 
secondary endpoint of VX -548 versus HB/APAP on SPID48, based on 2 -sample t-tests with 

Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 6 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  significance level 0.05. To allow for about 15% dropout, a total of approximately 1000  
subjects are planned to be enrolled.  
The primary effica cy analysis will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include SPID48 as the dependent variable and treatment as a fixed effect, 
with site and baseline NPRS as covariates. If the model estimation does not converge, then 
site will be removed from the model. The least squares mean difference from placebo for 
VX-548 will be provided along with the 95% CI and P value.

5.1 Background  
Pain is one of the most common symptoms for which patients seek medical attention. Current 
treatment options for pain are limited by poor efficacy and high rates of adverse events (AEs), 
leaving many patients without adequate pain control. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) pose a potentially serious risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with acute and chronic use, 
hematologic toxicity with acute use, and nephr otoxicity with chronic use.1 Opioids are 
significantly limited by safety and tolerability issues and have a high abuse liability. 
Opioid -associated deaths have increased in frequency over the past 2 decades.2 Opioids were 
involved in more than 77,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2021 and in approximately 74% of 
fatal drug overdoses in the EU in 2020.3, 4 
Given the limited treatment options, comb ined with the risks and constrained utility of current 
treatments, the development of new analgesics with improved efficacy and safety profiles is vital 
for better pain management and patient health outcomes. Despite the need for new analgesics, 
clinical d evelopment has exhibited a considerable lack of recent progress and innovation of new 
medications to treat pain.5 Over the last decade, the majority of approved an algesic drugs either 
act on the opioid receptor system or are NSAIDs6; few  new molecular entity drugs for moderate 
to severe pain have been approved.7, 8 The majority of research activity focuses on developing 
abuse -deterrent reformulations of existing narcotic  pain drugs, or combinations with NSAIDs. 
The resultant compounds do not have substantially improved efficacy or safety.  
Voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) plays a critical role in pain signaling.9, 10 Support for 
this assertion arises from (1)  evaluation of the role Na V1.8 plays in normal physiology11-15, 
(2) pathological states arising from mutations in the Na V1.8 gene ( SCN10A )16, 17, (3) animal 
models18-21, and (4)  pharmacology of known Na V1.8-modulating agents.22-24 In addition, because 
NaV1.8 is preferentially expressed in peripheral pain -sensing neurons (e.g., the dorsal root 
ganglia [DRG])11, 13, Na V1.8 inhibitors are not expected to be associated with the side effects 
commonly observed with other sodium channel modula tors and are not expected to have the 
abuse liability associated with opioid therapies. Therefore, targeting the underlying biology of 
pain through selective Na V1.8 inhibition represents a scientific approach to analgesic drug 
development that has the pote ntial to address an urgent unmet need for safe and effective acute 
and chronic pain therapies. These therapies include treatment where the primary mechanisms 
underlying pain are nociceptor hyperexcitability.  
VX-548 is being developed for the treatment of p ain. VX -548 is a Na V1.8 inhibitor that is highly 
selective for Na V1.8 relative to other Na V channels. Clinical data from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects and Phase 2 proof -of-concept studies in subjects with moderate to severe acute pain 
demonstrate tha t VX -548 is generally safe and well tolerated. Refer to the VX -548 Investigator’s 
Brochure for additional details.25

Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 in treating acute pain after an abdominoplasty 
(Figure  9-1). 
On Day 1, subjects will undergo a standard (“full”) abdominoplasty procedure (as defined in 
Section  8.1). After surgery com pletion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3  treatment groups 
if: (1)  the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is 
moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does 
not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within 4 hours after surgery completion, the subject will not 
be eligible for this study.  
Approximately 1000  subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX -548 (100 mg 
first dose, then 50 mg every  12 hours [q12h]), HB/APAP (5  mg/325  mg every 6  hours [q6h]; 
opioid reference), or placebo ( Table  9-1). Randomization will be stratified by site and ba seline 
NPRS (<8 versus ≥8). To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets 
and capsules q6h in a double -dummy design.

Notes: After surgery completion, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups if: (1) the subject 
requests the first dose of stu dy drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, 
and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within 
4 hours after surgery completion, the subject will not be eligible f or this study. Figure is not drawn to scale.

HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; q6h: every 6 hours; q12h: every 12  hours  
Notes: To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and capsules in a 
double -dummy design. VX -548 active or VX-548 placebo tablets will be administered to all subjects q12h as 
follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 12, 24, and 36 hours after the first dose of study drug. HB/APAP active or 
HB/APAP placebo capsules will be administered to all subjects q6h as follows : 0 hours (first dose) and at 6, 
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42 hours after the first dose of study drug.  
Subjects will report their pain intensity on the NPRS at each scheduled time point through 
48 hours after the first dose of study drug. In addition, pain  intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
Ibuprofen ( 400 mg orally q6h as needed [prn] ) is permitted as a rescue medication for pain relief 
upon the subject’s request starting any time after the fi rst dose of study drug through 48  hours 
after the first dose of study drug. Subjects are encouraged to wait 90  minutes after the first dose 
of study drug to request rescue medication, and subjects should generally not receive rescue 
medication unless their  NPRS score is ≥4.  
9.1.1  Screening  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section 9.1. 
Screening Visit through Admission  
Assessments from the  Screening Visit through admission (pre -procedure) are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Visit will occur within 28  days before the scheduled abdomin oplasty procedure 
and may occur in the clinic or as a home health visit with a qualified visiting nurse if permitted 
by local regulations. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) 
will obtain informed consent from each sub ject in person or remotely (Section  13.2.3 ) before 
performing any study -related procedure. If needed, Screening Visit assessments may be 
performed on  different days within the visit window.  
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4). 
At the Screening Visit, subjects will receive trainings on appropriate expectations around their 
participation in a clinical study, placebo response reduction, and the importance of accurate ly 
reporting their post -procedural pain. On Day 1 (pre -procedure), these trainings will be repeated.  
Additional review of these educational materials may be repeated for some or all subjects, as 
needed.  
Surgical Procedure Through Randomization  
Assessments from the surgical procedure through randomization are listed in Table  3-2. 
Subjects will receive 4 mg of intravenous (IV) ondansetron once at the beginn ing of surgery as 
prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting. No other agents should be used as standing 
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 25 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  agents for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis. After surgery, subjects may receive 
4 mg of IV ondansetron every 8  hours prn for the tr eatment of nausea and/or vomiting. Refer to 
Section 9.4.1.1  for details on perioperative pain management.  
Randomization may not occur until at least 1 5 minutes after the last administration of 
supplemental analgesic medication (i.e.,  fentanyl; Section  9.4.1.1 ). 
In the postoperative period before randomization, VRS will be completed upon request for the 
first dose of study drug for pain relief. Pain intensity will be recorded after a ≥3 -minute rest in 
bed. NPRS will be completed after VRS  only if the subject’s pain is rated moderate or severe on 
the VRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria (Section 8.1) within 4  hours after 
surgery completion, the subject will not be eligible for this study.  
9.1.1.1  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolysis of sample, equipment error). 
In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting.  
9.1.1.2  Rescreening  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respiratory 
infection with fever) in the 5  days before the first dose of study drug that was properly 
evaluated and which resolved fully  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screen ing window  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit to all study procedures  
• Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any 
exclusion criterion, with the exc eption of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version 
of the protocol  
Any subject who is rescreened for any of the exceptions listed above may have the screening 
window extended by 1  week before needing to undergo any rescreening assessments. If m ore 
than 35  days have elapsed from the Screening Visit before the first dose of study drug, all 
screening assessments need to be repeated. The medical monitor must approve all rescreening 
and/or screening window extension requests before these occur.  
9.1.2  Treat ment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table  3-3. 
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. Dosing details are in Section  9.6. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
scheduled inpatient portion of the study, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be 
notified, and the subject will be asked to remain at the study site until such abnormalities resolve. 
If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain at the study site, the medical monitor (or 
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 26 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigator will make every effort to arrange 
follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities.  
9.1.3  Follow -up 
Subjects will have a Safety  Follow -up Visit 14  (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug. Safety 
Follow -up Visit asse ssments are listed in Table  3-3. 
9.1.4  Early Discontinuation  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing for any reason will remain under 
observat ion at the study site for at least 48  hours after the first dose of study drug and complete 
(1) all scheduled vital signs and 12 -lead ECG assessments through 48  hours after the first dose of 
study drug and (2) all safety assessments listed for the 48 -hour time point ( Table  3-3), after 
which point they can be discharged. The reason, date, and time of discontinuation will be 
recorded for all subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug. All concomitant medications 
will continue to be recorded through completion of study participation as indicated in 
Section  9.5. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities, the medical monitor (or 
authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain at the study site 
until such abnormalities resolve. If the subj ect is unable or unwilling to remain at the study site, 
the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigator will make 
every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of 
the abnor malities.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing will be required to complete the 
Safety  Follow -up Visit 14  (± 2) days after the last dose of study drug.  Safety Follow -up Visit 
assessments are listed in Table  3-3. 
If a subject withdraws consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed; refer to 
Section  9.8 for information on the use of study data and samples already collected.  
9.1.5  Home Health Visits  
Home health visits are only an option if permitted by local regulations. Any visits that occur via 
home health must have a c onsultation (i.e.,  telemedicine video conference or telephone contact) 
between the subject and investigator or qualified delegate (licensed independent practitioner 
[LIP]) within 2 business days after the home health visit in order to check -in and collect AEs and 
may also include a separate follow up with the study coordinator.  
9.1.6  Completion of Study Participation  
Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as 1 of the following:  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Vi sit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit: the date of last contact  
The end of study is defined in Section  13.2.9 . 
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately  1000  subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX -548, 
HB/APAP (opioid reference), or placebo. The randomization ratio of 2:2:1 will be controlled for 
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 27 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  the overall study, and the details of the randomization implementation will be specified in 
separate documents.  
Each randomized subject will be assigned a unique subject number. Randomization will be 
stratified by site and baseline NPRS (<8 versus ≥8).  
An interactive web or voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. 
The randomization code will be produced by Vertex Biostatisti cs or a qualified randomization 
vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the production of the final 
randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded 
biostatistician who is not a member of the Study Team.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 in treating acute pain after an abdominoplasty . 
Abdominoplasty is a well-established, multi -dose, surgical, acute pain model. A randomized, 
double -blind study design was selected to avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes 
arising from the subjects’ knowledge of treatment. A parallel design is considered most 
appropriate given the acute nature of abdominoplasty surgery.  
An opioid reference group assessing a standard -of-care treatment (HB/APAP 5 mg/325 mg q6h) 
was included to establish the ability of the study, as executed, to successfully observe a treatment 
effect. 
Following a standard study design, subjects will be randomized after surgery and after the 
subject’s pain meets the pain threshold criteria. The pain threshold criteria are designed to ensure 
subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the drug is ef fective. Ibuprofen was selected as the 
rescue medication because it is a commonly used, short -acting, standard -of-care treatment for 
acute pain.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
The VX -548 dosing regimen of 100 mg first dose (loading dose), then 50 mg q12h was  selected 
based on favorable safety and PK data from healthy subjects and subjects with pain after 
bunionectomy or abdominoplasty. Exposures at the selected VX -548 dose are predicted to 
achieve Na V1.8 inhibition levels of approximately 65% by 2 hours and a pproximately 90% by 
24 hours after the start of dosing. After 24 hours, exposures corresponding approximately to IC 90 
are sustained for the duration of dosing.  
The duration of dosing (48  hours) is a standard duration for postsurgical, acute pain models and  
is of sufficient length to assess efficacy and safety.  
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
VRS:  A 4-point VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included as part of the pain threshold 
inclusion criterion to ensure that all subjects have moderate or severe pain at baseline, which 
ensures subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the study drug is effective.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 28 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  NPRS: NPRS is frequently used in abdominoplasty studies and is recognized by the FDA as a 
valid pain intensity measure.28 Pain rated ≥4 on an 11 -point (0 to 10) NPRS at baseline ensures 
subjects have suffi cient pain to determine if the study drug is effective.  
Use of rescue medications: The use of rescue medications is an important covariate in pain 
studies that can impact the analysis of other efficacy assessments.  
PGA of study drug : The PGA of study drug is a single -item assessment of patient perceptions 
of pain control with the study drug and is evaluated on a 4 -point Likert scale (poor, fair, good, or 
excellent).29 The PGA of study drug provides subjects the ability to state their perceptions of the 
treatment that may not be captured by measuring pain intensity alone.

10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
dispensed but not administered. These materials will be retained at the site according to 
instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site -specific d rug accountability 
system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, 
the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the 
drug accountability documentation on a regular bas is. The study monitor will promptly 
communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials until the study monito r has 
performed drug accountability. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the 
investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special  instructions provided by Vertex. 
Destruction will be adequately documented.  
The principal investigator, study site staff, including pharmacy personnel will assist Vertex with 
any recall activities (as applicable) and place impacted investigational medicin al product (IMP) 
in quarantine when requested.  
10.6 Compliance  
Study drug doses will be administered under the direct supervision of the investigator or 
designee. A hand -and-mouth check will be done after each dose administration at the study site 
to ensure 10 0% study treatment compliance.  
10.7 Rescue Medication  
Vertex will supply ibuprofen for use as rescue medication during the Treatment Period. Drug 
accountability will be performed in a similar manner as for study drug.  
10.8 Blinding and Unblinding  
This is a double -blind study.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 34 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  10.8.1  Blinding  
All study personnel will be blinded to subject treatment assignments except for the following 
individuals:  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of a subject in 
the event of a life -threatening medical emergency  
• Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of a subject 
and a fetus in the event of a pregnancy  
• Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy serious 
adverse event (SAE)  processing and reporting regulations  
• External vendor (unblinded) statistician preparing the final (production) randomization list 
who is not part of the study team  
• Vertex IXRS Management for IXRS oversight and system administration  
• Vertex Clinical Supply Chain  
• The bioanalytical laboratory/vendor personnel responsible for the sample testing (Vertex or 
external)  
• The Vertex bioanalytical personnel responsible for reviewing raw data from the bioanalytical 
contract research organization  (CRO), who is not a memb er of the Study Team (the Vertex 
bioanalytical Study Team member will continue to be blinded)  
• Vertex personnel or vendor(s), who are not part of the study team, and are responsible for 
analyzing PK/population PK data to support interactions with regulatory  authorities, as 
applicable.  
Vertex medical monitor may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual subjects at any 
time.  
10.8.2  Unblinding  
At the initiation of the study, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking 
the blind. The u nblinding method will be either manual or electronic.  
Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical 
emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is 
necessary  for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to 
whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. 
If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they wi ll first attempt to contact the 
medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the 
clinical situation, and may proceed wi th unblinding.  
Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document.  
If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be noti fied within 24  hours of the unblinding event. 
The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. 
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 35 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a 
secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the CRO, or any site 
personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the investigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an  SAE, 
according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to 
Vertex GPS or designee, per Section  13.1.2 . 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual 
subjects at any time.

A blood sample (optional DNA sampl e) will be collected for potential exploratory evaluation of 
associations between DNA markers with other endpoints, PK, treatment response, AEs, and 
biomarkers related to health and disease, including pain, for subjects who choose to participate in 
this as sessment.  
These data will be used for internal exploratory purposes. Detailed procedures for the collection 
of blood samples and additional procedures for processing and handling samples for 
pharmacogenomics analysis will be provided in a separate document.  
11.4 Efficacy  
11.4.1  Numeric Pain Rating Scale  
NPRS will be completed after a ≥3 -minute rest in bed.  
In the postoperative period before randomization, NPRS will be completed after VRS only if the 
subject’s pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS. If a su bject does not meet the VRS and 
NPRS criteria (Section 8.1) within 4  hours after surgery completion, the subject will not be 
eligible for this study . 
During the Treatment Period, subjects will report their pain intensity on the NPRS at each 
scheduled time point through 48  hours after the first dose of study drug. In addition, pain 
intensity will be recorded on the NPRS immediately before each administ ration of rescue 
medication (Section 9.4.1.2 ). 
11.4.2  Use of Rescue Medications  
Rescue medication is permitted for pain relief upon subject’s request. Guidelines on 
administration of ibuprofen as rescue medication are included in Section  9.4.1.2 . A record will

Clinical laboratory assessments during screening must have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by the investigator, for a subject to receive study 
drug on Day  1.  
Additional Screening Tests : The following additional tests will be performed at the Screening 
Visit and/or pre -procedure to assess eligibility:  
• Serology : Hepatitis B surface antigen  (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab), HCV 
RNA, human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 antibod y/antigen (HIV -1/HIV -2 Ab/Ag), 
and HIV -1/HIV -2 RNA. RNA samples will only be analyzed as a reflex test following a 
positive antibody or antibody/antigen t est. Subjects with detectable viral load for HIV 
(≥200  copies/mL) or HCV will be excluded (Section  8.2). 
• Serum Follicle -stimulating Hormone (FSH) : Serum FSH will be tested at the Screening Visit 
for female subjects who are suspected to be postmenopausal ( as defined in Section 11.5.5.1 ). 
For a s ubject to be considered of non -childbearing potential, the serum FSH levels will be 
within the laboratory range for postmenopausal females.  
• Pregnancy Testing : All biologically female subjects will have a serum beta-human chorionic 
gonadotropin ( β-hCG)  test during the Screening Visit. Female subjects of childbearing 
potential (Section  11.5.5.1 ) will also have a urine β-hCG  test before admission on Day 1. 
Both the serum and urine β-hCG tests (as applicable per Table  3-1) must be negative to 
receive study drug.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 39 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  • Drug and Alcohol Screening:  Drug screening for opioids, methadone, cannabinoids, cocaine, 
amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines will be assessed by a 
urine test at the Screening Visit and before admission on  Day 1. Alcohol screening will be 
assessed before  admission on  Day 1 by a urine, blood, or breath test. Subjects may undergo 
random urine drug screen and alcohol testing if deemed appropriate by the investigator. Drug 
and alcohol screen results must be negative for a subject to receive study drug; a posi tive 
marijuana screen will only be exclusionary on Day  1. A positive drug screen for a known 
prescribed concomitant medication that is not otherwise exclusionary (e.g.,  benzodiazepines) 
will not disqualify subjects.  
Additional Evaluations:  Additional clini cal laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used, 
with the following exceptions:  
• Day 1 (pre -procedure) drug and alcohol tests and urine β -hCG pregnancy tests will be 
assessed by staff onsite.  
• Local laboratories may be used to repeat a screening assessment to determine eligibility on 
Day 1 (pre -procedure) if there is clear evidence of laboratory error (Section  9.1.1.1 ) in the 
central laboratory assessment.  
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent me dical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator 
becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.5.3  Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs asse ssments will be performed during screening and at 
select study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs 
assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider. If the 
Screening Visit occurs via home health, an abbreviated PE will be performed at the Screening 
Visit and a complete PE will be performed on Day  1 (pre -procedure).  
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat  (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; 
musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed 
when medically indicated. After the complete PE during screening, any clinically significant 
abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: general; 
cardiovascular system; respiratory system; skin; and abdomen.  
A focused PE of the operative site will be performed in or der to assess wound healing.   
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, respiration 
rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The subject will be instructed to rest (seated or supine) for at 
least 5  minutes before vital signs are assessed.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 40 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  If there is an abnormal clinical assessment during a home visit, depending on its severity and at 
investigator discretion, the subject may be instructed to have a PE or other evaluation in the 
clinic.  
11.5.4  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 1 2-lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate using a machine with printout. Additional 
standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The 
performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be do ne before blood draws or any other procedures that may affect heart rate.  
• The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supine position.  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for  safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. All traces will be centrally evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. 
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety 
Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the median QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or the 
median absolute QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled or unscheduled ECGs (performed 
in triplicate), 2  additional ECGs (performed in triplicate) will be performed approximately 2  to 
4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If the median QTcF value from either of 
these repeated ECGs r emains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or ≥500  msec), 
the subject should discontinue dosing. For safety monitoring after discontinuation, a single ECG 
will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below th e 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.  
11.5.5  Contraception and Pregnancy  
The effects of VX‑548 on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. Refer 
to the VX‑548 Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.25 
11.5.5.1  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below.  
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject. The subject must confirm that they will practice true 
abstinence from the Screening Visit through 30  days after the last dose of study drug. True 
abstinence i s important to differentiate from periodic abstinence (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility m ay be documented through 
examination of a semen specimen.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 41 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  • If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12  consecutive months and a serum FSH 
level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy  
• Same biological sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not  waived , study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception, as 
outlined in Table  11-3, is used as a couple from the Screening Visit through 30  days after the last 
dose of study drug.  
Table  11-3 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  
Subjects and their 
non-study partnersa At least 1 of the following acceptable methods must be used as a couple from the 
Screening Visit through 30 days after the last dose of study drug:  
• Male vasectomy 6  months or more previously, with a documented negativ e 
post-vasectomy semen analysis for spermb 
• Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously  
• Female continuous use of an intrauterine device for at least 90 days b efore the first 
dose of study drug, throughout study drug treatment, and  until 3 0 days after the last 
dose of study drug.  
• Female hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least 60  days before the 
first dose of study drug, throughout study drug treatment, and until 3 0 days after the 
last dose of study drug.  
• Male or f emale condom (with or without spermicide)c 
• Female barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge) with 
spermicide  
a Applicable to subjects and their non -study partners of the opposite biological sex for whom the contraception 
requirement is not waived. 
b Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not required. The subject must 
confirm that their partner has documented proof, and the subject’s confirmation should be documented.  
c Female condom cannot  be used with male condom due to risk of tearing.  
Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive methods listed in 
Table  11-3. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for 30  days following the last dose of study  drug.  
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of the Screening Visit must 
agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active 
with a partner of the opposite biological sex.  
• Medical record do cumentation of contraception for non -study partners is not required.  
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.

Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  Unique situations that may not fall within the above speci fications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor or designee on an individual basis.  
11.5.5.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
If a subject, or the female partner of a male subject, becomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will 
(1) notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24  hours  of the site’s knowledge of the 
subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy, and (2) send the Pregnancy Information Collection Form to 
Vertex GPS.  
A subject (or their partner, if relevant) who becomes pregnant while on study will be followed 
until the end of the pr egnancy only if on blinded treatment, or if they have been unblinded and 
have received active drug. The infant will be followed for 1  year after birth, provided informed 
consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow -up activi ties. 
Pregnancy itself is not an AE.  
12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
This section presents a summary of the principal features of the planned efficacy, safety, and PK 
analyses for the study. Safety and efficacy analysis details will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), and PK analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology 
analysis plan (CPAP). Both the SAP and CPAP will be finalized before clinical data lock.  
Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been 
entered in the clinical study database, and the clinical data have been locked.  
12.1 Sample Size and Power  
Assuming a standardized effect size of 0.40 for VX -548 compared to placebo and 0.25 for 
VX-548 compared to HB/APAP, 338  evaluable subje cts per group for VX -548 and HB/APAP 
and 169  evaluable subjects for placebo will provide more than 90% power for the primary 
endpoint of VX -548 versus placebo on SPID48 and 90% power for the key secondary endpoint 
of VX -548 versus HB/APAP on SPID48, based on 2-sample t-tests with significance level 0.05. 
To allow for about 15% dropout, a total of approximately 1000  subjects are planned to be 
enrolled.  
12.2 Analysis Sets  
The All Subjects Set  is defined as all subjects who have been randomized or have received a t 
least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used in subject listings and disposition 
summary tables, unless otherwise specified.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
1 dose of study drug. The FAS is to be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set  is defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The 
Safety Set is to be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatment they received.

Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  12.3 Statistical Analysis  
12.3.1  General Considerations  
All individual subject data for subjects who were randomized or received at least 1  dose of study 
drug will be presented in individual subject data listings.  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most recent non -missing 
measurement ( scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For 
ECGs, the baseline value will be defined as the average of the pretreatment measurements 
(triplicate) on Day  1. 
Change (absolute change) from baseline  will be calculated as Post-baseline  value  − Baseline 
value . 
Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  will include the time from the first dose of study drug to the 
Safety Follow -up Visit or to the completion of study participation (as defined in Section 9.1.6 ), 
whichever occurs first.  
12.3.2  Background Characteristics  
Unless otherwise specified, subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior 
and concomitant medications, and important protocol deviations will be summarized.  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
Only the principal features of the efficacy analysis will be presented in this section. For more 
details, please refer to the SAP.  
12.3.3.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
The primary efficacy analys is will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include SPID48 as the dependent variable and treatment as a fixed effect, with 
site and baseline NPRS as covariates. If the model estimation does not converge, then site will be 
removed from the model. The least squares mean difference from placebo for VX -548 will be 
provided along with the 95% CI and P value.  
12.3.3.2  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
SPID48 compared to HB/APAP and SPID24 compared to placebo will be analyzed in a similar 
manner as the primary endpoint.  
The time to ≥2 -point (or ≥1 -point) reduction in NPRS from baseline is the time elapsed from the 
first dose of study drug to the first time the subject has at least a 2 -point (or 1 -point) reduction in 
the NPRS from baseline. The se endpoints will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method to 
estimate the median time to event and survival curve for each treatment group. The log -rank test 
will be used to compare the survival curves between VX -548 and placebo. The time to first use 
of rescue medication will be analyzed similarly.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 44 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  The proportion of subjects reporting good or excellent on the PGA at 48 hours compared to 
placebo will be analyzed by the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test, stratified by baseline NPRS. The 
proportion of subjects u sing rescue medication from 0 to 48 hours compared to placebo will be 
analyzed similarly.  
The incidence of vomiting or nausea compared to HB/APAP will be analyzed using Pearson’s 
chi-squared test. If any expected counts are too small, Fisher’s exact test w ill be used instead.  
The total rescue medication usage from 0 to 48 hours will be analyzed by the Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test, stratified by baseline NPRS.  
12.3.3.3  Multiplicity Adjustment  
The following primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested using a hierarchical 
testing procedure. Each endpoint will be tested in the following order at the 2 -sided significance 
level of 0.05:  
• SPID48 compared to placebo  
• SPID48 compared to HB/APAP  
• Time to ≥2 -point reduction in NPRS from baseline compared to placebo  
12.3.4  Safe ty Analysis  
The overall safety profile of VX -548 will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints:  
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis)  
• Standard 12 -lead ECG outcomes  
• Vital signs  
Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively based on the Safety Set. For safety analyses, 
no statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. Additional details will be provided in the 
SAP.

PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis (if done) will be reported in a  separate document.  
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL,  REGULATORY, AND ADM INISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward med ical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) afte r the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1 .  
13.1.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessme nts including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment  is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are  clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4  laboratory value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  

Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 46 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adve rse Events  
All AEs will be collected in source documents from the time the ICF is signed until completion 
of study participation (Section 9.1.6 ). 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorde d in source documents. 
AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be recorded only in the 
subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nons erious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Pro gram, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2022). The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear  in the CTCAE will be 
determined according to the definitions in Table  13-1.

Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  13.1.1.5  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will  be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for  the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association bet ween the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clini cal status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action take n 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Table  13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be u sed in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Section 9.7 for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 48 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of  an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participati on in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at hom e)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or proced ure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not 
associated with an AE (e.g.,  social hosp italization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Protocol VX22 -548-105, Version  4.0 Page 49 of 58 
Vertex Pharmaceutic als Incorporated  Confidential Information  Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) o f a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.   
13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow -up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of 
identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of 
identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through  the Safety Follow -up Visit, the 
SAE Form will be co mpleted for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it 
becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: globalpatientsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159  
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact telephone: +1 -617-341-6677  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagn osis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study 
drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 
only as related (includes poss ibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purpos es of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.  
13.1.2.3  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporti ng suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IEC, and 
participating investigators in accordance with current ICH E2A Guidelines and/or local 
regulatory requirements, as applicable. In addition, Vertex, or authorized designee, will be 
responsible for the submission of safety letters to central IECs.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to promptly notify the local IRB/IEC of all 
unexpected serious adverse drug rea ctions involving risk to human subjects, if allowed by local

monitor will ensure that the study is conducted acco rding to the protocol design and regulatory 
requirements.  
13.5 Data Capture  
Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application 
sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct  information in the CRFs on th e 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s 
CRF. Source doc umentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in 
the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, 
and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, will complet e the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, 
including any changes made to them, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for 
whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF 
will be placed in the inves tigator’s study  file.

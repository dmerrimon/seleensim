Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 3 of 108Study Population
All patients must have PROC, defined as progression within 6 months from completion of platinum-containing 
therapy, and must be eligible for single agent chemotherapy. Safety run-in patients may have received more than 1 systemic treatment regimen for PROC. Patients elig ible for Parts A and B patients must have received 1
to 3 prior anticancer lines of therapy overall, including at least 1 line of therapy containing bevacizumab or abiosimilar to bevacizumab.
Patients must have measurable disease at baseline according to RECIST v1.1. An Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 and adequate cardiovascular, central nervous system 
(CNS), renal, and hematological functio n (including coagulation parameters) are required at baseline. Patients 
may not have active bleeding conditio ns, uncontrolled pleural/p ericardial effusions, un controlled tumor-related 
pain, peripheral neuropathy ≥  Grade 2, or ocular surface disease at the time of enrollment. Tumor TF expression 
will not be evaluated at screening or required for enrollment.
Number of Planned Patients
Approximately 222 patients may be enrolled in the study. Th is includes approximately 12 patients in the safety 
run-in phase as well as approximately 30 patients in each of 2 Par t A cohorts with a possible expansion of up to 
approximately 70 additional patients in one of the 2 Pa rt A cohorts. Part B will enroll approximately 80 patients
including approximately 60 patients who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including bevacizumab
treatment.
Study Design
This is an open-label, phase 2 study wi th an initial safety run-in period. The safety run-in period will evaluate 
the safety of a dose-dense schedule and will start at a 0.9  mg/kg dose level. If 0.9 mg/kg is considered safe and 
tolerable, the dose level will be escalated to 1.2 mg/kg. Ot herwise it will be de-escalated to 0.65 mg/kg. Each 
dose level will enroll approximately 6 patients. Patients who do not complete th e DLT period will be replaced.
A dose level is considered safe and tolerable if no more than 1 pa tient experiences a DLT among 6 patients 
during the DLT period. The highest dose level that is considered safe will be the recommended phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) and will be used in Part A. If no RP2D for the  dose-dense schedule is identified, Part A will be a single 
arm of the Q3W regimen and Part B will not enroll.
In Part A, 60 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to receive tisotumab vedotin 2.0 mg/kg intravenously 
(IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W regimen) or the safety run-in RP2D on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle 
(dose-dense regimen; 3Q4W) if a RP2D has been identif ied. Randomization will be stratified by first line vs. 
second line PROC and histology (serous vs. non-serous).
Based upon antitumor activity and safety data, one Part A treatment arm may be expa nded to enroll up to an 
additional 70 patients to further characterize safety and antitumor activity of tisotumab vedotin for patients with 
PROC. The analysis to support expansion will be cond ucted when approximately 30 patients per arm have at 
least one post-baseline response assessment per RECIST v1 .1 or have discontinued from the study or started 
subsequent cancer therapy.
Part B will enroll approximately 80 patients with PROC including approximately 60 patients who have received
1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including bevacizumab treatment. Part B will further characterize the long-term 
efficacy, safety, and PK of 0.9 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle 
(dose-dense regimen) if the 0.9 mg/kg dose level is considered safe and tolerable in the safety run-in period.
Enrollment in this cohort may discontinue when Part A begins enrollment.
Interim futility analysis will be perfor med on Part B after at least 20 patients with 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy,
including bevacizumab treatment, have been treated and ha d at least one response assessment post-baseline. The 
Bayesian predictive probability approach will be used to assess the futility criteria. Based on activity and safety 
data, together with the predictive proba bility of success (PPoS), a cohort may be stopped early by the sponsor. 
A cohort may also be discontinued at any point at the discretion of the sponsor.
On a periodic basis, a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC ) will monitor the safety of patients participating in 
the trial. The SMC will be responsible for evaluating the results of safety analyses and will make 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 4 of 108recommendations to the sponsor. Ongoing, real-time review  of patient safety and seri ous adverse events (SAEs) 
will also be conducted by the sponsor’s Drug Safety department throughout the study.
During the safety run-in period, the SMC will assess to lerability and safety of tisotumab vedotin (refer to SMC 
charter for additional details) at the end of the DLT peri od for each dose level. Ad hoc meetings of the SMC 
may be convened prior to the safety ev aluation period if safety data indicate.
An individual’s dose may be modified based upon treatment -related AEs. Response will be assessed every 
6 weeks for the first 6 months, every 12 weeks for the next 6 months, and then every 6 months after that. 
RECIST v1.1 will be used by the investigator to score responses for primary and secondary endpoints as well as 
progression. Objective responses will be confirmed with repeat scans at least 4 weeks after the first 
documentation of response. The study will be closed 3 years after the last patient is enrolled or when no patients 
remain in long-term follow-up, whichever comes first. Additionally, the sponsor may terminate the study at any time.
Investigational Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration
For the dose-dense regimen, tisotumab vedotin will be ad ministered at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg as a 
30–60 minute IV infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle. For patients weighing more than 100 kg, 
dosing will be capped at 90 mg or 120 mg for the 0.9 or 1.2 mg/kg doses, respectively, per infusion. If the dose 
for the dose-dense regimen is de-escalated to 0.65 mg /kg, the maximum dose will be capped at 65 mg per 
infusion.
For the Q3W regimen, tisotumab vedotin will be administered at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg as a 30 –60 minute IV 
infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. For patients weighing more than 100 kg, dosing will be 
capped at 200 mg per infusion.
Duration of Treatment
Patients will continue to receive study treatment until di sease progression, unacceptable toxicity, investigator 
decision, consent withdrawal, start of a subsequent anti-cancer therapy, study termination by the sponsor, 
pregnancy, or death, whichever comes first.
Efficacy Assessments
Antitumor activity will be assessed by radiographic tumor imaging at protocol-specified time points. Response 
assessment for primary and secondary efficacy endpoi nts will be evaluated by the investigator using 
RECIST v1.1. Patients will be followed for response assessments until disease progression, subsequent cancer therapy, consent withdrawal, study termination by the sponsor, or death, whichever comes first.
In addition to radiographic tumor assessments, expressi on level of CA-125 will also be monitored to assess 
response rate by CA-125 and the combination response of ORR/CA-125 as secondary endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments
Patient serum and plasma samples will be obtained for tisotumab vedotin PK and ATA evaluation at protocol
specified- time points. Concentrations  of tisotumab vedotin, total antibody, and monomethyl auristatin 
E (MMAE) will be measured in plasma and ATA in serum.
Biomarker Assessments 
Blood and fresh and/or arch ival tumor samples will be collected at protocol-specified time points. Biomarker 
analysis will not be utilized for patient selection. Biomar ker assessments in tumor tissue may include, but are 
not limited to: measurement of TF protein, mRNA  expression, disease subtype, tumor immune 
microenvironment, and tumor mutational load. Assessments in blood may include, but are not limited to: cancer 
markers such as CA-125, cytokine measurements, abundance and phenotypes of immune cell subsets, and 
circulating nucleic acids. Methods of analysis may in clude immunohistochemistry (IHC), PCR and T-cell 
receptor beta chain sequencing, multiplex immune histof luorescence, mutation and gene expression profiling, 
Next Generation Sequencing, flow cytometry, and proteomic methodologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microvesicle- assessment.
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 5 of 108Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will include the surveillance and recording of AEs, physical examination findings, eye 
examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (EC Gs), concomitant medications, pregnancy testing, and 
laboratory tests. Safety assessments will be performe d while the patient continue s to receive treatment. 
On a periodic basis, a safety monitoring committee (SMC) will monitor the safety of patients participating in 
the trial.
Statistical Methods
The primary analysis of the study will be performed when all treated patients have been followed for at least 
6 months or come off study, whichever comes first. Patien ts enrolled in the safety run-in and Parts A and B of 
the study will be summarized separately.
Safety measurements will be summarized by descriptive s tatistics based on the safety analysis set. The safety 
analysis set will include all patients who re ceived any amount of study treatment.
The primary endpoint of Parts A and B is the confirmed ORR per RECIST v1.1. The confirmed ORR will be 
estimated for each cohort based on the full analysis s et, comprising all patients who received any amount of 
study treatment. The 95% exact confidence intervals (C Is) using the Clopper-Pearson method will be provided.
Interim futility analysis will be performed on Part B after  at least 20 patients with 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, 
including bevacizumab, have been treated and had at least one response assessment post-baseline. The Bayesian predictive probability approach will be used to determine th e futility criteria. Based on activity and safety data, 
together with the PPoS, a cohort may be stopped early by the sponsor. A cohort or Part may also be discontinued at any point at the discretion of the sponsor.
For a sample size of 30 patients (Part A)  and 60 patients (Part B with 1 to 3 p rior lines of therapy, including 
bevacizumab treatment) per cohort (or 100 patients, if a treatment arm from Part A is expanded), assuming the 
confirmed ORR is between 20% and 40%, the 2-sided 95% exact CIs are summarized below:
Confirmed ORR 95% Exact CI (N=30) 95% Exact CI (N=60) 95% Exact CI (N=100)
15% (4%, 31%) (7%, 27%) (9%, 24%)
20% (8%, 39%) (11%, 32%) (13%, 29%)
30% (15%, 49%) (19%, 43%) (21%, 40%)
40% (23%, 59%) (28%, 53%) (30%, 50%)

1.1 Patient Population
Epithelial cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube , and of peritoneal origin in women exhibit 
similar biology, clinical characteristics and behavior. As such, these are often collectively 
referred to as epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in clinical trials and clinical practice.
Despite initial therapy, the vast majority of women with ovarian cancer will relapse and 
require subsequent therapy. Platinum-free interval is a strong predictor of treatment success in recurrent ovarian cancer ( Pujade-Lauraine 2011 ). Patients whose disease relapses within 
6 months after platinum-containing therapy are categorized as having platinum-resistant disease. At first relapse, approximately 25% of the patients have platinum-resistant ovarian 
cancer (PROC), and the vast majority of patients  with recurrent disease will eventually 
develop PROC ( Slaughter 2016 ).
Treatment combining double agent chemotherapy with the VEGF receptor antibody bevacizumab has become standard of care for women with PROC, despite a lack of evidence that it prolongs overall survival (OS) ( Pujade-Lauraine 2014 ). Ideal patients for 
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab include those women who have received less than 2 prior regimens, have not received bevacizumab previously, and have no history of bowel 
obstruction within six months ( Pujade-Lauraine 2014 ). For patients that relapse from or are 
not eligible for this combination treatment, options are limited primarily to single agentchemotherapy ( Pujade-Lauraine 2014 ).
For patients who relapse after first-line th erapy for PROC and are fit enough to receive 
subsequent treatment there is no standard of care. Clinical benefit, as measured by progressive-free survival (PFS) and OS, dimini shes significantly below even the poor 
prognosis of first-line treatment as the line of therapy increases ( Hanker 2012 ). Thus, there is 
an urgent need for more effective therapies for the treatment of PROC, particularly forpatients previously treated with bevacizumab.
1.2 Tissue Factor
Human Tissue Factor (TF), also called thrombopl astin, CD142 or coagulation factor III is a 
43–47 kDa, single chain, transmembrane glycoprotein. TF is the main initiator of the 
extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, which starts when TF binds to serine protease factor 
VII (FVII) or activated FVIIa. The TF:FVIIa complex initiates blood coagulation by 
proteolytic cleavage of factor X (FX) to FXa, and factor IX (FIX) to FIXa, eventually leading to thrombin generation and the formation of a clot. In addition, the TF:FVIIa complex can 
initiate an intracellular signaling cascade by proteolytic activation of protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2), resulting in release of proangiogenic factors and proinflammatory mediators such as VEGF and interleukin-8.
Constitutive TF expression is mostly restricted to subendothelial cells (such as pericytes, 
smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts) that only interact with blood borne FVIIa when vascular 
integrity is compromised ( Drake 1989 ). TF is expressed in the vessel walls of a wide range of 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 13 of 108organs, with moderate to high levels observed in the brain, heart, intestine, kidney, lung, 
placenta, uterus, and testes. Its expression pattern suggests that TF provides additional hemostatic protection to these organs. In a ddition, TF expression has been described in 
epithelial cells in a number of organs including the skin, kidney, and lung ( Drake 1989 ;
Flossel 1994 ;Imokawa 1997 ). Under pathological, inflammatory conditions TF is aberrantly 
expressed, including but not limited to bullous pemphigoid, urticaria (primarily on eosinophils), ( Cugno 2009 ;Marzano 2011 ;Marzano 2009 ), inflammatory gastrointestinal 
diseases including Crohn’s di sease and ulcerative colitis (More 1993), and lung diseases 
including acute respiratory distress syndrome ( Bastarache 2007 ).
1.2.1 Role of Tissue Factor in Malignancy
TF has a central physiological role in initiation of the coagulation cascade but, during 
oncological transformation, it is upregulated and expressed on the membranes of neoplastic cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. U nder pathological conditions, membranous TF 
can be aberrantly expressed. The pathological presence of TF in cancer cells promotes tumorinitiated- thrombosis and cancer metastasis ( Zhang 2017 ). Indications where tumor cells are
known to express TF include gynecological and genito-urinary tumors such as cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer as well as s quamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, non
small- cell lung cancer, esophageal and colorectal tumors, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and pancreatic cancer ( Akashi 2003 ;Ohta 2002 )(Chen 2010 ;Clouston 2016a ;
Clouston 2016b ;Clouston 2016c ;Cocco 2011a ;Cocco 2011b ;Khorana 2007 ;Sawada 1999;
Uno 2007 ;Yokota 2009 ).
TF is expressed widely in ovarian cancer. In one study, TF was expressed in 27 of 32 (84%) of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients with stage I to IV disease. High TF expression correlated with incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), a common complication of ovarian cancer that occurs in as many as 42% of patients ( Uno 2007 )(Abu Saadeh 2013 ).
The same association with VTE was found in a separate study that showed TF expression to be highest in clear cell carcinoma and endometroid carcinoma when compared with benign ovarian tumors ( Abu Saadeh 2013 ). A different analysis reported TF expression in 24 of 25 
(96%) ovarian cancer samples of stage I to IIIC disease, while no staining was found in normal ovarian tissue ( Cocco 2011b ). Immunohistochemical analysis of 48 primary ovarian 
tumor tissue microarrays showed membranous TF expression in 40% of these samples (sponsor’s internal data).
Expression of TF on tumor cells has been associated with negative overall survival or 
disease-free survival as described in severa l indications, including ovarian, bladder, and 
pancreatic cancer ( Han 2006 ;Nitori 2005 ;Patry 2008 ). Experimental studies suggest that 
tumor cells may benefit from both TF pro-coagulant activity and TF-induced PAR-2signaling, for example through enhanced metastatic potential, angiogenesis, and cell survival (Kasthuri 2009 ;Ruf 1996 ). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies that inhibit either TF:FVIIa 
intracellular signaling or TF pro-coagulant capacity could reduce tumor growth in vivo 
(Versteeg 2008 ).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 14 of 1081.3 Tisotumab Vedotin
Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) being developed for patients with 
tumors known to express TF, including ovarian cancer and other tumor types. It is composed of a TF- targeted human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (subtype κ) conjugated vi a a 
protease-cleavable valine citrulline linker to the drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a 
dolastatin 10 analog ( Doronina 2003 ;Hamblett 2004 ;Sun 2005 ). Dolastatins and auristatins 
belong to a class of chemotherapies that act as microtubule disrupting agents.
1.3.1 Mechanism of Action
Tisotumab vedotin binds efficiently to human TF-expressing cells and is rapidly internalized 
into tumor cells where it undergoes lysoso mal degradation resulting in release of the 
cytotoxic payload. Upon lysosomal degradation, tisotumab vedotin can induce bystander killing as a result of diffusion of free MMAE over the cell membrane, leading to cytotoxicity against neighboring tumor cells. In a biodistribution study in xenograft models, tisotumab vedotin effectively accumulated in TF-positive, but not TF- negative, tumors (sponsor’s 
internal data).
1.3.2 Preclinical Experience with Tisotumab Vedotin
Tisotumab vedotin treatment resulted in pot ent and long-lasting tumor regression in TF
expressing xenograft models derived from a variety of solid cancers, including -patient
derived- xenograft models with heteroge neous TF expression. Moreover, potent tumor 
regression was observed in xenograft models of bladder, lung, cervical, and ovarian cancer 
that had received prior treatment with paclitaxel.
Due to the mode of action of tisotumab ve dotin, its potential impact on TF-dependent 
coagulation was investigated in vitro in a series of coagulation assays. These included an 
activated factor X (FXa) generation assay, the standard prothrombin time assay, a clotting 
assay, thromboelastography (TEG), and a thrombin generation assay. Overall, only relatively minor impact of HuMax-TF on TF-mediated coagulation was observed. However, in vivo at clinically relevant or maximally tolerated doses of tisotumab vedotin in cynomolgus monkeys (≤5 mg/kg), no bleeding events were obse rved and prothrombin time and aPTT 
coagulation parameters were unaffected by treatment with tisotumab vedotin.
Tisotumab vedotin caused reversible skin changes in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 
≥5mg/kg, but, apart from this, the safety profile was consistent with MMAE/tubulin-
disrupting agents.
Further details on nonclinical studies can be found in the tisotumab vedotin Investigator’s 
Brochure.
1.3.3 Clinical Experience With Tisotumab Vedotin
Tisotumab vedotin has been investigated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials, GEN701 and 
GEN702. Each trial consists of a dose escalation part and a cohort expansion part. The dose 
escalation part has been finalized for both trials and the cohort expansion part is ongoing for 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 15 of 108GEN701. Enrollment in GEN702 has discontinued. As of 17 August 2017, 207 patients had 
been enrolled across both trials.
GEN701
Dose escalation (Part I) has completed. A to tal of 27 patients were dosed, all on a Q3W 
schedule: 0.3 mg/kg (3 patients), 0.6 mg/kg (3 patients), 0.9 mg/kg (3 patients), 1.2 mg/kg 
(3 patients), 1.5 mg/kg (3 patients), 1.8 mg/kg (3 patients), 2.0 mg/kg (3 patients), and 2.2 mg/kg (6 patients). Among the 2.2 mg/kg dose group, 3 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported in 3 patients (diabetes mellitus type II, mucositis, and neutropenic fever, all Grade 3). Based on these DLTs, the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) on a Q3W schedule was 
defined as 2.0 mg/kg.
Dose expansion (Part II) is ongoing. This portion of the study is an open label evaluation of 
the MTD of 2.0 mg/kg dosed Q3W in patients  with relapsed, advanced and/or metastatic 
cancer of the ovary, cervix, endometrium, bladder, prostate, esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, or NSCLC who have failed available standard therapy or 
who are not candidates for standard therapy. At the time of this data cut, 146 patients have been dosed with 2.0 mg/kg Q3W and 1 patient was dosed at 2.2 mg/kg Q3W.
GEN702
Dose escalation (Part I) has completed. A total of 9 patients were dosed using a dose-dense 
schedule: 0.9 mg/kg 3Q4W (3 patients) and 1.2 mg/kg 3Q4W (6 patients).
Dose expansion (Part II) has completed, with a total of 24 patients treated. Fourteen patients 
were treated at 1.2 mg/kg 3Q4W, 6 patients started at 1.2 mg/kg 3Q4W and were later 
switched to 2.0 mg/kg Q3W, and 4 received 2.0 mg/kg Q3W.
Pharmacokinetics
Based on preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of data from GEN701 dose escalation at 
the 2.0 mg/kg dose, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 1 maximum concentration (C
max) for ADC 
was 32.9 (7.3, n=3) ug/mL. The mean (std dev, n) Cycle 1 area-under-the-concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC
last) was 54.5 (18.0, n=3) 
day*ug/mL. For MMAE, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 1 C maxwas 7.32 (4.5, n=3) ng/mL and 
the AUC lastwas 78.2 (46.9, n=3) day*ng/mL.
Based on preliminary PK analysis of data from GEN702 dose escalation at the 0.9 mg/kg 
dose, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 1 C maxfor ADC was 20.4 (3.6, n=3) ug/mL and 
the AUC lastwas 36.5 (6.40, n=3) day*ug/mL. For MMAE, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 
1C maxwas 1.69 (0.93, n=3) ng/mL and the AUC lastwas 8.56 (4.1, n=3) day*ng/mL.
Based on preliminary PK analysis of data from GEN702 dose escalation at the 1.2 mg/kg 
dose, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 1 C maxfor ADC was 28.9 (3.5, n=6) ug/mL and 
the AUC lastwas 60.4 (29.0, n=6) day*ug/mL. For MMAE, the mean (std dev, n) Cycle 
1C maxwas 1.76 (1.38, n=6) ng/mL and the AUC lastwas 9.72 (7.32, n=6) day*ng/mL.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 16 of 1081.3.3.1 Summary of Clinical Safety from GEN701 and GEN702
As of 17-Aug-2017, tisotumab vedotin had been administered to 174 patients dosed on a 
Q3W schedule in GEN701 and to 33 patien ts dosed 3Q4W and/or Q3W in GEN702 
(207 total).
Based on combined safety data from the 2 trials and across all dose cohorts, the most 
commonly reported adverse events (AEs) seen in at least 41 patients ( ≥20%) were epistaxis 
(62%), fatigue (51%), nausea (44%), conjunctivitis and alopecia (38% each), decreased appetite and constipation (32% each), di arrhea (26%), vomiting (25%), peripheral
neuropathy (22%), and abdominal pain (21%).
Grade 3 or higher AEs were reported in 120 patients (58%). Across all dose cohorts the most 
frequently reported Grade ≥3 AEs seen in at least four patients (2%) were fatigue (9%), 
anaemia (7%), hyponatraemia (5%), hypokalaemi a, and abdominal pain (4% each), vomiting 
and conjunctivitis (3% each), nausea, intestinal obstruction, small intestinal obstruction, 
peripheral neuropathy, and symblepharon (2% each).
No AEs ≥ Grade 3 of coagulation abnormalities (prothrombi n time [PT], activated partial 
thromboplastin time [aPTT], or international nor malized ratio [INR]) have been reported.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported  in 96 patients (47%). Across all dose cohorts, 
the most frequently reported SAEs seen in at least four patients (2%) were abdominal pain 
(5%), vomiting and hyponatraemia (3% each), naus ea, intestinal obstruction, small intestinal 
obstruction, general physical health deterioration, and anemia (2% each).
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 60 patients (29%). Across all dose cohorts 
the most frequent AEs leading to discont inuation were peripheral neuropathy (4%), 
conjunctivitis (3%), pe ripheral sensory neuropathy and symblepharon (2% each). All other 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 2 patients (1%) each.
Five patients (3%) died within 30 days following the last dose of tisotumab vedotin in the GEN701 trial. Two patients died due to AEs c onsidered to be related to tisotumab vedotin 
(pharyngeal tumor haemorrhage in a patient given 0.6 mg/kg and pneumonia in a patient given 2.0 mg/kg), 2 patients died as an outcome of disease progression not considered related to tisotumab vedotin, and one patient in the 2.0 mg/kg dose group died due to an unknown cause. One patient (3%) died within 30 days following last dose of tisotumab vedotin in the 
GEN702 trial due to disease progression.
Ocular Adverse Events
Ocular AEs are frequently reported with ti sotumab vedotin. Events of conjunctivitis have 
been mainly CTCAE Grade 1 and 2. In May 2016, an initial ocular mitigation plan (OMP) 
was implemented upon reporting of the first case of Grade 3 conjunctivitis with irreversible damage in a patient given 0.9 mg/kg 3Q4W in the GEN702 trial. This plan was further updated in September 2016 after 2 patients in the GEN701 trial experienced Grade 2
conjunctivitis with conjunctival scarring. Due to an event of Grade 4 keratitis in the GEN701 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 17 of 108dose expansion cohort (Part II), an urgent safety measure and a more comprehensive OMP
were implemented across both GEN701 and GEN702 trials in December 2016. Elements of this ocular mitigation plan included the additi on of ocular premedicati ons for all patients 
(cooling eye pads during tisotumab vedotin infusion, vasoconstrictor eye drops immediately prior to treatment with study drug, prophylactic  treatment with topical ophthalmic steroid eye 
drops, use of lubricating eye drops throughout st udy treatment) and dose modifications for 
ocular events.
Ocular AEs with Q3W tisotumab vedotin
As of 16 Aug 2019, 396 patients have received tisotumab vedotin on a Q3W schedule. The 
most frequent ocular AEs were conjun ctivitis (29.5%), dry eye (20.7%), lacrimation 
increased (6.1%), vision blurred (6.1%), blepharitis (5.1%), and keratitis (4.8%).
Since implementation of the December 2016 comprehensive OMP ,both the frequency and 
severity of conjunctivitis, the most frequently reported ocular AE in relation to treatment 
with tisotumab vedotin, have been reduced. The  frequency of conjunctivitis decreased from 
44.2% to 25.9% in subjects dosed Q3W and only one subject has experienced a Grade 3 
event after Dec-2016 (no Grade 4 or 5 events have been observed either before or after Dec-2016). Table 1 and Figure 1 summarize the decreased frequency and severity of

Ocular AEs with Dose Dense Regimens
A total of 29 patients received 0.9 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin on a dose-dense 
schedule in the GEN702 trial. None of the 3 pat ients treated with 3Q4W 0.9 mg/kg tisotumab 
vedotin were subject to the comprehensive ocular mitigation plan in the GEN702 study as all 
were treated prior to December 2016. One of the patients treated at 0.9 mg/kg 3Q4W experienced an event of Grade 3 conjunctivitis and Grade 2 symblepharon.
A total of 26 patients received 1.2 mg/kg 3Q4W tisotumab vedotin in the GEN702 trial. The 
6 patients treated during dose escalation were treated prior to Dec 2016. The comprehensive 
OMP was inconsistently applied to the remain ing 20 patients in the expansion cohort.
Prophylactic steroid eye drops were not administered on subsequent dosing days after the 
first week for most patients. In addition, many patients with ongoing ocular events continued 
to receive tisotumab vedotin in GEN702 as th ey were treated prior to GEN702 Amendment 
4, when dose adjustments due to ocular even ts became more restrictive. Grade 3 or higher 
ocular events were seen in 6 patients ( 23%) treated with 1.2 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin,
including 5 patients (19%) with Grade 3 or higher symblepharon.
Since December 2016, the comprehensive ocular mitigation plan has been modified with 
additional measures for toxicity management (see Section 5.3.1).

Adverse Events of Special Interest
Three Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) have been identified:
●Ocular AEs : AEs of Grade 1-2 conjunctivitis are frequently reported in patients 
treated with tisotumab vedotin. Severe cases ( ≥ CTCAE Grade 3) of conjunctivitis, 
keratitis, and symblepharon have been obs erved in both trials. Implementation of a 
comprehensive mitigation plan and preven tive measures (please refer to Section 5.3)
have reduced both the frequency and severi ty of ocular adverse reactions in the 
GEN701 cohort expansion.
●AEs of peripheral neuropathy : (including preferred terms as: neuropathy 
peripheral; peripheral sensory neuropa thy; peripheral motor neuropathy; 
polyneuropathy): Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known adverse reaction to treatment 
with chemotherapeutics (including cisplatin and taxanes) as well as MMAE-based ADCs and is frequently reported in relation to treatment with tisotumab vedotin. The majority of the reported cases are Grade 1 –2; however, peripheral neuropathy was the 
leading cause of permanent discontinuation of study drug in GEN701 cohort expansion. A mitigation plan, including dose reduction and dose delays, is in place to 
control the rates and severity of peripheral neuropathy observed in patients treated with tisotumab vedotin (please refer to Section 5.3).
●AEs of bleeding : Bleeding events are considered AESI due to the target of tisotumab 
vedotin (TF). Epistaxis was the most common bleeding event, reported in 62% of patients across all dose cohorts (mainly Grade 1, one Grade 3 event). For the majority of the bleeding events (excluding epista xis) no causal relation to treatment with 
tisotumab vedotin can be established. One serious event of Grade 5 pharyngeal hemorrhage was reported in a patient with SCCHN treated in the dose escalation cohort of GEN701. This event was considered most likely due to the patient’s underlying disease. However, a causal relations hip to trial drug could not be ruled out 
at that time. Please refer to Section 5.3for dose modifications in the event of 
bleeding.
1.3.3.2 Summary of Efficacy Data from GEN701 and GEN702
Preliminary efficacy data
As of a data cutoff of 17 August 2017, 18% of patients in the GEN701 cohort expansion 
achieved response to tisotumab vedotin. The response rate varied across the indications ranging from 0% in prostate cancer to 32% in cervical cancer. Nine of the 11 responses in34 cervical cancer patients were confirmed responses (26%).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 20 of 108Among 36 patients with ovarian cancer in the GEN701 cohort expansion, the objective 
response rate (ORR) was 17% (6 patients) with  3 confirmed responses (8% confirmed ORR).
All of these patients were treated with ti sotumab vedotin at 2.0 mg/kg on a Q3W schedule.
As of the final data cut date of 26 March 2018 in  the GEN702 expansion, 12 patients with 
ovarian cancer who began treatment on the dose-dense schedule had an ORR of 33% (4 patients). Two of these 4 responses were confirmed (17% confirmed ORR). While all of these patients received 1.2 mg/kg tisotuma b vedotin 3Q4W, 1 patient was switched onto 
2.0 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin Q3W beginning at Cycle 6, after her response had been recorded. These limited data suggest that efficacy may be improved with a dose-dense schedule as compared to the Q3W schedule in patients with ovarian cancer. Though 
3 patients received 0.9 mg/kg tisotumab vedot in on the dose-dense schedule in the GEN702 
trial, none had ovarian cancer.
A complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to tisotumab vedotin and its 
study in human patients is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Benefit Risk Assessment
Data from GEN701 and GEN702 demonstrate initial activity of tisotumab vedotin in heavily 
pretreated patients with recurrent or metastatic ov arian cancer who had re ceived up to 6 lines 
of prior therapy. The most common AEs included epistaxis, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, conjunctivitis, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy. The majority of these events were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2).
Pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that dose  intensity of the 0.9 mg/kg dose-dense and 
2.0 mg/kg Q3W regimens is similar, allowing  exploration of whether the more frequent
schedule, with its different exposure profil e, may improve efficacy. Limited data from a 
small number of patients treated with 3Q4W ti sotumab vedotin in the GEN702 trial provide 
preliminary evidence that this exposure profile may , in fact, enhance efficacy as compared to 
Q3W dosing in ovarian cancer patients. The ORR was 17% in 36 ovarian cancer patients 
who received 2.0 mg/kg Q3W in GEN701 as opposed to an ORR of 33% in 12 patients who received 1.2 mg/kg 3Q4W in GEN702. The 1.2 mg/kg dose-dense regimen was associated with higher incidence of ocular adverse events in GEN702, including Grade 3 conjunctivitis and symblepharon. These patients were dosed  without comprehensive prophylactic ocular 
safety mitigation measures (the comprehe nsive OMP) or ocular AE-related dose 
modifications used in current trials.
The following measures are being employed to ensure safety of patients in this trial:
●Safety run-in analysis of the dose-dense regimen of tisotumab vedotin with a 28 day 
safety evaluation period after the last patient is dosed.
●Identification of AESIs, including ocular adverse events, and implementation of preventative mitigation plans for each, when appropriate (see Section 5.3).

prophylactic measures, that is informed by progressive modifications to ocular 
preventive measures in the GEN701 and GEN702 trials, as well as ophthalmological thought leader input (see Section 5.4).
●Formation of a safety monitoring committee (SMC) to monitor safety of tisotumab vedotin in the selected patient populations.
●Interim futility analysis performed on Part B after at least 20 patients with 1 to 3 prior 
lines of therapy, including bevacizumab treatment, have been treated and had at least one response assessment post-baseline. The interim futility analysis will ensure that further enrollment of these patients has reasonable potential to provide clinically 
meaningful benefit from tisotumab vedotin. While the futility analysis is being 
performed, enrollment in Part B will continue.
The feasibility of targeting TF in ovarian  cancer with tisotumab vedotin has been 
demonstrated in the clinic in phase I studies in heavily pretreated populations with encouraging activity results. Preliminary safety and activity data from the GEN701 and GEN702 trials suggest a positive benefit-risk profile and warrant further investigation of 
tisotumab vedotin in ovarian cancer populations that exhibit high unmet medical need.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Summary of Study Design
This is an open-label, phase 2 study with an initial safety run-in period. The safety run-in
period will evaluate the safety of a dose-dense schedule and will start at a 0.9 mg/kg dose level. If 0.9 mg/kg is considered safe and tole rable, the dose level will be escalated to 
1.2 mg/kg. Otherwise it will be de-escalated to 0.65 mg/kg. Each dose level will enroll approximately 6 patients. Patients who do not complete the DLT period will be replaced. A
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 23 of 108dose level is considered safe and tolerable if no more than 1 patient experiences a DLT 
among 6 patients during the DLT period. The high est dose level that is considered safe will 
be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and will be used in Part A. If no RP2D for the dose-dense schedule is identified, Part A will be a single arm of the Q3W regimen and Part B 
will not enroll.
In Part A, 60 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive tisotumab vedotin 
2.0 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W regimen) or the safety run-in RP2D on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle (dose-dense regimen; 3Q4W) if a RP2D has beenidentified. Randomization will be stratified by first line vs. second line PROC and histology 
(serous vs. non-serous).
Based upon antitumor activity and safety data, on e Part A treatment arm may be expanded to 
enroll up to an additional 70 patients to further characterize safety and antitumor activity of 
tisotumab vedotin for patients with PROC. The analysis to support expansion will be 
conducted when approximately 30 patients per ar m have at least one post-baseline response 
assessment per RECIST v1.1 or have discontinued from the study or started subsequent cancer therapy.
Part B will enroll approximately 80 patients with PROC including approximately 60 patients 
who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therap y, including bevacizumab treatment. Part B will 
further characterize the long-term efficacy, safety, and PK assessments of 0.9 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle (dose-dense regimen) if the0.9 mg/kg dose level is considered safe and tolerable in the safety run-in period. Enrollment 
in this cohort may discontinue when Part A begins enrollment.
Interim futility analysis will be performed on Part  B after at least 20 pati ents with 1 to 3 prior 
lines of therapy, including bevacizumab treatme nt, have been treated and had at least one 
response assessment post-baseline. The Bayesian predictive probability approach will be 
used to determine the futility criteria ( Lee 2008 ). At the time of the interim futility analysis, 
the predictive probability of success (PPoS) will be calculated. Based on activity and safety data, together with the PPoS, the cohort may continue or be stopped early by the sponsor. While the interim futility analysis is performe d, enrollment in Part B may continue. A cohort 
may also be discontinued at any point at the discretion of the sponsor.
On a periodic basis, a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will monitor the safety of 
patients participating in the trial. The SMC w ill be responsible for evaluating the results of 
safety analyses and will make recommendations to the sponsor. Ongoing, real-time review of 
patient safety and serious adverse events  (SAEs) will also be conducted by the sponsor’s 
Drug Safety department throughout the study.
During the safety run-in period, the SMC will assess tolerability and safety of tisotumab 
vedotin (refer to SMC charter for additional de tails) at the end of the DLT period for each 
dose level. Ad hoc meetings of the SMC may be convened prior to the safety evaluation 
period if safety data indicate.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 24 of 108An individual’s dose may be modified based upon treatment -related AEs. Response will be 
assessed every 6 weeks for the first 6 months, every 12 weeks for the next 6 months, and then 
every 6 months after that. RECIST v1.1 will be used by the investigator to score responses for primary and secondary endpoints as well as progression. Objective responses will be 
confirmed with repeat scans at least 4 weeks after the first documentation of response. The study will be closed 3 years after the last patient is enrolled or when no patients remain in long-term follow-up, whichever comes first. Additionally, the sponsor may terminate the 
study at any time.
Figure 2: Study design
Safety run-in will start with 3Q4W dosing of 0.9 tisotumab vedotin in approximately 12 patients. If deemed safe, this dose 
will escalate to 1.2 mg/kg. If not deemed safe, it will de-esc alate to 0.65 mg/kg. Part B will enroll only after the 0.9 mg/kg 
3Q4W dose is deemed safe by the SMC.
3.1.1 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
DLTs will be assessed during the safety run-in por tion of the study. Patients will be replaced 
for DLT evaluation if they do not complete the DLT evaluation period and do not experience 
a DLT before they discontinue from the study or start subsequent cancer therapy.
The DLT evaluation period for each safety run-in patient is defined as 28 days after the first 
dose of tisotumab vedotin. Patients who ex perience DLTs should not receive further 
treatment with tisotumab vedotin, unless clinical benefit is demonstrated with adequately managed toxicity. Subsequent treatment with tisotumab vedotin will be defined by the 
medical monitor in discussion with the site investigator in the context of the type of AE observed.
The IB for tisotumab vedotin describes AEs commonly observed, as well as less common 
serious findings. The IB should be referenced when attributing causality; however, the final 
decision regarding causality is at th e discretion of the investigator.

3.2 Discussion and Rationale for Study Design
Therapies available to patients with PROC that have previously received 1 to 3 prior lines 
therapy, including bevacizumab, have poor res ponse rates of around 12% in the first line 
setting and their effectiveness declines furt her in the second line and beyond. Long-term 
survival of patients with PROC is very low.
Patients with ovarian cancer have significant unmet medical need for therapies that can 
provide meaningful improvement. Tisotumab vedotin has been examined in a limited number 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 26 of 108of patients with ovarian cancer in the GEN701 and GEN702 trials. These initial data show 
activity and need to be explored further in this population with high unmet need. Limited available data indicate that the dose-dense regimen may yield improved efficacy with the same or somewhat higher dose intensity as the Q3W regimen. Previously, dose-dense regimens, including 0.9 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg 3QW4, were tested in GEN702 patients 
without a comprehensive ocular mitigation plan, or  strict dose modification guidelines for 
ocular toxicities in place. With appropria te ocular mitigation steps and dose-reduction 
guidelines, the dose dense schedule may be both tolerable and efficacious for this patient population.
3.2.1 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
In the safety run-in portion of the study, each dose level will enroll sequentially starting at 
0.9 mg/kg using the dose-dense schedule.
Part A will begin enrollment after the safety run-in period is completed. Patients will be 
randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing schedules in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization is intended to 
avoid bias and minimize imbalance between 2 dosing schedules on key prognostic factors for the purpose of evaluating safety and activity of the dose-dense and Q3W schedules.Randomization will be centrally controlled and stratified by fi rst line vs. second line PROC
and histology (serous vs. non-serous). At the time of randomization, a unique randomization number will be assigned to identify the dos e regimen (dose-dense or Q3W) the patient is 
allocated to. Randomization procedures are detailed in the Study Manual.
Part B will have a single treatment arm and will begin enrollment of patients after 0.9 mg/kg 
dose-dense is deemed safe and tolerabl e in the safety run-in, if this occurs.
3.2.2 Rationale for Selection of Doses
Available data indicate that, across the GEN701 and GEN702 trials, patients with ovarian 
cancer experienced more tumor responses w ith a dose-dense schedule. However, in the 
GEN702 trial, ocular toxicities occurred at a higher rate with this schedule when dosed at 1.2 mg/kg. This necessitated the imp lementation of an initial oc ular mitigation plan for 
patients in both trials who received tisotum ab vedotin. The 0.9 mg/kg dose-dense schedule 
had been completed in the GEN702 trial before the comprehensive ocular mitigation plan had been put into place and therefore these pa tients did not receive these risk mitigations.
Ultimately, weekly dosing with 1.2 mg/kg tisotumab vedotin was halted in the GEN702 trial in favor of the 2.0 mg/kg Q3W regimen. The implementation of a comprehensive ocular 
mitigation plan in December 2016 as well as dose modifications for ocular AEs substantially 
reduced both the frequency and severity of ocular adverse reactions in patients treated at 2.0 mg/kg Q3W in the GEN701 cohort expansion.
Based on preliminary PK data from the dose escalation part of GEN701, at least 95% of 
tisotumab vedotin was eliminated from the plasma within 7 days of dosing across all 
investigated doses administered Q3W. Free MMAE was eliminated 14 –21 days after 
administration. Based on preliminary PK data from GEN702 dose escalation at the 0.9 mg/kg 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 27 of 108dose, no notable accumulation of mean ADC concentrations at day 7 post-dose, or area under 
the concentration-time curve from day 0 to day 7 (AUC 0-7), was observed between the first 
and last dose of Cycle 1 on a 3Q4W schedule (n=3).
Dose intensity of the 0.9 mg/kg dose-dense a nd 2.0 mg/kg Q3W regimens is similar, 
allowing exploration of whether a dose-dense schedule, with its different exposure profile,
provides improved efficacy in ovarian cancer patients at the same dose intensity. Over a 
given cycle, the Q3W dose regimen at 2.0 mg/kg results in a dose intensity of 0.67 mg/kg/week, while the dose-dense regimen at 0.9 mg/kg 3 times every 4 weeks results in a dose intensity of 0.68 mg/kg/week. If DLTs are experienced in 2 or more patients at the 0.9 mg/kg dose during the safety run-in, a de-escalation of 28% to 0.65 mg/kg 3 times every 4 weeks will be explored. The 0.65 mg/kg dose level results in a dose intensity similar to a 
1.5 mg/kg Q3W dose. In the GEN701 trial, at the 1.5 mg/kg Q3W dose, no DLTs were 
observed. Additionally, during dose escalation in the GEN701 trial, the 1.2 mg/kg Q3W dose was the lowest dose at which a partial res ponse was observed, suggesting that 0.65 mg/kg 
3 times every 4 weeks may be in the therapeutic range.
The full implementation of a comprehensive ocular mitigation strategy allows the re-
exploration of the 1.2 mg/kg dose-dense regimen,  if 0.9 mg/kg is deemed to be safe by the
SMC. The 1.2 mg/kg dose-dense regimen represents an increase in dose intensity (33%) over the 0.9 mg/kg dose-dense regimen. The dose-dense regimens have lower maximum ADC plasma concentrations (C
max) and higher ADC trough plasma concentrations (C min) compared 
to the 2.0 mg/kg Q3W dose regimen. These differ ences in pharmacokinetic profiles allow the 
further investigation of exposure-response relationships for optimal efficacy and safety.

patients should be calculated in order to achieve a 30 –60 minute infusion period. Tisotumab 
vedotin must not be administered as an IV push or bolus. Tisotumab vedotin should not 
be mixed with other medications.
Weight- based dosing is based on the patient’s actual body weight. Doses must be adjusted 
for patients who experience a ≥10% change in weight from base line. Patient weight must be 
measured during all relevant assessment windows as described in the schedule of events. 
Other dose adjustments for changes in body weight are permitted per institutional standard. 
Rounding is permissible to the nearest kilogram.
An exception to weight-based dosing is made for patients weighing greater than 100 kg; 
doses will be based on 100 kg for these in dividuals. The maximum dose permitted per 
infusion in this study is 90 mg or 120 mg fo r patients receiving th e dose-dense regimen 
and 200 mg for patients receiving the Q3W regimen. If dosing is de-escalated to 
0.65 mg/kg for patients on th e dose-dense regimen, the maximum dose permitted per 
infusion for these patients will be 65 mg.

6.5 Response Assessments
Time points for radiographic exams should be calendar-based and do not depend on cycle 
visits. Imaging should be conducted on the following schedule until disease progression, start of a new cancer therapy, consent withdrawal, study termination by the sponsor, or death, whichever comes first:
●Every 6 weeks (±7 days) for 6 months after the first dose of tisotumab vedotin
●Every 12 weeks (±7 days) for the next 6 months (i.e., until 1 year after first dose)
●Every 6 months (±2 weeks) thereafter
Blood collections for CA-125 status should correspond as closely as possible with imaging 
visits (±5 days).
Responses must be evaluated with a confirmator y scan at least 4 week s after initial response.
6.6 End of Treatment Visit (30 to 37 days after last dose of study drug)
End of Treatment (EOT) visits should occur 30 to 37 days after the last dose of study drug 
unless delayed due to an AE. Note: The time to EOT visit may be longer than 37 days. However, EOT evaluations must be performed before initiation of a new (non-protocol) 
therapy. If EOT evaluations are completed befo re 30 days after the last study treatment, the 
patient will be contacted 30 to 37 days followi ng the last treatment to assess for adverse 
events.

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS
7.1 Screening/Baseline Assessments
Only patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria specified in Section 4will be 
enrolled in this study.
Patient medical history includes a thorough review of significant past medical history, 
current conditions, any treatment for prior malign ancies and response to prior treatment, and 
any concomitant medications.

serum, for patients of childbearing potential) are required for all patients at screening and/or baseline as described in Section 6.2and Appendix A .
7.1.1 Biopsy Collection
Fresh or archived biopsy tissue is required to be collected at baseline. Archived tumor tissue 
samples must have been obtained within 2 years prior to the first administration of tisotumab 
vedotin. Older specimens may be allowed upon approval of the sponsor’s medical monitor .
Fresh tissue must be obtained from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor 
lesion. If available, archived tumor tissue is also requested from patients who receive fresh 
biopsies. This will be used for additional biomarker analysis.
7.2 Response/Efficacy Assessments
The determination of antitumor activity will be based on objective response assessments 
made by the investigator according to the RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009) and treatment 
decisions by the investigator will be based on these assessments. Clinical response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), st able disease (SD), or PD will be determined 
at each assessment. In addition, images will be collected by an independent review facility for possible future analysis.
Measures of anti-cancer activity will be assessed by either CT with contrast or MRI scans at 
protocol-specified time points. Patients must be evaluated using the same imaging 
method throughout the study for efficacy assessments.
CT/MRI scans will include, at minimum, the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other regions 
should be scanned if the patient has known or suspected disease in that region.
Responses (CR or PR) will be confirmed with repeat scans at least 4 weeks after first 
documentation of response. The schedule for response assessments should not be adjusted 
after the confirmatory scan (e.g., CR at Week 6, confirmatory scans at Week 10, next assessment due at Week 12). Tumor imaging should also be performed whenever disease 
progression is suspected.
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than objective disease progression 
by RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix G ) or subsequent cancer therapy will continue to receive 
CT/MRI scans every 6 weeks (±7 days) for the first 6 months after the first treatment with 
tisotumab vedotin (Cycle 1 Day 1). Between 6 and 12 months on study the frequency of response assessments will be reduced to every 12 weeks (±7 days). After 1 year on study, assessments will be reduced further to every 6 months (±2 weeks). Tumor assessments will 
continue until the patient has radiologica lly-confirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 55 of 108by the investigator, initiates a new anti-cancer therapy, dies, withdraws consent, or the study 
closes, whichever comes first.
In patients who discontinue study treatment due to pregnancy, response assessments should 
be conducted as appropriate.
Patients’ clinical data must be available for CRF source verification. Copies of tumor images 
must be made available for review by the sponsor (or its designee), upon request.
In addition to radiographic tumor assessments, expression level of CA-125 will also be 
monitored to assess response rate by CA-125 and the combination response of overall response/CA-125 as secondary endpoints. Blood collections for CA-125 should correspond as closely as possible with imaging visits (±5 days).
7.3 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Assessments
Blood samples for PK and ATA will be coll ected throughout the study per the sample 
collection schedule provided in Appendix B . Validated assays will be used to measure the 
concentrations of tisotumab vedotin and MMAE in serum or plasma. Two assays will be 
used for tisotumab vedotin: one detecting ti sotumab vedotin only and one detecting total 
antibody. PK samples will be collected and arch ived for possible analysis of other tisotumab 
vedotin-related species. A qualified assay will be used to determine the levels of ATA in 
serum.
Refer to the Central Laboratory Manual for information on collection, processing, storage, 
and shipment of samples. It may be possible to have some samples collected via home visits 
by an external home health aide vendor. More in formation regarding this service will be 
provided by the sponsor prior to the site initiation visit.
7.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes Assessments
Parts A and B, US patients only , validated instruments will be utilized for health-related 
quality of life assessment from the patient’s perspective. Patients will be required to respond 
to questions related to physical functioning, adverse effects of treatment, and the overall burden of adverse effects. Patients will be reque sted to complete each of the questionnaires at 
timepoints described below before clin ic visits (see Schedule of Events, Appendix A ).
Questionnaires may be completed remotely.
Each patient will have an option to answer questions electronically or via paper. Patients will 
respond to questions related to adverse effects (10 questions), the overall burden of adverse effects (1 question) and vision related problems (3 questions) every 7 days during a set time interval. Patients will respond to key physical functioning related questions (6 questions) on Day 1 of each treatment cycle before infusion of study drug and at the end of treatment visit (EOT).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 56 of 108The following instruments will be utilized:
●NCI PRO-CTCAE: Questions related to adverse effects patients may experience 
during the trial are taken from a set of items from the NCI PRO-CTCAE item bank. 
Of the 78 items related to symptomatic treatment toxicities available in NCI PRO-CTCAE, a total of 10 questions related to visual symptoms (blurred vision, watery eyes), gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) bleeding (bruising, nose bleeds), and neurological (numbness and tingling) were selected for this trial (see Appendix D ).
●PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System): Patients will respond to 6 questions related to their ability to carry out various physical 
activities. The questions are from PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes 
Measurement Information System) item bank (PROMIS Version 1.2 SF 6b –See
Appendix D ).
In addition to NCI PRO-CTCAE and PROMIS, 4 additional PRO questions have been added 
by the sponsor. Three of these questions allow patients to report symptoms related to color vision, near vision, and night vision, resp ectively, on a simple 5-point scale. (Appendix D ).
One additional question allows patient to report the overall effect of symptoms, also on a 5-point scale ( Appendix D ).
7.5 Biomarker Studies
Samples for exploratory biomarkers will be co llected at protocol-specified time points per the 
schedule provided in Appendix B . Biomarker assessments will not be used for patient 
selection.
Methods of analysis may include immunohistochemistry (IHC), mIHF, Next Generation 
Sequencing, PCR, mutation and gene expression profiling; T-cell receptor beta chain 
sequencing, flow cytometry, and proteomic methodologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microvesicle assessment.
7.5.1 Protein Markers in Blood
The primary effects of tisotumab vedotin on tumor cells may lead to changes in the activation 
state of local, tumor-associated, and periphera l immune cells. Biomarker assessments in 
blood samples may include but may not be limited  to CA-125 status and markers of immune 
function, including abundance and phenotype of immune cell subsets and abundance of cytokines. These may provide insight into treatment-related changes in activation state of peripheral immune system associated with tisotumab vedotin-induced tumor cell death.
7.5.2 Characterization of Tumor Tissue
To better understand relationships between pre-t reatment tumor biological characteristics and 
patient outcome, submission of tumor tissue is required during the screening period 
(pretreatment). Patient is required to provide fresh tissue from a newly-obtained core or 
excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion OR an archived specimen obtained within 2 years of the 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 57 of 108first administration of tisotumab vedotin. Old er specimens may be allowed upon approval of 
the sponsor’s medical monitor . Please see the Laboratory Manual for details.
Biomarker assessments in tumor tissue may include, but not be limited to:
●Tumor expression of TF protein
●Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression (e.g., TF)
●Markers of disease subtype (e.g., The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] subtypes)
●Mutational load
●Markers of the tumor immune microenvironment (e.g., PD-L1, CD4, CD8)
If available and the patient consents, archived  tumor tissue is also requested from patients 
who received fresh biopsies. This tissue will be used for biomarker analysis.
Any unscheduled tumor biopsies performed while a patient is on study should be made 
available to the sponsor if feasible and if the patient has signed the consent form to allow submission of this tissue. For example, if a biopsy on residual tumor is performed at the end of treatment or at progression, a sample will be collected (if available).
7.6 Biospecimen Repository
In the US only, for patients who provide additional consent, remaining de-identified unused 
blood and/or tissue will be retained by Seattle Genetics and used for future research, including but not limited to the evaluation of ta rgets for novel therapeutic agents, the biology 
of ADC sensitivity and resistance mechanisms, and the identification of biomarkers of ADCs. Blood and tissue samples donated for future research will be retained for a period of up to 25 years. If additional consent is not provided, any remaining biological samples will be destroyed after the study has been comple ted and all applicable regulatory obligations 
have been met.
7.7 Safety Assessments
The assessment of safety during the course of this study will consist of the surveillance and 
recording of AEs including serious adverse events (SAEs), recording of concomitant 
medication, and measurements of protocol-specified physical examination findings and laboratory tests. Safety assessments will be performed at prespecified time points through the end of treatment visit.
Safety will be monitored over the course of the study by an SMC which includes sponsor 
representatives including the study statistician, drug safety representative, and medical monitor as well as all investigators with at least one patient enrolled in the trial. An ongoing, real-time review of patient safety and SAEs will also be conducted by the sponsor’s Drug 
Safety Department.

Vital signs measures are to include heart rate, blood pressure (while patient is in seated 
position), and temperature.
7.7.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed locally. This testing will include institutional 
standard tests for evaluating safety and making clinical decisions. With the exception of pregnancy testing, results of clinical laboratory tests are to be submitted to the central laboratory.
The following laboratory assessment(s) will be performed at scheduled time points (see 
Appendix A ) during the course of the study:
●The estimated GFR (eGFR) should be calculated using the MDRD equation as applicable, with serum creatinine (Scr) reported in mg/dL:
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m
2) = 175 x (Scr)-1.154x (Age)-0.203x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if
African American)If Scr is reported in μmol/L, the value should be converted to mg/dL using the 
conversion factor 0.011312 μmol/L to mg/dL.
●Coagulation parameters: fibrinogen, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT), and international normalized ratio (INR)
●A serum or urine β-hCG pregnancy test for patients of childbearing potential (See 
Section 7.7.6)
●Chemistry panel: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, chloride, LDH, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, glucose, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), amylase, lipase, uric acid, and total bilirubin.
●CBC with differential is to include the following tests: white blood cell count with five-part differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), platelet count, he moglobin, and hematocrit.
●Hemoglobin Alc
●CA-125 expression levels
Test results for biochemistry, hematology, and coagulation factors must be obtained and reviewed by the investigator within 24 hours prior to trial treatment administration. Laboratory test values should be recorded in the eCRF if they are of clinical importance, e.g., used as supportive information on an AE or lead to dose modifications/delays of the trial treatment.

Physical examinations should include assessments of the following body parts/systems: 
abdomen, extremities, head, heart, lungs, neck, and neurological. Measurements of height obtained within the prior 12 months may be utilized.
7.7.4 Ophthalmological Exam
An ophthalmological evaluation must be performed by an ophthalmologist at screening prior 
to treatment with tisotumab vedotin. This screening exam will allow the ophthalmologist to have a pre-treatment assessment for adequate on-treatment comparison. In addition, patients must be referred for additional ophthalmological examinations if ocular symptoms occur or in the case of objective findings from scheduled eye exams at the site (see Section 5.3.1).
Relevant physical findings from the ophthalmological examination must be documented in the eCRF (See Section 5.3.1). Assessments to be performed with results recorded on the 
eCRF include visual acuity, Schirmer’s test, slit lamp, inspections of the conjunctivas and corneas including staining, intraocular pressure, and fundoscopy.
7.7.5 Eye Examination
Eye examination should be assessed by the investigator and should include a visual 
inspection of the eye orbit and conjunctiva and control of normal eye movement. The patient should be asked about any ocular symptoms (e.g., itchy eyes, sticky eyelids, eye secretion, blurry vision etc.).
In case of either subjective ocular symptoms and/or objective findings, every effort must be 
made to refer the patient to an ophthalmologist for prompt review within 3 days. Relevant 
physical findings from the ophthalmological examination must be documented in the eCRF (See Section 5.3.1).
7.7.6 Pregnancy Testing
For patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine β-hCG pregnancy test with sensitivity 
of at least 25 mIU/mL will be performed locally at baseline, within 7 days prior to Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the EOT visit.
A negative pregnancy result is required before the patient may receive each infusion of study 
drug. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated as requested per IRB/IEC or if required by local 
regulations.
7.7.7 Electrocardiogram
ECGs are to be obtained per institutional standard at time points defined in Section 6and 
Appendix A . Routine 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the patient has been in a supine 
position for at least 5 minutes. Paper copies of the tracings will be used for data entry into the 
CRF.

7.7.8.1 DefinitionsAdverse Event
According to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guideline Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 CFR 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered 
a medicinal product and which doe s not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.
The following information should be considered  when determining whether or not to record a 
test result, medical condition, or other incident on the Adverse Events and Pre-existing 
Conditions CRF:
●From the time of informed consent through the day prior to study Day 1, only study protocol-related AEs should be recorded. A protocol-related AE is defined as an untoward medical event occurring as a result of a protocol mandated procedure.
●All medical conditions present or ongoing predose on study Day 1 should be recorded (i.e., hypertension).
●All AEs (regardless of relationship to study drug) should be recorded from study Day 1 (predose, during and postdose) through the end of the safety reporting period (see Section 7.7.8.5 ). Complications that occur in association with any procedure 
(e.g., biopsy) should be recorded as AEs whether or not the procedure was protocol mandated.
●Changes in medical conditions and AEs, including changes in severity, frequency, or character, during the safety reporting period should be recorded.
●In general, an abnormal laboratory value should not be recorded as an AE unless it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms, requires an intervention, results in a SAE, or results in study termination or interrupt ion/discontinuation of study treatment. 
When recording an AE resulting from a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality its elf should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” 
rather than “low hemoglobin”).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 61 of 108Serious Adverse Events
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria:
Fatal: AE resulted in death
Life threatening: The AEs placed the patient at immediate risk  of death. This classification does not 
apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.
Hospitalization: The AE resulted in hospitalization or  prolonged an ex isting inpatient 
hospitalization. Hospitalizations fo r elective medical or surgical procedures or 
treatments planned before the signing of informed consent in the study or routine 
check -ups are not SAEs by this criterion. Admission to a palliative unit or hospice 
care facility is not considered to be a hospitalization. Hospitalizations or prolonged 
hospitalizations for scheduled therapy of the underlying cancer or study target 
disease need not be captured as SAEs.
Disabling/ 
incapacitating:An AE that resulted in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
Congenital anomaly or 
birth defect:An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the molecule or 
study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.
Medically significant: The AE did not meet any of the above criteria, but could have jeopardized the 
patient and might have required medical or  surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal 
product of an infectious agent. Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) also is 
considered a medically significant event (see Section 7.7.8.1 for the definition of 
potential DILI.)
Adverse Event Severity
AE severity should be graded using the NCI CTCAE v5.0. These criteria are provided in the 
study manual.
AE severity and seriousness are a ssessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity 
of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the sponsor for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAEs, above).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 62 of 108Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment
The relationship of each AE to study treatment (tisotumab vedotin) should be evaluated by 
the investigator using the following criteria:
Related: There is evidence to s uggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE, 
such as:
●A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., an gioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome)
●One or more occurrences of an event th at is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in  the population exposed to the drug 
(e.g., tendon rupture)
Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is more plausi ble (e.g., due to underlying disease or 
occurs commonly in the study population), or a temporal sequence cannot be 
established with the onset of the AE and administration of the study treatment, or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible
Investigator and study personnel will report all AEs and SAEs whether elicited during patient questioning, discovered during physical examination, laboratory testing and/or other means by recording them on the CRF and/or SAE form, as appropriate.
7.7.8.2 Procedures for Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events
Eliciting Adverse Events
An open-ended or non-directed method of questioning should be used at each study visit to 
elicit the reporting of AEs.
Recording Adverse Events
The following information should be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre-existing 
Conditions CRF:
●Description including onset and resolution dates
●Whether it met SAE criteria
●Severity
●Relationship to study treatment or other causality
●Outcome
Diagnosis vs. Signs or Symptoms
In general, the use of a unifying diagnosis is preferred to the listing out of individual 
symptoms. Grouping of symptoms into a diagnosis should only be done if each componentsign and/or symptom is a medically confirmed component of a diagnosis as evidenced by standard medical textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or symptom does not fit into a classic pattern of the diagnosis, report the individual symptom as a separate adverse event.
Important exceptions for this study are adverse reactions associated with the infusion of 
study drug. For IRRs, do not use the NCI CTCAE terms of “cytokine release syndrome,” 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 63 of 108“acute infusion reaction,” or “allergic or hypersen sitivity reaction.” Instead, record each sign 
or symptom as an individual AE. If multiple signs or symptoms occur with a given infusion-
related event, each sign or symptom should be recorded separately with its level of severity.
Recording Serious Adverse Events
For SAEs, record the event(s) on both the CRF and an SAE form.
The following should be considered when recording SAEs:
●Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported on both an SAE form and CRF.
●For hospitalizations, surgical, or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the narrative as part of the action taken in response to the illness.
Progression of the Underlying Malignancy
Since progression of underlying malignancy is being assessed as an efficacy variable, it 
should not be reported as an AE or SAE. The terms “Disease Progression”, “Progression of 
Disease” or “Malignant Disease Progression” an d other similar terms should not be used to 
describe an AE or SAE. However, clinical symp toms of progression may be reported as AEs 
or SAEs if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to progression of the underlying malignancy or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease 
under study. In addition, complications from progression of the underlying malignancy 
should be reported as AEs or SAEs.
Pregnancy
Notification to Drug Safety
Complete a Pregnancy Report Form for all pregnancies that occur from the time of first study 
drug dose until 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s). Email or fax to the sponsor’s Drug Safety Department within 48 hours of beco ming aware of a pregnancy. All pregnancies 
will be monitored for the full duration; all perinatal and neonatal outcomes should be 
reported. Infants should be followed for a minimum of 8 weeks.
Collection of data on the CRF
All pregnancies (as described above) that occur within 30 days of the last dose of study 
drug(s) will also be recorded on the Adverse Events and Pre-Existing Conditions CRF.
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should be reported as an SAE. 
Congenital anomalies or birth defects, as defined by the ‘serious’ criterion above (see 
definitions Section 7.7.8.1 ) should be reported as SAEs.
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 64 of 108Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury
The observation of the critical importance of altered liver function has been referred to 
informally as Hy’s Law (Reuben 2004) . Hy’s Law can be used to estimate severity and the 
likelihood that a study drug may cause an increased incidence of severe hepatotoxicity.
The absence of hepatotoxicity in clinical tr ials provides a limited predictive value for 
potential hepatotoxicity in the clinical setting(s) being studied. However, finding 1 Hy’s Law 
case in clinical trials is ominous; finding 2 cases is highly predictive of a potential for severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI).
Definition
Briefly, potential Hy’s Law cases include the following 3 components:
1. Aminotransferase (ALT and/or AST) elevation >3 x ULN
AND2. Total bilirubin >2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (i.e., elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase),
AND3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransferase elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or 
acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
Reporting Requirements
Any potential Hy’s Law case should be handled as a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction (SUSAR) associated with the use of the drug and reported promptly to 
the sponsor.
Reporting should include all available informat ion and should initiate close follow-up until 
complete resolution of the problem and completion  of all attempts to obtain supplementary 
data.
Follow-up for Abnormal Laboratory Results Suggesting Potential DILI
In general, an increase of serum ALT or AST to >3x ULN should be followed by repeat 
testing within 48 to 72 hours of serum ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, 
to confirm the abnormalities and to determine whether they are worsening.
Appropriate medical assessment should be in itiated to investigate potential confounding 
factors and alternative causes of hepatotoxicity. 
7.7.8.3 Reporting Periods for Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The safety reporting period for all AEs and SAEs is from study Day 1 (predose) through the 
EOT visit or 30 days after the last study treatment (tisotumab vedotin), whichever is later. 
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 65 of 108However, all study protocol-related AEs are to be recorded from the time of informed 
consent. All SAEs that occur after the safety  reporting period and are considered study 
treatment-related in the opinion of the investig ator should also be reported to the sponsor.
SAEs will be followed until significant changes return to baseline, the event stabilizes (recovering/resolving) or is no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator, or the patient dies or withdraws consent. All non-serious AEs will be followed through the safety reporting period. Certain non-serious AEs of interest (i.e., all ocular events) will be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or study closure.
7.7.8.4 Serious Adverse Events and AESIs Requiring Immediate Reporting
Within 24 hours of observing or learning of any SAE, investigators are to report the event to 
the sponsor, regardless of the relationship of the event to the study treatment regimen. 
Additionally, all ocular AEs (any grade, whethe r they meet seriousness criteria or not) must 
be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours. Ocular AEs are the only non-serious events that should be reported on an SAE form.
For initial SAE reports, available case details are to be recorded on an SAE form. At a 
minimum, the following should be included:
●Patient number
●Date of event onset
●Description of the event
●Study treatment, if known
The completed SAE form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet are to be emailed or faxed to the sponsor’s Drug Safety Department within 24 hours (see email or fax number specified on the SAE report form) u nless otherwise instructed on the sponsor’s SAE form.
Relevant follow-up information is to be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes available.
7.7.8.5 Sponsor Safety Report ing to Regulatory Authorities
Investigators are required to report all SAEs, including anticipated SAEs, to the sponsor (see 
Section 7.7.8.4). Investigators must also report all ocular AEs, whether or not they meet 
seriousness criteria, to the sponsor.
The sponsor will report all SAEs and ocular AEs to regulatory authorities as required per 
local regulatory reporting requirements. In the United States, endpoints that assess disease-related mortality or major morbidity, as well as other SAEs that are not study endpoints but are known consequences of the underlying disease or condition that are anticipated to occur in the study population, should not be reported to the FDA as individual IND safety reports per the final rule amending the IND safety reporting requirements under 21 CFR 312.32 and 
the FDA’s guidance Safety Assessment for IND Safety Reporting Guidance for Industry 
(draft guidance December 2015).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 66 of 108In this study, progression of underlying malignancy is not reported as an AE or SAE. No 
individual IND safety reports will be submitted for progression of underlying malignancy. Progression of underlying malignancy will be evaluated as an efficacy endpoint.
7.8 Appropriateness of Measurements
The safety measures that will be used in th is trial are considered standard procedures for 
evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications.
Response will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1, which are standardized criteria for 
evaluating response in the solid tumors comprising the cohorts in this study. The intervals of evaluation in this protocol are considered appropriate for disease management.
Immunogenicity is commonly assessed for biologics; therefore, standard tests will be 
performed to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to tisotumab vedotin. Pharmacokinetic assessments are also common in  clinical studies to help characterize dose-
exposure-response relationships.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 67 of 108Monitoring visits will occur periodically, with frequency dependent on the rate of enrollment 
and workload at each site. During monitoring visits, the Seattle Genetics representative will 
typically review regulatory documentation, CRFs, source documentation, and investigational product storage, preparation, and accountab ility. The CRFs will be reviewed for 
completeness, adherence to the provided guidelines, and accuracy compared to the source documents. The investigators must ensure that the monitor is allowed to inspect all source documents pertinent to study patients, and must cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems noted in the course of the trial are resolved. The investigator must maintain a comprehensive and centralized filing sys tem of all study-related documentation that is 
suitable for inspection by Seat tle Genetics or its designated monitors and by quality 
assurance auditors, or representatives of regulatory authorities.
8.2 Data Management Procedures
Seattle Genetics will provide CRF Completion Guidelines for eCRF data entry. Study 
specific data management procedures will be maintained in the data management plan. 
Queries resulting from edit checks and/or data verification procedures will be posted electronically in the eCRF.
8.3 Access to Source Data
The investigator will permit the sponsor’s representatives to monitor the study as frequ ently 
as the sponsor deems necessary to determine that protocol adherence and data recording are 
satisfactory. Appropriate measures to protect patient confidentiality are to be employed during monitoring. The CRFs and related source documents will typically be reviewed in 
detail by the monitor at each site visit. Orig inal source documents or certified copies are 
needed for review. This review includes insp ection of data acquired as a requirement for 
participation in this study and other medical  records as required to confirm that the 
information contained in the CRFs, such as disease assessments, AEs, and concomitant 
medications, is complete and correct. Other study records, such as correspondence with the 
sponsor and the IRB/IEC and screening and drug accountability logs will also be inspected. 
All source data and study records must also be available for inspection by representatives of 
regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC.
8.4 Accuracy and Reliability of Data
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include:
●The selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers.
●Review of protocol procedures with the i nvestigators and associated personnel prior 
to the study.
●Periodic monitoring visits by the designated monitor(s).
●CRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the designated monitor(s) 
during monitoring visits to the study centers and/or by centralized monitoring. Any 
discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designees as appropriate.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 68 of 1088.5 Quality Assurance Procedures
The Research and Development Quality group or its designee may conduct audits at the 
clinical site or other study-related facilities and organizations. Audit reports will be retained 
by the Research and Development Quality group of Seattle Genetics as part of the written 
record.
8.6 Data Handling and Record Keeping
8.6.1 Data Handling
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensu re the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and 
timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports. Data 
reported on the CRF that is derived from source documents should be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies should be explained.
Any change or correction to a CRF will be maintained in an audit trail within the electronic
data capture system. Data changes may only be made by those individuals so authorized. The investigator should retain records of the changes and corrections, written and/or electronic.
8.6.2 Investigator Record Retention
The investigator shall retain study drug disposition records and all source documentation 
(such as original ECG tracings, laboratory reports, inpatient or office patient records) for the maximum period required by the country and institution in which the study will be 
conducted, or for the period specified by S eattle Genetics, whichever is longer. The 
investigator must contact Seattle Genetics prior to destroying any records associated with the 
study. If the investigator withdraws from the study (due to relocation, retirement, etc.), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee, such as another investigator or IRB/IEC. Notice of such transfer will be provided in writing to Seattle Genetics.
9 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
Up to approximately 222 patients may be enrolle d in the study. This includes approximately 
6–12 patients in the safety run -in phase, approximately 30 patients in each of 2 randomized 
Part A cohorts, and the possible expansion of an additional 70 patients in one of the 2 Part A
cohorts. Part B will enroll approximately 80 pa tients including approximately 60 patients 
who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including bevacizumab treatment.
Analysis regarding expansion of Part A will be conducted when approximately 30 patients 
per cohort have at least one post-baseline response assessment per RECIST v1.1 or have discontinued from the study or started subsequent cancer therapy.
A cohort may be expanded to further characterize antitumor activity if the safety profile is 
acceptable, other efficacy endpoints are compar able to current standard of care, and the 
number of confirmed CR or PR meet cohort-specific criteria.
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 69 of 108The sample size is not based on power calculations for formal hypothesis testing, but is 
selected based on ORR estimate precision as characterized by 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For a sample size of 30 patients (Part A) and 60 patients (Part B with 1 to 3 prior lines 
of therapy, including bevacizumab treatment) per  cohort (or 100 patients, if a treatment arm 
from Part A is expanded), assuming the co nfirmed ORR is between 20% and 40%, the

9.2 Study Endpoint Definitions
9.2.1 Confirmed ORR 
Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR 
according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator. Patients who do not have at least 2 post-baseline response assessments (initial resp onse and confirmation scan) will be counted 
as non-responders.
9.2.2 Confirmed and Unconfirmed ORR 
Confirmed and unconfirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR 
or PR according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator. These include patients with 
confirmed responses as well as those whose responses were not confirmed or had not yet 
been assessed for confirmation. Patients who do not have at least 1 post-baseline response 
assessment will be counted as non-responders.
9.2.3 CA-125 Response Rate
CA-125 response rate is defined as the proporti on of patients who have at least a 50% 
reduction in CA-125 value from baseline. The re sponse must be confirmed in a subsequent 
sample collected ≥28 days after the prior sample. The absolute value of the confirmatory 
sample must be ≤110% of the prior sample. Only patients  who have an elevated baseline 
CA-125 value of ≥2 x ULN and within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug will be 
included in the analysis.
9.2.4 Combined RECIST/CA-125 Overall Response
The combined RECIST/CA-125 overall response is defined as the proportion of patients 
whose best response is a CR or PR according to the Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) combined RECIST and CA-125 criteria ( Rustin 2011 ). The combined overall 
response will be assessed as indicated in Table 8 .

for patients with elevated CA-125 before treatment which never normalizes, or 3) CA- 125 ≥2x ULN on 2 occasions at 
least 1 week apart for patients with CA-125 in the reference range before treatment.
c Target lesions are not all evaluated, non-target lesions are non-PD, and no new lesions appear.
9.2.5 Disease Control Rate
Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR or PR 
according to RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator, or meet the SD criteria at least 
once after start of study treatment at a minimum interval of 12 weeks ( –1 week window). 
Patients who do not have at least 1 post-baseline response assessment will be counted as non-responders.
9.2.6 Duration of Response 
DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR 
that is subsequently confirmed) to the first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.
DOR data will be censored as described below:
●Patients who do not have PD and are still on study at the time of an analysis will be 
censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting absence of PD.
●Patients who started a new anti-cancer treat ment prior to documentation of PD will be 
censored at the date of last disease assessment prior to the start of new treatment.
●Patients who are removed from the study prior to documentation of PD will be censored at the date of last disease assessment documenting absence of PD.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 71 of 108●Patients who progressed or died after an extended loss to follow up 
(i.e.,≥2consecutive missed disease assessments) will be censored at the date of the 
last disease assessment prior to the missed visits.
DOR will only be calculated for patients w ho achieve a confirmed CR or PR according to 
RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator.
9.2.7 Time to Response
Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first 
documentation of objective response (CR or PR th at is subsequently confirmed). TTR will 
only be calculated for patients who achieve a confirmed CR or PR, and will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics.
9.2.8 Progression-Free Survival
PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first documentation of PD 
or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.
The same censoring rules as outlined in Section 9.2.6 for DOR will be applied to PFS. 
Patients who are not known to have died and who do not have an evaluation of tumor 
response after their first dose of study drug will be censored at Day 1.
9.2.9 Overall Survival
OS is defined as the time from the start of stud y treatment to date of death due to any cause. 
In the absence of death, survival time will be censored at the last date the patient is known to 
be alive (i.e., date of last contact).
9.3 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical and analytical plans presented be low summarize the more complete plans to be 
detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A change to the data analysis methods 
described in the protocol will require a prot ocol amendment only if it alters site conduct 
(e.g., adding baseline assessments to define a subgroup). The SAP will be finalized prior to 
database lock. Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be described and justified in the clinical study report.
9.3.1 General Considerations
Patients enrolled in the safety run-in portion, Part A and Part B will be summarized 
separately. All analyses in Part A and Part B will be presented by cohort and total unless 
otherwise specified.
Descriptive statistics will be presented that include the number of observations, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum and maxim um for continuous variables, and the 
number and percentages per category for categorical variables.
The 2-sided 95% exact confidence interval (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method ( Clopper 
1934) will be calculated for the response rates where applicable (e.g., ORR).
Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 72 of 108For time-to-event endpoints, the median surviva l time will be estimated using the Kaplan-
Meier method; the associated 95% CI will be calculated based on the complementary log-log 
transformation ( Collett 1994 ).
9.3.1.1 Randomization and Blinding
This is an open-label phase 2 study with an initial safety run-in phase. The safety run-in will 
evaluate the tolerability of dose-dense regimen. If the tolerability is confirmed, the study will proceed to Part A and Part B. In Part A, randomiz ation will be stratified by first line vs. 
second line PROC and histology (serous vs. non -serous). Patients will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive tisotumab vedotin 2.0 mg/kg Q3W or the RP2D dose-dense regimen.Randomization is used in this study to minimize bias and not as a basis for statistical 
inference as the study includes no formal statistical hypothesis testing.
If the tolerability of dose-dense regimen is not confirmed after the safety run-in, Part A will 
be a single-arm treated with the Q3W dosing schedule.
Part B will be a single arm of the 0.9 mg/kg dose dense regimen.
9.3.1.2 Adjustments for Covariates
No adjustments for covariates are planned in the analyses.
9.3.1.3 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data
Missing data will not be imputed unless otherw ise specified. Missing AE start date and/or 
end date will be imputed while calculating durat ion of events and treatment-emergent status.

Study SGNTV-002 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4, 24-Aug-2020
Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 73 of 108The safety analysis set includes all patients  who received any amount of study drug, and thus 
is equivalent to the FAS. All safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set.
The DLT evaluable analysis set includes all patients who received any amount of study drug 
and have completed the DLT evaluation pe riod or have experienced a DLT. The DLT 
evaluable set applies only to the safety run-in cohort.
The efficacy-evaluable (EE) analysis set incl udes patients who received any amount of study 
drug and had at least one post-baseline disease assessment per RECIST v1.1 or discontinued 
from the study or started subsequent cancer therapy. The EE analysis set will be used for supplemental analysis of efficacy endpoints as applicable.
The CA-125 evaluable analysis set includes patients with ovarian cancer who have an 
elevated baseline CA-125 va lue of ≥2 x ULN and within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of 
study drug. The CA-125 evaluable analysis set will be used for the analysis of CA-125
response rate.
9.3.1.8 Examination of Subgroups
As exploratory analyses, subgroup analyses may be conducted for selected endpoints. 
Subgroups may include but are not limited to the following:
●Platinum-free interval
●Histology
●First line vs. second line PROC
●TF expression
●Prior treatment with CPIs
●Prior treatment with PARP inhibitors
9.3.1.9 Timing of Analyses
The primary analysis of study will be conducted when all treated patients have been followed 
for at least 6 months or come off study, whiche ver comes first. Subsequent data cutoff dates 
may be defined to assess longer term clinical benefit with further follow up.
A safety analysis will be conducted at end of  DLT period for each dose level in the safety 
run-in portion to evaluate the tolerability of dose-dense regimen.

specified. Supplemental analysis of efficacy endpoints may be performed using the EE 
analysis set.
9.3.4.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses
The primary endpoint of this study is the confirmed ORR according to RECIST v1.1 per 
investigator assessment. The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a 
confirmed CR or PR. The confirmed ORR and it s exact 2-sided 95% CI will be calculated.
9.3.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The confirmed and unconfirmed ORR according  to RECIST v1.1, CA-125 response rate, and 
combined RECIST/CA-125 overall response rate will be estimated and the 95% CIs will be 
calculated. In addition, the TTR will be summ arized for patients who achieve confirmed 
objective responses.
The DOR, PFS, and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology and the 
medians and associated 95% CIs will be calcula ted. Kaplan-Meier plots will be provided as 
appropriate. The 6 month PFS rate and the 6 month OS rate will be estimated with 95% CI.
9.3.5 Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Analyses
Tisotumab vedotin and MMAE concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics

9.3.8.1 Extent of Exposure
Extent of exposure will be summarized by c ohort for the safety analysis set. Summary 
statistics for duration of therapy, number of cycles, total dose, and dose intensity will be 
presented. Dose modifications, including dose delay, dose reduction, and unplanned dose adjustment, will be summarized. Details will be provided in the SAP.
9.3.8.2 Adverse Events
An overview of AEs will provide a tabulation of the incidence of all AEs, treatment-
emergent AEs, treatment-related AEs, Grade 3 and higher treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, 
treatment-related SAEs, deaths, and AEs leadin g to study treatment discontinuation. Adverse 
events will be defined as treatment emergent if  they are newly occurring or worsen after first 
dose of study treatment and including 30 days after last dose of study treatment.
Treatment-emergent AEs will be listed and summarized by Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. In the event of multiple occurrences of the same AE with the same preferred term in 1 patient, the AE will be counted only once as the occ urrence. The incidence of AEs will be tabulated 
by preferred term and treatment group. AESIs and AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized and listed in the same manner.
9.3.8.3 Deaths and Serious Adverse Events
SAEs will be listed and summarized in th e same manner as all AEs. Events with a fatal 
outcome will be listed.
9.3.8.4 Clinical Laboratory Results
Summary statistics of laboratory results and ch anges from baseline will be tabulated by 
scheduled visit. Grading of laboratory values will be assigned programmatically per the NCI 
CTCAE v5.0. Shift tables comparing the worst post-baseline to baseline CTCAE grade will be presented. Laboratory values will be lis ted with grade per CTCAE and flagged when 
values are outside th e normal reference range.

ECG status (normal, abnormal clinically significant, or abnormal not clinically significant) 
will be summarized by scheduled visit, a nd shifts from baseline will be tabulated.
9.3.9 Interim Analyses
A safety analysis will be conducted at end of  DLT period for each dose level in the safety 
run-in portion to evaluate the tolerability of do se-dense regimen. A SMC consisting of the 
investigators, study medical monitor, biostatistician, and drug safety representative will 
review the data before proceeding to Part A.
Interim analysis for futility will be performed on Part B after at least 20 patients with 1 to 3
prior lines of therapy, including bevacizumab treatment, have been treated and had at least 
one response assessment post-baseline.
The Bayesian predictive probability approach will be used to determine the futility criteria 
(Lee 2008 ). At the time of the interim futility analys is, the PPoS will be calculated. PPoS is 
the probability of achieving “success” should the cohort be continued to the maximum 
sample size of 60 in the target population (1 to 3 prior lines of therapy, including 
bevacizumab treatment) given the data observed at interim, and the cohort is considered “success” if the posterior probability that the ORR exceeds the response rate of current 
standard of care (i.e., 12% as reference in Section 3.2) is greater than 70%.
Both the confirmed and unconfirmed CR or PR observed at interim will be counted as a 
response for the calculation of PPoS. It is appropriate to include the unconfirmed response 
for the purpose of interim analysis because based on the estimates from GEN701 trial, about 
60% of the responders will respond at their first post-baseline scan and approximately 75% of the confirmed/unconfirmed responses will eventually be confirmed. Table 9 summarizes 
the PPoS based on the number of responses observed among the first 20 patients. Details of the calculation of PPoS are shown in Appendix I .

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 77 of 108If the PPoS is <10% (i.e., 1 or fewer responses  among the first 20 patients), the interim data 
indicates that it is unlikely the ORR will be better than the response rate of current standard 
of care at the end of the cohort and the cohort could be stopped early due to insufficient 
activity. On the other hand, if the PPoS is >70%, the interim data suggests that if the same trend continues, there is a high proba bility to conclude a “success” at the end of the cohort. 
The PFS, OS, and DOR will also be evaluated at the time of the interim futility analysisusing Kaplan-Meier methodology. Based on the activity and safety data, together with the PPoS, the cohort may continue or be stopped early by the sponsor. A cohort or Part may also be discontinued at any point at the discretion of the sponsor.
The operating characteristics of the design based on 500,000 simulation runs are summarized 
inTable 10. If the true ORR is less than 5%, there is reasonable chance to reach the futility 
criterion at interim. On the other hand, if the true ORR is 20% or higher, the probability to 
stop for futility is low (<12%).

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 98 of 108APPENDIX G: RECIST CRITERIA SUMMARY (VERSION 1.1)
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
Term Definition
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate a
n
absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression. 
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.
Measurable lesion Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT slice thickness no greater than 5 m
m).
From RECIST Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009 )
A response (CR or PR) will be considered confirmed if the following disease assessment 
(at least 4 weeks after the initial response) still shows response (CR or PR). In cases where
the initial response is followed by SD, it will be considered as confirmed if the SD is later followed by PR or CR. For example, if a patient had PR in week 6, SD in Week 12, and PR in Week 18, this PR will be considered as confirmed.

Tisotumab vedotin Seattle Genetics, Inc. - Confidential Page 100 of 108APPENDIX I: CALCULATION OF PREDICTIVE PROBABILITY OF SUCCESS
1. Let Nmaxbe the maximum sample size of a cohort, and nbe the number of patients treated 
and evaluated for the response status by the time of interim analysis
2. Assume the prior distribution of the response rate pfollows a beta distribution
p~ beta( a0,b0)
Note: A weakly informative prior with a0 = 0.12 and b0 = 0.88 is chosen for this study to 
reflect the prior belief of 12% ORR with tiso tumab vedotin, and let the data speak for itself 
so that inferences are not overly affected by information external to the observed data.
3. Let Xbe the number of responders in the first npatients, and X follows a binomial 
distribution
X ~ binomial(n, p)
The likelihood function for the observed data xisL(p | X = x )px(1-p)n-x
4. With the Bayes theorem, the posterior distribution of the response rate given X = x
follows a beta distribution
p | x ~ beta(a 0+ x, b 0+ n - x)
5. Let Ybe the number of responders in the potential mfuture patients, where 
m= (Nmax–n), thus Yfollows a beta-binomial distribution
Y ~ beta-binomial (m, a0 + x, b0 + n - x)
Given Y = i , the posterior distribution of pfollows beta( a0+ x + i, b 0+ N max–x–i)
6. Let Bi= Pr( p > p 0| x, Y = i ), where Bimeasures the probability that the response rate p
exceeds p0(the response rate of current stand of care), given xresponders in the first n
patients and iresponders in the mfuture patients
7. Compare Bito a threshold value θT. If Bi> θT, then the cohort is considered “success” at 
the end of the cohort given the interim data and the potential outcome of Y = i .
Note: A more relaxed threshold value, θT= 70%, is chosen for this study given the 
exploratory nature of study.
PPoS =P r ( Y=i | x) • I(Pr(P > p 0| x, Y = i) >θT)} = Pr( Y=i|x) • I(B i> θT)}

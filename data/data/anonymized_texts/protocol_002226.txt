Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 6 of 31 1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Psychological concerns are among the most commonly reported unmet needs among post-treatment 
cancer survivors.1 Up to 54% of post -treatment cancer survivors report clinically significant distress,2,3 
which is associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including mortality.4,5 Hispanic cancer survivors 
have a disproportionately higher risk of experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms relative to non-
Hispanic whites,6-11 even up to  5 years after diagnosis.9 Further, Hispanic cancer survivors are less 
likely to receive psychosocial services than non -Hispanic whites.12 Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) 
has a large evidence base demonstrating its efficacy in reducing distress , 13 anxiety , 14,15 and 
depressive symptoms14-21 among Hispanics.  
 The pilot work extends our current work by increasing our ability to serve a broader group of cancer 
survivors (including those who speak Spanish), addressing a disparity in supportive care services 
available to Hispanic cancer survivors. The work in this pilot grant targets the needs of Hispanic cancer survivors in our catchment area and broadens our ability to provide psychosocial care to Hispanic 
cancer survivors (regardless of language) by obtaining critical survivor and provider feedback to 
culturally adapt an existing evidence- based intervention.  
2.0 Objectives  
 
Building on this study team’s current NCI -funded study of a telephone -based intervention targeting 
English -speaking rural cancer survivors (5R21CA198237, MPIs Danhauer/Brenes), this study proposes 
to culturally and linguistically adapt a telephone- based cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention 
designed to reduce anxiety and depressive symptoms for use with Hispanic cancer survivors (Spanish- 
or English -speaking). Twelve  participants will be recruited to participate in the tailored CBT intervention. 
They will provide content/process feedback on the intervention and undergo assessment of relevant 
future outcomes (to be used as pilot data). Participants with either moderate or severe distress (an xiety 
and/or depressive symptoms) will complete the telephone- based intervention that will consist of a CBT 
workbook with accompanying psychotherapy by a bilingual mental health provider . Each participant will 
choose whether (s)he prefers to complete the intervention in Spanish or English (at least half of the participants will complete the study in Spanish).  
2.1 Primary Objective s 
 
2.1.1  To assess the feasibility  (participation, accrual, retention, adherence) of administering 
the intervention in Hispanic cancer survivors.  
 
2.1.2  To culturally adapt an existing behavioral intervention for cancer survivors based on 
stakeholder feedback.  
 
2.2 Exploratory Objectives 
 2.2.1 To summarize emotional distress (anxiety , depressive symptoms)  and fear of recurrence 
in these post -treatment Hispanic cancer survivors.  
 
2.2.2 To describe the therapy process in terms of satisfaction with treatment and the therapist -
participant relationship.

more than a year; (4) chronic myelogenous leukemia with stable disease (chronic phase 
disease); or (5) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) not requiring treatment or a change in 
treatment for more than 6 m onths.  
• 6 ‐60 months post ‐treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy) for cancer (If 
only received active surveillance for prostate cancer or lymphoma with no other cancer treatment, participant is ineligible.)  The timeframe applies to the most recent completion of 
treatment if a participant had a cancer recurrence. It is acceptable to be on hormonal/maintenance  therapies.  
• Must be able to spea k, read,  and understand Spanish or English  
• Resides in North Carolina  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• Current psychotherapy [regular appointment(s) with a mental health provider  within the last 
30 days]  
• Self-reported active alcohol or substance abuse within the last 30 days  
• Past history of prostate cancer or non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma with only active surveillance 
(i.e., no surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy)  
• Progressive cancer  
• Global cognitive impairment based on self-reported diagnosis of dementia.  
• Self-reported psychotic symptoms in the last 30 days ( Item in  Screening Form : “Have you 
seen things that aren’t really there or have you heard voices when no one else was around 
within the last 30 days?”)  
• Active suicidal ideation with plan and intent 
• Any change in psychotropic medications within the last 30 days  
• Hearing loss that would preclude participating in telephone sessions ( determined by brief 
hearing assessment administered by research staff).  Individuals who can compensate for 
hearing loss through the use of a hearing device or TDD phone, and through the use of such devices are able to communicate with the study therapist by telephone, will be included. If 
the therapist cannot communicate with the participant by telephone, the participant will be 
excluded.

Both men and women are eligible for this open pilot trial. The entire  sample  (N=12) will be 
Hispanic because this is our target population.  Children will not be included because t he 
research topic is not relevant to children. While children may experience depression and/or 
anxiety, the treatment approach would be different from the approach used in this study that has 
been developed for use with adults.

5.0  Study Outcomes and Study Measures  
 Participants will have the choice to complete all study measures in either English or Spanish.  
 
Data Collection -- Self-Report (Qualitative) Measures . The research staff  will obtain weekly feedback on the 
process and content of the intervention in brief (~5 minute) phone calls following the weekly telephone 
sessions . Study staff will also complete t elephone assessments at baseline (Week 0), halfway through the 
intervention (Week 7), and upon completion of the intervention (Week 13). Additionally , upon completion of 
the intervention, a Q-PRO staff person will conduct a semi -structured in- depth interview  designed to identify 
any issues (logistical, intervention feedback, feedback on how the process/content could work better for 
Hispanic cancer survivors) and maximize usability of the CBT workbook. These interviews will last  up to 60 
minutes  and be conducted over the phone. Interviews will be recorded with participants ’ permission and then

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 9 of 31 summarized. After the first 4 participants  complete the intervention and in- depth interview , Q-PRO  and the 
MPIs will review the data. Suggested changes will be made to the intervention and tested in the next 4 
participants . Remuneration for time will be provided.  
 
 
5.1 Primary Outcomes  
5.1.1  Feasibility  (participation, accrual, retention, adherence rates )  
To determine study feasibility, recruitment, accrual, retention, and adherence rates , 
which  will be calculated as follows:  
Participation. To  determine participation rate, we will track the total number of 
individuals approached, the number of individuals who met all eligibility criteria, and 
percent who agree to participate.  
Accrual . Accrual rates will be calculated by calculating the mean number of participants 
recruited per month.  
Retention . Study retention will be estimated by the proportion of participants who 
complete the Week 13 visit. Drop- out is defined as 100% minus the dropout %.  
Adherence. Intervention adherence will be estimated as the mean percentage of 
therapy or check -in sessions each participant completes. Participants must complete at 
least 9 of the 12 sessions (75%) to be considered adherent.  
5.2 Secondary Outcomes 
5.2.1  Anxiety – GAD-7 
The GAD -753 is a self -report measure of DSM -IV symptoms of GAD. Participants rate 7 
questions on  a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day); one additional question 
assesses the interference of these symptoms with functioning. The first 7 questions are 
summed to create a total score. It has been validated for use in the general population 70 
and in primary care.53 The GAD -7 has demonstrated good sensitivity (89%) and 
specificity (82%) in identifying GAD diagnoses when using a cut point of 10.53 It also has 
good internal consistency (alphas = 0.89 -0.92) and test -retest reliability (intraclass 
correlation = .83).53,70 
5.2.2  Depressive Symptoms – PHQ-9 
The PHQ -9 is a self -report measure of DSM -IV symptoms of Major Depressive 
Disorder. Participants rate how often they have experienced nine symptoms over the past 2 weeks on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Responses are summed, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptomatology. It has 
demonstrated good reliability and validity. The traditional cutoff for the PHQ -9 is a score 
≥10. However, ASCO guidelines recommend using a score ≥8, based on a study of cancer outpatients
76 and a meta- analysis of use of the PHQ-9 for identifying depression 
in cancer patients.77 
5.2.3  Fear of Recurrence – Fear of Recurrence Inventory Severity Subscale  
The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory55 (FCRI; severity subscale) will be used to 
measure self -reported fear of recurrence. This 9 -item subscale measures the presence 
and severity of the intrusive thoughts or images associated with the fear of recurrence, and it can be used separately as a short form of the 42- item FCRI for the brief 
screening of fear of cancer recurrence. The measure is widely used and has strong 
reliability and validity (Cronbach’s α=0.75).

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 10 of 31 6.0 Intervention Plan  
 
Participants will have the choice to complete the intervention in either English or Spanish.  
 
Intervention Adaptation . Building on the feedback received from Aim 1  from key clinical, bilingual 
psychotherapist, and patient stakeholders  (IRB00063774), w e will iteratively refine the CBT workbook 
based on feedback from  12 cancer survivors receiving the intervention and completing relevant 
outcome and feasibility measures .   
 
Intervention. Participants with moderate or severe anxiety and/or depressive symptoms will participate in the 
telephone- based intervention that consists of the CBT workbook (15 minutes daily to complete exercises), 
plus psychotherapy delivered by telephone with a licensed bilingual mental health provider  (45-50 minute 
sessions weekly). Two therapist s who meet the following requirements have been hired to conduct the 
intervention. They meet the following qualifications: Master’s or doctoral degree in counseling, marriage and 
family therapy, psychology, or social work; licensed as an independent mental health provider in North 
Carolina; and experience with CBT. The therapists will complete study -specific training with Dr. Brenes that 
will cover study design, anxiety/depression in cancer survivors, principles of CBT, intervention delivery, and use of the workbook. The professionally -prepared CBT workbook focuses on cognitive- behavioral techniques 
for managing anxiety, depression, and distress. Chapters focus on the cognitive- behavioral model of 
depression and anxiety, relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, worry control, exposure, behavioral activation, and relapse prevention.  Workbook chapters target issues specific to cancer 
survivors, such as (a) fear of recurrence;
2,3,29- 41  (b) lasting effects of treatment on health, ongoing symptoms 
of fatigue and physiologic effects of cancer treatment;2,3,29,32,37,41,42  (c) late effects of cancer treatment (the 
possibility of developing other diseases);29,38,43  (d) concerns about reproductive ability42,44  and (e) distress 
related to changes in body image and sexuality.31,38,43 The sessions will supplement the participant's 
understanding of distress management techniques and include a review of the daily workbook exercises to 
assure understanding and maximize application in daily life.

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 11 of 31 6.1 Study-Related Flow Activities  
Screening and Consent Procedures  
Patients will be referred from oncology providers and the Hispanic patient navigator  or from the community . 
 
       Pre-Visit  
We will obtain a limited HIPAA waiver to assess the potential participant’s name, contact information, and 
demographics . This information will be collected on a Pre -Visit Form that will be reviewed with potential 
participants during the screening phone contact  to assess for eligibility.  
 
Informed Consent  
After making sure the patient clearly understands the study procedures and agrees to follow them, the 
patient will be asked to sign the informed consent form electronically  (e.g., REDCap) or in person. If 
signed electronically , REDCap will allow the study team to access signed electronic consent forms 
immediately after signature. Patients will have the option to download a copy of the signed informed consent from REDCap, or a hard copy will be provided to the patient  if needed.  
 
Screening  
The screening process will occur by telephone. Once a participant has signed the informed  consent , 
emergency contact information will be collected and the participant will be screened for adequate hearing ability and additional screening criteria. T he PHQ -9 and GAD -7 will be administered. If the participant is 
eligible based on the scoring of the PHQ- 9 and GAD -7, then additional screening questions will be 
administered.    
 
The Screening  Form will be reviewed with participants to confirm contact information,  demographics , and 
chart information (eligibility criteria – type of cancer, month/year of diagnosis, cancer stage at time of 
diagnosis, time of last treatment, date of birth).  Additional questions will also be administered to assess  
additional eligibilit y criteria including an item to determine adequate hearing ability (please refer to the next 
paragraph for additional hearing ability information), telephone access , and language preference.    
 
To determine adequate hearing ability, the participant is asked to repeat the phrase, “I have a cat so all I 
need is a dog.”  If the participant is able to repeat  this phrase correctly, staff will continue with screening.  
If the participant is unable to repeat the phrase correctly after a second attempt or if staff thinks hearing is a problem, the participant will be considered ineligible and will not be screened further.  Participants with a 
circumstance that could affect the ability to hear at the time of the call (illness, hearing aid problem, in process of obtaining hearing aid, etc.) can reschedule.    We will also collect information from the participant’s medical chart, including type of cancer, month/year 
of diagnosis, cancer stage at time of diagnosis, time of last treatment . 
 If a participant is not eligible or declines study participation at screening, screening informa tion will be 
entered  into RedCap up to the point the participant was no longer eligible or declined, and no further  
information will be collected.  
 
Baseline Testing
 
If informed consent was administered by electronically/by phone, the site must receive the signed full 
informed consent prior to initiating baseline study activities. Baseline interviewer -administered measures 
and chart review must be administered and completed by study  staff. Baseline measures may be 
completed over the phone with study staff or through REDCap . The baseline measure responses must be 
received within 30 days after screening with PHQ -9 and GAD -7. Replacement packets can be emailed at

participant prior to enrolling the participant.  
 
Baseline Measures:  
• Demographics  
• Fear of Recurrence Inventory --Severity Subscale 
 Interviewer Administered Measures and Chart Review:  
 
Research staff will administer the following forms (see Appendices) by telephone (or in person if participant is in clinic) and enter the data in REDCap  within 48 hours.   These forms are to be 
interviewer -administered whether the contact is by telephone or  in person.  The PHQ -9 and GAD -7 
should have no missing data.    
• PHQ -9 (administer only if it has been >30 days since screening to reassess eligibility)  
• GAD -7 (administer only if it has been >30 days since screening to reassess eligibility)  
• Current Medication Use 
 
Chart Review:  
• Initial Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Form  
• Additional Malignancy Diagnosis and Treatment Form 
• Cancer Relapse/Recurrence Form  
 
      Weekly  
 The study staff will obtain weekly feedback on the process and content of the intervention and 
completion of the study measures in brief (5- 10 minutes ) phone calls following the intervention 
sessions. The Project Manager will work to coordinate calls shortly after the end of weekly therapy 
sessions  and enter responses into REDCap.  
 
Weeks 7 and 13:  
The participant will complete questionnaires and telephone interviews during week 7 and week 13 of 
the study. During week 7, the participant will complete the PHQ -9 and GAD -7. Study staff will obtain 
information about current medication use and adverse events. At week 13, patients will again 
complete the P HQ-9, GAD -7, Fear of Recurrence Inventory --Severity Subscale, client satisfaction 
item. Study staff will obtain information about cancer diagnosis and treatment information, current medication use, and adverse events.  
 After completing the intervention, a Q- PRO staff person will conduct a semi -structured in- depth 
interview designed to identify any issues (logistical, intervention feedback, feedback on how the 
process/content could work better for Hispanic cancer survivors) and maximize usability of the CBT 
workbook. Interviews will last up to 60 minutes and be conducted via telephone.  Interviews will be 
recorded and summarized. After the first 4 participants, Q -PRO and the MPIs will review the data. 
Changes will be made and tested in the next 4 participants . Remuneration for time and transportation 
will be provided.   Individuals who are unable to afford a telephone may be provided with assistance to 
cover this expense. This will be determined on a case- by-case basis.  
Participant Enrollment  
The participant  should not be enroll ed until the participant  is ready to start the intervention.  Once 
the participant  is enrolled, the study timeline begins .

by the PHQ -9 at baseline and at weeks 7 and 13. When the data from either of these two forms 
are filled out, the study staff will document the scores to ensure participants have not indicated 
a significant worsening in anxiety or depression scores (1 standard deviation increase  [rounded 
to the nearest integer) on the GAD -7 (Change≥4)75 or PHQ -9 (Change≥6)73 from baseline] . If 
there has been a significant change, the Project Manager will initiate the Crisis Protocol and 
complete a Crisis Protocol Event Form. During the course of a regularly scheduled participant contact, it may become evident that there is a need for immediate evaluation (e.g., active 
suicidal ideation, active psychotic symptoms, disorientation) . Staff will be instructed to follow 
the Crisis Protocol and complete the Crisis Protocol Event Form.  In both cases, the participant 
may be referred for mental health care by their primary care physician or by an emergency 
department physi cian.  
 
Study  staff will follow the steps outlined in the Crisis Protocol and participants will receive 
information about safety precautions and procedures to follow in the event of a crisis (i.e., the participant becomes imminently suicidal). Because active suicidal ideation is an exclusion 
criterion for the study, we anticipate that the risk of participants becoming suicidal during the study will be minimal. Further, in our prior studies, no participants randomized into the study 
became imminently suicidal. All study staff (therapists, research staff) will receive training on 
the Crisis P rotocol and coping with participant distress  that may be experienced during the 
consent, assessment and treatment procedures. In addition, there will be regular study team  
meetings to discuss clinical issues. Dr. Brenes will review the status and progress of participants with the study therapists on a regular (at least monthly) basis . All participants will 
be contacted at Week 7 and Week 13 to assess the primary outcomes and depressive

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 14 of 31 symptoms.  Additionally, study therapist s will attempt to reach participants who miss a  session 
by calling the participant twice in a one- week period. If the therapist is unable to contact the 
participant by phone, the therapist will send the participant a letter with a request that the 
participant contact the therapist regarding interest in continuing the study sessions.  
6.3 Duration of the Intervention  
CBT Intervention. CBT will consist of 1 2 individual weekly psychotherapy sessions with a 
study therapist by telephone and an accompanying workbook.  We have used this treatment 
in 4 previous RCTs.  The 12- chapter workbook focuses on techniques that have 
demonstrated efficacy in treating adults w ith an anxiety disorder  and is currently being used 
in an ongoing for rural post -treatment cancer survivors .45,4647 -51  
 All participants receive 12 identical chapters  according to their language preference . To tailor the 
intervention to anxiety and depressive symptoms, participants are instructed to choose 2 chapters 
from a menu of 5 chapters  (e.g. pain, more focused information on changing behavior related to 
anxiety or depression, etc.).   Workbook chapters target issues specific to cancer survivors, such as 
(a) fear of recurrence (most commonly reported source of distress in survivors across different 
types of cancer);
8,9,13,24,38 –48 (b) lasting effects of treatment on health, ongoing symptoms of fatigue 
and physiologic effects of cancer treatment;38,39,42,44,48– 50 (c) late effects of cancer treatment (the 
possibility of developing other diseases);14,38,45 (d) concerns about reproductive ability and higher 
risk of cancer for their children;50,51 and (e) distress related to changes in body image and 
sexuality.14,41,45  
 
There will be weekly telephone sessions with the study therapist that will last 45 to 50 
minutes. The participant and therapist  will review the assigned chapter and assignments 
during weekly telephone sessions.  In order to ensure privacy, every participant will be asked 
if he/she needs to reschedule the appointment due to a lack of privacy .  
 
Coach training and supervision. Study coaches will be bilingual licensed mental health 
providers who have the ability to conduct therapy in both English and Spanish.  Training will include use of the treatment manual, didactic presentations, readings, and role plays.  The 
competency o f coaches in delivering CBT- T will be evaluated with a measure developed 
and used by Dr. Melinda Stanley.
47,48  Coaches  who fail to demonstrate competency (mean 
competency score < 6 on a scale of 1 to 8) will receive additional training and exposure to 
role play exercises until competency is demonstrated.  Also, coaches must achieve ≥80% 
adherence across the sessions before contacting any potential participants.  If any coach 
fails to achieve this level, the PI will determine if there are specific components across sessions that are routinely omitted or implemented incorrectly and will retrain the coach in 
the identified treatment components.   The PI will meet with the coaches  weekly to discuss 
cases, review adherence and competence ratings , and answer any questions regarding the 
administration of the protocol.  Any areas of non -adherence will be reviewed with the 
coaches .

Participants will be involved in a 12 -week intervention and will complete the follow -up assessm ent 
immediately upon completion of the intervention.   
6.5 Criteria for Removal from Study 
Participants will be removed from study for the following reasons:  the protocol intervention and any 
protocol -required follow -up period is completed, serious adverse event, lost to follow -up, withdraw 
consent, PI removes from study, or death. Participants also have the option to discontinue the 
intervention but continue in the study for follow -up purposes. For subjects who are enrolled, site 
staff must contact the subject at the next study visit with at least 5 attempts.  After 5 documented 
contact attempts the subject will be considered lost to follow -up.  Site staff must complete a 
Participant Status Change Form in RedCap . 
7.0 Adverse Events List and Reporting Requirements  
REPORTING ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Reportable Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human 
subject, including any clinically significant abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the 
research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research. The burden of collecting and reporting data on every possible AE is excessive and therefore, study staff will report all 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and selected described below .  
 
SAEs and AEs will be ascertained by study  staff for all participants at Weeks 7 and 13. Study  staff will 
administer the Adverse Event Ascertainment Form to specifically query participants about safety events 
at weeks 7 and 13. In addition, adverse events may also be reported to study staff spontaneously 
through telephone calls, emails or other correspondence. In addition to local reporting requirements, all 
SAEs and selected AEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event Form by clinic staff.  
 
AEs will be assessed according to the grade associated with the CTCAE term. AEs that do not have a 
corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in 
the CTCAE v5.0.. A copy of the CTCAE can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
 
Definition: Regulations at 21 CFR §312.32 (revised April 1, 2014) define an SAE as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose or intervention level has one or more of the following outcomes:  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) is defined if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of ex isting hospitalization for ≥ 24hours  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect

Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC # 01220  
 
Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 16 of 31 • Important Medical Event (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 Reporting Requirements for above Study Descriptions:  
• All unexpected hospitalizations regardless of grade  
• All Grade 5 toxicities (deaths -expected and unexpected)  
• All unexpected Grade 4 toxicities  
• All additional reporting requirements as outlined in the protocol  
  
Selected Adverse Events  
A select list of adverse events include suicide attempts, psychosis, worsening anxiety, worsening depression, and suicidal ideation, should be reported as an adverse event, regardless of whether they 
resulted in an ER visit or hospitalization.  
 
Definition of Worsening Anxiety or Depression  
An adverse event form should be completed for any participant who indicates a significant worsening in 
anxiety or depression scores (1 standard deviation increase (rounded to the nearest integer) on the 
GAD -7 (Change≥4)  
75 or PHQ -9 (Change≥6)73,74,51 from baseline). If there is a need for immediate 
treatment (e.g., active suicidal ideation, active psychotic symptoms, disorientation, and active 
substance abuse) at any point in time, staff persons will notify the co- PIs. In both cases, the participant 
may be referred for psychiatric care.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring:   As adverse event reports are collected, all adverse events will be 
identified and reported to the co- principal investigators. The co- principal investigators are responsible 
for the review of all adverse event reports and determining whether any changes in the study protocol or informed consent are required to insure subject safety and welfare.  
 
Clinical Monitoring: The co -PIs will meet with the study staff weekly to provide supervision and review 
the clinical status of all participants. Study staff will also notify at least one supervisor immediately if a patient shows the need for urgent treatment (e.g., suicidal intent, active psychosis). This type of information will be communicated immediately, with consultation about an appropriate course of action.  
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for reviewing SAEs for WFBCCC Institutional 
studies as outlined in Appendix D. All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention and are coded as 
either 1) unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospitalization ≥ 24 hours (regardless of grade), or grade 5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC using the using the SAE console in WISER.  
 All WFBCCC Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) staff members assisting a Principal Investigator 
in investigating, documenting and reporting an SAE qualifying for DSMC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the DSMC as well as the entire committee via the email notification procedure of the occurrence of an SAE.

Protocol version date 3/15/21       Page 18 of 31 9.0 Statistical Considerations  
9.1 Analysis of Primary Objective 
Objective 2. 1.1will provide data on feasibility, including participation, accrual, adherence, 
and retention rates. We will calculate  95% confidence intervals for each feasibility measure 
to determine the range of estimates consistent with our data. We will track the number 
approached for screening, number screened, number eligible, and the percent who agree to 
participate. For those not meeting eligibility criteria, reasons will be summarized. The 
proportion of participants and corresponding 95% CI for participants who participated in the 
intervention sessions and those who completed all assessments will be computed; we will 
also calculate the percent who complete the Week 13 visit to assess retention. We will use one-sample tests of binomial proportions to compare participation, adherence, and retention 
rates to th e hypothesized values of 50%, 75%, and 75 %, respectively.  
 
Qualitative Analyses . Interview transcripts  and field notes will be reviewed independently by 
two staff members of the Q -PRO Shared Resource who will provide an integrative 
summary/synthesis of th e interviews (identification of key points, potential themes, areas 
needing further exploration). The qualitative and quantitative analyses will be evaluated in a 
mixed -methods framework for consistency and discrepancies to refine the intervention for 
future studies.  
 
9.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
8.2.1 Analysis of Exploratory Objectives 
 
In exploratory analyses, we will summarize the variables of interest  (anxiety , depressive 
symptoms) fear of recurrence, satisfaction, and the therapist -participant relationship)  by visit  
using descriptive statistics.  Because this is a small pilot study, this information will be used to 
estimate variability for future study planning purposes, but not to estimate effect size or to test hypotheses , and the analyses will be considered exploratory . 
 
9.3 Sample Size Justification 
An N=12 sample size is quite standard for qualitative analyses to achieve thematic saturation.   
With 12 people, we will be able to calculate two- sided 95% confidence intervals around 
proportions of interest within 28%.  Power is not applicable for this study in the absence of 
hypothesis testing.  
 
9.4 Estimated Accrual Rate  
We will enroll 12 participants over six months at a rate of 2 participants per month.  
9.5 Estimated Study Length 
The study will span one year in duration.   
9.6 Interim Analysis Plan 
None planned.

Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC ) Serious Adverse 
Event  (SAE)  Notification  SOP Date:  02/11/2021  
 
Mandatory DSMC  SAE Reporting Requirements in WISER  
This document describes reporting requirements of adverse events from WFBCCC Investigator 
Initiated interventional trials to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ). A trial is 
considered a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trial if the following criteria  are met: 
 
1) The Principal Investigator (PI) of the trial is a member of a department at the  Wake  Forest 
University Baptist Medical Center.  
2) WFBCCC is considered as the primary contributor to the design, implementation  and/or  
monitoring of the  trial.  
3) The trial is designated as “Interventional” using the Clinical Research  Categories 
definitions provided by the NCI in the Data Table 4  documentation.  
(https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/DataGuide#dt4 ) 
 
There are two distinct types of WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials based  on where 
patient enrollment occurs.  These  include:  
 
1) Local WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials where  all patients are 
enrolled from one of the WFBCCC sites. These include the main outpatient  Cancer Center 
clinics (located in Winston -Salem) as well as WFBCCC affiliate  sites located in Bermuda Run 
(Davie Medical Center), Clemmons, Lexington, High Point,  or Wilk esboro.  
2) Multi -Center WFBCCC Investigator Initiated interventional trials defined as trials  where  
patients are enrolled from other sites in addition to WFBCCC sites.   
There are  three  types of trials that are included in this  category:  
a. Trials sponsored by the NCI Community Oncology Research Program  (NCORP) that are 
conducted at multiple sites where the PI is a member of a department at the Wake 
Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
b. Trials sponsored by Industry that are conducted at multiple sites and the PI is  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
c. Trials sponsored by WFBCCC that are conducted at multiple sites and the PI is  a 
member of a department at the Wake Forest University Baptist Medical  Center.  
 
All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur on any patients  enrolled on WFBCCC 
Investigator Initiated Interventional trials must be entered into the WISER  system. The only exception to 
this requirement is for patients enrolled on NCORP trials at  non- WFBCCC sites. AEs and SAEs for NCORP 
patients enrolled at WFBCCC sites must be entered into the WISER system. Once these AEs and SAEs are 
entered in WISER, certain actions must  be taken regarding the reporting of specific Adverse Events to the  
DSMC . 
Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation of a Telephone -Based Intervention to Treat Depression and 
Anxiety in Hispanic Cancer Survivors 
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC # 01220  
 
 All Adverse Events that occur during protocol intervention (defined below) and are coded as either 1) 
unexpected grade 4, 2) unplanned inpatient hospitalization > 24 hours (regardless of grade) , or grade 
5 (death) must be reported to the DSMC  using the using the SAE console in WISER.  
 
A research nurse or clinical research coordinator when made aware that an adverse  event  meets one 
of the above criteria has occurred on a WFBCCC Investigator Initiated  interventional trial, is responsible 
for informing a clinical member of the DSMC  by phone (or in- person)  about  the adverse event. The 
nurse/coordinator should contact the treating physician prior to calling the DSMC clinical member to 
obtain all details of  the SAE, as well as all associated toxicities to be recorded along with the SAE. In 
addition, this nurse or coordinator is responsible for entering the  adverse  event information into the 
SAE console in WISER.  Once the adverse event has been  entered into the SAE console an email 
informing the entire DSMC  will be  generated.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any staff member on the study team for  a WFBCCC Institutional 
Interventional trial. Ultimately, the protocol PI has the  primary  responsibility  for AE identification,  
documentation,  grading  and assignment  of attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. However, 
when an AE event as described above  is observed, it is the responsibility of the person who observed the event 
to be sure that it  is reported to the  DSMC . 
 
What is considered during protocol  intervention ? 
During protocol intervention is considered to be the time period while a patient is on  study  treatment or 
during the time period within 30 days of last study treatment (even if patient  begins a new (non- study) 
treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be  the standard window to be used in all 
protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented  to suggest that a shorter window can be used 
to identify  events.  If it is a trial sponsored by Industry and the sponsor requires a longer window for 
monitoring of SAEs, then the longer window of time specified by the sponsor should be followed.  
 
What is considered as an Unexpected Grade 4  event?  
Any grade 4 even t that was not specifically listed as an expected adverse event in the  protocol should be 
considered as unexpected. A grade 4 adverse event can be considered to  be unexpected if it is an event 
that would not be expected based on the treatment being  received  or if it is unexpected based on the 
health of the patient. In either case, if there is  any uncertainty about whether a grade 4 adverse event is 
expected or unexpected it should be reported to  DSMC . 
 
DSMC  notification responsibilities of the person (e.g., nurse) handling  the reporting/documenting of the SAE in 
WISER:  
1. Make a phone call (or speak in person) to the appropriate clinical member of the  DSMC  
according to the schedule as listed below (page if  nece ssary) . 
2. Enter  a new SAE  into the SAE  module that is located  in the Subject>> CRA  Console  in WISER 
WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. Information can be  entered and  saved, but 
the DSMC  members will not be notified  until a  date  is entered  into the   DSMC  Notification Date 
Field. This will ensure that all persons that need to be made  aware  of the event (i.e., PI, study 
team members and  DSMC  members) will be  notified; remember to file a copy of the  
confirmation.  
3. Document that the appropriate person(s) on the DSMC  has been contacted. Indicate  the name of 
Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation of a Telephone -Based Intervention to Treat Depression and 
Anxiety in Hispanic Cancer Survivors 
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC # 01220  
 
 the DSMC clinician that was contacted  and the date and time contacted in the Event Narrative 
field in the SAE  console  of the particular  subject.  
4. Document whether or not the protocol should be suspended based on the  discussion  with the 
DSMC  clinician. This is the major function of the email notification. Enter  whether the protocol 
should be suspended in the Event Narrative  Field.  
5. Follow up/update the clinical member(s) of DSMC  regarding any new developments or 
information  obtained during the course of the SAE investigation and reporting  process.

Definition of  Unavailable: 
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not respond to the phone  call or page 
within 30 minutes, then initiate contact with the next  DSMC  clinician  listed in the table above on the 
particular day the SAE is being reported . Allow up to  30 minutes for the new DSMC  clinician to respond to 
a phone call or page before  contac ting the next  member  in the table . These times (30 minutes) are a 
general guideline. Best judgment as a clinical research professional should be used giving considerations 
of the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is appropriate to contact 
backup clinicians. If  the event occurs near the end of day, then leave messages (voice or email) as 
appropriate  and proceed with submitting the DSMC  notification form. It is important to take reasonable  
steps and to document that some type of contact has been initiated to one or more of the  clinical 
members of  DSMC . 
 
DSMC  CLINICAN  RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the  DSMC  clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events  as they are 
reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and  the members of DSMC . 
The review will include but not be limited to the information reported;  there  may be times when 
additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be  made  and further communi cation 
directly with the investigator may be warranted. DSMC  reserves  the right to disagree with the 
Investigator's assessment. If DSMC  does not agree with the Investigator,  DSMC reserves  the right  to 
suspend  the trial pending  further  investigation.  If there  is any immediate danger or harm that could be 
present for a future patient based on the  information  provided  in the DSMC  report  then an immediate  
Cultural and Linguistic Adaptation of a Telephone -Based Intervention to Treat Depression and 
Anxiety in Hispanic Cancer Survivors 
Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center  
WFBCCC # 01220  
 
 suspension  of enrollment should  be considered.  
 
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS  REPORTS  
If all pertinent information is unavailable with the initial submission, once the additional  information is 
available do not submit a new report. Rather, go to the original email that  was sent to the DSMC  and 
using that email “reply to all”. Entitle this new email “ Amendment for (list date of event and patient ID)” 
this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the  additional information being reported. This 
information needs to be entered into WISER as  well. To do this, go to the Subject console and click SAEs 
on the  left column. Click on  the appropriate  SAE number  that needs  updating.  Then  click  Update.  This 
will allow  additional     information to be  added.

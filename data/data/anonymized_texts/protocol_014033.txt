 1 BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Introduction 
 
This is a prospective, randomized, double- blind,  study of H01 of 24 weeks  in adults with pulmonary 
hypertension (PH)  with an optional open- label extension  (extension to 48 weeks) . The primary objective 
of this double-blinded study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of H01 over 24 weeks. Secondary objectives 
are to investigate the safety  and tolerability  of H01 and pharmacokinetic (PK)  and pharmacodynamic (PD)  
markers  in this population. Following IRB approval and written  informed  consent, a total of 16 participants 
will be enrolled, randomized approximately 2:1 (H01 1600 mg/day : placebo), stratified  by PH type, and 
treated for 24 weeks. Data  from  this study will inform future larger studies.  Participants will have the 
opportunity to extend their participation an additional 24 weeks by consenting to an open- label  extension 
. 
 
PH is characterized by remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in narrowing and eventual  
obliteration  of the lumen,  leading to increased  mean  pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP)1.While multiple  
therapies  have been  developed to address PH, there  are no disease modifying therapies and morbidity  and 
mortality  remains high.  
 
Recent research has suggested that hyaluronan (HA), a key component of the extracellular matrix, plays  
an important role in the pathology of PH and has potential as a therapeutic target2,3. Hyaluronan is an 
extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan capable of trapping large volumes of water and driving pro- 
inflammatory  pathways and fibrosis4. The role of hyaluronan in pulmonary hypertension, lung 
inflammation, and fibrosis has been validated in multiple animal models2,3,5,6. Further, in these models,  
inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis with H01 led to significant reductions in hyaluronan and had positive  
effects on clinically relevant outcomes  such as Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure (RVSP), the Fulton  
index and arterial oxygenation (Sp02). 
 
Hymecromone (H01) is a known inhibitor of HA that has been  studied in models of respiratory  the context 
of both inflammation  and fibrosis.  The purpose of this clinical  trial is to study the safety  and utility  of H01 
in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with chronic lung disease (selected from Groups 1 and 
3 PH).  
 
We hypothesize that oral H01, at doses of 1600 mg per day, will be a safe and well -tolerated agent in  
adults with pulmonary hypertension over 24 weeks. In addition, this study will investigate the potential  
benefit of oral H01 on clinical measures of PH disease severity including but not limited to: pulmonary vascular  resistance,  mean  pulmonary arterial  pressure,  and the 6 Minute Walk  Distance  Test (6MWDT).

1.3 Scientific  Rationale 
 
1.3.1 Urgent need  for pulmonary hypertension  therapeutics 
 
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined by a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥3 WU associated  
with an increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP >20 mmHg) at rest1. It can lead to right  
ventricle hypertrophy (RVH), right -sided heart failure and eventually death7 010). Idiopathic pulmonary  
fibrosis (IPF) is a form of restrictive interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with extremely poor  
outcomes. IPF is characterized by parenchymal fibrosis that leads to impaired gas exchange8. PH, with a  
prevalence of about 40% in advanced disease9,10, is a common complication in IPF where it is strongly  
associated  with increased  morbidity  and mortality10,11. It is classified  as WHO  Group 3 PH12. 
There  are limited  treatment options  for patients with interstitial lung disease and PH, with lung 
transplantation being the only “curative” option. Despite the many pharmacological agents available to  
treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (classified as Group 1 PH, where no lung parenchymal  
component is observed), these agents have been shown to be either ineffective or detrimental to patients  
with IPF + PH13. Consequently, it is essential  to develop improved medical therapies  for IPF+PH.  
1.3.2 Discussion  on pulmonary hypertension groups 
 
This trial selects patients from Groups 1 and 3 PH based on the hypothesized utility of H01 in PH due to  
lung conditions associated  with inflammation,  vascular  remodeling,  and fibrosis.  Brief discussion of these  
groups provides relevant context for  selected inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
 
PH is broadly classified into 5 groups based on etiology, although there can also be overlap between  groups. 
Group 1 (also referred to as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)) includes patients with PAH  secondary 
to connective tissue diseases,  idiopathic  PAH,  hereditary  PAH,  and PAH secondary  to selected  other 
conditions (e.g. toxins, HIV, etc.). Although the prevalence of PAH is unknown in North America, several  
European registries  have  reported  rates  of 5 to 52 per million14,15. PAH is a proliferative  vasculopathy, 
characterized  by vasoconstriction, cell proliferation,  fibrosis,  and micro -thrombosis. Pathologic findings 
include hyperplasia and hypertrophy of all three  layers of the vascular  wall (intima, media, adventitia) in 
pulmonary arteries <50 microns (i.e., localizes to the small pulmonary muscular  arterioles). In addition, 
fibrosis and in situ thrombi of the small  pulmonary arteries and arterioles  (plexiform lesions) can be 
seen16,17. The pathologic appearance of the small pulmonary arteries and arterioles  is qualitatively  similar 
in all patients with group  1 PAH.  
 
Over a dozen PAH specific therapies are available. They target components of five PAH relevant  
molecular  pathways: voltage gated,  L type calcium  channels,  nitric  oxide cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP), endothelin, and prostacyclin18. However, effective options for patients with  
group 1 PAH  with co-existing lung disease  are limited.  These patients are primarily  treated  with 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
9  
 pulmonary vasodilators but outcomes remain poor. 
 
Group 3 PH is the second most common form of PH and is associated with increased morbidity and  
mortality19. The most common lung diseases resulting in PH are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
(COPD),  interstitial lung disease (ILD) and obstructive sleep  apnea (OSA)  but PH  is also associated  with 
other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and high altitude exposure.  Among the etiologies of group 3 PH, the 
strongest evidence favors hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPVC) with re -modelling of the  
pulmonary vascular bed. Group 3 PH has a very high morbidity and mortality19. PH in the setting of  
fibrotic  lung disease is observed  in up to 80% of patients  with interstitial  lung disease (ILD).  The presence  
of PH is considered the single most significant predictor of mortality in patients with chronic lung  
disease10,11. 
The treatment of Group 3 PH has traditionally been to optimize treatment of the underlying lung disease  
and give long- term oxygen therapy to those who are hypoxic. The efficacy of pulmonary vasodilators in 
this group of patients is unclear. There have been mixed results from meta -analysis assessing the effects  
of vasodilators on exercise tolerance and quality of life20,21. Only  recently  has an acute  vasodilator therapy 
with inhaled treprostinil been evaluated  and approved for Group II PH.22 
In view of the poor prognosis associated  with these conditions, and the lack of available  specific therapy, 
further work is required to develop effective therapy. The only durable therapy for chronic lung diseases, 
such as ILD with PH, is lung transplantation. However, lung transplantation itself is associated with  
inferior outcomes in ILD+PH  than for most other indications23. In addition, despite the many 
pharmacological agents available to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), classified as Group 1  
PH, where no lung parenchymal component is observed, these agents have been shown to be either  
ineffective or detrimental to patients with IPF + PH13. Consequently, it is essential to develop improved 
medical  therapies for  PH in the setting of chronic lung diseases such  as ILD.  
 
1.3.3 Hyaluronan is an important driver of respiratory disease and pulmonary hypertension 
 
Hyaluronan (HA), also known as hyaluronate or hyaluronic acid, is a glycosaminoglycan and a major  
component of the lung ECM24,25. Elevated hyaluronan has been reported in lung diseases including IPF  and 
PAH26–30 and in PH associated  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease31. Furthermore,  
overexpression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2),  an enzyme responsible for the synthesis of hyaluronan, 
has been  implied  in severe fibrosis29. In addition, increased  hyaluronan has also been  reported  in 
autoimmune diseases. For example, in systemic sclerosis (SSc), elevated HA is present in both the skin32 
and associated  with lung injury33,34. Elevated  HA appears to be associated  with progressive SSc affecting  
the lungs where it is associated with fibrosis35 and in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)  
associated ILD36. These are consistent with increased HA observed in patients with Group 1 PH 26. 
Collectively,  these studies point at a pathogenic role of HA in the PH associated  with chronic lung diseases  
and suggest. that therapies targeting  HA may serve as novel disease -modifying  treatments  for PH.  
 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
10  
 The inflammatory  effects  of HA are   dependent on   its   molecular   weight.   High   molecular  weight 
HA (HMW -HA) of 1000 KDa is believed to have protective effects30. However, the breakdown of HA 
into low molecular weight (LMW) HA has been demonstrated to contribute to its pathobiological  effects 
in the lung30. In line with this, increased LMW -HA fragments  have been  detected  in an experimental 
model of PH associated  with lung fibrosis2. 
1.3.4 H01 is a novel approach to addressing pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung 
disease  
 
H01, also known as 4- methylumbelliferone (4MU), is a small molecule inhibitor of HA synthesis. H01  
reduces HA levels primarily  through two identified  mechanisms.  The first mechanism  occurs through the 
extensive glucuronidation of H01 by UDP -glucuronyltransferases (UGTs) resulting in the depletion of  
UDP -glucuronic acid, one of the two substrates required for HA synthesis37,38. The second way that H01  
reduces HA levels is by downregulating HAS mRNA levels39. 4MU has been shown to inhibit HA  
production in  multiple  cell lines  and tissue types40–44. 4MU has  also been  used in multiple  animal models 
of cancer,  fibrosis  and autoimmunity39,45– 51. Several  studies have demonstrated  that inhibition of HA using 
H01 prophylactically and therapeutically attenuated features of experimental PH including vascular  
remodelling and elevated right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP, a surrogate for mPAP in mice). Using  
a mouse model of lung fibrosis and PH studies showed that a 2- week oral treatment with H01 inhibited 
RVSP  and vascular  remodelling2. These results  were  replicated  in a mouse model exhibiting lung fibrosis,  
PH and airspace enlargement,  where  H01 treatment for 4 weeks  was able to attenuate  vascular  remodelling  
and RVSP values3. Interestingly, in these studies, lung fibrosis was also attenuated. In addition to these  
highly- relevant pre- clinical studies in models that recapitulate features of Group 3 PH, H01 has been  
shown to be effective in  models of acute lung injury5,6. 
In addition, H01 has demonstrated anti -fibrotic activity in other settings of inflammation (e.g., liver  
fibrosis). Independent of H01, HA inhibition has also been linked directly with meaningful clinical  
outcomes  such as Forced  Expiratory  Volume (FEV1)  in respiratory  disease52. Taken  together,  these results  
point at elevated HA as a key feature in patients and experimental models of pulmonary hypertension.  
Furthermore,  preclinical  studies  using  H01 both prophylactically  therapeutically  demonstrates a beneficial  
effect of H01 in treating PH associated with lung fibrosis. These results underscore the use of H01 as a  
novel agent to treat  Group 3 PH, where limited treatment  options are available.  
Hymecromone (H01; 4- m ethylumbelliferone), a known inhibitor of HA synthesis, has been studied pre - 
clinically  in inflammation  and fibrosis53–55. In particular,  H01 is of benefit in multiple  models of airway  
inflammation5,6,56. Including in multiple pre -clinical mouse models of PH2,13. Hymecromone is an  approved 
oral drug in Europe (European Union reference date [EURD] 07/27/1965) indicated in various  diseases of 
the gallbladder  and biliary  tract (i.e. Biliary  dyskinesia). It is hypothesized that its mechanism  of action  in 
biliary  dyskinesia and autoimmunity  may work, in part, via inhibition  of hyaluronan biosynthesis. In regards 
to inhibition  of HA, H01 is extensively  glucoronidated by UDP - glucuronyltransferases (UGTs)  which  
results in the depletion of UDP -glucuronic acid,  a precursor  necessary for HA synthesis.37,38 There is 
substantial evidence for the efficacy and safety of H01 based on its approved uses in multiple markets and 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
11  
 in multiple clinical trials57. A comprehensive review of H01 is available39. 
We propose a Phase 2a study of H01 in patients  with Group 1 and Group 3 Pulmonary hypertension. This 
proof- of-concept study will generate data supporting the ultimate goal of investigating H01 as a safe,  
effective,  oral treatment  for patients  with pulmonary hypertension. 
 
2 H01 PHARMACOLOGY 
 
2.1 Dose  Rationale 
 
H01 is an approved oral drug in Europe (European Union reference date [EURD] 07/27/1965) for  
disorders of the biliary tract. H01 has been administered chronically in humans for 50+ years at doses up  
to 1800 mg/day PO with few observed adverse safety events. Based on the European package insert, the  
standard dosing regimens for adults in hepatobiliary conditions are 300- 600 mg oral up to 3 times / day 
(900-1800 mg/day).  
 
Several  clinical  trials  of H01 in humans have  been  published and all demonstrated  safety  during both short 
and long- term administration (Appendix B). The longest reported duration of administration was a study  
of oral administration for 6 months in patients (n=29)58. The highest dose administered in a clinical trial is 
3600mg for 4 days. 
 
To inhibit excess HA synthesis and alleviate respiratory distress, we propose to administer H01 800mg  
twice a day (1600 mg/day) PO for 24 weeks. Twice daily dosing was selected to facilitate outpatient  
adherence.   If the participants  are enrolled in  the open- label extension,  H01 is administered twice  a day 
at dose of  800 mg (1600 mg/day) until Week 48. 
 
The selected dose of 1600 mg/day is consistent with non- clinical models of lung injury where human  
equivalent doses (HED) of H01 ranging from 120 mg/day PO to 2600 mg/day intra -peritoneal (IP)  
demonstrate notable functional improvements  and reduced  HA in bronchoalveolar lavage  fluid2,5,6. In the 
Phase 1 dose range study recently completed at Stanford University, doses of 1200mg, 2400mg and  
3600mg per day doses over 4 days in healthy volunteers  were  well tolerated  and led to decreases in sputum 
HA. 
 
Given the existing body of safety data for H01, and the relevance of the models suggesting 2600mg/day  
IP, characteristics of H01’s pharmacology, and the time necessary to see clinical efficacy in pulmonary  
hypertension patients, the decision was made to target 1600mg/day for 24 weeks. A BID regimen is  
selected  over a QID regimen primarily  to support patient compliance over a 24- week  period. Participants 
enrolled in the open- label extension until week 48 will continue this BID regimen  (800 mg twice a day).  
 
The results at this dose will inform the H01 development plan and larger  scale dose-range studies.

 2.2 Clinical Efficacy  
 
Dozens of previous studies of H01 have established efficacy in the context of approved and currently 
marketed indications (hepatobiliary conditions)(reviewed in Nagy 201539) A recently completed Phase 1  
dose- range study demonstrated inhibition of hyaluronan in the sputum of healthy adults over 4 days  
(pharmacodynamic marker).  
 
The current study will be the first study to use the novel mechanism of HA inhibition to investigate the  
clinical  efficacy in pulmonary hypertension.

 2.3 Clinical Safety 
 
In published clinical trials including more than 200 patients, H01 has demonstrated safety with over 28  
patient years of exposure. In these studies, H01 was safe and well tolerated. The safety profile of H01 is  
supported further by decades of marketing authorization approval in Europe, which is characterized by  
broader pharmacovigilance data. A principal European manufacturer reports awareness of more than 60  
clinical trials including 2638 patients (Grunenthal 2020). The main reported side effects for H01 in the  
product labels include diarrhea and allergic reactions. According to the WHO spontaneous reporting  
database59, investigated on August 8th, 2021, only 63 cases of adverse drug events to H01 have been 
reported since 1967 worldwide. The majority  of reported adverse events concerned  skin disorders (42.9%, 
mainly urticaria and pruritus), GI disorders (20.6%, mainly diarrhea), and immune system disorders  
(20.6%, mainly anaphylactic shock, angioedema or face edema).  
 
In fourteen  randomized controlled  trials,  few side- effects  were  reported at doses up to 2400 mg/day PO39,60. 
In another study of H01 at 2400 mg/day in patients following surgical revision of biliary pathways, no  
serious adverse reactions  were observed.  
 
2.4 Non-clinical Efficacy  
 
H01 has been studied in multiple animal models of lung injury. Across these animal models, inhibition of  
HA synthesis  with H01 led to a significant  reduction in HA content, as well as clinically  relevant outcomes. 
Five relevant studies are summarized  below: 
 
• Bleomycin model of pulmonary hypertension and lung fibrosis . In 2017, Collum et al.  
published an article entitled “Inhibition of HA synthesis attenuates pulmonary hypertension  
associated  with lung fibrosis”2. In an experimental model  of lung fibrosis  and pulmonary 
hypertension (PH), mice were treated i.p. with 0.035 U/g of bleomycin (BLM) or vehicle (PBS)  
twice  a week  for 4 weeks.  This model of chronic injury  presents with fibrotic  deposition affecting  
the distal  areas of the lung, which  is more  representative than the more  common  intra-tracheal  (IT) 
instillation of bleomycin. On day 15, mice were provided with chow containing H01 at a dose of  
20 mg/kg/day or regular chow for the remainder of the experiment. To deliver 20 mg/kg/day, H01 
was added to the diet at a concentration of 125 mg/kg diet (assuming a mean body weight ~25 g  
and chow intake ~4 g per day). It was observed that blood oxygenation was reduced  by 25% in the 
bleomycin-exposed mice  on control chow, whereas only 5% oxygenation reduction was observed 
in the bleomycin -exposed and H01 treated group. This was consistent with improvised right  
ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) values in BLM- exposed and H01 treated mice compared to 
BLM -exposed vehicle treated mice. RVSP is a surrogate value for mPAP in mice.  Furthermore, 
hyaluronan (HA)  levels  observed  by immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  showed increased  HA 
deposition in bleomycin- exposed mice that were inhibited by H01 therapy. In line with this,  
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed a significant HA elevation in bleomycin -exposed 
mice  that was attenuated  from 1600 ng/mL HA to 1000 ng/mL HA by H01 treatment.  These  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
14  
 observations were  consistent  with increased  levels of the HA-synthases  Has1,  Has2  and Has3  
expression in bleomycin-exposed mice.  H01 attenuated  Has2  and Has3  but not Has1  expression. 
 
• Adenosine  deaminase  null mouse  (Ada-/-) model  of lung  fibrosis  and pulmonary  hypertension  
in combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema (CPFE). In 2019, Collum et al. published an 
article entitled “Adenosine and hyaluronan promote lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension in 
combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema”3. Genetically engineered mice lacking adenosine  
deaminase (Ada-/-) were  utilized  as an experimental model  of lung fibrosis  and pulmonary 
hypertension (PH)  in combined pulmonary fibrosis  and emphysema (CPFE).  Ada-/- mice  received  
supplemental PEG -ADA, allowing them to live normally, from birth up to week 24. Starting on 
week 24, PEG -ADA was gradually reduced over 9 weeks and, starting on week 34, mice were 
provided with either  control chow or medicated  chow (H01  at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks.  
Ada-/- mice developed increased fibrosis in the lung as detected by Masson’s trichrome staining  
for collagen which was decreased upon H01 treatment. Arterioles from Ada-/- mice exhibited  
increased aSMA staining indicative of increased muscularization of the arterioles which resulted  
in an increased smooth muscle area/vessel ratio.  Arterioles from H01 -treated Ada-/- mice had  
significantly decreased aSMA staining and a more normalized smooth muscle area/vessel ratio.  
Ada-/- mice also had significantly decreased lev els of arterial oxygenation (SpO 2) which were  
normalized with H01 treatment. Importantly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels from  
Ada-/- mice contained HA levels that were significantly increased (> 10x) compared to normal  
mice while H01 treatment in Ada -/- mice were only ~3x above normal. In addition, in this study  
H01 was able to therapeutically  reduce evidence of fibrotic matrix  remodeling  in these mice.  
• Hypoxia- induced Pulmonary  Hypertension . In an unpublished study using mice  lacking  HAS2,  
investigators demonstrate that these mice are protected from the development of pulmonary  
hypertension, induced following chronic exposure to hypoxia (10% O 2 for 28 days) with weekly  
Sugen (SU5416) injections. Similarly,  in a model of hypoxia- sugen  induced pulmonary 
hypertension, H01 administered  starting  on day 15 of 10% O 2 halted  vascular  remodeling, 
perivascular HA accumulation and attenuated RVSP  after 13 days of treatment. The hypoxia - 
sugen model of PH is able to recapitulate some of the features of patients with PAH, including  
elevated RVSP and vascular wall thickening without parenchymal lung disease. These studies  
underscore the role of HA synthesis in PH and highlight the capacity  of H01 to halt the 
development of disease.  
 
• Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) -induced model of acute lung inflammation. In 2013,  
McKallip  et al. published an article  entitled  “Treatment  with the hyaluronic acid synthesis inhibitor  
4-methylumbelliferone suppresses SEB -induced lung inflammation”5. The effects of H01 on  
staphylococcus (SEB) -induced acute lung inflammation were investigated in vitro and in vivo . 
Culturing staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) -activated immune cells with H01 led to reduced  
proliferation,  reduced  cytokine production as well as an increase in apoptosis  when  compared  to 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
15  
 untreated cells. In an in vivo model of lung inflammation, exposure to SEB led to significantly  
elevated levels of 1500 pg/mL hyaluronan (HA) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). 
However, H01 treatment following SEB exposure significantly reduced BALF HA levels to 200 
pg/mL. Concomitant with the decrease in BALF, HA levels, mRNA levels of HAS1, HAS2 and  
HAS3  were  also all significantly  decreased.  Furthermore,  exposure of vehicle -treated  mice  to SEB 
led to an increase in the expression of various cytokines, such as IL‑1β, IL -2, IL -6, IFN -γ, and  
TNF -α, which are all reported to play a role in lung inflammation. In comparison, treatment of  
mice  with H01 led to a significant  reduction in the SEB-induced increase in all cytokines measured.  
 
• Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced model of acute lung inflammation . In 2015, McKallip et  
al. published an article  entitled  “Treatment  with the hyaluronic acid synthesis inhibitor 4- 
Methylumbelliferone  suppresses LPS-induced lung inflammation”6. The effects  of H01 on 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced acute  lung inflammation  were  investigated in vitro  and in vivo. 
Culturing LPS -activated immune cells with H01 led to reduced proliferation, reduced cytokine  
production, and an increase in apoptosis when  compared  to untreated  cells.  Treatment  of mice  with 
H01 (single  dose of 450 mg/kg i.p., approximately 18000 mg/kg assuming  a body weight of 25 g) 
led to protection from LPS -induced lung injury. Specifically, H01 treatment led to a reduction in 
LPS-induced HA synthase (HAS)  messenger  RNA (mRNA)  levels HAS1  decreased  from  9 to 1.5, 
HAS2 from 8 to 0.5, HAS3 from 13 to 1. Vascular permeability induced by LPS was reduced  
nearly  4-fold with H01 treatment  while  pro- inflammatory  cytokine levels (IL-6, IFN-α and IFN-γ) 
were  reduced by >90% with treatment.  
 
2.5 Non-clinical Safety  
 
The acute toxicity of H01 is relatively low: the LD50 for oral administration is 7593 mg/kg in mice and  
6220 mg/kg  in rats (highest doses tested;  HED  37,000 mg/day and 61,000 mg/day, respectively).  
Protracted  oral administration  of 800-2400 mg/kg/day for 3 months in a dog model (HED 79,000 mg/day) 
and of 400- 1000 mg/kg/day for 4 months in a rat model (HED 9700 mg/day), showed no toxicities in  
physical or behavioral measures (Cantabilin  Label  Italy - Attachment).  No teratogenicity  was observed  in 
rat or rabbit at oral doses up to 1200 mg/kg/day (HED  23,000 mg/day). Toxicology tests on animals  have 
not shown any toxic phenomena, abnormalities of growth or behavior. No cases of teratogenicity or fetal  
toxicity  have been encountered.  
 
2.6 Hypothesis  
 
We hypothesize that oral H01 at doses of 1600 mg per day for 24 weeks in the blinded study and for an 
additional 24 weeks as part of open- label extension  will be safe and well -tolerated  and show evidence of 
clinical efficacy. We will conduct exploratory analyses in both the blinded study and open- label extension  
to further establish the  correlation  of changes in  serum  HA with meaningful clinical outcomes.

22  
 and undergo informed  consent.  Screening will be conducted within  30 days of baseline  assessment.  If any 
of the screening labs were performed as part of standard of care within 4 weeks of the screening, these 
labs will be  used for screening. 
 
If the patient qualifies and consents to participate, they will undergo baseline assessments. Baseline labs  
that were done within the previous 4 weeks will be accepted as baseline labs; if there are no labs for >4  
weeks,  these will be repeated.  If any of the following baseline procedures were  performed  and documented 
in the medical  chart  at part of standard  of care within  2 months of the baseline visit,  these will be accepted  
as the baseline assessment:  RHC, PFTs,  6MWDT, 12- Lead  ECG.  
 
All participants will start taking the study drug on the morning of Day 1, the day after the baseline  
assessment.  All participants  will follow  up in person for assessments at Weeks 4, 12, and 24. 
Participants  will also be contacted  electronically  and/or by telephone on Weeks 2, 8, 16, 20, 28. Participants  
will continue the study drug for 24 weeks with the final in person assessment  at Week  24. A final follow - 
up electronically or by telephone will be performed at week 28 (4 weeks after treatment completion). If  
participants  do not complete  the 24 weeks of treatment for any reason,  every  effort will be made to conduct 
the Week 24 final assessment at the time of treatment termination and the participant will be followed  
until at least  4 weeks  after stopping the study drug (longer  if necessary  to follow AEs).   If the participants 
are enrolled in the open- label extension, they will be contacted  by telephone on Weeks 26 and 36.  A final 
in-person assessment will occur at Week 48 .

7.3 Clinical Improvement  
 
Clinical improvement in this study will utilize the RHC, 6MWD test, PFTs, and patient symptom score  
reports. 
 
RHC at rest and with exercise will be performed in accordance with standard procedures by a trained  
pulmonologist  in a cardiac catheterization  laboratory  and standard  sedation  medications  may be used.  This 
procedure typically takes  less than one hour. 
 
6MWD test and PFTs will be performed in the clinic at specified visits in accordance with standard  
guidelines and will be carried out by trained study  staff.  
 
Quality of life questionnaires will be performed a selected time points and will include questions to  
measure physical activity,  respiratory  symptoms, pain, general  health, mental  and emotional wellbeing. 
8 S TUDY DRUG  PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 Treatment  Assignment  
 
Up to 16 eligible  participants will be randomly assigned  to H01 or placebo  in a 5:3 ratio using a computer- 
generated randomization scheme, stratified by PH type, developed by an unblinded biostatistician at  
Stanford University. The code used to generate the allocation, along with the seed used in the random  
number generation, will be stored  on secure servers and maintained  by the unblinded biostatistician.  
 
8.2 Blinding  
 
This is a double- blind study design. Participants, study investigators, and clinicians will be blinded.  All 
doses of study  drugs and placebo  will be prepackaged  by a central  study pharmacy. The central  pharmacy  
will coordinate randomization  with the independent biostatistician for  randomization codes. The 
allocation codes and labeled product will be used by dedicated study personnel who will administer  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
24  
 product to enrolled and randomized participants. An SOP will govern the blinding process. Any break in 
the blinding process will  be reported to the DSMC and principal investigator.  
 
8.3 Formulation  of Test and Placebo  Medications 
 
H01 will be supplied by a manufacturer  in Europe that holds current  good manufacturing practice  (GMP)  
certification. Specifically, the tablet formulation approved in the European Union called Isochol 400 mg 
will be  used and provided by the marketing  authorization  holder, Zentiva. U Kabelovny, 529/16, 102 00 
Praha -Dolní Měcholupy, Czechia.  
 
Under normal conditions, unopened H01 has a reported shelf -life by the manufacturer of 3 years. The drug 
product will be stored at a temperature under 25 °C  in bottles, and bottles will be tightly closed in order 
to protect from moisture, in accordance with the storage instructions on the Iscohol 400mg label. 
 
The placebo  tablets  used in this trial are selected  to match  the general  shape,  size and color of H01 but are 
not identical.  Storage and dispensing of medications H01 and placebo product will be performed at 
controlled room temperature, 59° to 77°F (15° to 25°C) and protected from light and moisture by study- 
designated pharmacy  personnel. Study  drug will be dispensed   to enrolled  participants based on site- level 
standard operating procedures. Study drug will remain in the original bottles until the time of release of 
the product to patients for home administration.  A site Drug Accountability Log will be  maintained by 
site personnel. This log is subject to audit and will be signed off by the site investigator at the end of  the 
trial.  A temperature log will be utilized by the IDS to ensure compl iance with temperature requirements.
8.4 Possible  Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment  
 
All reasons for discontinuation from study drug will be captured  in study  CRFs  enabling for the ability  to 
differentiate  treatment  discontinuation  from study withdrawal.  These include the following  reasons:  
 
• Completed  24 weeks of treatment of the blinded study or 48 week of the open- label extension  
• Grade  ≥3 Adverse Drug  Reactions  
• Withdrawal  of consent 
• Physician  request 
 
Investigators and study staff are reminded of the importance of participant retention in the case of  
treatment discontinuation and should take steps to prevent missing data that will be critical to the  
interpretation  of the study results.  Investigators  and study  staff should remind  participants of the 
importance of continued participation  in laboratory  and clinical monitoring. Participants  who discontinue 
study drug should continue follow -up when possible. This concept will be reinforced in the Informed  
Consent Form  (ICF).  
 
In the case of missing data for participant disposition for a randomized participant, a vital records search  
will be undertaken.

9 MONITORING  AND REPORTING  OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
9.1 Adverse Events  Definition  
 
An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward or unfavorable medical  occurrence in humans which occurs during 
the participant’s participation of a clinical study, whether or not considered drug related. Any change in 
clinical  status,  routine  labs, physical examinations, etc. that is considered clinically  significant  by the study 
investigator are considered AEs.  
 
9.2 Suspected  Adverse Reaction Definition  
 
A Suspected Adverse Reaction is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the  
investigational drug caused the AE. For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means  
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected  
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
9.3 Serious  Adverse Event  or Serious  Adverse Reaction Definition  
 
An AE or suspected  adverse  reaction  or adverse reaction  is considered  serious if, in the view of either the 
PI or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE: it is considered “life -threatening” if its occurrence, in the opinion of the  
investigator or sponsor, places the participant at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred  in a more  severe form,  might have 
caused  death. 
• Persistent  or significant incapacity  or substantial  disruption of the ability  to conduct normal life 
functions 
• Inpatient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing  hospitalization 
• Congenital abnormality  or birth  defect  
• Necessary  surgery or medical  device intervention  to prevent fatal or permanent adverse effects  
• Important medical  event that may not result  in one of the above outcomes, but may jeopardize the 
health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the  
outcomes listed in  the above definition of serious adverse event  
 
 
9.4 Unexpected  Adverse Event  or Reaction Definition  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
26  
 Investigator Brochure or package insert or is not listed  at the specificity,  severity  or rate of occurrence that 
has been  observed. The below  summary  includes adverse reactions  from product labels for H01 in Europe. 
 Cantabiline® 400 mg (France)  
Undesirable effects: Occasional  cases of diarrhea  and isolated  reports  of allergic  skin reactions.  
 Cantabilin® 300 mg (Italy)  
Undesirable effects: Diarrhea, anaphylactic reactions, including urticaria, itching, dyspnea, Quincke's  
edema and hypotension that can evolve to anaphylactic shock.  
 Cholspasmin® forte  400 mg (Germany)  
Undesirable effects: With prolonged administration of higher doses, soft stool or diarrhea may occur;  
fullness, constipation and stomach pressures are also reported (<0.01%) hypersensitivity reactions may  
occur, which can manifest as skin changes (< 0.01%).  
 Isochol® 400 mg (Czech Republic)  
Undesirable effects: Rare frequency of headache and rash (  <0.001)  
 
9.5 New Fact  
 
A new fact is defined as any new data that may lead to a reassessment of the risk -to-benefit ratio of the  
research or of the product being researched, changes in the use of this product, in the conduct of the  
research,  or to the documents relating  to the research,  or data that may lead to the suspension,  
discontinuation or modification of the research protocol  or similar research.  
 
9.6 Identification  of Adverse Events  
 
As all participants in this study will have pre- existing medical conditions, those pre -existing conditions  
will not be considered adverse  events.  New events that occur  or worsening (through frequency  or intensity) 
of pre- existing  conditions will be  considered  as adverse events.  
 
Adverse events (including  SAEs) may  be discovered through any of these methods: 
1. Observing or interviewing  the participant.  
2. Procedures / laboratories  as performed  as part of participating  in the study. 
3. Receiving  an unsolicited  complaint from the participant.  
The in vestigator will provide the following  information  about an AE: 
• Date  of onset and resolution 
• Severity, graded using the NIH Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE),  
Version 5.0 
• Action  taken  with study drug product 
• Changes in study drug dosing 
• Causal  relationship  to study  drug 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
27  
 • Outcome 
All reportable  drug adverse events as defined above will be recorded  on the appropriate AE/SAE  CRF  
form starting after consent has been obtained until Day 196 (ie at least 30 days after the last dose of  
study drug). 
9.7 Follow- up of Adverse Events  
 
If a participant experiences any clinical or laboratory abnormality attributed to the study drug, they will  
be monitored until the abnormality returns to baseline (as defined at enrollment) or stabilizes. This  
procedure is implemented in the study database and case report forms and includes both adverse events  
and serious adverse events. Participants can take medications for symptomatic relief (e.g. anti -emetics,  
anti-diarrhea,  analgesics).  
 
9.8 Guidelines  for Assessing  Severity  of an Adverse Event  
 
Adverse events will be graded  on a scale from  1 to 5 according  to the NIH Common Terminology Criteria  
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Referenc  
e_5x7.pdf ). A summary  is below. 
 
• Grade  1 Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms; clinical  or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental  activities of  daily  living  (ADL).  
• Grade  3 Severe or medically  significant but not immediately  life-threatening; hospitalization  or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting  self-care ADL.  
• Grade  4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade  5 Death  related  to AE. 
9.9 Guidelines  for Determining  Causality 
 
Attribution of all grade 2 and higher AE’s as treatment related or not will be done in two ways. First,  
attribution will be done by the treating clinician at the time of clinical evaluation using the formal  
assignment detailed below. Later, attribution we be done again by investigators in aggregate data review  
and reporting. 
 
Attribution  Standards: 
 
1. Unrelated:  The AE is clearly not related  to the investigational  agent 
2. Unlikely: The AE is doubtfully related  to the investigational  agent 
3. Possible: The AE may be  related  to the investigational agent  
4. P robable: The AE is likely  related  to the investigational agent 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
28  
 5. Definite: The AE is clearly related  to the investigational agent 
 
9.10 Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Investigators will report to the Primary Investigator (PI) all serious adverse events within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of  the event, regardless of  relationship or expectedness.  
 
For serious adverse events, all requested information on the AE/SAE CRF will be provided. However, unavailable details of the event will not delay  submission of the known information.  As additional details  
become available,  the AE/SAE  CRF  will be updated and submitted. 
 
9.11 Unexpected  Non-serious Adverse Events  
 
An unexpected, non- serious adverse event that is of Grade 2 severity or higher and study related will be  
recorded  and reported to the PI under the serious adverse event  reporting procedure above (i.e., within  24 
hours). 
 
9.12 Reporting  to Health  Authority  
 
The Principal Investigator sponsor for the IND will report all AEs and SAEs to the FDA within the  
reporting time limits set forth by the  FDA.  
 
9.12.1 Standard Reporting (IND  Annual Report) 
 
This option applies if the AE is classified  as one of the following: 
 Serious, expected,  suspected  adverse  reactions  
 Serious and not a suspected  adverse reaction  
 Pregnancies  
*Note that all adverse events (not just those requiring 24- hour reporting) will be reported in the Annual  
IND Report. 
 
9.12.2 Expedited  Reporting 
 
The investigators  must  report in an IND safety  report any suspected  adverse reaction  to study drug that is 
both serious and unexpected. In particular,  any cases  of anaphylaxis potentially  due to the study drug must 
be reported. The time frame  for submitting an IND safety  report  to FDA and all participating  investigators  
is no later than 15 calendar days after the PI determines that the suspected adverse reaction or other  
information  qualifies for reporting. 
 
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions represent especially important safety  
information and, therefore, must be reported more rapidly to FDA. The requirement for reporting any  
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction to FDA is no later than 7 calendar days  
after the sponsor’s initial  receipt of  the information.  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
29  
 Investigators must submit IND and/or CTA safety reports as required by IRB. Documentation of the  
submission and receipt by the IRB must be retained for each IND  safety report.  
 
9.13 Protocol Violations 
 
All protocol deviations will be recorded in a protocol deviation log by qualified study personnel. Based  
on IRB policies, protocol violations will be reported to the Institutional Review Board within 5 days of 
the protocol violation. As warranted, the PI will develop a corrective action plan to present to the IRB to  
address deviations and/or violations.  
 
9.14 Reasons for Early  Termination  
 
Study drug administration must be discontinued if any of the following  occurs: 
 
• Participant  develops grade  3 adverse drug reaction.  
• Participant  desires to discontinue participation  in the study (withdrawal of consent) 
• Participant  is unwilling  or unable to comply with the protocol. 
• The investigator feels  that is in the participant’s  best interest  to discontinue treatment  with study 
drug. 
 
Participants who halt study drug due to an AE will continue to be followed until AE resolution or  
stabilization.  
 
9.14.1 Halting  the Study 
 
The study will be halted  if: 
• At any point in the study the Investigators feel that there are safety concerns in this study that put  
the participants  at increased  risk as compared  to the original information  on risk in the consenting 
process; enrollment will be paused and a safety review will be performed. The investigators in  
discussion with the FDA  can choose to stop the study. 
OR 
 
• The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee for the study, after reviewing data on a  
rolling  basis  concludes that it is in the best interests  of the participants  to discontinue the study. 
Investigators and DSMC will consider the following to guidelines for adverse drug reactions (ARs) to  
guide decisions regarding study suspension. Given the severity of PH -ILD disease, the DSMC will need  
to assess the safety data to make final decisions and recommendations, including consultation with IRB  
and FDA as they deem  important. 
 
Grade  2 serious ARs 
• If a total of 3 or more  grade  2 ARs occur, enrollment  will be paused  and a safety  review  performed.  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
30  
  
Grade  3 or 4 serious ARs 
 
• If 1 grade 3 or 4 serious AR occurs,  enrollment will be paused and a safety  review  performed. 
 
Grade  5 (fatal)  
 
• Any incidence will lead to pausing enrollment and a safety  review.  
 
A final decision to halt the study will be made by the investigators after consultation with the DSMC.  
Such a decision with its supporting documentation and possible future plans including possible protocol  
amendments for the study will be submitted to,  and discussed  with,  the FDA.  
 
9.15 Data  Safety  Monitoring  
 
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be established. The DSMC will  
consist of 3 individuals representing statistical and clinical expertise needed to perform the role of safety  
oversight and interpretation  of data for this trial. Members will be selected  to ensure no conflict of interest 
exists relative to  study outcomes and will not be  directly engaged in study conduct. 
 
The DSMC will monitor the trial, review safety data, and assess the performance of trial operations and  
will provide  recommendations  on whether  the trial should continue as planned, be modified,  or be stopped. 
Any action taken by the Board, and the reasons for the action, will be recorded. These documents will  
include any data summaries or analyses provided to the DSMC  and will remain  confidential until the study 
is concluded. The DSMC charter  includes additional details  on roles and  responsibilities.  
10 S TATISTICAL METHODS  AND CONSIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Analysis Population  
 
There will be two analysis populations for the trial: the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per- protocol (PP) 
populations. The following description provides how the populations will be derived and analyzed: 
 
• ITT population 
o Composed of all randomized participants  
o Analyzed  according to their assigned  treatment arm 
• PP population 
o Composed of all randomized participants  who completed  treatment and didn’t have  any 
major protocol deviations 
o Analyzed  according to their assigned  treatment arm 
 
10.2 Descriptive Statistics  
 
Descriptive statistics will be reported for all key participant variables, including, but not limited to,  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
31  
 baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, use of medications, laboratory values, vital signs,  
clinical  outcomes, adverse events,  compliance,  and study completion status.  Proportions will be presented  
for categorical variables. Continuous variables will be presented using means, standard deviations, and 
number of observations if the data are normally distributed. If the data are not normally distributed, then 
continuous variables will be presented  using medians  and interquartile  ranges. In all cases,  between -group 
comparisons will be assessed  using absolute standardized differences.  
 
10.3 Analysis of Primary  Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint is the change in PVR on RHC from baseline to the end of treatment period. No  
hypothesis testing will be performed in analyzing the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint will be  
analyzed  in the ITT  population. 
 
The PVR on RHC will be presented as means, standard deviations, number of observations and 95%  
confidence intervals for each randomization arm. Differences in PVR may be calculated between the  
treatment group, placebo group, and different types of PH (e.g. Group 1 versus Group 3) to assess  
treatment differences. The analysis will be performed after all participants in the ITT population have  
reached  the end of treatment or have been withdrawn from the trial.  
10.4 Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
All secondary  endpoints will be analyzed  in the ITT population. 
 
The proportion of participants experiencing adverse events (AE) events will be summarized by AE type  
and treatment  arm. The proportion of participants  experiencing an AE will be calculated  as the number of 
participants who have experienced an AE divided by the number of participants in the ITT population. AEs will be summarized by each arm separately. AEs may be compared by arm using a Fisher’s exact  
test. 
 
The proportion of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAE) events will be summarized by  
SAE type and treatment arm. The proportion of participants experiencing an SAE will be calculated as  the 
number of participants  who have experienced  a SAE  divided by the number of participants  in the ITT 
population. SAEs will be summarized by each arm separately. SAEs may be compared by arm using a  
Fisher’s exact test.  
 
The baseline,  follow -up, and change from  baseline  in mPAP,  6MWDT , EMPHAIS -10 score,    SGRQ score, 
serum HA concentration, and NT -proBNP will be summarized using means, standard  deviations numbers 
of observations, and 95% confidence intervals  for each randomization  arm. Differences in these measures 
may be calculated between the treatment and placebo group overall and within  different types  of PH (e.g. 
Group 1 versus Group 3) to assess treatment differences.  
 
10.5 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
32  
 All exploratory endpoints will be analyzed  in the ITT population and will be analyzed  after all participants 
have completed treatment or have withdrawn from the trial. 
 
The baseline,  follow-up, and change from  baseline  in inflammatory  markers,  pro- inflammatory  cytokines, 
PFTs (including FEV1, FVC, TLC, and DLCO), and EBC HA concentration, and HA fragment size will  
be summarized using means, standard deviations numbers of observations, and 95% confidence intervals  
for each randomization  arm. Differences  in these measures may be calculated  between  the treatment group, 
placebo group, and different types of PH (e.g. Group 1 versus Group 3) to assess treatment differences. 
The pharmacokinetics and fragment size will be  described.  There will also be a sensitivity analysis to 
investigate whether drug product used (Isochol vs Cantabiline) led to differential primary endpoint 
outcomes, using a stratified analysis by drug product. 
 
10.6 Missing  Data  Handling  
 
While  we expect minimal  missing  data,  it is inevitable in clinical trials.  We will thoroughly and 
transparently present the amount of missing data for each variable where missing data is present. Given  
the small sample size, we will use complete  case analyses.  
10.7 Sample  Size and Randomization 
 
A total of 16 participants with PH will be enrolled in the study. Participants will be randomized 5:3 to 
treatment:placebo. Randomization will be stratified by PH type. As no formal hypothesis testing will be  
performed  on the primary  endpoint, this sample  size is not based  on a statistical  powering. However,  data 
on hand regarding clinical improvement and HA changes in preclinical and clinical settings suggests we  
will be able to draw meaningful insights  from a study of this size  that informs future trials.  
 
11 DATA COLLECTION,  RETENTION AND  MONITORING  
 
11.1 Data  Collection  Instruments  
 
Data entry, database management, and data quality assurance will be led by a study coordinator at the  
study site. Source documentation will include site assessment  forms,  laboratory  results,  telephone surveys, 
and internet surveys. Where possible, electronic transfer of electronic source data to the study CRFs  
through a secure electronic  data capture (EDC)  system  will be automated. Any paper- based  forms  that are 
used will be maintained in a secure locked facility at the study site and maintained by the site clinical  
research  coordinator (CRC).  An eCRF  will ensure capture of information  including subject  identification,  
study identification, provision and date of informed  consent form (ICF),  visit dates,  clinical  results  (safety  
and efficacy) as specified in the protocol, adverse events, concomitant medications, investigational  
medicine receipt/use/destruction, production administration, data of study completion, and reason for  
withdrawal if needed. The individual author of all source documents will be identifiable. Any adverse  
related reports will be signed off by the investigator. All study related documentation will employ the  
minimum of identifying information.  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
33  
  
11.2 Data  Management Procedures  
 
In compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines, the study site will maintain all source documentation, CRFs,  
and study- related documents. All participants will be assigned a study ID. All study tools will use only 
the subject’s  study ID. Specimen  containers and blood tubes for assignment to site laboratories  or shipping 
to central  laboratories  will be labeled  by the site CRC  with the minimum amount of identifying  information  
(e.g., participant identifier,  study identifier,  and date of  collection).  
 
A secure trial master file (TMF) maintained by qualified study staff and will include all study -related  
documents  including the protocol, investigator  brochure,  study operations manual, statistical analysis  plan, 
laboratory  manual, email communications, SOPs,  evidence of validated  processes for ECD systems.  Trial  
site-specific files will also be maintained on the TMF including a delegation of authority log, site roster  
for study personnel, qualified person certification, local SOPs affecting study conduct, ICF, and IRB  
approvals. The trial master file system will include audit trails for document versions and archiving  
capabilities.  
 
11.3 Data  Quality  Control and Reporting  
 
The lead investigator is responsible for ensuring that a roster of active study personnel is maintained, a  
delegation of authority log assigns tasks to individual team members, and that access to the secure study  
EDC and TMF systems are controlled in alignment with the roster and  log. 
 
In order to ensure data quality, quality  audits will be performed.  The timing  of audits will be developed 
based  on a risk-based  approach, reflecting  the nature  of the study design, known profile  of 
the drug being used, and patient population. Study monitors will follow an SOP. Elements of study 
monitoring  will include:  
 
1. Implementation  of patient  consent processes  
2. Source data verification  (SDV) (e.g., for questionnaires,  hospital medical  records,  and 
biospecimen collections)  
3. Pharmacy  monitoring (drug accountability processes,  IMP storage, labeling  and expiry  dates,  
randomization and blinding) 
4. Laboratory  monitoring  (Adherence to Lab Manual  and specimen  handling requirements)  
5. Adverse  event  reporting (ensuring reporting  from source documents to trial team,  reporting to local  
authorities) 
 
The results of site audits  will be shared  with the clinical  trial investigator(s)  and IRB as appropriate. 
 
11.4 Archival of Data  
 
Electronic  data including  all study databases and supporting electronic  documentation will be archived  to 
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
34  
 cloud- based  servers on a daily basis. 
 
11.5 Availability  and Retention  of Investigational Records  
 
All electronic  data will be kept in secured  servers.  All paper- based  forms  that are used will be maintained  
in a secure locked facility at the study site and maintained by the site CRC. Only the research team will  
have access to the data. 
 
11.6 Subject  Confidentiality  
 
Participant medical and study information will be kept confidential. The following health information  
related to this study may be used or disclosed in connection with this research study, including, but not  
limited to, name and initials, address, email, phone number(s), date of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicity,  
medical  record  number, information  related  to COVID-19 disease,  symptoms,  physical exams,  symptoms 
that might relate  to medication  side effects,  vital signs including temperature  and oxygen saturation  levels,  
laboratory  tests, pregnancy test,  and medications  received including study drug. 
 
All participants will be given a sequential study ID. The code for this ID with personal identifiers will be  
maintained  in a locked research  file accessible only to study personnel. Only  research  personnel will have 
access to the research records. The data will be keyed into a secure study website in a coded fashion by  
the study coordinator. Paper research charts will be kept in a locked file cabinet with limited access.  
Laboratory personnel will have access to study specimens. The data is transferred by co mputer via  
password protected electronic network. When transferring via electronic networks, a password protected  
encrypted computer will be used. 
12 ETH ICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 IRB and HIPAA  
 
This study protocol, all procedures and informed consent forms (ICF), and any subsequent protocol  
amendments must be reviewed  and approved by the Institutional Review  Board  (IRB).  Prior to any study- 
related  procedures, the investigator or designee will obtain  from  the participant a signed  and dated  written  
ICF consistent with FDA/ICH regulations and the HIPAA Privacy  Rule.  A HIPAA Privacy  Rule  
Authorization  language will be included in the ICF and must  be IRB approved prior to study 
implementation. In addition, the document of Bill of Rights will be attached to the ICF so that the  
participants  can read  and understand the same.  All versions will be maintained  in the TMF.  
 
12.2 Potential Participant Risks  
 
H01: H01 is a natural active ingredient that is synthesized for pharmaceutical use. H01 is currently not  
FDA  approved for use in  the United  States.  However,  H01 has been  marketed  and used as approved drug 
in Europe for >50 years (European Union reference date [EURD] 07/27/1965). Overall, H01 appears to  
be a safe and well -tolerated medication. The French product of H01 named Cantabiline will be used in  
The SATURN  Study  [CONFIDENTIAL  – DO NOT  REDISTRIBUTE]  
35  
 this trial. Cantabiline is authorized by the French Medicines Agency (Agence nationale de sécurité du  
médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM)) under CIP : 6 197 431 7. The recommended dose is 400 
mg with main meals. The main side effect listed in the product label is the gastrointestinal pathology of  
diarrhea, which is listed as common 0.1% to 10%. Potential anaphylactic or allergic reactions are also  
listed as possible side effects with an unknown rate. The label recommends to not use in cases of biliar y 
obstruction or severe hepatic impairment.  
 
To minimize  risks  of potential severe allergic  reactions,  participants with a known allergy  for H01 will be 
excluded. A standard operating procedure for managing allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, will  
also be in place. These risks as well as guidance on the potential signs and symptom of a severe allergic  
reaction will be included in the participant consent. Additionally, if participants develop a grade 3 or  
higher allergic reaction thought to be due to the study drug, treatment with the study drug will be  
discontinued immediately. To minimize risks of gastrointestinal side effects, patients with acute biliary  
obstruction of severe hepatic impairment will be excluded from the study. Additionally, if participants  
develop diarrhea,  we have  developed guidelines based  on diarrhea  severity  and participant preferences for 
1) treating  symptoms, 2) avoiding dose increases,  3) reducing doses,  or 4) discontinuing treatment.  
 
Right heart catherization: RHC can cause bruising of the skin or infection at the site where the catheter  
(sterile tube) is inserted into a vein, injury to blood vessels, excessive bleeding because of puncture or  
damage to the vein during catheter  insertion, or partial  collapse of a lung if a neck  or chest  vein is used to 
insert the catheter. Rare but serious risks include abnormal heart rhythm or electrical blockage of heart  
beats,  perforation  of the heart  muscle with bleeding into the sack around the heart,  blood clots,  stroke, 
heart attack, or death. Medications for pain or sedation can cause allergic reaction, an unconscious state,  and 
depressed breathing.  During the RHC, you maybe asked to perform an exercise test.  With your feet on a 
supine ergometer you may exercise for 3 to 6 mins at a gentle pace.  You may feel short of breath during this 
portion of the study.  You can stop at any point.   
 
Pulmonary function tests and expired breath  condensate:  PFTs  and EBC are usually safe for most people. 
However, PFTs may require participants to breathe in and out quickly so they may feel dizzy and may faint.  
 
Venipuncture & arterial blood gas: The risks of venipuncture and ABG include temporary discomfort, pain, 
and anxiety from the needle stick,  bruising, and, rarely,  infection.  To minimize  risk, all blood draws  will 
follow hospital/clinical procedures and be drawn by experienced providers. There is minimal risk  regarding  
the blood loss  related to  study tests. 
 
Privacy: There is a risk of loss of privacy around health information. To minimize this risk, information  
about participants will be handled with a goal of maintain confidentiality in compliance with privacy regulations (e.g. HIPPA and local government laws). Participant names and medical record numbers will  
be recorded for study management purposes. This information will not be included in the hard copy data  
case report forms or the electronic database used for data analysis and will be maintained in a locked file in 
a lockable office.  It will not be disclosed  to others.  Study data will be identified  by a unique study code for 
each participant. Hard copy study data will be maintained in a separate locked research file in a lockable

 office.  The electronic  data set, which  will be identified  by the unique study codes,  will be keyed into a 
computer that is password  protected  and encrypted. Access to study data will be limited  to research  personnel 
who have completed protocol- specific  training.

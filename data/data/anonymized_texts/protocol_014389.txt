Amended protocol  02 (23 February 2023) 
This amended protocol 02 (amendment 02) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT   
Due to difficulties in recruitment, the Sponsor is amending the Phase 2/3 (Part A and B) 
EFC16723 efficacy and safety study to be just a Part A Phase 2 study. The purpose of thi s 
protocol amendment is to  remove Part B  and for Part A to modify the  number of participants  to be 
enrolled , shorten  treatment period,  modify endpoints, and modify overall study phase . In addition,  
the primary analysis population is being updated to the elevated baseline eosinophils population, 
and consequently the sample size is updated so that we will have approximately 30 participants 
with elevated eosinophils ( ≥300 cells/mm3), which coupled to the existing low eosinophils 
population will bring the tot al sample size to 70. Other changes include the modification of 
treatment period and primary and secondary endpoints.  The following table outlines the changes 
made to the protocol and the affected sections:    
Protocol amendment summary of changes table  
Section # and 
Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Throughout  Deleted mention s of and relevant text for Part  B of the study , 
including objectives and endpoints for Part B . The original study design was Phase 2/3 
with Part  A (proof -of-concept Phase 2) 
and Part  B (Phase 3)  changed to a 
Phase 2 study with remov al of Part B.  
Deleted nomenclature for Part  A and Part  B. Clarification for removal of Part B.  
Deleted mentions of and relevant text for adolescents , 
parents, LAR, 200 mg dose, Week 48, and Week 52 at 
applicable instances .  As consequence of Part B removal , no 
adolescent participant  will be enrolled .

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 3 Section # and 
Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
The Part A treatment period has been changed from 52 
weeks to at least 24 and no more than 52 weeks.  To align with the primary analysis 
timepoint at week 24 and to shorten the 
time to study completion while allowing 
for collection of endpoint data to 
evaluate efficacy in participants with 
CRSsNP.  
Updated sample size from:  
140 participants (approximately  70 per arm) with 
approximately 100 participants with blood eosinophils >= 
300 (approximately 50 per arm)  
To: 
70 participants (approximately 35 per arm)  with 30 
participants with blood  eosinophils >= 300  (approximately 15 
per arm)  Due to enrollment difficul ties, the 
Sponsor proposes a single part Phase 2 
study with reduced sample size . 
Deleted the phrase “2 -part” from the study title.  Due to protocol change, the Part B 
Phase 3 study will no longer be 
conducted. Part A is modified and 
remains a Phase 2 study.  Updated study Phase from 2/3 to 2  
Minor editorial and typographical changes wherever 
applicable  Formatting and typographical  
Updated patient to participant wherever applicable  Formatting and typographical  
1.1 Synopsis  Deleted note with below  text: 
The primary analysis of Part A at Week 24 (details in Section 
9.6) will be conducted both to provide initial evidence of 
efficacy of dupilumab in adult participants with severe or 
uncontrolled CRSsNP and inform the initiation and design of 
Part B.  
Added new note with below text:  
Modification of the treatment period will result in all patients 
who complete the treatment period being treated for a 
minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks, or until 
the last patient randomized completes a minimum tr eatment 
period of 24 weeks.  Since the purpose of the study has now 
changed from Phase 2/3 to a Phase 2 
and there is no longer need to assess 
efficacy beyond 24 weeks, the 52 -week 
treatment period for all participants in 
Part A is now variable between 24 
weeks and 52 weeks. A minimum of   
24-week treatment period for all 
participants allows for reliable 
assessment of the LMK endpoint in 
participants with CRSsNP.  
1.1 Synopsis  
3 Objectives and 
Endpoints  Updated the primary objective and endpoint from:  
Primary Objective  
To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab as assessed by the 
reduction at Week 24 in sinus opacification on computerized 
tomography (CT) scan and sinus total symptom score 
(sTSS) compared to placebo  
To: 
To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab as assessed by the 
reduction at Week 24 in sinus opacification on computerized 
tomography (CT) scan in the dupilumab group only  Because the reduction in sample size 
does not support reasonable power for 
the symptoms score sTSS and for 
placebo comparison.

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 4 Section # and 
Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Moved co -primary endpoint (sTSS) to secondary endpoint 
making LMK score a single primary endpoint with evaluation 
only in the dupilumab group:  
• Change from baseline to Week 24 in opacification of
sinuses assessed by CT scan using the Lund Mackay (LMK)
score
To: 
• Change from baseline to Week 24 in opacification of
sinuses assessed by CT scan using the Lund Mackay (LMK)
score in the dupilumab groupTo align with the new primary objective.  
Moved the following co -primary endpoint to a secondary 
endpoint:  
• Change from baseline to Week 24 in the sTSS*
For all the secondary objective and endpoints, deleted the 
Week 52 objective/endpoints and requalified to exploratory, 
except the following endpoints listed below. In addition, in 
the asthma subgr oup objective and endpoints removed 
comparison to placebo, and for endpoints evaluating the 
≥300 cells/mm3 population changed to ITT.
• Change from baseline to Week 24 in opacification of
sinuses assessed by CT scan using LMK score
• Change from baseline to Week 24 in sTSSGiven that 15 participants per arm 
(primary analysis population is patients 
with blood eosinophil count ≥300 
cells/mm3) does not support reasonable
power, most endpoints moved to 
exploratory. Removed all 52 -week 
endpoints as treatment duration 
shortened to 24 weeks. Certain 
endpoints modified to align with primary 
analysis population modification. Since 
the asthma subgroup will be a small 
subset of the primary analysis 
population, FEV1 and ACQ -6 will be 
evaluated i n the dupilumab arm only.  
Deleted the following endpoints:  
Endpoints in the asthma subgroup evaluating LMK and 
sTSS.  
Endpoint in other secondary endpoints in the screening 
blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/mm3 subgroup
Endpoints evaluating rescue ther apy for worsening disease.  Endpoints removed to reflect changes in 
primary analysis population, reduced 
sample size, and shortened treatment 
duration.  
Added new exploratory objective and corresponding 
endpoint for three -Dimensional CT volumetric assess ments  Additional data analysis relevant for 
evaluation of efficacy.  
1.3 Schedule of 
Activities  (SoA)  Added a note with below text for treatment duration:  
The treatment period will be variable between 24 to 52 
weeks, V6 and V7 are optional for participants.  This allows flexibility for participants on 
study completion due to variable 
treatment period between 24 weeks and 
52 weeks.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 5 Section # and 
Name  Description of Change  Brief Rationale  
Added following text in footnote ‘h’ applicable to Study 
intervention and Efficacy Assessments:  
Questionnaires in paper form are not permitted; only 
electronic form is allowed.  The study employs exclusively eCROs 
and ePROs; the statement reflects the 
Sponsor’s prohibition on use of 
questionnaire in paper copy.  
Added following text in footnote ‘h’ applicable to Study 
intervention and Efficacy Assessments:  
Physician assessment UPSIT may not be available at some 
sites for visits; in this case the investigator may omit the test 
for that visit.  To add flexibility in the UPSIT test 
performance.  
3.1 
Appropriateness of 
Measurements  Deleted text to reflect that sTSS is not a primary endpoint 
now and added “in the dupilumab group” for LMK primary 
endpoint.  
Added text to reflect that LMK and sTSS when comparing 
dupilumab to placebo are secondary endpoints . Text adaptation to endpoint hierarchy 
change.  
4.2 Scientific 
Rationale for Study 
Design  Updated the following text from:  
… participants regardless of screening blood eosinophil 
counts will be included. While the primary analysis 
population will be the ITT population, the treatment effect of 
dupilumab will also be evaluated on the screening blood 
eosinophil count of ≥300 cells/mm3 population.  
To: 
… a subset of patients with blood eosinophil counts of <300 
cells/mm3 will be randomized while the primary an alysis 
population will remain as patients who have peripheral blood 
eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/mm3. The primary analysis population will be 
participants with blood eosinophil count 
≥300 cells/mm3 as this is the population 
predicted to have most benefit w ith 
dupilumab.  
 
4.4 End of Study 
Definition  Updated study completion definition for participants following 
original protocol , amended protocol 1 and 2  As consequence of treatment period 
shortening from 52 to 24 weeks.  
5.4 Screen Failures  Added the below sentence:  
All other screening procedures must be repeated for 
rescreening.  To clarify to participating clinical sites 
that in case of rescreening all 
procedures need to be repeated, except 
CT scan if within the defined window 
period.  
6.1 Study 
Interventi on(s) 
Administered  Addition of the following sentence: ‘During study visits, the 
IMP is administered on sites after all procedures.  In order to further clarify that IMP will be 
administered at sites at the time of 
Visits.  
6.5.3 Rescue 
medicine  Changed from  
Short course OCS (prednisone or equivalent prednisolone 
up to 7 days; avoid use 4 weeks before Week 24 or Week 
52, where applicable).  
To 
Short course OCS (prednisone or equivalent prednisolone 
up to 14 days; avoid use 4 weeks before Week 24 o r Week 
52, where applicable).  To clarify an inconsistency between 
Prohibited medications and Rescue 
medications, the short course of OCS is 
up to 14 days.

8.6 
Pharmacodynamics  Removed measurement of secreted P -glycoprotein.  Test is unable to be performed  
by the Sponsor due  to assay 
limitations.  
9.2 Sample size 
determination  
9.3 Populations for 
analyses  
 Sample size determination updated.  
Primary population changed from ITT population to ITT 
population with screening blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 
cells/mm3. To reflect changes in the study primary 
objective and endpoint.  
9.1 Statistical 
hypotheses  
9.4.1 General 
considerations  
9.4.2 Primary 
endpoint(s)  Statistical hypotheses removed.  
Multiplicity consideration removed.  
Multiple imputation removed.  
Model -based analyses removed.  
Sensitivity and subgroup analyses removed.  
Use of descriptive statistics for all endpoints.  To apply more appropriate analysis 
methods based on the reduced sample 
size. 
9.4.2 Primary 
endpoint(s)  
 The intercurrent events handling strategy for taking SCS for 
any reason prior to Week 24 was changed from ’all data 
collected after SCS use will be used in the analysis’ to ‘data 
after the IE will be set to missing and the worst post -baseline 
value on or before the time of the IE  will be used to impute 
missing Week 24 value (WOCF)’.  To change handling of taking SCS for 
any reason in the primary estimand to 
an approach more appropriate for this 
clinical setting.  
9.4.3 Secondary 
endpoint(s)  Description of secondary analyses for pro portion and time -
to-event endpoints removed.  To reflect changes in the secondary 
objectives and endpoints.  
9.6 Timing of 
statistical analyses  Updated the timing of analyses to only one database lock 
after all participants have completed the study.  To reflect the removal of Part B and 
shortened treatment duration of Part A.  
10.8 Appendix 8: 
Clinician -Reported 
Outcomes and 
Patient -Reported 
Outcomes  Added new appendices with samples for following 
questionnaires:  
10.8.6 Morning Diary,

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Protocol title:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled, chronic rhinosinusitis 
witho ut nasal polyposis (CRSsNP)  
Short title:  Dupilumab in CRSsNP  
Liberty CRSsNP ORION  
Rationale:  
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS ) is an inflammatory disease of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses 
character ized by 2 or more symptoms (lasting for ≥12 weeks), one of which is nasal obstruction or 
nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior ), and may also include facial pressure/pain and/or 
reduced sense of smell. It is estimated to affect approximately 10% of th e population in the United 
States (US ) and Europe ( 1, 2). Chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypically is broadly divided into 
2 types based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps: CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP ) 
and CRS wi thout nasal polyposis (CRSsNP ) (3). Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis is 
the most common type of CRS, accounting for approxi mately two -thirds of the overall CRS 
population ( 3, 4). 
While the underlying etiopathogenesis of CRSsNP is likely multifact orial, there is a subset of 
CRSsNP patients, representing nearly one -third of the overall CRSsNP population, where the 
disease process appears to be predominantly driven by type-2 inflammation. In this subset of 
type-2 CRSsNP patients, transcriptomic and p roteomic analyses of surgical sinonasal tissues 
reveal elevated levels of type-2 inflammatory markers, such as interleukin  (IL)-5, 
immunoglobulin E (IgE ), eosinop hilic cationic protein (ECP ), Charcot -Leyden crystal galectin 
(CLC ), etc ( 5, 6, 7). The type-2-associated molecular signat ure identified in these type-2 CRSsNP 
patients suggests that the underlying pathophysiological disease process is similar to that found in 
CRSwNP patients where it is well known that type-2 inﬂammation with prominent eosinophilia 
and elevated levels of type-2 cytokines, such as IL -4, IL-5, and IL -13, plays a key role in the 
disease process ( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Consistent with the implication of type-2 inflammation 
underlying the disease process in these CRS patients, asthma is a common comorbid condition for 
both CRSsNP and CRSwNP patients, 20 % to 40% in the for mer and 50 % to 60% in the latter ( 4, 
11) and about 52% of CRSsNP patients h ave comorbid allergic rhinitis ( 4). Clinical features more 
commonly reported in CRSsNP patients with type-2 endotype in clude loss  of sense of 
smell /reduced taste ( 5). Comorbid asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia have been associated 
with higher risk of need for recurrent sinonasal surgery ( 12, 13).  
Standard  medical therapies, including topical and oral corticosteroids  (OCS) , and antibiotics, do 
not provide adequate or lasting control of the symptoms in many patients with CRSsNP. In a 
study of CRSsNP,  45% of patients “failed” medical therapy, defined as persistent symptoms and 
31% remained symptomatic enough to elect to pursue surgery (14). In the GA2LEN  study, 70% to 
80% of patients d id not have  lasting benefits from the medical therapies (including OCS ,

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 14 antibiotics , and intranasal corticosteroids [INCS ]) (11). Also , many CRSsNP patients have 
reported at least one prior surgery or are planning to have surgery in the near future for better 
control of symptoms (11). In patients who have undergone sinonasal surgery, comorbid asthma 
and peripheral blood eosinophilia are risk fac tors for recurrence of CRS post -operatively ( 12, 13), 
suggesting that type-2 CRSsNP patients may be more at risk for dise ase recurrence after surgery. 
Consequently, because of the chronic and unremitting nature of the condition in many patients, 
CRS is associated with a substantial socioeconomic burden that results from the costs of 
diagnostic tests, medical and surgical therapies,  lost and reduced school and work productivity, 
and a detrimental impact on physical and emotional health  (15).  
Dupilumab blockade of IL-4 and IL -13 signaling has demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety 
profile for the treatment of a variety of atopic disease states, including atopic dermatitis  (AD) 
(16), asthma  (17), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  (18), and CRSwNP  (19); diseases  where type-2 
inflammation is a key driver of the underlying disease process.  
This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab administered to 
type-2 CRSsNP patients who are inadequately controlled by or have int olerance/contraindication 
to INCS, systemic corticosteroids  (SCS ), and antibiotics or sinonasal surgery.  
This study consists of:  
A screening period of up to 4 weeks, followed by a randomized, double -blind,  
placebo -controlled, 2 -arm, parallel -group, 24 to 52 -week treatment period . The primary 
endpoint  will be assessed at Week 24. Participants who complete treatment will continue 
to a 12 -week post-treatment follow -up period.  
Note : Modification of the treatment period will result in all patients who complete the treatment  
period being  treated for a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks, or until the last 
patient randomized completes a minimum  treatment period of 24 weeks.

Overall design:  
This is a P hase 2 multicenter  study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab compared to 
placebo, in participants  with uncontrolled CRSsNP . This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled study in adult pa rticipants  regardless of screening eosinophil count to evaluate the 
treatment effect of dupilumab on sinus opacification as assessed by the Lund -Mackay (LMK ) 
sinus computed tomography ( CT) scan total score,  and to provide data on safety.   
All participants in the study  (adults only)  will enter a screening period (2 to 4  weeks), with 
a 24 to 52 -week treatment perio d, followed by post -treatment follow -up (12  weeks).  
Approximately 70 adult participants will be randomized 1:1 ( approximately 35 participants 
per arm) into 2  treatment groups as follows:  
- Arm A: Dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks ( q2w),  
- Arm B: Matching placebo .

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 16 Randomization will be stratified by screening blood eosinophil count ( ≥300 cells/mm3 or 
<300 cells/mm3), background INCS use (yes or no) and region.  
To ensure enrollment according to the intended distribution of screening blood eosinophil 
count, alerts will be built into the IRT to control the number of participants in each 
stratification group as follows:  
- ≥300 cells/ mm3: approximately 15 participants per arm , 
- <300 cells/ mm3: approximately 20 parti cipants per arm . 
In addition, in order to have an adequate number of participants with comorbid asthma, alerts will 
be built into the IRT to limit the number of participants without comorbid asthma to no more than 
70% of the randomized population .  
During the study, participants who report deterioration requiring medical/surgical intervention 
may come to the site for clinical evaluation. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose 
and, if necessary, the Investigator may consider one of the treatment alternatives described in 
Section  6. 
Disclosure S tatement :  
This is an interventional study with 2 study treatment arms and the study treatment assignment is 
blinded to the Participant and Investigator.   
Number of participants:  
Approximately 35 participants will be enrolled to each study intervention arm for an estimated 
total of study enrollment of approximately  70 participants.  
Note:  "Enrolled" means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative’s, agreement to 
participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process  and is 
randomized into the study at V isit 2. Potential participants who are s creened for the purpose of 
determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered 
enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 18 • Primary endpoint : 
In the primary analysis approach for the primary endpoint , for participants who undergo 
sinonasal surgery for CRSsNP  or take SCS for any reason , data collected after surgery or 
initiation of SCS will be  set to missing and the worst post -baseline value on or before the 
time of surgery or SCS will be used to impute missing Week 24 value (ie, worst 
observation carried forw ard [WOCF ] approach). For participants with no  post-baseline 
values, the baseline value will be used . Participants who discontinue the study intervention 
prematurely are encouraged to fo llow the planned clinical visits and, in these participants, 
who did not undergo surgery  or receive SCS , all data collected after study intervention 
discontinuation will be used in the analysis. No missing data will be imputed. Descriptive 
statistics and 9 5% CI  in the dupilumab group  will be provided.  
Main  secondary endpoints:  
The change from baseline to Week 24 in the secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
using the same analysis approach as for the primary endpoint . For endpoints comparing 
dupilum ab to placebo, 95% CI of the treatment difference will be provided  
The safety variables, including adverse events  (AEs), laboratory parameters, and vital 
signs, will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Data Monitoring Committee: Due to the extensive safety record of the post -marketed IMP 
(dupilumab), it is not planned to have a Data Monitoring Committee  for this study.

countries for which a specific approval procedure for the CT scan is required by a different committee than the IEC/IRB, these countries will be exempted from all the planned study CT scans until approval from 
these committees is received. A 4 -month  window must be required between 2 CT scans. It is recommended to avoid use of OCS as rescue therapy during the Week 20 to Week 24  or the Week 48 to Week 52 . If a 
participant  must use OCS during this period to control CRSsNP worsening/acute sinusitis  based on Investigator judgment the site should make every  effort  to schedule the Week 24th CT scan prior to OCS rescue 
therapy.  
l An electronic diary (ie, CRSsNP sinonasal symptom diary) is used for daily recording of nasal symptoms (from V1 to EOS ): 1) nasal congestion/obstruction 2)  anterior rhinorrhea (runny nose), 3) posterior 
rhinorrhea (post -nasal drip), 4) loss of sense of smell, 5) facial pain/pressure, and 6) headach e. This device is dispensed at V1, and information is downloaded from this device on the other indicated days. For 
sTSS (nasal congestion, anterior/posterior rhinorrhea, facial pain/pressure), a score of ≥5 at Visit 1 (day score) and at Visit 2 (weekly ave rage score ) is required.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 25 2 INTRODUCTION   
Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin 4 receptor alpha 
subunit (IL -4Rα), which is a component of IL -4 receptors type-1 and Type-2, as well as the IL -13 
Type-2 receptor. The binding of dupilumab to IL -4Rα resul ts in blockade of IL -4 and IL -13 
intracellular signaling.  
As a targeted/specific immunomodulatory agent, dupilumab is expected to selectively inhibit 
Type-2 inflammation and is designed to achieve the desired therapeutic effect without the side 
effects ty pically associated with the use of less selective immunosuppressants.  
Both IL -4 and IL -13 signaling pathways are implicated in atopic diseases ; and by blocking the 
activity of these cytokines, dupilumab has been shown to be an effective treatment for atopic 
conditions, including CRSwNP , AD, and asthma (eosinophilic pheno type) in adults.  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Dupilumab blockade of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling has demonstrated a favorable efficacy and an 
acceptable safety profile for the treatment of a variety of atopic disease states, including AD (16), 
asthma  (17), EoE ( 18), and CRSwNP  (19), where Type-2 inflammation is a key driver of the 
underlying disease process. Notably in the dupilumab CRSwNP clinical development program, 
two Phase 3 studies in adult participant s with  severe CRSwNP have demonstrated that dupilumab 
300 mg q2w is significantly better than placebo for the reduction of polyp size, sinus 
opacification, and severity of symptoms, and is generally well tolerated  (19). Similarly, in the 
dupilumab asthma Phase 3 study that included both adult and adolescent participants , dupilumab 
significantly reduced the adjusted annualized rate of severe asthma ex acerbations compared to 
placebo in pre -specified subgroups of participants with elevated blood eosinophil counts and high 
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO ) levels, both markers of Type-2 inflammation  (17). Of 
note, in the asthma Phase 3 study EFC13579 (QUEST), a subset of asthma patients with CRSsNP , 
treated , with dupilumab appear ed to have greater improvement in Sino-Nasal Outcome 
Test-22-item ( SNOT -22) from baseline to Week  24 compared with placebo -treated participants . 
Compared with placebo, dupilumab als o led to greater suppression of markers of Type-2 
inflammation, including FeNO, IgE, and thymus -and activation -regulated chemokine (TARC ) 
levels, in the subset of asthma  patients w ith CRSsNP in EFC13579 ( 20). The totality of the data 
from the completed AD, asthma , and CRSwNP clinical development programs indicates that 
dupilumab has broad therapeutic benefit in various conditions with strong Type-2 immunologic 
signatures.  
The key objective of this study will be to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety profile o f 
dupilumab administered to type-2 CRSsNP patients with difficult -to-treat disease.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of dupilumab is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB ).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 26 2.2 BACKGROUND   
Chronic rhinosinusitis  is an inflammatory disease of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses 
characterized by 2 or more symptoms  (lasting for ≥12 weeks),  one of which is nasal obstruction or 
nasal discharge (anterior and/or posterior) and may also include facial pressure/pain and/or 
reduced sense of smell. It is estimated to affect approximately 10% of the population in the US 
and Europe ( 1, 2); based on real -world data a large majority of CRSsNP patients are adults 
(≥18  years old). However, lower estimates for symptomatic patients are reported; in the US , the 
percentage of the population that met the initial symptom criteria compatible with a diagnosis of 
CRS was reported at 2.1% ( 21). Chronic rhinosinusitis phenotypically is broadly divided into 2 
types based on the presence or absence of nasal polyps: CRSwNP and CRSsNP  (3). Chronic 
rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis is the most common type of CRS, accounting for 
approximately two -thirds of the  overall CRS population ( 3, 4). 
While the underlying etiopathogenesis of CRSsNP is likely multifactorial, there is a subset of 
CRSsNP patients, representing nearly one -third of the overall CRSsNP population, where the  
disease process appears to be predominantly driven by type-2 inflammation. In this subset of 
type-2 CRSsNP patients, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of surgical sinonasal tissues 
reveal elevated levels of Type-2 inflammatory markers, such as IL -5, IgE, ECP, CLC , etc ( 5, 6, 
7). The Type-2-associated molecular signature identified in these Type-2 CRSsNP patients 
suggest that the underlying pathophysiological disease  process is similar to that found in 
CRSwNP patients , where it is well known that Type-2 inﬂammation with prominent eosinophilia 
and elevated levels of Type-2 cytokines, such as IL -4, IL -5, and IL -13, plays a key role in the 
disease process ( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).  
Several reports su ggest peripheral blood eosinophilia is w ell correlated with tissue Type-2 
inflammation ( sinus tissue eosinophilia) in CRS patients with or without nasal polyps ( 22, 23, 24, 
25, 26). In one cohort, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analys is predicted  high tissue 
eosinophilia  from ethmoid sinus biopsies  (>10/ high power field  [HPF] ) using a peripheral blood 
eosinophil cutoff level of 240 cells/ mm3 (sensitivity 70.9%, speciﬁcity 78.4%, AUC: 0.792, 
p<0.01). This cutoff level produced a positiv e predictive value (PPV) of 83.0%, negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 64.5%, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 3.28 ( 24). Similarly, in 
anoth er cohort, a cutoff value of 215  cells/ mm3 for the absolute blood eosinophil count yielded a 
sensitivity of 74.2% and a specificity of 86.5%, PPV of 80.3% and NPV of 81.9%, LR+ of 5.51  
(25). Generally, a higher cutoff for peripheral blood eosinophil count is associated with greater 
specificity, but correspondingly lesser se nsitivity, for identifying Type-2 inflammation 
(eosinophilia) in sinus tissue.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 27 Consistent with the implication of type-2 inflammation underlying the disease process in these 
CRS patients, asthma is a common comorbid condition for both CRSsNP and CRSwNP patients: 
20% to 40% in the former and 50 % to 60% in the latter ( 4, 11), and abo ut 52% of CRSsNP 
patients are reported to have comorbid allergic rhinitis ( 4). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide has 
been reported to be significantly correlated with other markers of type-2 inflammation, including 
elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts and tis sue eosinophilia, which also correlates with 
LMK scores in patients with CRS ( 27). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide  has been noted to be 
elevat ed in CRSwNP patients with tissue eosinophilia independent of a diagnosis of asthma ( 27). 
Further peripheral blood eosinophilia, ≥300 cells/ mm3 (sensitivity 70%, speciﬁcity 70%), has 
been reported as a predictor of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in CRSsNP patients without a 
diagnosis of asthma ( 22). Co morbid asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia have been 
associated with  a higher risk of need for recurrent sinonasal surgery and need for systemic therapy 
after sinus surgery  (12, 13, 28). Other clinical features more commonly reported in CRSsNP 
patients with type-2 endotype include  loss of sense of smell /reduced taste; the type-2 CRSsNP 
patients also have more complaints of headache/migraine as compared  with the non -type-2 
CRSsNP patients  (5). 
The pathological hallmark of CRSsNP -associated upper airway disease is mucus secretion and 
goblet cell and glandular hyperplasia. Goblet cells are responsible for the production of mucin 
5AC, one of the main secreted mucins in the human airway ( 29). The increase in mucous gland 
density that occurs in patients  with severe CRSsNP is in contrast to those with CRSwNP who 
show a signiﬁcant decrease in mucous gland density ( 30, 31, 32, 33). Glandular hypertrophy and 
mucous secretion in the airway mucosa are  likely to be mediated by various cytokines, including 
IL-13 (34, 35, 36). 
Standard medical therapies, including topical and oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics, do not  
provide adequate or lasting control of the symptoms in many patients with CRSsNP. In a study, 
45% of patients “failed” medical therapy, defined as persistent symptoms ; and 31% remained 
symptomatic enough to elect to pursue surgery ( 14). In the GA²LEN study, 70% to 80% of 
patients do not  sustain  adequate benefits from the medical therapies (including OCS, antibiotics 
and INCS) ( 11). Also , many CRSsNP patients have reported at least 1 prior surgery or are 
planning to have surgery in the near future for better control of symptoms ( 11). In patients who 
have undergone sinonasal surgery, comorbid asthma and peripheral blood eosinophilia are risk 
factors for the recurrence of CR S post -operatively ( 12, 13), suggesting that CRSsNP patients with 
type-2 inflammation  (as indicated by increased peripheral blood eosinophilia and comorbid 
asthma)  may be more at risk for disease recurrence after s urgery. Consequently, because of the 
chronic and unremitting nature  of the condition in many patients, CRS is associated with 
substantial socioeconomic burden that results from the costs of diagnostic tests, medical and 
surgical therapies, lost and reduced  school and work productivity, and detrimental impact on 
physical and emotional health ( 15). Therefore, a high unmet medical need for efficaci ous therapy 
remains for CRSsNP patients who are inadequately treated by currently available treatment 
options, and dupilumab may become a novel effective treatment option for CRSsNP patients with 
peripheral blood eosinophil ia (a marker of type -2 inflammati on) who are inadequately controlled 
with available therapies.

COVID -19 Benefit -risk assessment  
Dupilumab has shown clinical benefit in several type -2 driv en immunological disorders, such as 
AD, asthma, and CRSwNP.  
To date, more than 8000 participants have been treated with dupilumab during the clinical 
development program in several indications, of which AD, asthma, and CRSwNP are licensed in 
some countries .  
Currently, there are in sufficient data in participants with Coronavirus Disease -2019 (COVID -19) 
who are being treated with dupilumab. Thus , the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in COVID -19 
patients are unknown. During the course of the clinical trial program, respiratory infections 
including viral infections were monitored and these events are not listed as adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) with dupilumab  
The target population of EFC16723 is patients with uncontrolled, CRSsNP who have evidence of 
type-2 inflammation. These patients  have failed medical therapies and/or surgical intervention and 
have active disease that causes significant impairmen t in function and quality of life. Therefore, 
these patients have a high unmet medical need for novel effective treatment. Participation in 
EFC16723 will provide an opportunity for these patients to be treated with a novel therapy that 
has proven efficacy in certain other disease states (i e, AD, asthma, and CRSwNP) where type-2 
inflammation is the underlying driver of the disease process.  
Based on the aforementioned potential benefits to patients participating in EFC16723, the 
Sponsor’s assessment is that t he benefit -risk remains favorable for patients to participate in this 
trial.  
The Sponsor also recognizes that the  COVID -19 pandemic may have an impact on the conduct of 
clinical trials. The Sponsor will monitor the situation closely and ensure the integri ty of the trial 
conduct and data  (see Section  8).  
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably 
expected AEs of dupilumab is available in the IB . 
2.3.1  Risk assessment   
No tissue targets or specific hazards to humans were identified in nonclinical general and 
reproductive toxicology studies.  
Dupilumab has an extensive safety database. As of 28 March 2020 , 10 191 participants were 
enrolled into the development program for dupilumab and include d in the safety population: 382 
as healthy volunteers, 4 405 from AD studies, 3614  from asthma studies, 782 from CRSwNP 
studies, 232 from EoE studies, 103 from the grass allergy  study , 145  from peanut allergy studies, 
511 from the chronic obstructive pulmon ary disease (COPD ) study , 5 from prurigo nodularis ( PN) 
studies, and 12 from the chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU ) study . The number of participants

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 29 exposed to dupilumab in clinical studies was 8720  (356 in healthy volunteer studies, 40 52 in AD 
studies, 3 263 in asthma studies, 470 in CRSwNP studies, 166 in EoE s tudies, 52 in the grass 
allergy  study , 96 in  peanut allergy studies, 256 in the COPD stud y, 3 in PN studies, and 6 in the 
CSU  study. For the latest information, please refer to the current IB.  
Based on the information retrieved from Intercontinental Marketing Services Health and using the 
World Health Organization’s defined daily dose for dupilumab of 21.4 mg/day, the cumulative 
post marketing exposure to dupilumab is estimated to be 161 582 patient -years (01  January  2017 
through 31 March  2020 ).  
Dupilumab was generally well tolerated in all populations tested in clinical development programs 
consistent with a favorable benefit/risk profile. The adverse drug reactions ( ADR ) identified to 
date for dupilumab include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis (including allergic and 
bacterial), oral herpes, herpes simplex, blepharitis, keratitis, dry eye, eye pruritus , eosinophilia, 
serum sickness , anaphylactic reaction, a ngioedema, and arthralgia . These ADRs were generally 
mild or moderate, transient, and manageable. These ADRs were not observed consistently in all 
indications (see IB for greater details). More significant serious allergic reactions were very rare. 
Importa ntly, no increased overall infection risk was observed in patients treated with dupilumab.   
Systemic hypersensitivity is established as an important identified risk with dupilumab. As protein 
therapeutics, all monoclonal antibodies are potentially immunoge nic. Rare serious and systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the dupilumab program including serum 
sickness/serum sickness -like reaction in the adult AD program and anaphylaxis related to 
dupilumab in the adult asthma clinical trials.  
The important potential risk for dupilumab is “eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms in 
asthma patients .” The observed increase in eosinophil count is transient, which is consistent with 
the current understanding of the mechanism of action of dupilu mab. In dupilumab asthma studies, 
a small number of patients with asthma experienced serious systemic eosinophilia presenting with 
clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, cond itions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid 
therapy. These events have been seen in other drug development programs for severe asthma and 
usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy 
sugges ting possible unmasking of these conditions with tapering of corticosteroids during 
dupilumab therapy. The association of dupilumab treatment and these events has not been 
established. Health care providers should be alert to eosinophilia associated with v asculitic rash, 
worsening of pulmonary symptoms, pulmonary infiltrate, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy presenting in their patients, especially upon reduction of SCS. 
Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clin ical studies ; 
therefore , it is not known if dupilumab will influence the immune response against helminth 
infections. Consequently, patients with pre -existing helminth infections should be treated for their 
helminth infection before initiating therapy with  dupilumab.  
The common ADR across all indications is injection site reactions. Other potential risks based on 
the safety profile in particular indications are discussed in the IB.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 30 While long -term data are still accumulating, data from randomized, placebo -controlled trials and 
open -label extension studies to date have not identified any new safety concern in these 
populations. It is anticipated that dupilumab in patients with type-2 CRSsNP will have a favorable 
safety profile as observed across other type-2 driven immunological disorders.  
2.3.2  Benefit assessment   
Dupixent® (dupilumab) is authorized for marketing in over 60 countries worldwide including the 
US, European Union (EU ) (Centralized Procedure), Japan, Canada , and Australia for the adult AD 
indication. Dupilumab is also authorized in the US, EU, and other jurisdictions for the adolescent 
AD indication , in the US for children  6 to 12 years old with AD , and in the US, EU, Japan , and 
other jurisdictions for the adult and adolescent asthma indication. Dupilumab also has approval 
for its CRSwNP indication in the US, EU, and Japan.  For the latest information, please refer to the 
current IB.  
There are no treatments specifically approved for CRSsNP in the US. Standard medical therapies,  
such as those based on EPOS 2020 guidelines, which include topical and oral corticosteroids, and 
antibiotics, do not provide adequate or lasting contr ol of the symptoms in many patients with 
CRSsNP. A high unmet medical need exists for therapies that target  underlying  inflammatory 
processes in type-2 CRSsNP patients who are inadequately treated by  the current standard of care .  
Considering this unmet me dical need and the known mechanism of action of dupilumab, the  
Sponsor is proposing to develop dupi lumab for the treatment of type-2 CRSsNP for the following  
reasons:  
1. There is a subset of CRSsNP patients with an underlying pathophysiology that is driven  
primarily by Type-2 inflammatory processes and is characterized by increased type-2 
biomarkers such as blood eosinophils, type-2 comorbidities or recurrence after  surgery. 
Dupilumab has demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles across a  broad ran ge of 
diseases including AD, asthma, and CRSwNP where type-2 inflammation is a key driver 
of the underlying disease process.  
2. Dupilumab has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing sinus opacification,  severity 
of CRS symptoms and nasal polyp burden in  CRSwNP, a disease that shares  several 
clinical and molecular features wi th CRSsNP with evidence of Type-2 inflammation.  
3. A post -hoc analysis of the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study demonstrated that  
dupilumab treatment improved sinonasal symptoms and health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL ), as assessed by  SNOT -22, in patients with CRS (20) and suppressed airway  
(FeNO) and systemic (total IgE, TARC) type-2 inflammatory biomarkers versus  placebo 
(20). Furthermore,  clinically meaningful improvement from baseline in SNOT -22 was 
observed primarily in patients who had peripheral blood eosinophil counts 
≥300  cells/ mm3.

The primary efficacy assessment  of change from baseline in the LMK  CT scan score  at Week  24 
in the dupilumab group , will provide objective imaging -based measurement of benefit of CRSsNP 
patients. The LMK and a related total symptom score (TSS ), as secondary endpoint  with 
dupilumab group compar ison to placebo , are 2 of the key assessments  that ha ve been successfully 
implemented and  have  provided clinically meaningful evidence of therapeutic benefit  of 
dupilumab treatment after 24 weeks in the completed clinical development program of dupilumab 
in CRSwNP ( 19). The sTSS in this trial is a total score composed of three common, cardinal 
symptoms of CRSsNP, including nasal congestion, rhin orrhea (anterior/posterior), and facial 
pain/pressure  that are daily assessed by the participant . This score  will provide a  comprehensive 
clinical assessment  of the impact of dupilumab on the key symptoms of CRSsNP , and will 
complement the objective assessment provided by the well -validated LMK score.  Other 
supportive assessments , including individual scores  for the main symptoms in CRSsNP 
(NC/obstruction , loss of sense of smell , facial pain/pressure , and rhinorrhea ) and visual analog 
scale (VAS ) for rhinosinusitis severity  will also be assessed . The SNOT -22 will also be collected 
to provide additional evidence of therapeutic benefit.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 35 4 STUDY DESIGN   
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN   
This is a Phase 2 multicenter  study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab , in 
participants  with uncontrolled CRSsNP. This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
study in adult p articipants  regardless of screening eosinophil count to evaluate the treatment effect 
of dupilumab on sinus opacification as assessed by the LMK sinus CT scan total score and to 
provide data on safety.  
All participants (adults only)  will enter a screening period (2 to 4 weeks), with a 24 to 
52-week treatment period, followed by post -treatment follow -up (12 weeks).  
Approximately 70 adult participants will be randomized 1:1 ( approximately 35 participants 
per arm) into 2  treatment groups as follows:  
- Arm A: Dupilumab 300 mg q2w , 
- Arm B: Match ing p lacebo . 
Randomization will be stratified by screening blood eosinophil count ( ≥300 cells/mm3 or 
<300 cells/mm3), background INCS use (yes or no) and region.  
To ensure enrollment according to the intended distribution of screening blood eosinophil 
count, alerts will be built into the IRT to control the number of participants in each 
stratification gro up as follows:  
- ≥300 cells/ mm3: approximately 15 participants per arm , 
- <300 cells/ mm3: approximately 20 participants per arm . 
Note: The treatment will stop for all participants when the LPI has completed 24 weeks of 
treatment. Therefore, all participants fo llowing Amendment 02 will be treated for at least 
24  weeks and the other participants (enrolled before Amendment 02) will have variable treatment 
period and may continue up to 52 weeks.  
In addition, in order to have an adequate number of participants with  comorbid asthma, alerts will 
be built into the IRT to limit the number of participants without comorbid asthma to  no more than  
70% of the randomized population.  
During the study , participants who report deterioration requiring medical/surgical interventio n 
may come to the site for clinical evaluation. An unscheduled vis it may be used for this purpose  
and, if necessary, the Investigator may consider one of the treatment alternatives described in 
Section  6. 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  FOR STUDY DESIGN   
EFC16723 is designed as a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, study to minimize bias 
in data collection and interpretation. The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the 
objectives of this study since it will provide the most robust assess ment of the efficacy and safety

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 36 of dupilumab. The study has a 24 to 52 -week study treatment period to provide initial evidence 
related to the treatment effect of dupilumab in patients with Type-2 inflammation (as indicated by 
perip heral blood eosinophil c ounts ≥ 300 cells/ mm3) CRSsNP  and to provide safety information .  
In addition, a post -hoc analysis to assess the efficacy of dupilumab on upper airway symptoms as 
measured by SNOT -22 in the subset of asthma patients with CRS from the dupilumab Phase 3 
asthm a study EFC13579 (QUEST) was performed. Clinically meaningful improvement from 
baseline in SNOT -22 was observed only in patients who had peripheral blood eosinophil counts 
≥300 cells/ mm3 and not in those with <300 cells/ mm3. In the study, to further evalua te the 
predictive value of baseline peripheral blood eosinophil counts as a potential marker of treatment 
response to dupilumab, a subset of participants  with blood eosinophil counts of <300 cells/mm3 
will be randomized while the primary analysis population will remain as participant s who have 
peripheral blood eosinophil counts ≥300 cells/mm3. 
The 24-week treatment duration should be sufficient for the demonstration of the efficacy with 
dupilumab based on the efficacy results seen in CRSwNP. This duration is also sufficient for 
safety assessment given the extensive safety experience with dupilumab including in the related 
condition of CRSwNP.  
Rescue medications and/or surgery for CRSsNP deemed nece ssary  by Investigators will be 
allowed , which mirror the expected future therapeutic paradigm of dupilumab in this population in 
clinical practice.  
The primary efficacy assessment will be change from baseline in the LMK at Week 24  in the 
dupilumab group . Other supportive assessments, including sTSS scores for the main symptoms in 
CRSsNP (nasal congestion  [NC]/obstruction, loss of sense of smell, rhinorrhea, facial 
pain/pressure), VAS for rhinosinusitis severity, a nd SNOT -22 will also be collected, to provide 
additional evidence of therapeutic benefit.  
Changes in the LMK and sTSS , as secondary endpoint,  will provide both objective imaging 
measure of benefit and evidence of symptomatic improvement in the cardinal cli nical 
manifestations  of CRSsNP patients, respectively other secondary and exploratory measures, 
including individual scores for the main  symptoms in CRSsNP, VAS for rhinosinusitis severity, 
and SNOT -22, that assess other disease manifestations of CRSsNP and the associated impact on 
the quality of life in pa rticipants .

Participants were not involved in the design of the clinical trial.  
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE   
Based on  the known pharmacokinetics ( PK), safety , and efficacy of dupilumab, the selected 
dosing regimen for EFC16723 study is dupilumab 300 mg q2w.  
This dose regimen  is expected to achieve concentrations in serum that saturate the target -mediated 
clearance pathway and has demonstrated  similar efficacy in adult patients with asthma and AD, 
VV-CLIN-0598090 2.0

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 37 and in adults with CRSwNP. The PK of dupilumab have been found to be consistent across 
populations of patients with AD, asthma, and CRSwNP, as well as healthy volunteers. 
Furthermore, the sources of variability of dupilumab PK identified in each population and the 
magnitude of the covariate effects indicate that body weight is the most influential factor, whereas 
other covariates i dentified as being statistically significant have no meaningful impact on 
dupilumab PK. Overall , it is expected that the PK of dupilumab is similar in healthy adults an d 
participants with a range of type-2 diseases, with body weight being the most influent ial covariate 
affecting exposure. The immunogenicity of dupilumab is also comparable in these populations 
(see approved D upixent prescribing information).  
The 300 mg q2w dose regimen has been proven to be effective with an acceptable safety profile in 
patients with moderate -to-severe AD, moderate -to-severe asthma, and CRSwNP. The 300  mg 
q2w without a loading dose has been demonstrated to be efficacious for adult pa rticipants with 
severe CRSwNP, where differential treatment responses between dupilumab - and placebo -treated 
patents were observed as early as after 4 weeks of study treatment. Consistent with the observed 
PK and pharmacodynamic (PD ) profile of nasal polyp score (NPS ) response (gradual 
development of response during the treatment period as well as slow offset of response during 
off-treatment period) in patients with CRSwNP, PK/PD simulation of the co-primary endpoints of 
NPS and NC showed minimal difference in the development of treatment effect and steady -state 
response of NPS and NC in the presence and absence of the loading dose of 600 mg on Day  1 in 
patients with CRSwNP. Therefore, no loading dose is included in the present study for CRSsNP 
adult participants . 
The collective PK/PD, clinical efficacy , and safety data of dupilumab across diverse disease 
populations suggest that the selected dose regimens for EFC16723 will be efficacious and safe for 
the treatment of adult CRSsNP patients.

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS   
No restrictions.  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES   
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomly assigned to study intervention/entered in the study. A minimal set of 
screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and 
to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information inclu des demography, 
screen failure reasons, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE ). 
In the case of technical malfunction of equipment, the participants may be rescreened.  
Individuals who d o not meet the inclusion criteria  or fail the exclusion criteria  may be rescreened 
once  as per Investigator decision . Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant 
number versus the one received for the initial Screening Visit (Visit 1).  
There  is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen failure date  and the rescreening 
date. The interactive response technology  (IRT ) report will flag rescreened participants. 
Participa nts that are rescreened must sign a new consent form . 
If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility criteria at the screening period , these 
laboratory assessments may be repeate d at the discretion of the Investigator, if it is judged to b e 
likely to return to the acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening window prior to 
Day 1. A baseline CT scan  must be repeated for  these  rescreen ed participants if the previous 
CT scan done between Visit 1 and Visit 2 is more than 31 days in the past (28 days+3  days). If, 
the rescreening cannot be done within 31  days (28  days + 3 days), then these rescreened 
participant s must wait for 4 months to repeat CT scan to prevent over exposure to CT  radiation . 
All other screening procedures must be  repeated for rescreening.

Investigational medicinal product(s)  
The IMP is administered every 14  ± 3 days (q2w)  during the treatment period (with the last IMP 
administration at Week 22-50). 
During study visits, t he IMP is administered on sites after all procedures. For the doses that are 
not scheduled to be given at the study site, home administration of IMP is allowed after 
appropriate training of the participant or caregiver ). Investigator or delegate will prepare and 
inject the first dose of IMP at Visit 2, in front of the part icipant (or caregiver). The participant (or 
caregiver) will prepare and inject the IMP under the supervision of the Investigator or delegate at 
Visit 3. The training must be documented in the participant’s study file. In case of emergency (eg, 
natural disa ster, pandemic, etc) different training ways (eg , training remotely with instruction 
provided by phone, etc) can be performed (and will be documented in the participant’s study file).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 46 If the participant (or caregiver) is unable or unwilling to prepare and  inject IMP, injections can be 
performed at the study site by way of unscheduled visits; or arrangements can be made for 
qualified site personnel and/or health care professionals (eg, visiting nurse service) to administer 
IMP at participant’s home.  
In case  of emergency (eg , natural disaster, pandemic, etc), IMP may be supplied from the site to 
the participant via a Sponsor -approved courier company where allowed by local regulations and 
approved by the participant.  When the participant has a study visit, the  IMP will be administered 
after clinical procedures and blood collection  are performed . Participants should be monitored for 
at least 30 minutes  following injection . The monitoring period may be extended as per 
country -specific or local site -specific requi rements.  
The participant/parent/legally authorized representative/caregiver should be trained by the site 
staff to recognize potential signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction in order to 
self-monitor/monitor at home for at least 30 minutes (or long er per country -specific or local 
site-specific requirements) following injection. In case of hypersensitivity symptoms , the 
participant  should contact healthcare provider/emergency.  
Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of  the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or the upper arms, so that the same site is not 
injected between two q2w injections. Injections in the upper arms could be done only by a trained 
person (caregiver trained by Investigator or delegate) or health care professional but not the 
participants themselves.  
For doses not given at the study site, paper diaries will be provided to the pa rticipant  to record 
information related to the home injections . The paper diary will be kept as source  data in the 
participant’s study file.  
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING /STORAGE/ACCOUNTABIL ITY  
6.2.1  Storage and Handling   
1. The Investigator  or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study intervention.  
2. Only participants  enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site 
staff may supply or administer study intervention. A t site, a ll study intervention must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) ar ea in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator  and 
authorized site staff.  
3. The Investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountab ility, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 47 6.2.2  Responsibilities   
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP  (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor . 
Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure (see Section  8.3.7 ). 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to the initiation of a recall procedure by 
the Sponsor . In this case, the Investigator  will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor  in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator  supply IMP to a third party (except for direct mail to 
participant shipmen t, for which a courier company has been approved by the Sponsor ), allow the 
IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of the IMP in any 
other manner.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE  BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING   
The randomized intervention kit number list is generated centrally by Sanofi , and IMPs are 
packaged in accordance with this list. The randomization and intervention allocatio n are 
performed centrally by IRT. The IRT generates the participant randomization list and allocates the 
intervention number and the corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it. 
Before the study is initiated , the log -in information and directions f or the IRT will be provided to 
each site.  
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio treatment arm described in Table  2.  
Randomization will be stratified by screening blood eosinophil count ( ≥300 cells/mm3 or 
<300  cells/mm3), background INCS use (yes or no) and region.  
At Screening (Visit 1 ), the Investigator  or designee will contact the  IRT to receive the participant 
number. If a pa rticipant  who had previously failed  screening is approached for re -screening, a new 
ICF must be signed. In such case, a new participant  number will be assigned by I RT.  
A randomized participant is defined as a participant who has been allocated to a randomized 
intervention regardless of whether the treatment was administered or not (ie , participant registered 
by the I RT). A participant cannot be randomized more than once in the study.  
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in  the SoA (Section  1.3). 
Returned study intervention should not be re -dispensed to the participants.

Dupilumab 300 mg and placebo 300 mg will be provided in identically matched 2  mL pre -filled 
syringes that a re visually indistinguishable for each dose. Syringes and box will be labeled with a 
treatment kit number.  
Code breaking  
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole res ponsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s intervention 
assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such 
a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, he/she ma y, at his/her 
discretion, contact the Sponsor to discuss the situation prior to unblinding a participant’s 
intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a 
participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be notified within 24 hours 
after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the 
source documentation and eCRF , as applicable.  
If the code is broken at the site level, the participant must withdraw permanently  from IMP 
administration.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE   
• The Investigator or his/her delegate must ensure that IMP is administered to each 
participant according to the labeling instructions.  
• IMPs accountability:  
- Intervention units are returned by the participant at each visit. In case of direct mail to 
participant  process, the intervention units can be returned by the carrier (if defined in 
the contract) , 
- The Investigato r or his/her delegate counts the number of remaining kits/pre -filled 
syringes and fills in the Intervention Log Form , 
- The Investigator or his/her delegate records the dosing information on the appropriate 
pages of the  eCRF , 
- The monitor in charge of the study then checks the eCRF data by comparing them with 
the IMP that he/she has retrieved , and the intervention log forms . 
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the 
Investigator or designee, under medical s upervision. The date and time of each dose administered 
in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF. The dose of 
study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a 
member  of the study site staff other than the person adminis tering the study intervention.  
When participants self -administer study intervention(s) at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by checking  participant  
home -dosing diary and used/unused kits/pre -filled syringes  during the site visits and documented

recorded in the eCR F. 
Detailed instructions for transport, storage, preparation, and administration of IMP are provided to 
the p articipant . For doses not given at the study site , participants will complete a dosing diary to 
document compliance with self -injection (or caregiver) of IMP, location of injec tion, and any 
symptoms. The diary will be kept as source data in the participant’s  study file . 
A record of the number of kits/pre -filled syringes  dispensed to and taken by each participant must 
be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compl iance records. Relevant data from 
the dosing diary will be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY   
Any medication or vaccine (including over the counter  or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or 
herbal supplements or other specific categories of interest) that the participant is receiving at the 
time of enrollment or receives during the study must be recorded along with:  
• Reason for use.  
• Dates of administration including start and end dates.  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency.  
The Sponsor or Sponsor representative(s)  should be contacted if there are any questions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapy.  
6.5.1  Background treatments   
Participants should continue their  permitted  background INCS spray during the study, if they were 
on stable dose of INCS ( except for Xhance™) for at least 4 weeks prior to screening. From t he 
time of screening, they should not change their background medications.  
Permitted concomitant medication  
The following treatments are allowed:  
• Intranasal corticosteroid spray (except for Xhance™) is permitted as background 
medication that it should be on the stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to study screening, 
and participants must maintain the same INCS throughout the study treatment period if 
initiated before enrollment.  
• Single dose of topical decongestants administration, for example, oxymetazo line 
hydrochloride (to reduce the swelling and widen the path for the endoscope) as well as a 
topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine) are allowed before nasal brushing or before endoscopy.  
• Administration of short courses antibiotics for a concurrent infection o r CRS sNP 
worsening /acute sinusitis , is allowed during the study (reason for and duration of 
treatment should be documented in the eCRF) (see Section  6.5.3).

• Inhaled corticosteroids.  
• Systemic antihistamines.  
• Leukotriene antago nists/modifiers are only permitted during the study, for participants 
who have been on a continuous treatment for ≥30 days prior to Visit 1.  
• Allergen immunotherapy in place for ≥3 months and dose stable for 1 month prior to 
Visit  1 is permitted.  
• Short cour ses of SCS to treat other serious co -existing diseases (such as asthma 
exacerbation) or for AEs are allowed (see Section  6.5.3 ). 
Other concomitant medication may be considered on a case -by-case basis by the Investigator in 
consultation with the Sponsor or Sponsor representative(s) if required.  
6.5.2  Prohibited medications   
The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during the screening period and the 
randomized treatment period:  
• Any systemic immunosuppressive treatment, such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, 
mycophenolate, tacrolimus, etc . 
• Initiation of allergen immunotherapy . 
• Intranasal corticosteroid drops; intranasal steroid emitting devices/stents; nasal spray using 
Exhalation Delivery System such as Xhance ™.  
• All forms of SCS are prohibited during screening and study treatment period except  for

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 51 • Systemic antibiotics (up to 2 weeks ) in case of acute infection . 
• Short course OCS (prednisone  or equivalent prednisolone  up to 14 days; avoid use 
4 weeks before W eek 24 or W eek 52, where applicable ). 
• Sinonasal surgery for CRSsNP (8 weeks of IMP treatment is recommended prior to 
surgery to allow onset of treatment effect).  
• Intranasal corticosteroids spray (initiation of INCS  spray or change in dosing of a 
background INCS during the study period ). 
Participants receiving rescue treatment other than surgery during the study should continue on 
study drug unless the Investigator decides to withdraw the study treatment. Before star ting 
treatment with OCS participants  should come to the study site for the clinical assessments.  It is 
recommend ed to avoid use of OCS as rescue  therapy  during the Week 20 to Week 24  or the Week 
48 to Week 52 . If a participant  must use OCS during th is period to control worsening of 
symptoms based on Investigator judgment the site should make every  efforts to schedule the 
Week 24 CT scan or the Week 52 CT scan prior to OCS rescue therapy .  
For participants  who undergo or are planned for surgery for CRSs NP the Investigator may decide 
to continue IMP up  to the time of surgery or end of treatment (EOT ) whichever date comes first. 
At the time of surgery participants  will be permanently discontinued from study treatment and 
assessed as soon as possible using the procedures normally planned for the EOT  Visit . In any case 
participants  who prematurely discontinued the treatment will be encouraged to return to the study 
site for the efficacy and safety assessments planned at EOT Visit and for additional visits.  
Additional appropriate medical/therapy per local guideline or per Investigators decision may be 
considered  to use as rescue medicine. The date and time of rescue me dication administration as 
well as the name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication must be recorded in the eCRF.  
6.6 DOSE MODIFICATION   
No IMP dose modification is allowed.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/ WITHDRAWAL   
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION   
7.1.1  Definitive  discontinuation   
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will remain in the 
study to be evaluated for safety  and efficacy . See the SoA ( Section  1.3) for data to be collected at 
the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow -up and for any further evaluations 
that need to be completed.   
The participants may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he or she decides to do so at any 
time for any reason, or based on the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reason(s) for study intervention discontinuation and recorded  in the eCRF . 
Participants must be permanently withdrawn from the study intervention for the following 
reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or oth er body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective participant to participate in the 
procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the I nvestigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
participant’s w ell-being.  
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• If the  participant is treated with the specific prohibited medications mentioned in  
Section  6.5. 
• If the  participant  misses 2 consecutive IMP doses.  
• In the event of a protocol devia tion, at the discretion of the I nvestigator or the Sponsor.  
• Any code broken at the requested of the I nvesti gator.  
• Pregnancy.  
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see  Section  10.9).  
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during the study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infections who se nature or course may suggest an 
immunocompromised status (see  Section  10.10 ).  
• Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) >3 ×upper limit of normal (ULN ) and t otal 
bilirubin >2  × ULN (see  Section  10.6).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 53 • Serum ALT >5 ×ULN if baseline ALT ≤2 ×ULN , or ALT >8 × ULN if baseline 
ALT  >2 × ULN (see  Section  10.6). 
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline 
in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF ] after enrollment), the Investigator or 
qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in 
participant management is needed. This review of the  electrocardiogram  (ECG ) printed at the time 
of collection must be documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an 
AE. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation within a reasonable timeframe as assessed by the Investigator before making a 
decision of definitive discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned participant.  
Handling of participants after definitive interven tion discontinuation  
If participants no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study.  
The Investigators should discuss with them key visits to attend. The value of all their study data 
collected during their continued involve ment will be emphasized as important to the public health 
value of the study.  
Participants who withdraw from the study intervention should be explicitly asked about the 
contribution of possible AEs to their decision, and any AE information elicited must be  
documented.  
Participants will be followed -up according to the study procedures specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whicheve r comes last.  
Participants who discontinue the study intervention prematurely (prior to completing the  treatment 
period) will perform, as soon as possible, the Early Termination V isit with all the assessments 
normally planned for the EOT Visit (refer to Section  8.1.1 ), to assure a complete clinical 
assessment in close temporal proximity to the premature termination of study intervention is 
available.  A CT scan can be done at time of Early Termination Visit if the previous CT scan is 
performed at least 4 months ago. Otherwise , the CT scan should be performed at the next 
scheduled timepoint (ie , Week 24) .  
In addition, and to allow assessment of participant outcomes over the stipulated study period, 
participa nts will be asked and encouraged to complete all r emaining study treatment visits  and 
participate in all assessments according to the visit schedule with a ±3 day s window. Under 
exceptional circumstances when a participant cannot come to the site for a sch eduled visit, a 
phone contact can be made. During the phone contact, at least information about AEs, 
concomitant medication , and the status of CRSsNP  should be collected.  
All cases of definitive intervention discontinuation must be recorded by the Investig ator in the 
appropriate pages of the eCRF when considered as confirmed.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 54 7.1.2  Temporary discontinuation   
Temporary intervention discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of 
suspected AEs. For all temporary intervention discontinuations, duration should be recorded by 
the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
Temporary interven tion discontinuation decided by the Investigator corresponds to at least 1 dose 
not administered to the participant. Following a temporary interruption or missed dose, the study 
intervention should be reinitiated at the next scheduled administration, maint aining the planned 
dose.  
If 2 consecutive IMP doses have been missed, the study intervention will be definitively 
discontinued (see  Section  7.1.1 ). Investigator must contact the pa rticipant to instruct not to take 
any subsequent injection.  
7.1.2.1  Rechallenge   
Reinitiation of intervention with the IMP wi ll be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator consider s this to be appropriate  according to his/her 
best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned 
event wa s unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to  Section  5). 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTIN UATION/ WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
• A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at h is/her own request  or if his/her 
caregiver(s ) or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator  for 
safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons.  This is expected to be 
uncommon.  
• At the time of discontinuing from the study,  if possible, an early follow -up/EOS V isit 
should be conducted, as shown in the SoA  (Section  1.3).  
• The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and 
from the study at that time.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for the disclosure of future informat ion, the Sponsor  
may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of a ny samples 
taken and not tested;  and the Investigator  must document this i n the site study records.  
• All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens of 
the eCRF and in the participant’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date 
of the withdrawal and the reason should be docu mented.  
• In addition, a participant may withdraw his/her consent to stop participating in the study. 
A participant’s decision to discontinue intervention should be distinguished from 
withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for 
non-participant contact follow -up, eg,  medical record checks. The site should document 
any case of withdrawal of consent.

7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP  
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible , counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and  ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator  or designee  must make 
every effort to r egain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documente d in the participant’s 
medical record.  
• If the participant continue s to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix 1

8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS   
8.1.1  Computerized Tomography Scans using Lund -Mackay   
Computerized tomography scans using the LMK  allows the assessment of sinus opacification 
(37).  
The CT scan LMK staging system represents the most widely established method of sinus CT 
scoring in clinical trials. The LMK total score is based on assessment of the CT scan findings for 
each sinus area (maxillary, anterior ethmoid, posterior ethmoid, sphenoid, and frontal sinus on 
each side). The extent of mucosal opacification is rated on a 3 -point scale ranging from 
0 = normal to 2 = total opacification. In addition, the ost iomeatal complex is graded as 
0 = not occluded  or 2 = occluded. The maximum score is therefore 12 per side for a maximum 
total score of 24, corresponding to the sum of all sinuses and the ostiomeatal u nit. 
This scoring system has been validated in several studies (37, 38, 39). 
The CT scans should be performed anytime during the screening period before first administration 
of IMP at Visit 2 (baseline CT data) , Visit 5 (Week 24). The Visit 7 (Week 52) CT scan is 
optional due to variable treatment period. Whenever possible a cone beam CT scan should be 
utilized. In countries for which a specific approval procedu re for the CT scan is required by a 
different committee than the local IEC /IRB , a 4-month window is required between 2 CT scans. If 
a participant needs to be rescreened or is terminated early from the study intervention , the 
repeated CT scan or following CT scan must be done over a 4-month  restriction window. If 
Participant who discontinue the study intervention prematurely, the CT sca n will be performed as 
soon as possible, with all other assessments normally planned in EOT Visit  as long as between  2 
CT scans can meet a 4-month  restriction window. Otherwise , the CT scan can be done in next 
scheduled visit.  
It is recommended to avoid us e of OCS as rescue therapy during the Week 20 to Week 24 or  the 
Week 48 to Week 52. If a participant  must use OCS during th is period to control CRSsNP 
worsening/acute sinusitis  based on Investigator judgment the site should make every  efforts to 
schedule the Week 24 CT scan or  the Week 52 CT scan  prior to OCS rescue therapy.  
The CT scan will be performed locally and reviewed centrally in a pre -specified manner as 
described in the Image Acquisition Standards (IAS) and Image Interpretati on Standards (IIS) 
(refer Section  1.3).

sense of smell , anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, facial pain/pressure and 
headache symptoms   
The CRSsNP sinonasal symptom diary is designed to assess the severity of CRS sinonasal 
symptoms on a daily basis. These symptoms include NC/obstruction, anterior rhinorrhea and 
posterior rhinorrhea, and facial pain/pressure , and loss of smell  (39). Each of the individual items 
of the diary are scored from 0 (“ No symptoms ”) to 3 (“ Severe symptoms – symptoms that are 
hard to tolerate, cause interference with activities or daily living ”). Higher scores on the items of 
the individual symptoms denote greater symptom severity.  
The CRSsNP sinus Total Symptom Score ( sTSS) is a composite score derived from the 
following  individual items : NC, anterior/posterior rhinorrhea, and facial pain/pressure . The total 
score ranges from 0 to 9 and consists of the sum of NC, the averaged rhinorrhea item scores , and 
facial pain/pressure scores . Higher scores on sTSS indicate greater overall symptom severity.  
The CRSsNP sinonasal symptom diary  also includes an i ndividual item about headache. 
Headache severity is scored on a scale ranging from 0 ( “No symptoms ”) to 3 ( “Severe symptoms 
– symptoms that are hard to tolerate, cause interference with activities or daily living ”). The score 
is not a part of sTSS.  
The CRS sNP sinonasal symptom diary  will be administered electronically. The e -diary is used for 
daily recording of participant’s answers to the questionnaires. This device will be dispensed at the 
Screening Visit (Visit 1), including instructions for use. Partici pants will be instructed on the use 
of the device. Recorded information will be downloaded from this device daily. At EOS Visit, the 
e-diary will be downloaded and returned to the site. On regular basis, the site staff should review 
on the vendor’s website  the information downloaded from participants’ e -diary. They should 
particularly check status of the disease as well as compliance to background/rescue therapy and 
overall e -diary compliance. The site should follow -up with the participant as appropriate.  
Participants will complete the CRSsNP sinonasal symptom diary as described in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
8.1.3  University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test  (UPSIT)   
The UPSIT is a rapid and easy -to-administer method  to quantitatively assess human olfactory 
function. The test consists of 4 booklets, each containing 10 odorants with one odorant per page. 
Above each odorant strip is a multiple -choice question with 4 alternative words to describe the 
odor that the partic ipant  is asked to indicate which word best describes the odor. The score ranges 
from 0 to 40, with 40 being the best possible score. Participant’s olfactory function can be 
classified based on their score s (40). The UPSIT will be procured  and used to match to each 
culture easing participants identifications of the odorant depending on degree of loss  of sense of 
smell . 
The c linician will adminis ter and score  the UPSIT as described in the SoA (Section  1.3).

The SNOT -22 is a PRO questionnaire designed to assess the impact of CRS  on participant s’ 
HRQoL (41). SNOT -22 has 22 items covering symptoms, social/emotional impact, productivity, 
and sleep consequences of CRS. The recall period is past 2 weeks. Each item is rated on a 6 -point 
Likert scale response option, ranging fr om 0 (‘No problem’) to 5 (‘Problem as bad as it can be’). 
A global score ranging from 0  to 110 is calculated by summing the responses to all items; higher 
score indicates greater rhinosinusitis -related health burden. The questionnaire is an easy, valid , 
and reliable tool (41). The minimally important difference that is the smallest change in SNOT -22 
score that can be detected by a pa rticipant  was found to be 8.9 points (41). 
The SNOT -22 is provided in Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8).  
Participants will complete the SNOT -22 as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.5  Three -dimensional volumetric measurement of the sinuses   
This method is used to calculate: (42) 
• The volume of the air (mL)  
• The volume of mucosa (mL)  
• % occupied by disease  
• Thickness of lateral wall  
For the analysis, central reading at baseline will be used for comparison with EOT reading. The 
sites will remove participant -identifying information from the imaging data header prior to 
sending the imaging data to the central reader. The % change in opacification from baseline to 
EOT will be calculated.  
8.1.6  Rhinosinusitis Severity Visual Analog Scale   
The rhinosinusitis  severity  VAS is used to evaluate the overall severity of the rhinosinusitis  (41). 
It is a recommended scale to determine the participant ’s disease severity and to guide the 
treatment for CRS. The pa rticipant  is asked to answer the following question: “How tro ublesome 
are your symptoms of your rhinosinusitis” on a 10 -cm VAS from 0 (‘not troublesome’) to 10 
(‘worst thinkable troublesome’). Based on their score on the VAS, the severity of rhinosinusitis 
can be divided into 3 categories as follows:  
• Mild = VAS 0 to 3  
• Moderate = VAS >3 to 7  
• Severe = VAS >7 to 10  
The rhinosinusitis  severity  VAS is provided in in Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8).  
Participants will complete the rhinosinusitis severity VAS as described in the SoA (Section  1.3).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 60 8.1.7  Asthma Control Questionnaire 6 -item version   
The asthma control questionnaire 6 -items (ACQ -6) was designed to measure both the adequacy of 
asthma control and  the change in asthma control  that occurs either spontaneously or as a result of 
treatment  (43). The ACQ -6 has 6  questions that assess the most common asthma symptoms: 1) 
Frequency in past week awoken by asthma during the night, 2) Severity of asthma symptoms in 
the morning, 3) Limitation of daily activities due to asthma, 4) Shortness of breath due to asthma, 
5) Frequency of whee zing, and 6)  Short -acting bronchodilator use.  
Participants are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to 
respond to the symptom questions on a 7 -point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum 
impairment). The questions are equ ally weighted ; and the ACQ -6 global score is the mean of the 
6 questions ranging from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled).  A higher score 
indicates lower asthma control. On the 7 -point scale of the ACQ -6, a change or difference in score 
of 0.5 is the smallest change that can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined by the developer (44). Measurement 
properties such as reliability  and the ability to detect change have been documented in the 
literature (44).  
The ACQ -6 is provided in Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8).  
Participants with co morbid asthma will complete the ACQ -6 as described in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
8.1.8  Patient Global Impression of Severity of CRSsNP  and Patient Global Impression of 
Change of CRSsNP   
The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC ) is a 1 -item questionnaire that asks the 
participant to provide the overall self -assessment of change in their CRSsNP  on a 7 -point scale 
compared to just before the participant started taking the study treatment. The r esponse choices 
are: 0 = “Very much better”, 1  = “Moderately better”, 2 = “A little better”, 3  = “No change”, 
4 = “A little worse”, 5  = “Moderately worse”,  and 6 = “Very much worse”.  
The Patient Global Impr ession of Severity (PGIS ) is a 1 -item questionnaire that asks participants 
to provide the overall self -assessment of their CRSsNP  severity on a 4 -point scale for the past 
week. Respon se choices are: 1 = “None”, 2 = “Mild”, 3 = “Moderate”, and 4 = “Severe”.  
The PGIS and PGIC are provided in Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8).  
Participants will complete the  2 items as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.9  EuroQol -5 dimensions questionnaire   
The EuroQol -5 dimensions (EQ -5D) is a standardized PRO measure of health status developed by 
the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal. The adult version of the questionnaire is adapted to pa rticipants age 1 6 and 
older  and can be used for participants aged 12 -15 as stated in the EQ -5D user guide . The EQ -5D

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 61 consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EuroQol -VAS . The EQ -5D-5L descriptive 
system comprises the following 5  dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels of perceived problems: “no 
problem”, “slight problems”, “moderate problems”, “severe pro blems”, and “extreme problems” 
(45). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the 
box again st the most appropriate statement in each of the 5  dimensions; this results in a 1 -digit 
number expressing the level for that dimension. The digits for 5  dimensions can be combined in a 
5-digit number describing the respondent’s health state. The EQ -VAS re cords the respondent’s 
self-rated health on a vertical, VAS where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state 
(100)” and “worst imaginable health state (0)”. This information can be used as a quantitative 
measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. The recall period of the 
questionnaire is “today” . 
The EQ -5D-5L is provided in Appendix 8 ( Section  10.8). 
Participants will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.10  Health care resource utilization and missed day s at work/ missed day s at school   
A questionnaire about health car e resource utilization and productivity (missed days of 
school /workdays) will be collected by the Investigator for all participants throughout the study 
through eCRF.  
8.1.11  CRSsNP Worsening/ Acute Sinusitis   
The CRSsNP w orsening/acute sinusitis is defined as worsening of any of CRS symptoms that 
requires initiation of rescue therapy  as assessed by Investigator . 
8.1.12  Spirom etry  
Spirometry will be performed at the local level (study site or another facility) in the morning after 
withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbu terol for at least 
6 hours and LAMA and LABA for 24 hour s. The FEV 1, forced vital capacity (FVC ), and forced 
expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF  25 to 75) will be determined at the 
designated treatment visits. The results of FEV1 (% of predicted normal), FVC and FEF  25 to 75 
should be recorded in the eCRF during the screening period (before V2) for all pa rticipants and in 
participants with asthma for the other scheduled visits during the randomized treatment period. 
Whenever possible, the same spirometer and standard spirometric techniques, including 
calibration, will be used to perform spirometry at all visits and, the sam e person s hould perform 
the measurements.

Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
8.2.1  Physical examinations   
• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin (full 
body skin examination ), nasal cavities, eyes, ears, respiratory, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, neurological, lymphatic, and m usculoskeletal systems.  
• Participants should be disrobed and provided with a hospital gown before the skin 
examination.  
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.  
• Any new finding or worsening of previous finding should be reported as a new adverse 
event . 
8.2.2  Vital signs   
Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine or sitting position after 5 minutes rest and will 
include temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate.  
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be assessed using the same arm with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniqu es will be used only if an automated device is not available.  
Body weight (kg) will be measured at Screening (Visit 1),  Baseline (Visit 2) and following visits . 
Height (cm) will be measured only at Screening (Visit 1).  
8.2.3  Electrocardiograms   
As defined in S oA (Section  1.3), single 12-lead ECG will be obtained for screening purpose only .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 63 unless judged by the Investigator  to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s 
condition.  
• All laboratory tests with values considere d clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within  12 weeks  after the last dose of study intervention  
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator  or Sponsor or Sponsor representative(s) . 
- If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified , and the Sponsor  
notified , 
- All protocol -required laboratory  assessments, as defined in  Appendix  2 (Section  10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA  
(Section  1.3), 
- If laboratory values from non -protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the Investigator  (eg, SAE , AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF.   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SE RIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS   
Adverse event will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the participant’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or  study procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention  (see Section  7).  
8.3.1  Time per iod and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information   
All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the EOS 
Visit at the time points spec ified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
All AE s will be collected from the signing of the ICF at the time points specified in the SoA  
(Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESI will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee  immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed  24 hours, as indicated in  Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor  within 24  hours of it being 
available.  
Investigator s are not obligated to actively seek AE s or SAE s after conclusion of the study 
participation . However, if the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she cons iders the event to be reasonably

8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs   
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE s and SAE s and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 (Section  10.3). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to  inquire about 
AE occurren ces.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/ AESI/ SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. At the  prespecified study end -date, a ll SAEs,  and AEs of 
special interest (as defined in Section  8.3.6 ), will be followed unt il resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
8.3.4  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by the Investigator  to the Sponsor  of an SAE is e ssential so that l egal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor  has a l egal responsibility to notify both the local r egulatory auth ority and 
other r egulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor  will comply with country -specific r egulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the r egulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and Investigator s. 
• Adverse events that are considered expected will be specified in the reference safety 
information .  
• Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) are reported to regulatory 
authorities, Investigators, and IRBs/IECs as follows:  
• For SUSARs that are life -threatening or result in death, reporting is no later than  7 days 
after first knowledge by the Sponsor, with all relevant follow -up information subsequent ly 
reported within an additional 8 days , 
• For SUSARs, other than those that are life -threatening or r esult in death, reporting is no 
later than 15 days after first knowledge by the Sponsor . 
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describi ng an SAE, SUSAR or 
any other specific safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor 
will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.  It is the responsibility  of the Sponsor to assess whether an 
event meets the criteria for a SUSAR and , therefore, is expedited to regulatory authorities.

• Details of all pr egnancies in female p articipa nts and  female partners of male participants 
will be collected after the start of study intervention and until  the outcome has been 
determined.  
• If a pr egnancy is reported, the Investigator  should inform the Sponsor  within 24 hours of 
learning of th e pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in  Appendix  4 
(Section  10.4). 
• Abnormal pr egnancy outcomes ( eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pr egnancy) are considered SAEs  
8.3.6  Adverse event of special interest   
Adverse event of special interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI ) is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added, modified , or removed during a study by proto col amendment.  
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE  
notification described in Section  10.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the  
corresponding pages in the eCRF (to be  sent) or screens in the eCRF. Adverse event of special 
interests  for this study include:   
• Anaphylactic reactions.  
• Systemic hypersensitivity reactions . 
• Helminthic infections . 
• Any severe type of conjunctivitis or blepharitis .  
• Keratitis . 
• Clinically symptomatic eosinophilia (or eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms) . 
• Pregnancy of a female  participant  entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male participant  entered in the study with IMP : 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female participant entered in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male participant e ntered in the clinical trial  will be qualified as an SAE 
only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria , 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued , 
- Follow -up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female p artner of a male 
participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined , 
- Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.

• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or sponta neously notified by the participant and defined as at least twice 
the intended dose during an interval of less than 11 days. The circumstances 
(ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and 
symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms , 
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) with any NIMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the participant and defined as at least twice 
the maximum prescribed daily dose, within the intended therapeutic  interval. The 
circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the overdose 
form.  
8.3.7  Guidelines for reporting product complaints   
Any defect in the IMP  must be reported as soon as possible by the Investigator  to the monitoring 
team that will complete a product complaint form within required timelines.  
Appropriate information ( eg, samples, labels or documents like pictures or photocopies) related to 
product  identification and to the potential deficiencies may need to be gathered. The Investigator  
will assess whether or not the quality issue has to be reported together with an AE or SAE.

Overdose is an AESI (defined in Section  8.3.6 ). No antidote is available for dupilumab. The 
Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator /treating physician should:  
1. Provide symptomatic care.  
2. Contact the Sponsor or Sponsor representative(s)  immediately.  
3. Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until 
dupilumab  can no longer be detected systemically.  
4. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis as so on as possible if requested by the Sponsor or 
Sponsor representative(s)  (determined on a case -by-case basis).  
5. Document appropriately in the eCRF.

8.10 USE OF BIOLOGICAL SAM PLES AND DATA FOR FU TURE RESEARCH   
Future research may help further  the understanding of disease subtypes, disease biology, related 
conditions, drug response and toxicity, and can help identify new drug targets or biomarkers that 
predict participant response to treatment. Therefore, data and biological samples will be sto red 
and used for future research when consented to by participants (see Section  10.1.3 ) unless 
prohibited by local laws or IRBs/IECs (in such case, consent for future use of sample will not be 
included in the local ICF ).  
For participants who consent to the storage and use of th eir data and remaining and/or extra 
clinical samples, data and samples may be used after the study ends for future research related 
either to the drug, the mechanism of action, and the disease or its associated conditions. Such 
research may include, but is  not limited to, performing assessments on DNA,  RNA, proteins , or 
metabolites. If future research on genetic material is performed, this will also be limited to the 
purpose of addressing research questions related to the drug, the mechanism of action, the disease 
or its associated conditions.  
In the event future research is conducted for other purposes, the study participants will be 
informed of those purposes and will be given means to object to those research projects.  
Data and samples will be used in com pliance with the information provided to participants in the 
ICF Part 2 (future research).  
All study participant data and samples will be coded such that no participant direct identifiers will 
be linked to them. Coded data and samples may be transferred to  a Sponsor site (or a 
subcontractor site), which may be located outside of the country where the study is conducted. 
The Sponsor adopts safeguards for protecting participant confidentiality and personal data (see 
Section  10.1.4 ).

his/her samples before the end of the retention period, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor (or 
its contract organization) in writing. In such case, samples will be destroyed and related coded 
data wil l be anonymized unless otherwise required by applicable laws.  
Study participant coded data will be stored for future research for up to 25 years after the end of 
the study. If data are still considered of important scientific value after this period, coded  data 
already available will be anonymized unless otherwise required by applicable laws (the same will

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESE S  
No statistical hypotheses  will be tested in this study.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION   
Sample size calculation was performed to ensure reasonable accuracy for the estimation of the 
primary endpoint in participants treated with dupilumab wi th screening blood eosinophil count 
≥300 cells/mm3. With a 1:1 randomization ratio, a standard deviation (SD) of 5 and a dropout rate 
of 10%, a  sample size of approximately 30 participants with screening b lood eosinophil count 
≥300 cells/mm3 will provide a half -width of approximately less than 3 for the 2 -sided 95% CI in 
the dupilumab group which is deemed reasonable.  
In addition, it is planned to include approximately 40 participants with screening blood eosinophil 
count <300 cells/mm3. Thus, the planned total sample size is approximately 35  participants per 
arm.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES   
The fol lowing populations are defined  in Table  5 for this study . The primary population of the 
efficacy endpoints will be the ITT population  with screening blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 
cells/mm3. 
Table  5 - Populations for analyses   
Population  Description  
Screened  All participants who sign the ICF . 
Randomized  The randomized population includes all participants with a treatment kit number allocated and recorded in the  
IRT database, and regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not. Participants treated without being 
randomized will not be considered randomized and will not be i ncluded in any efficacy population.  
Intent -to-treat (ITT ) All randomized participants analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by randomization 
regardless if treatment kit is used or not.  
ITT with screening 
blood eosinophil 
count 
≥300  cells/mm3 All randomized participants with screening blood eosinophil count ≥300 cells/mm3 analyzed according to 
the treatment group allocated by randomization regardless if treatment kit is used or not.  
Safety  All participants randomly assigned to study intervention and who take at least 1  dose of study intervention. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the intervention they actually received. Randomized participants for 
whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will be included in t he safety population as 
randomized. For participants who accidentally receive different study intervention from the planned, the actual 
intervention allocation for as -treated analysis will be the dupilumab group.

In the primary analysis approach for the primary endpoint, for participants who undergo sinonasal 
surgery for CRSsNP  or take SCS for any reason , data collected after surgery  or initiation of SCS  
will be  set to missing and the worst post -baseline value on or before the time of sur gery or SCS 
will be used to impute missing Week 24 value (ie, WOCF approach). For participants with no  
post-baseline values, the baseline  value  will be used . Participants who discontinue the study 
intervention prematurely are encouraged to follow the planned clinical visits and, in these 
participants, who did not undergo surgery  or receive SCS , all data collected after study 
intervention discontinuation will be used in the analysis. No missing data will be imputed. 
Descriptive statistics (number of participants , mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum ) and 
95% CI in the dupilumab group , will be provided.  
Supplementary  analyses  
Supplementary analyses to assess the robustness of intercurrent event handling may be performed. 
Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.3  Secondary endpoint(s)   
- The change from baseline to Week 24 in the secondary endpoints will be analyzed 
using the same analysis approach as for the primary endpoint. For endpo ints 
comparing dupilumab to placebo, 95% CI of the treatment difference will be provided.    
9.4.4  Tertiary/exploratory endpoint(s)   
Analysis of exploratory endpoints will be detailed in the SAP.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 75 Analyses of Adverse Events  
Adverse event incidence tables will pr esent by system organ class (SOC ) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order) and preferred term (PT ), the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
participants experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same participant 
will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment phase. The d enominator for 
computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group.  
The p roportion of participants with at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE ), 
treatment -emergent serious adverse event (TESAE ), TEAE leading to death, and TEAE leading to 
permanent study intervention discontinuation will be tabulated by treatment group. In addit ion, 
TEAEs will be described according to maximum intensity and relation to the study intervention. 
Serious AEs and AEs leading to study discontinuation that occur outside the treatment -emergent 
period will be summarized separately.  
The i ncidence of each type of AESI and other AE groupings will be tabulated by treatment group.  
For each type of AESI, the following analysis will be generated : 
• A summary of the number (%) of participants with:  
- Any TEAE ,  
- Any SAE (regardless of treatment -emergent status) ,  
- Any TESAE , 
- Any AE leading to death ,  
- Any TEAE leading permanent study intervention discontinuation ,  
- Any TEAE related to study intervention reported by the Investigator ,  
- Any TEAE by maximum intensity, corrective treatment, and final outcome .  
The method to id entify AESIs and other AE groupings will be specified in the SAP.  
The following death summaries will be generated:  
• Number (%) of participants who died by study period (TEAE, on  study) summarized on 
the safety population by treatment received.  
• Death in nonrandomized participants or randomized and not treated participants.  
• TEAE leading to death (death as an outcome on the AE eCRF page as reported by the 
Investigator) by primary SOC and PT showing number (%) of participants.  
Analyses of laboratory and vital signs parameters  
Results and change from baseline for the laboratory and vital signs parameters will be 
summarized by treatment group for baseline and each post baseline time point, endpoint,

standard deviation, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum.  
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory and vital signs parameters.  
• The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA ) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined 
criteria/thresholds based on literature review and defined by the Sponsor .  
• PCSA criteria will determine which participants had at least 1 PCSA during the 
treatment -emergent  period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the 
treatment -emergent period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of 
all such participants will be the numerator for the treatment -emergent PCSA percentage.  
The proportion of participants who had at least one incidence of PCSA at any time during the 
treatment -emergent period will be summarized by treatment group. Shift table s showing changes 
with respect to the baseline status will be provided.  
9.4.6  Other analyses   
Pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, PD, and biomarker exploratory analyses will be described in 
the SAP finalized before the database lock. The population PK and PD analyses might be 
presented separately from the main clinical study report (CSR).  
Data collected regarding the impact of the COVID -19 or other pandemics on the participants will 
be sum marized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). Any additional analyses and methods 
required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 or other events requiring public health emergency 
on the efficacy (eg, missing data due to COVID -19) and safety will be detail ed in the SAP.  
9.5 INTERIM ANALYSES   
No interim analysis is planned.  
9.6 TIMING OF STATISTICA L ANALYSES   
The d atabase lock will be performed after all participants have completed the end of study visit . 
Final analyses in the CSR will be based on all data collected up to this database lock.

RECORDING, EVALUATIN G, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING   
10.3.1  Definition of AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention , whether or not consi dered related 
to the study intervention . 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention . 
Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinic ally significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator ( ie, not related to progression of 
underlying disease ). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention  administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention  or a concomitant medication.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE.  
The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae res ulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as 
AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of efficacy" or "failure of 
expected pharmacological action" also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
Investigator  to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/di sorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 88 • Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the star t of the study that do not worsen . 
10.3.2  Definition  of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( eg, hospitalizati on for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a) Results in death  
b) Is life -threatening  
• The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing ho spitalization  
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the physici an’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or w as necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment  of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accide ntal trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 89 f) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in decidi ng whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the participant or may require medical or surgical interventi on to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.  
- Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a 
guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically 
important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive:  
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm , 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow 
aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc) , 
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc).  
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse ,  
- ALT >3 × ULN + total bilirubin >2 × ULN or asymptomatic ALT 
increase >10 × ULN ,  
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality ,  
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of 
blood sampling) ,  
- Bullous cutane ous eruptions , 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study , 
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated 
during the study . 
10.3.3  Recording and follow -up of AE and/or SAE   
AE and SAE recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation ( eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completio n of the  AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor’s representative. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of 
the participant number, will be redacted on t he copies of the medical records before 
submission to the Sponsor’s representative.

SAR231893 -EFC16723  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 90 • The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following cat egories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities . 
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities . 
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday  activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a cat egory utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe . 
An event is defined as “serious ” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention  and 
each occurrence o f each AE/SAE.   
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment . 
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assess ment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor’s representative. However, it is 
very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor’s 
representative . 
• The Investigator  may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining r egulatory reporting 
requirements.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 91 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator is obligated to perform  or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the Sponsor’s 
representative to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as 
possible. This may include additional l aboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide the Spon sor’s representative with a copy of any post -
mortem findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt  of the information.  
10.3.4  Reporting  of SAEs  
SAE reporting to the Sponsor  via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor’s representative  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection 
tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data  into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -
line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to 
the Sponso r’s representative  by telephone.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the protocol.  
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor’s represent ative.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone 
is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the n eed for the Investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the protocol.

- Documented bilateral salpingectomy , 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy . 
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above,  (eg, mullerian agen esis, androgen insensitivity), Investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contracep tion methods if they 
wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue 
HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 93 CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE : 
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described below.  
Highly effective contraceptive methods that are user dependenta 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral  
• Intravaginal  
• Transdermal  
Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Oral 
• Injectable  
Highly effective methods that are user independenta 
Implantable progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner o f the 
WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be 
used. 
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability  of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation 
to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
NOTES :  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be cons istent with local regulations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
COLLECTION OF PR EGNANCY INFORMATION :  
Male participants with partners who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidential  Page 94 female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the m other and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anoma lies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. The initial information will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning 
of a participant’s pregnancy.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow -up information on the participa nt and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow -up will not be required 
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will 
be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or  absence of anomalies) or indication for 
the procedure.  
• Any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons 
will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at 
>22 weeks gestational age) is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
• Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as de scribed in  
Section  8.3.4 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former stud y participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention.

ASSESSMENTS   
 
*If unable to retest in 72 hours, use original lab results to decide on further reporting/monitoring/discontinuation.  
Note:  
“Baseline” refers to ALT sampled at baseline visit; or if baseline value unavailable, to the latest ALT sampled before the ba seline  visit. The 
algorithm does not apply to the instances of increase in ALT during screening.  
See Section  10.3 for guidan ce on safety reporting.  
Normalization is defined as ≤ULN or baseline value, if baseline value is >ULN.  
ALT > 3 ULN
Monitor LFTs every 72 hoursALT ≤ 5 ULN ALT > 3 ULN &
Total Bilirubin > 2 ULN 
Permanent Discontinuation of IMPALT > 5 ULN 
In ANY CASE, FOLLOW the instructions listed in the box below : 
1.INFORM the Site Monitor who will forward the information to the Study Manager
2.INVESTIGATE specifically for malaise with or without loss of consciousness, dizziness, and/or 
hypotension and/or episode of arrhythmia in the previous 72 hours; rule out muscular injury
3.PERFORM the following tests:
-LFTs: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total and conjugated bilirubin and prothrombin time / INR
-CPK, serum creatinine, complete blood count
-Anti-HAV IgM, anti -HBc IgM, (HBV -DNA if clinically indicated), anti -HCV and HCV RNA, anti -
CMV IgM and anti -HEV IgM antibodies
-Depending on the clinical context, check for recent infection with EBV, herpes viruses, and toxoplasma
-Hepatobiliary ultrasonography (or other imaging investigations if needed)
4.CONSIDER Auto -antibodies: antinuclear, anti -DNA, anti -smooth muscle, anti-LKM
5.CONSIDER consulting with hepatologist
6.CONSIDER patient hospitalisation if INR>2 (or PT<50%) and/or central nervous system disburbances 
suggesting hepatic encephalopathy
7.MONITOR LFTs after discontinuation of IMP:
-As closely as possible (or every 48 hours) until stabilization, then every 2 weeks until return to 
normal/baseline or clinical resolution .
8. FREEZE serum sample (5ml x 2)
9. In case of SUSPICION of GILBERT Syndrome, a DNA diagnostic test should be doneCOMPLETE the specific CRF forms 
for „ALT Increase” and inform the 
Monitoring Team within 24 hours

endpoints in Part A (at Weeks 24 and 52) as 
follows:  
Objective: To eva luate the effect of dupilumab in 
the subgroup of participants with screening blood 
eosinophil count ≥300 cells/mm3 compared to 
placebo  
Endpoints:  
-Change from baseline to Weeks 24 and 52 
(Part  A) in opacification of sinuses assessed by 
CT scan using LMK score in the screening blood 
eosinophil count ≥300  cells/mm3 population.  
-Change from baseline to Weeks 24 and 52 
(Part  A) in sinus total symptom score (sTSS) 
using the screening blood eosinophil count 
≥300  cells/mm3 population.  
-Evaluation of other seco ndary endpoints listed 
above in the screening blood eosinophil count 
≥300 cells/mm3 population.  To evaluate the effect of 
dupilumab in a subgroup of 
interest as the primary analysis 
population was changed to the 
ITT population regardless of 
eosinophil lev els in Part A, per

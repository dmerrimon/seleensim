VERSION DATE:  1/26/21 
 
 
Start date 11/ 19/2020  
Define primary study cohort as of this date  
Define secondary study cohort as of this date  
Define matched control cohort as of this date (attempt to match pilot to control at rate of 4:1 for 
primary and 2:1 for secondary ) 
 
Groups of interest:   
• Patients meeting primary patient population  criteria at the study start date 
o Adults aged 65 to 85 years at the time of the study start date AND  
o One or more office or telehealth visits in the year preceding the study start date at the eligible NM primary care sites AND  
o Medicare or Medicare Advantage insurance on study start date AND  
o Last two of fice blood pressures elevated (either >= 140 mmHg systolic or >= 90 
mmHg diastolic) in the past 2 years AND  
o Diagnosis of hypertension in the year preceding the study start date (problem list or encounter diagnosis : all of the subcodes of I10, I11, I12, I13, I15) AND  
o Not meet the exclusion criteria  
 Persistent atrial fibrillation as indicated in the EHR  
• Exclude if “permanent atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial 
fibrillation” [I48.1, I48.2] (active problem list or two encounter 
diagnoses in past 2 years)  
 Stage IV or more severe kidney disease, defined as the most recent 
estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 per 1.73m2 or currently on renal 
replacement therapy (i.e. hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) [N18.4, 
N18.5, N18.6]  
 Diagnosis of dementia as indi cated in the electronic health record [ all 
subcodes of F01 -F03, all subcodes of G30, all subcodes of G31]  
  
• Patients meeting secondary  patient  population  criteria at the study start date  
o Meet criteria for primary population OR  
o Diagnosed hypertension but did not have the l ast two office blood pressures >= 
140 mmHg systolic or >= 90 mmHg diastolic OR  
o No diagnosis of hypertension in the past year but did have the last office blood 
pressure >= 140mmHg systolic or >= 90 mmHg diastolic  
• Control group matched based on the primary study criteria  
• Control group matched based on the secondary study criteria.  
 
 
Matching criteria  
• Sex 
• Age (+/ - 5 years)  
• Mean SBP from T -365d to T -183d (+/ - 10 mm Hg)  
• Mean SBP from T -182d to T -0d (+/ - 10 mm Hg)  
• Number of office visits to primary care in the past year categories : 1, 2, 3- 4, 5+  
 
Assess for time 0 (11/ 19/2020)  
Characteristics of study populations and matched control populations.  
 
At time 0 , 1 month (12/ 18/2020), 3 months (2/ 18/2020) and 6 months (5/18/2020) describe  
for each group:  
• The p roportion of patients who satisfy the performance measure Controlling High 
Blood Pressure (NQF 0018)   
• The systolic blood pressure at the most recent face- to-face office visit  
 
 
 
At time 1 month (12/ 18/2020), 3 months (2/ 18/2020) and 6 months (5/ 18/2020) describe for 
each group:  
• Number of antihypertensive medication intensifications between the study start and the 
measure date  
 
Hypothesis testing—perform separately for primary and secondary populations  
 
H1: Antihypertensive medication intensification will be greater in pilot clinic(s) with RPM 
compared to contemporaneous control clinic(s).  
Compare at 1, 3, and 6 months the number of medication intensifications between study group 
and control group using Poisson regression (if variance of medication intensifications is 
approximately equal to the mean) or otherwise negative binomial regression with study group a s 
the independent variable.  
 
H2: The proportion of patients who satisfy the performance measure C ontrolling High Blood 
Pressure (NQF 0018) will be greater in pilot clinic(s) with RPM compared to contemporaneous 
control clinic(s).  
Compare at 1, 3, and 6 months the proportion of patients in the study group and control group 
who satisfy the performance measure Controlling High Blood Pressure (NQF 0018 ) using 
logistic  regression with study group and baseline systolic blood pressure as independent 
variables.  
 
H3: The systolic blood pressure at the most recent office visit will be lower in pilot clinic(s) w ith 
RPM compared to contemporaneous control clinic(s).  
Compare at 1, 3, and 6 months the systolic blood pressure at the most recent face- to-face office 
visit among patients in the study group and control group using linear regression with study 
group and baseline systolic blood pressure as independent variables . 
 
 
RPM enrolled patient  analyses  
 
We will explore the trajectories of blood pressure for individuals who are prescribed RPM.  
 We will describe all patients who are enrolled in RPM at their enrollment date and follow their 
blood pressure outcomes at 1, 3, and 6 months from their enrollment (or until the study end 
date).  
 
We will retrospectively , at the end of the study end date, identify matched controls (4:1) for 
patients enrolled in RPM  selected from patients in the non- pilot clinics and matched on the 
same baseline criteria ( assessed at the time of RPM ordering) . We will perform comparisons 
analogous to those described above for the primary cohort.

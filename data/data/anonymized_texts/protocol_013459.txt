 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Phase II Study of Tacrolimus Methotrexate and Tocilizumab for the Prevention of Acute 
Graft -versus -Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation  
 
 
Principal Investigator:  William R. Drobyski, MD; Marcelo Pasquini, MD 
 
Study Design:  This is a phase II open label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of Tacrolimus, Methotrexate and Tocilizumab (Tac/MTX/Toc) in preventing graft versus host disease (GVHD) compared to a contemporary control from t he 
CIBMTR.    
 Primary Objective:  The primary end point of the study is to compare grade II -
IV aGVHD- free survival at Day 180 between recipients of 
Tac/MTX/Toc to contemporary CIBMTR controls.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  Compare, grades II -IV and II I-IV aGVHD, chronic GVHD,  
neutrophil and platelet engraftment, transplant related 
mortality ( TRM ), disease relapse or progression, 
progression- free and overall survival . Phase 2 specific 
outcomes include incidence of grades ≥3 toxicities 
according to CTACAE v4, incidence of infections, and 
proportion of donor chimerism, immune reconstitution, and 
production of pro- inflammatory cytokines.  
 Exploratory Objectives: Compare depressive symptoms , anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and 
pain among allogeneic HCT recipients receiving 
tocilizumab to a control group of allogeneic HCT recipients who did not receive prophylactic tocilizumab  (UW control 
cohort). To describe gene expression and Rap1 prenylation 
among allogeneic HCT recipients receiving prophylactic tocilizumab.  
 
 
Eligibility:   Eligible patients are 18 years  and older  undergoing HCT 
for treatment of acute leukemia in complete morphologic 
remission; chronic myelogenous leukemia, other myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplasia with less than 5% blasts in bone marrow; and chemotherapy sensitive lymphoproliferative diseases. Patients must receive a busulfan -based conditioning regimen and have 
related or unrelated peripheral blood or bone marrow donor. Sibling donor must be a 6/6 match for HLA -A, B 
and DRB1 or unrelated donor must be a 8/8 match at HLA -

 A, -B, -C and DRB1. Patients are excluded if they have a 
history of intolerance or allergy  to Tocilizumab; or if they 
received rituximab or other monoclonal antibodies as part 
of the conditioning regimen. Eligibility f rom the control 
cohort includes patients who received their first allogeneic transplant at a US center, for the same indications and 
conditioning regimens as listed above, from a HLA match 
related or unrelated donor with bone marrow or peripheral blood graft in the years of 2010 to 2013. Controls should also receive tacrolimus and methotrexate as the sole GVHD prophylaxis. Donor type of the controls will be matched to 
that of patients enrolled in the clinical trial.  
  
Treatment Description:  Patients enrolled in the clinical trial will receive tacrolimus per standard of care  at doses to maintain therapeutic levels 
and continued until at least Day 90 post-transplant . 
Methotrexate will be dosed at 15  mg/m
2 Day +1 and 
10mg/m2 Days +3, +6 and +11.  Tocilizumab will be 
administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg at Day -1.   
. Accrual Objective:   35 patients will be accrued  to the clinical trial and at most 
200 CIBMTR controls will be included in the analysis. 
 
Accrual Period:   The estimated accrual period is 2 years.  
 
Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 12 months following initiation  
of therapy.

 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Acute Graft versus Host Disease  
 
Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the major complication associated with allogeneic  
hematopoietic  cell transplantation  (HCT).  A prominent characteristic of GVHD is the presence 
of a proinfla mmatory milieu that is attributable to conditioning regimen -induced host tissue 
damage as well as secretion of inflammatory cytokines [e.g. interleukin -1 (IL -1), tumor necrosis 
alpha- α (TNF -α), interferon -γ (IFN -γ), interleukin- 6 (IL -6)] by alloactivated d onor T cells and 
other effector cell populations.1-3 These cytokines perpetuate GVHD through direct cytotoxic 
effects on host tissues,4-6 activation and/or priming of immune effector cells,7 and differentiation 
of proinflammatory T cell populations (i.e. T H1 and T H17 cells) from naïve T cell precursors.8,9  
This inflammatory environment is also promoted by the absence of an effective regulatory T cell 
(Treg) response as both a relative and an absolute decline of Tregs in the peripheral blood and target tiss ues has been demonstrated in a majority of studies.
8,10- 12 The strong association 
between a proinflammatory milieu and the absence of an effective counter regulatory response suggests that the inflammatory environment prevents and/or inhibits Treg reconstitution during GVHD.  How this occurs, however, is not well understood.   Up to 30% of the recipients of HCT from HLA -match  donors develop at least grade II aGVHD 
despite immunosuppressive prophylaxis.
13 The occurrence of moderate (grade II) or severe 
(grade III or IV) aGVHD after HCT results in increased treatment related mortality (TRM), which precludes improvement in overall survival.
14 T-cells in the graft play a key role in the 
pathogenesis of aGVHD.  During the past 20 years, a combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine (CSA)) and methotrexate (MTX) has been standard therapy for prevention of GVHD. However, despite use of these agents, the incidence of grade II -IV GVHD 
is 35-50%
15 The risk increases with unrelated or partially HLA -matched donors due to the 
greater genetic disparity between the donor and the host.  Furthermore, acute GVHD incidence and severity is augmented in older aged patients who increasingly comprise the majority of adult patients that need an allogeneic stem cell transplant for the treatment of their hematological malignancy.  Thus, new therapeutic treatment strategies are desperately needed for the prevention of acute GVHD.    
1.2  Interleukin 6  
 
IL-6 is a pleiotrophic cytokine that is produced by a variety of cell types, including T cells, B 
cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, monocytes and keratinocytes.16 IL-6 is of particular interest 
with respect to GVHD biology since it occupies a unique position at the crossroads where the 
fate of naïve T cells to become either regulatory cells or proinflammatory T cells is determined.  
In the presence of IL -6 and transforming growth factor -β (TGF -β), naïve T cells differentiate 
into T H17 cells, whereas in its absence these same cells are induced to become Tregs.117,18  
Furthermore, IL -6 produced by dendritic cells after activation through Toll -like receptors is able 
to inhibit the suppressive function of natural Tregs.19,20 Thus, IL -6 appears to have a pivotal role 
in directing the immune response towards an inflammatory phenotype and away from a 
regulatory response. The potential importance of IL -6 in GVHD is also supported by clinical 
studies that have shown that patients with elevated plasma levels of IL -6,21,22 as w ell as those 
with a recipient or donor IL -6 genotype that results in increased IL -6 production,23,24 have an 
increased incidence and severity of GVHD.

Signaling through IL -6 occurs by the binding to a low affinity IL -6 receptor (IL -6R) which 
together in duces homodimerization of gp130 and subsequent transduction of the intracellular 
signal.25 This membrane -bound IL -6R, however, is expressed only on hepatocytes and 
hematopoietic cells.  Notably, the IL -6R can also be shed from the membrane generating a 
soluble form of the receptor which can complex with IL -6 and induce an intracellular response in 
cells that lack the membrane -bound IL -6R through a process called trans -signaling.26,27  
Interference with the actions of IL -6 by administration of an IL -6R antibody that prevents 
binding of the cytokine to its receptor has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis,
28,29 amyloidosis,30 and colitis.31 
 
1.3 Tocilizumab  
 
Tocilizumab (Actemra ) is a humanized anti -IL-6 receptor antibody that blocks IL -6 signaling 
and has been FDA -approved for the treatment of severe active rheumatoid arthritis.  It has been 
shown to have remission- inducing efficacy in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid  
arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and multicentric Castlemans’ disease.32,33  A pilot 
phase I/II study in patient with active Crohn’s disease also suggested benefit when administered 
on an every two week basis.34 Recent studies in a murin e model of GVHD, has shown that 
treatment with an anti- IL-6R antibody is able to significantly reduce GVHD -associated mortality 
and pathological damage.35 One of the mechanisms by which this occurs is through the enhanced 
reconstitution of regulatory T cells that express the transcription factor foxp3.  Reconstitution of both natural and induced Tregs has been demonstrated in animals treated with this antibody, suggesting that the increase in overall numbers of Tregs is responsible, in part, for the attenuation in GVHD severity. A recent case report demonstrated that administration of Tocilizumab was effective at significantly reducing the severity of GVHD in the GI tract as 
determined by a marked reduction in the volume of diarrhea.
36  Notably, this patient  had failed 
multiple prior therapies, including high dose steroids, infliximab, budesonide, photopheresis, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil.  Furthermore, Drobyski et al
37 published a series of 
patients who received Tocilizumab for steroid refractory a cute GVHD.  Responses were 
observed in four of six patients with severe acute GVHD that had failed to respond to first, and in most cases, second line therapies.  Collectively, these studies support the premise that Tocilizumab has activity in GVHD.  
 
1.4 IL-6 blockade  in GVHD prophylaxis 
 Whether blockade of IL -6 signaling has efficacy in the prevention of GVHD has not been 
critically examined. In a preliminary unpublished report, Kennedy et al
38 analyzed IL -6 levels 
during HCT and demonstrated that levels peaked at day 7 post transplant and only returning to 
pre-transplant level by day 30. This study demonstrated the same pattern of IL -6 levels in the 
related and unrelated HLA matched transplants, myeloablative regimens were associated with higher day 7 peaks of IL -6 in the serum compared to reduced intensity conditioning. Kennedy et 
al subsequently used an anti -IL-6 humanized monoclonal antibody with cyclosporine and 
methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis in 48 recipients of HLA matched HCT. The mAb was administered as a single dose day -1 of transplant. The rates of grade II -IV and III -IV acute

 GVHD were 11.1% and 5.6%, respectively. There were no reports of graft failure in this 
analysis.  
   
 1.5 Rationale 
 
The current clinical trial has the objective to compare the co mbination of tacrolimus, 
methotrexate and  tocilizumab (Tac/MTX/Toc)  as GVHD prophylaxis to a contemporary control. 
The study will build upon the experience from Kennedy et al, by further exploring IL -6 blockade 
in GVHD prevention.  
 
 
2.0   STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a phase II open label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of  Tac/MTX/Toc  in

2.2  Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary objectives of the study are to compare  grades II -IV and II I-IV aGVHD, chronic 
GVHD,  neutrophil and platelet engraftment, transplant related mortality ( TRM ), disease relapse 
or progression, progression- free and overall survival between Tac/MTX /Toc and Tac/MTX 
CIBMTR controls. Additionally, secondary objectives include description of incidence of grades 
≥3 toxicities according to CTACAE v4, incidence of infections, and proportion of donor 
chimerism, immune reconstitution , and production of pro -inflammatory cytokines  among 
patients who receive Tac/MTX/Toc.   
 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives 
 The primary objective of this ancillary study is to compare levels of depressive symptoms, 
anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain between allogeneic HCT recipients who received prophylactic tocilizumab to a control group of allogeneic HCT recipients who did not receive tocilizumab 
(UW control cohort). Additionally, exploratory objectives include assessing  gene expression and 
Rap1 prenylation levels.

 2.6.2.1 Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cells PBPC) Mobilization and Collection 
 
PBPC mobiliza tion and collection will be done according to standard operating procedures from 
MCW BMT program.  It is recommended the following mobilization and collection: 
- Donors will receive G -CSF (filgrastim, Amgen) at a dose of ~10 mcg/kg/day 
subcutaneously for 5 consecutive days.  Daily dose will not exceed 1200 mcg/day, and volume per injection site will not exceed 2.0 mL.  G -CSF should be administered at 
approximately the same time each day.  The fifth dose will be given at least one hour prior to apheresis.   
- Apheresis will begin on Day 5 of G -CSF administration. The recommended method for 
apheresis is through a continuous -flow apheresis device and ideally bilateral peripheral 
venous access. Donors with insufficient peripheral access will undergo placement of a central venous catheter.   
 Target CD34 cell doses are between 5 -10 x 10
6 per kg recipient body weight.   
 The transportation of the PBPC product from unrelated donors shall be done in accordance with NMDP Standards.  2.6.2.2 Bone marrow collection 
 Bone marrow donors should undergo harvest on Day 0.  Either general or regional (epidural, spinal) anesthesia may be used .  The bone marrow cell dose recommended is approximately 4 x 
10
8 nucleated cells per kg of recipient body weight.  This dose will be unattainable for many 
recipients because of donor and/or recipient factors, e.g., body size mismatches.  The volume of marrow shall not exceed 20 mL per kg donor weight.  The estimated cell dose and a planned 
donor marrow volume shall be agreed upon by the donor and transplant centers for unrelated donors and between the transplant physician and cell processing laboratory for related donors before initiation of the transplant conditioning regimen.  Processing of bone marrow for reduction of volume, plasma, red blood cells, or fat, will be performed by the transplant center cell processing laboratory according to standard operating procedures from MCW BMT program.  2.6.2.3 PBPC and Marrow Infusion 
 PBPC or BM grafts will be infused through an appropriate central cathe ter, according to standard 
operating procedures from MCW BMT program at Day 0.  For recipients of related donor PBPC, whose donors require a third day of collection (Day +1), these cells will be infused separately from the Day –1 and Day 0 collections on D ay +1.

 2.6.3 Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/Tocilizumab  
 
Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus will be given per standard operating procedures from MCW BMT program,. 
Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels. The dose should be adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested level of 5 -15 ng/mL. The dose of tacrolimus may be switched to oral at a 
1:4 dose equivalence and rounded to the nearest 0.5 mg at the discretion of the treating physician.  If patients are on medications which alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), 
the initial starting dose and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practices . 
Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. T he rate of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients 
should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.   
Methotrexate 
 Methotrexate will be administered, per institutional practices, at the doses of 15 mg/m
2 IV bolus 
on Day +1, and 10 mg/m2 IV bolus on Days +3, +6 and +11 after hematopoietic stem cell 
infusion. Dose reduction of MTX due to worsening creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed according to institutional practices.  
 
Tocilizumab  
 
Tocilizumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg (maximum dose of 800mg) once on the Day -1 approximately 24 hours prior to the estimated time of the hema topoietic stem 
cell infusion. The infusion will be administered over 60 minutes through a dedicated IV line and must not be administered by IV bolus.   
 
2.7 Supportive Care  
 
All supportive care will be given according to standard operating procedures of the MC W BMT 
program.  
 
2.7.1 Growth Factors 
 G-CSF or other growth factors will not be used preemptively in patients enrolled in this clinical 
trial. The use of growth factor for treatment of delayed engraftment is allowed according to 
physician preference. 
 
2.7.2 Prophylaxis Against Infections  
 Patients will receive infection prophylaxis according to standard operating procedures of the 
MCW BMT program. Infection prophylaxis will include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies (e.g., PCR screening and preempti ve therapy) to reduce the risk of bacterial, herpes

2.9 Study Drug Information 
 
Study Agent: Actemra® ( Tocilizumab)  
 
Classification: Immunomodulatory 
 
2.9.1 Clinical Pharmacology  
 Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized interleukin -6 receptor inhibiting monoclonal antibody. 
Tocilizumab binds to both soluble and membrane bound IL -6 receptors and results in the 
blockade of interleukin-6 signaling through these receptors. 
 
2.9.1.1 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that tocilizumab  undergoes biphasic elimination from the 
circulation.  In rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with 4 and 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks, the 
central volume of distribution was 3.5 L and the peripheral volume of distribution was 2.9 L with a volume of distribution at steady state of 6.4 L.  Tocilizumab dosed at 8 mg/kg resulted in a 
mean steady state area under the curve (AUC), minimum concentration (Cmin) and a maximum concentration (Cmax) of 35 + 15 mg∙hr/ml, 9.74 + 10.5 mcg/ml and 183 + 85.6 mcg/ml 
respectively.   Tocilizumab AUC, Cmin and Cmax increased with increasing body weight with a 
86% higher exposure in patients greater than 100 kg.  As a result, doses exceeding 800 mg (max dosing weight 100 kg) per infusion are not recommended. 
 
The total clearance of Tocilizumab is concentration -dependent and is represented by the both the 
linear clearance and the nonlinear clearance.  Upon saturation of the non- linear clearance 
pathway, the main determining factor is linear clearance.  The reported linear clearance in th e 
pharmacokinetic studies is estimated to be 12.5 mL/h.  The concentration dependent half -life is 
up to 11 days for the 4 mg/kg dose and up to 13 days for the 8 mg/kg dose every 4 weeks at steady state.  
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
12 
 2.9.2  Special Populations 
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis in ad ult rheumatoid arthritis patients did not demonstrate a change in 
kinetics based on age, gender or race. The effects of renal and hepatic impairment have not been 
assessed.  
 
2.9.3 Drug Supply and Storage 
 
Tocilizumab is commercially available , but will be paid for by the study.  Single use vials 
containing Tocilizumab, preservative free, sterile concentrate solutions (20 mg/ml) for IV infusion are available in the following sizes:  80 mg, 200mg, and 400 mg. The solution is colorless to pale yellow, with a pH of approximately 6.5. 
 
Vials should be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  Do not freeze.  Protect the vials from light by storage in the original package until time of use.  Inspect vials visually for particulates and discoloration prior to use and discard if particulates or discoloration is noted. 
 
2.9.4 Preparation  
 
Using aseptic technique, utilize a 100 ml bag of 0.9% sodium chloride injection USP  and 
withdraw a volume equal to the volume of the tocilizumab  solution required for the dose.  Next, 
withdraw the calculated volume of tocilizumab solution necessary for the dose from the vials and 
slowly inject the tocilizumab to the infusion bag.  The final solution volume should be 100ml.  Gently invert the IV bag to mix the solution.  Inspect the prepared IV solution for particulates. 
 
2.9.5 Storage of prepared IV solution 
 The solution may be stored under refrigeration or at room temperature for up to 24 hours and 
should be protected from light. 
 
 
2.9.6 Warning and Precauti ons 
 2.9.6.1 Serious Infections  
 The product information labeling contains a black box warning regarding the risk of serious 
infection. Most patients who developed these infections were taking concomitant immunosuppressants such as Methotrexate or corticosteroids.  Serious infections leading to 
hospitalization or death, including tuberculosis, bacterial, invasive fungal, viral and other opportunistic infections have occurred in patients receiving tocilizumab. Viral reactivation and cases of herpes zoster exacerbation were reported in clinical trials.   It is recommended that patients are tested for latent tuberculosis before and during use of tocilizumab.  If a serious infection develops, Tocilizumab should be withheld until the infection is controlled.

 2.9.6.2 Gastrointestinal perforations  
 
Events of GI perforation have been reported in clinical trials, primarily as complications of 
diverticulitis.  Patients presenting with new onset abdominal symptom s should be evaluated 
promptly. 
 
2.9.6.3 Laboratory Parameters  
 
Neutropenia, decreases in platelets, transaminase elevations, and increases in lipid parameters 
(total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides) have been reported in relation to the use of tocilizumab.  
 
2.9.6.4 Drug Interactions  
 Elevated levels  of IL -6 and other cytokines have been associated with reduced expression of 
some cytochrome (CYP) P450 enzymes.  Tocilizumab, through IL -6 inhibition, has the potential 
to affect expression of multiple CYP enzymes by restoring their activity to a higher level than 
that in the absence of tocilizumab.  Monitoring of drugs that are metabolized by CYP’s with narrow therapeutic index or where the dose is individually adjusted is advised.  Caution should be exercised when tocilizumab is coadministered with CYP3A 4 substrate drugs where decrease 
in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, atorvastatin etc.  The effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzymes may occur within approximately 2 weeks of starting therapy and persist for several weeks after stopp ing therapy.  A list of CYP drug interactions can be  
found at this site  http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/ 
 
3.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1 Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint of this phase II clinical trial is to compare the probabilities of grade II -IV 
acute GVHD- free survival at Day 180 post -transplant between recipients of Tac/MTX/Toc and 
CIBMTR controls who received Tac/MTX alone. Development of grade II -IV acute GVHD or 
death is considered event for this composite endpoint. Patients who are alive without ever 
experiencing grade II -IV acute GVHD will be censored at the last follow -up.   
 
3.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
3.2.1 Acute GVHD  
 
Cumulative incidences of grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD will be determined.  Acute GVHD 
will be graded according to the Appendix A.  The time of onset of acute grades II- IV and III -IV 
acute GVHD will be recorded, as well as the maximum grade achieved.  This endpoint will be 
evaluated through 180 days post HSCT. Rates of grade II -IV and III -IV will be compared to the 
CIBMTR controls. Within the acute GVHD endpoint, the proportion of patients with visceral involvement (liver or gut) will be described.   
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
14 
 3.2.2 Chronic GVHD  
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be determined.  Assessment of chronic GVHD 
will occur up to one year post HS CT. Rates of chronic GVHD will be compared to the CIBMTR 
controls  3.2.3 Hematologic Recovery  
Hematologic recovery will be assessed according to neutrophil and platelet counts recovery after HSCT. Neutrophil recovery is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  ≥ 500/mm
3 for three consecutive measurements on three different days.  The first of the three 
days will be designated the day of neutrophil recovery.  The competing event is death without neutrophil recovery.    Platelet recovery is defined  by two different metrics: the first day of a sustained platelet count 
>20,000/mm
3 or >50,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days.  The first 
day of sustained platelet count above these thresholds will be designated the day of plat elet 
engraftment . 
 Cumulative incidence of hematologic recovery will be compared with CIBMTR controls.   
 
3.2.4 Transplant Related Mortality  
 The cumulative incidence of TRM will be estimated at Days 100, 180, and 1 year after HSCT.  An event for this endpoint is death without evidence of disease progression or recurrence. Disease progression or recurrence will be considered competing event.  Cumulative incidence of 
TRM will be compared with CIBMTR controls.    3.2.5 Disease Relapse or Progression  
 
Relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of acute leukemia or MDS consistent with pretransplant features, or radiologic evidence of lymphoma, documented or not by biopsy.  Progression of disease applies to patients with lymphoprol iferative diseases 
(lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) not in remission prior to transplantation.  The event is defined as increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, documented or not by biopsy.   Acute leukemia and MDS  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is:  
- Reappearance of leukemia blast cells in the peripheral blood; or,  
- >5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to another cause (e.g. bone marrow regeneration) 
- The appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes (MDS specific) within the bone marrow with or without falling donor chimerism; or  
- The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid or 
- The reappearance of cytogenetic abnormalities present prior to transplantation  
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
15 
  
Lymphoproliferative Diseases  – Relapse or progression will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even if other lesions are decreasing in size.  Increased FDG uptake  in a 
previously unaffected site will only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign.  Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the basis of the PET without histologic confirmation. 
- At least a 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the product diameters of any previously involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of 
the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or 
more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
 Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG-avid lymphoma or the lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PET systems (<1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).  
 
- In addition to the criteria above, patients with CLL who present in complete remission prior to transplantation may fulfill the relapse definition if there is reappearance of circulating malignant cells that are phenotypically characteristic of CLL.  
 
Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, p rogressive or relapsed disease, including the 
withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy or donor lymphocyte infusion, will be 
considered evidence of relapse/progression regardless of whether the criteria described above were met.  
 Rates of disease progression or relapse will be compared to CIBMTR controls.  
 3.2.6 Disease Free Survival 
 The event for this endpoint is relapse/progression or death.  T he time to this event is measured 
from transplant to death or relapse/progression, whicheve r comes first.  Patients  who are alive 
and disease free will be censored at  the last follow -up. Disease -free survival will be compared 
with CIBMTR controls.  3.2.7 Overall Survival 
 The event for this endpoint is death from any cause.  The  time to this event is measured from the 
time of  transplant to  death from any cause or for surviving patients, to last follow-up.  Overall 
survival rates among recipients of Tac/MTX/Toc will be compared to CIBMTR controls.

16 
 3.2.8 Incidence of Infections  
 
The incidence of definite and probable viral, fungal and bacterial infections will be tabulated for 
recipients of Tac/Mtx/Toc .  The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation by nucleic acid 
amplification test (NAAT) in the first 100 days post HSCT will be described.  All Grade 2 and  3 
infections will be reported.  
 
3.2.9 Toxicities  
 All grades ≥ 3 toxicities according to CTCAE, version 4 will be tabulated for recipients of Tac/Mtx/Toc .  The proportion of patients developing grade ≥ 3 AE will be reported .  
  3.2.10 Donor cell Chimerism 
 Chimerism will be evaluated using sorted  whole blood in CD3 and CD33 fractions.  For the 
purpose of this protocol, mixed chimerism is defined as the presence of donor cells, as a proportion of total cells to be < 95% but > 5% in the bone marrow or peripheral blood.  Full donor chimerism is defined as ≥ 95% of donor cells. Mixed and full chimerism will be evidence of donor cell engraftment.  Donor cells of ≤ 5% will be considered as graft rejection.  The proportion of patients with each level of chimerism described above will be described as part of this outcome for recipients of Tac/Mtx/Toc .  For sorted blood cell fractions, CD3+ donor cell 
chimerism will be used to define the donor/recipient chimerism status.  
 3.2.11 Immune Reconstitution  
 Quantitative assessments of peripheral blood CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 positive lymphocytes will be done through flow cytometric analysis at Days 28, 100,180 and 365  after 
transplant. Results will be tabulated according to time from transplant. Detailed  immune 
reconstitution assessments are outlined in appendix C. Approximately 30 mL in green top tubes 
(sodium heparin)  will be drawn for each assessment.  Study team will notify  Dr. Carolyn 
Taylor ’s lab prior to study draws. 
 
3.2.12 Levels of Pro -inflammatory Cytokines  
 
Serum will be analyzed for IL -4, IL -6, IL -10, IL -13, IL -17, interferon- gamma, and tumor 
necrosis alpha using a Bio- Plex Human Cytokine Assay Kit (Bio -Rad) at baseline, days +7, +14, 
and +28.  Soluble IL -6 receptor levels will also be assessed at t he same time points using an 
ELISA assay. Results will be tabulated according to time from transplant.  Approximately 10 mL 
in red top tube s will be drawn for each assessment.  Study team will notify Dr. Carolyn Taylor’s 
lab prior to study draws.

 4.0 PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATIONS  
 
4.1 Patient evaluation and enrollment 
Patients will be approached for this study after the decision to proceed with transplant is made 
and a suitable HLA -matched donor is identified. Transplant physicians will evaluate the patient 
eligibility onto this study. Eligible patients willing to participate in the trial will sign a MCW 
Institutional Review Board approved informed consent form. A Clinical Trials Office clinical 
research coordinator will record the documentation of patient consent and proceed with registration procedures.  All source documents that support eligibility including a signed informed consent/HIPAA and signed eligibility checklist, will be available, reviewed  and eligibility verified .  
At the point of registr ation, a member of the study team  will register the patient in the electronic 
database, including demographic s, consent and on- study information. The patient will be 
assigned a unique sequence number for the study.  One of the co -Principal Investigators of the 
study, Drs . Drobyski or Pasquini, will be notified prior to enrollment.  Pharmacy will be notified 
upon patient registration. 
 4.2 Guideline for serious adverse event reporting  
 
Please refer to Appendix C for more details on adverse event reporting.  
 
4.2.1 Monitoring the Progress of Trial and the Safety of Participants 
  
This Phase II clinical trial will be monitored by the principal investigator s (PI), William R 
Drobyski MD  and Marcelo C. Pasquini, MD, MS.  The PI s will review the outcome of the data 
for ea ch individual patient on an ongoing basis. The PI s of the study will have primary 
responsibility for ensuring that the protocol is conducted as approved by the Institutional Review Board. The PI s will ensure that the monitoring plan is followed and that all data required for 
oversight of monitoring are accurately reported, that all AEs are reported according to the 
protocol guidelines, and that any  AEs reflecting patient safety concerns are appropriately 
reported.   4.2.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
  The capture of toxicities and AEs in this protocol will follow the same approach and will be done 
in two levels. First, grades 3 -5 AEs will be collected at different time points during the study 
period. Any AE that fulfill s this criteria will be capture and the frequ ency of each organ toxicity 
tabulated. The DSMC and IRB will receive a summary of all the AEs captured in a log  form on a 
quarterly to biennial basis depending the schedule of protocol review meetings. Additionally the PIs will review the frequency of toxi cities in a quarterly basis.  
 Second, any AE that is unexpected and of grades 3 to 5 will required expedited report to the oversight committees (MCW IRB, MCW DSMC and FDA – if applicable for studies under 
IND). The collection grades 3 -5 unexpected AEs is event driven and require a more 
comprehensive description of the event. The report for these AEs are termed Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) and include the following components: 1 summary cover sheet of the 
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
18 
 event, 2 narrative of the event, 3 associated conditions, medications and diagnostic information, 
source documents with further explanation of the even and an evaluation of the event by one of the PIs. The PIs will review all these events and will dete rmine if they require expedited 
reporting. If they are considered grades 3- 5 and unexpected the report will be sent to the 
oversight committees within three days from acknowledgement of the event. If the event is not considered to fulfill criteria of grade s 3-5 unexpected AE, it will be included in the DSMC and 
IRB reports for scheduled protocol reviews and will not require expedited reporting.   Reporting timelines: 
1. Fatal  (grade 5) or Life Threatening  events must be reported within 24 hours but not 
later than 3 calendar day of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  
2. All other events grades 3 -4 unexpected events (non- fatal/non life -threatening) must be 
reported within 3 to 5 calendar days of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the 
event.  
  This study will be reviewed by the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (MCW CC DSMC). A summary of the MCW CC DSMC activities are as follows:  • Review the clinical trials for data integrity and safety  
• Review all adverse events requiring expedited reporting as defined per protocol • Review all DSM reports  
• Submit a summary of any recommendations related to study conduct • Terminate the study if deemed unsafe for patients  
 A copy of the MCW CC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan and membership roster will be 
maintained in the study research file and updated as membership changes. The committee will review reports from the study PI twice annually (or more frequently if needed) and provide recommendations on trial continuation, suspension or termination as necessary. Any available DSMC letters will be submitted to the IRB of record as required.

5.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
5.1 Study Design  
 The study is designed as a Phase II, open label, single center trial to compare a novel GVHD 
prophylaxis regimen, Tac/MTX/Toc with standard Tac/MTX regimens in recipients of  
allogeneic transplant for malignant disease s. The primary endpoint of grades II -IV acute GVHD 
free survival probabilities at Day 180 post-transplant will be compared to a non-randomized 
contemporary Tac/MTX control group collected through the CIBMTR.  The control group of patients will satisfy similar eligibility requirements  as the patients enrolled in the clinical trial 
and their donor type will be matched to patients  enrolled in the phase II trial .   
 5.1.1 Accrual  
 It is estimated that 24 months of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
Accrual will be reported by race, ethnicity, gender, and age.  
 5.1.2 Primary Endpoint 
 The primary endpoint is Day 180 Grade II -IV acute GVHD- free survival (GFS) . All patients will 
be followed for the primary endpoint for at least 6 months.

23 
  
5.2 Sample Size and Power Calculation  
 
Sample size and power consi derations are based on the comparison of the Tac/MTX/Toc arm to 
the CIBMTR controls. We plan to accrue 35 patients to this phase II trial.  We plan to identify 
approximately four controls (35 X 4 = 140) for each patient enrolled in the trial, matched by donor type and limit the number of patients in the control group to 200.  The probability of grade II-IV aGVHD-free survival at Day 180 with standar d Tac/MTX regimen in this patient 
population is expected to be 40%.  The intervention being studied will be considered promising if the survival probability increases by 20%.  The test hypothesis being considered in this study is H
0: p ≤ .40 vs. H 1: p ≥ 0.60.  Table 5.2.1 shows the probability of concluding Tac/MTX/Toc 
regimen is promising (the power) when the true Day 180 aGVHD- free survival probability with 
Tac/MTX/Toc regimen is 60% with a total sample size ranging from 175 to 235 using a one-sided Type I error of 0.10.

Control group sample 
size Total sample 
size Power  
140 175 0.80 
200 235 0.82 
 With 35 patients enrolled in the trial and 140 controls, there is 80% power to detect an improvement of 20% in Day 180 aGVHD-free survival and with 200 controls, there is 82% power. 
 
5.3 Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
 
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conducted on an ongoing basis , and if rates 
significantly exceed pre -set thresholds, the trial may be paused for further review.  The following 
guidelines serve as trigger for additional review and are not formal “stopping rules” that would 
mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.  
 The key safety endpoint for this study is graft failure at Day 60 post- transplant.  Graft failure will 
be monitored up to 60 days post-transplant.  For this safety endpoint, graft failure is defined as 
lack of engraftment in patients who are alive and disease- free 60 days post-transplant.   
 The expected graft failure rate at Day 60 is 5%, graft failure rate significantly higher than 5% is considered unacceptable.  .  A truncated S equential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) based on a 
binomial test of proportions for graft failure will be used as described below.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks for graft failure.  The SPRT can  be represented graphically.  At each interim analysis, the number of patients enrolled 
in the clinical trial is plotted against the number of patients who have experienced graft failure.  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by two parallel lines.  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive graft failure.  If the graph falls above the 
upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more graft 
failures than predicted by the n umber of recipients evaluable.  Otherwise, the SPRT continues 
until enrollment reaches the target goal.  
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
24 
  
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α  and β  of rejecting 
H0 when θ  = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ  = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|θi).  Note that since the test uses only the upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite 
sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level.  The test to be used 
in this protocol was developed from the following SPRT:    
• An SPRT contrasting 5% versus 20% graft failure, with nominal type I and II errors of 7% and 22%, respectively.   
• The slope of the parallel lines for monitoring graft failure is 0.110 and the intercepts are –0.925 and 1.547. 
 The stopping rule is summarized in Table 5.3.1    
Table 5.3.1 Stopping guidelines for graft failure at Day 60 among patients enrolled in trial 
 
* Stopping guideline is triggered if ≥ x recipients out of n experience graft failure 
     The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table 5.3.2, were 
determined in a simulation study.  The simulation assumed uniform accrual of 35 patients over a 24-month period.  Graft failure will be monitored in all patients in the Tac/MTX/Toc arm.  The 
SPRT rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% of the time when the true Day 60 graft failure is 5%, and 84% of the time when the true Day -60 graft failure is 20%.  This 
corresponds to a type I error rate of α = 0.05 and a type II error rate of β = 0.16.  When the true  
Day 60 graft failure rate is 20%, on average, the guideline will be triggered 13.3 months after opening, when 3.4 events have been observed in 17 patients.  Note that the SPRT procedure is adequately powered to distinguish between a graft failure rate of 5% and 20%.

 5.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease, disease specific risk categories, hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidit y index (HCT CI), donor type 
and HLA matching, donor/recipient CMV status, donor/recipient sex match, donor/recipient ABO match, and conditioning regimen.  Comparisons between group s will be performed for 
continuous variables via a Kruskal- Wallis test and for categorical variables, via the chi -square 
test. 
 
5.5 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
The primary outcome of the trial is grade 2 – 4 aGVHD- free survival (GFS) at 180 days after 
transplant.  Day 180 GFS probabilities with 90% confidence intervals will be estimated for the 
treatment group as well as the control using the Kaplan- Meier estimator.  The primary null 
hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference in GFS between the treatment arms at 180 days post-transplant .  The primary analysis will be performed using the difference in Kaplan -
Meier estimates for GFS at 180 days.  A 90% confidence interval for the difference in GFS at 180 days will also be constructed.   
 
5.6 Analysis of Secondary endpoints  
 
5.6.1 Acute GVHD  
 
Incidence of grades 2 -4 and 3- 4 acute GVHD at Day 100 and Day 180 will be estimated for each

will be compared between groups. 
 5.6.2 Chronic GVHD  
 
Incidence of chronic GVHD at 6 and 12 months will be estimated for each group using the 
cumulative incidence function treating death prior to chronic GVHD as the competing risk. Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be compared between groups using Gray’s test.  5.6.3 Hematologic Recovery  
 
Probabilities of achieving  an absolute neutrophil count ≥  500/mm
3, and transfusion independent 
platelet count >20,000/mm3 and >50,000/mm3 will be estimated using the cumulative incidence 
function treating death without the event as the competing risk.  Incidence of neutrophil and 
platelet engraftment will be compared between groups .

time from transplant to first evidence of laboratory recurrence or progression of primary disease 
according to standard criteria, death, or the last follow -up whichever occurs first.  Incidence of 
relapse/prog ression  at 6 and 12 months for each treatment group will be estimated using the 
cumulative incidence function treating  TRM as the competing risk. Incidence of 
relapse/progression will be compared between the two groups using Gray’s test.  
 5.6.6 Disease- free Survival (DFS) 
 The event for this endpoint is death or relapse/progression. The time to this event is from the time of transplant to death, relapse/progression, or the last follow -up whichever occurs first.  The

estimator.  DFS will be compared between the two treatment groups using the log- rank test.  
 
5.6.7 Overall Survival (OS) 
 The event is death from any cause. The time to this event is from the time of transplant to death 
or the last follow -up whichever occurs first.  The overall survival probabilities at Day 180 will be 
estimated for each group using the Kaplan- Meier estimator.  OS will be compared between the 
two treatment groups using the log- rank test.

Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see below), with no clinically 
significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites). Moderate chronic 
GVHD involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no major disability (maximum 
score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically significant 
functional impairm ent (maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be 
considered moderate chronic GVHD. Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by chronic 
GVHD (score of 3 in any organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe 
chronic GVHD.

C-1 
 Laboratory Correlatives 
Laboratory correlative for this clinical trials include evaluation of proinflammatory cytokines 
and immune reconstitution. The schedule of evaluations and blood volume required are listed below:   
 Baseline  7 14 21 28 100 180 365 
Immune reconstitution     30mL 30mL 30mL 30mL 
Proinflammatory Cytokines  10mL  10mL  10mL   10mL     
  
Proinflammatory Cytokines:  
Tocilizumab  blocks the activity of IL -6 and may interfere with further downstream pro 
inflammatory cascade. The clinical trial will evaluate levels of IL-4, IL -6, IL -10, IL -13, IL -17, 
interferon -gamma, tumor necrosis factor and soluble IL- 6 receptor  early in the study period.  
 
 
Post Transplant Immune Reconstitution 
 
The laboratory studies proposed to measure patient response to Tocilizumab treatment are based 
on the known activity of IL -6 in promoting inflammation and autoimmunity in both T and B 
cells.  While the effects of Tocilizumab on specific immune cell subsets has been described in patients with autoimmune disease, GVHD and its trea tment have profound effects on the 
immune system.  The additional effect of blocking the action of IL -6 in GVHD is not well 
described.  We will examine a number of immune cell populations to determine whether there is any correlation between clinical respo nse and immune parameters in this study.  Testing will be 
performed at  approximately  the following time points: day 28, day  100, day 180  and day 365 .  
The specific immune cell populations to be examined are as follows:  
1. B cell effects by assessment of antigen inexperienced B cells, and, transitional B cells, 
memory B cells, and plasma cells.  Specifically we will use multi- parameter flow cytometry 
measuring the level of expression of CD27, CD38, CD5, IgD, and IgM on the surface of CD19+ B cells.  Using these antibodies the following subsets can be defined:

GVHD and its therapy hinder immune reconstitution, and in SLE patients receiving Tocilizumab the presence of naïve T cells correlated with therapy response.  In contrast an increased number of effector T cells may be an indication that the disease process has not subsided.  In addition while NK cells are not typically considered to be a causative agent of GVHD, nor are they likely  to be 
affected by Tocilizumab, a subset of NK cells that express CD3 do display suppressor activity and may be elevated in patients responsive to Tocilizumab in our study.  To identify these subsets the following antibodies in combination are required: CD3, CD4, CD8, CCR7, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD56/CD16.

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING

Introduction 
 
Clinical trials that assess interventions in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation is challenging as the number of expected AEs is high. The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Network (BMT CTN) establish a capture an AE capture approach  specific 
for transplant trials. This approach has the objective of optimizing the capture of AEs, by reducing the noise -signal ratio and identifies AEs that are not expected after transplant or 
overlaps with manifestations of common complications, such as GVHD or graft failure.  
 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  (AE)  - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or 
procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a c ausal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can considered therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
 Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected  
• Expected adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current adverse event 
list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
• Unexpected adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency 
from information in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
 
  
Life-threatening Adverse Event – Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, 
in view of the investigator  or treating physician, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction. Study toxicities are graded using the adapted NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (where appropriate use the criteria for transplant patients.)  
    • Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death – regardless of cause.  
• life -threatening adverse event (see above). 
• persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• congenital anomaly. • requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
C-6 
   AE Grading: All AEs that oc cur in this protocol will be graded according to the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) v 4.0.  
 
AE Reporting: Depending on the type, severity and whether it is expected, each AE will 
need to be reported in an appropriate timeline to MCW IRB, Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee and FDA (if applicable for studies under an Investigational New Drug [IND] 
protocol).    
Adverse Events Reported to the DSMB  
All adverse events that are classified as grades 3 to 5 will be reported to the DSMC . The 
differences are the timing and amount of information associated with each.  
 
The two -tier approach collects adverse events at specific time points during the trial 
(calendar -driven) and event-driven upon knowledge of an event deemed serious (grades 3 
to 5) or unexpected to be seen in a transplant setting.  
 
Grades 3 -5 Adverse Events  
For the calendar-driven collection of toxicity, the protocol mandates collection of toxicity on a form that captures most of the most important toxicities observed post transplant. The forms would capture all the AEs that occur in a preceding period, for example day 28 toxicity form, collects all the AEs that occurred from enrollment to day 28 and the grade of each AE. This first period includes all non- hematologic toxicity, since it is expected 
significant hematologic toxicity will occur immediately  post transplant as an effect of the 
transplantation. Hematologic toxicity will be capture when it occurs beyond day 28 post transplant.  
 
Unexpected Grades 3 -5 
The threshold for collection of adverse events outside the calendar forms is related to the grade (grades 3 -5) and expectedness related to the transplant procedure or possibly 
related to the study drug. These events are required to be reported to the DSMC in a more immediate time frame and also require more information. For any adverse event that meets these criteria, the report would require a narrative of the event, associated 
laboratory and imaging information, associated medications and any relevant source documents. These reports are uploaded into Oncore and we will notify the DSMC chair and MCW IRB within  24 hours or 3 to 5 calendar days depending on the severity of the 
event.  Both the PI and the CTO BMT Section leader will be responsible to review and determine if an event meet criteria prior to uploading it in Oncore.   
 Reporting timelines: 
1. Fatal  (grade 5) or Life Threatening  events must be reported within 24 hours 
but not later than 3 calendar day of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event. 
 
2. All other events grades 3 -4 unexpected events (non- fatal/non life -threatening) 
must be reported within 3 to 5 calendar days of the investigator’s observation or 
awareness of the event.

The proposed method outlined here follows the same requirements from MCW IRB for prompt reporting of an event or Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks t o Subjects or 
Others (UPIRSO) : which is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 
1. Unanticipated (in terms of nature, severity , or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol- related documents, such as the IRB-
approved research protocol and informed consent document, instructions for 
Use/Device Manual and or Investigator’s Brochure; and (b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studies; 
2. Related or possibly related to pa rticipation in the research (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research ) or test article; and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized. 
 
DSMC Reporting  
 
The table below summarizes the reporting practices from the study to the DSMC. For the ongoing 
review of an opened trial, the DSMC will receive a report that includes in a tabular form all the grades 3 to 5 that occurred in the trial, summarized according to reporting periods: for example 0-
28d, 28-56d, 56 to 100d, 100-180d, 180-270d, 270 to 365d and 0-365d. Additionally the report 
will include all the unexpected grades 3 -5 that occurred in trial participants since activation of the 
trial and lastly the num ber of patients who met the graft failure stopping guidelines.  
 
For the unexpected grades 3 to 5, upon knowledge of the event, this will be discussed with the 
study PI and the CTO BMT section leader. If this fulfills criteria for expedited reporting to th e 
DSMC and IRB, a narrative will be uploaded in Oncore and the DSMC will be notified, either 
through its secretary or directly to the Chair.

 TOCILIZUMAB FOR THE PREVENTION OF DEPRESSION AND COGNITIVE 
CHANGES AMONG ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL 
TRANSPLANTATION RECIPIENTS  
 
An addendum to parent study “ PHASE II OPEN LABEL OF 
TACROLIMUS/METHOTREXATE AND TOCILIZUMAB FOR THE PREVENTION 
OF ACUTE GRAFT VERSUS HOST DISEASE AFTER ALLOGENEIC 
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION ” 
Principal Investigator: William R. Drobyski, MD  
 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Jennifer M. Knight, MD  
Co-Investigators: PI and Co- I’s of parent study  
 
1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Depression, cancer, and inflammation 
 
35-45% of cancer patients have emotional distress,1 with depression being a significant 
predictor of increased mortality among cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT ) recipients.
2, 3 Depression is associated with an elevation in pro- inflammatory 
cytokines, as is graft -versus -host disease ( GVHD), a significant source of morbidity and 
mortalit y for allogeneic HCT recipients.4, 5 It is unknown whether blocking inflammation 
associated wit h GVHD would also alleviate depressive symptoms in HCT patients.    
 Pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with infection or other diseases involving 
inflammation (i.e. GVHD) act on the brain to cause sickness  behavior, including 
depression.
6 Given the cytokine dysregulation involved in GVHD,5 it is mechanistically 
plausible that there may be onset or exacerbation of depressive symptoms in association with this disease, and in fact significant deficits in quality o f life (QOL) are associated 
with GVHD.
7 
 Specifically, IL -6 is consistently identified as a key cytokine implicated in inflammation -
associated mood dysregulation,
8-10 including among cancer patients.11, 12 Studies 
demonstrate that blocking other pro- inflammatory cytokine receptors associated with  
depression (i.e. TNF alpha) reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with high levels of infla mmation.
13 Despite accumulating evidence that inflammation and IL -6 play a role 
in mood alteration and depressive symptomatology, tocilizumab, an IL- 6 receptor  
antagonist, has never been evaluated for its possible role in improving mood or preventing deterioration of mood in association with pro- inflammatory states. This 
represents a novel approach for targeting depressive symptoms in an immunologically compromised population with a high degree of psychiatric morbidity. Though less robustly examined in the literature than depression, there is also indication that anxiety,
14, 
15 fatigue,16, 17 sleep,17 and pain18 are associated with alterations in IL -6. Therefore,  these 
additional cognitive components may also be affected by the administration of tocilizumab.

 1.2 Gene expression and inflammation in transplant  
 
Research suggests that ß -adrenergic s ignaling regulates many  cellular processes 
contributing to the initiation and progression of cancer,19 with the downstream effects of 
this signaling pathway reflected in the expression of a discrete grouping of genes comprising the conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) profile. This CTRA profile (53 inflammatory, interferon-related, and antibody- related genes) has been 
identified as overexpressed in other populations under conditions of chronic stress or adversity and is consistent with the physiology of stress -associated illness .
20 We recently 
identified that unrelated donor  HCT recipients exposed to the chronic stress of low 
socioeconomic status display significantly increased expression of ß- adrenergic s ignaling 
pathways as well as increased expressio n of the CTRA gene expression profile 
(manuscript under review). This increased expression wa s significantly associated with  
adverse clinical outcomes including increased relapse and decreased overall leukemia-free survival  (manuscript under review). Given the iterative and feedback dynamics 
involved in processes affecting expression of these ß -adrenergically -mediated gene 
expression  profile s, affecting periphera l inflammatory stimulation as occurs with 
tocilizumab may alter associated gene expression.  
 
1.3 Rap1 prenylation  
 
Rap1, a small GTPase, pla ys an important role in cell funct ion by regulating cell 
adhesion.
21-26 In this way, Rap1 suppresses metastasis by localizing at the plasma 
membrane of tumor cells through the process of prenylation, the post- translational 
attachment of a lipid tail to Rap 1. When Rap1 is localized at the plasma membrane of 
tumor cells, Rap1 promotes adhesion of the tumor cells and inhibits their metastatic spread.  In contrast, when Rap1 prenylation is inhibited, Rap1 cannot anchor at tumor cell 
membranes, resulting in loss of cell- cell adhesion and increased metastasis of tumor cells.  
Recently, it was discovered that prenylation of Rap1 is regulated by novel signaling 
pathways involving cAMP.
27, 28 Both cAMP  29-31 and Rap132, 33 have been found to 
participate in cellular responses to IL -6. These findings support the hypothesis that IL-6-
mediated signaling may affect the prenylation of Rap1 and alter the localization of 
prenylated Rap1 at the cellular  plasma membrane. Therefore, tocilizumab may alter Rap1 
prenylation and membrane localization, thereby suppressing the metastatic potential of tumor cells.  
 
1.4 Rationale 
 
Given that IL-6 is implicated in depressive symptomatology, t he current trial  aim is  to 
assess whether the immunomodulator and IL- 6 antagonist tocilizumab may be effective 
in reducing depressive symptoms among individuals undergoing allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation. Given additional evidence that anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain may also 
be associated with IL -6, we will examine the effect of tocilizumab on these symptoms as 
well. Further, given that IL- 6 is associated with ß-adrenergic signaling and Rap1 
prenylation, we will explore whether there are changes in gene expression pattern s and 
Rap1 prenylation in response to tocilizumab. These additional psychosocial, genetic, and 
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
C-16 
 biochemical assessments will leverage findings from the parent study “Phase II open 
label of tacrolimus/methotrexate and tocilizumab for the prevention of acute graft versus 
host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation”.  
 
2.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a non-randomized trial comparing the efficacy of tocilizumab to decrease 
depressive symptoms among a cohort of allogeneic HCT recipients. The intervention 
group is as described in the parent protocol “Phase II open label of tacrolimus/methotrexate and tocilizumab for the prevention of acute graft versus host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation”. Administration of tocilizumab will occur through the Medical College of Wisconsin HCT Program. Individuals participating in a longitudinal study evaluating the biobehavioral implications of allogeneic HCT at the Univer sity of Wisconsin -Madison (UW) will serve as controls 
for the psychosocial data. 165 allogeneic transplant participants with follow up QOL outcomes have been enrolled to date and none of them have received tocilizumab.   Participants will complete a batter y of self -report surveys at the following time points: 
baseline, day 28, day 100, and day 180 post-transplant in conjunction with scheduled data collection as part of the parent protocol (Table 1). These additional self-report surveys to be completed include: Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; 
depression and anxiety), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI; fatigue), Pittsburgh Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI; sleep), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; pain). Control participants from UW have also completed these surveys at the time points as described above. Blood samples will be collected at the above time points . Two tubes of blood will be drawn at 
each time point: a PAXGene RNA tube  and an 8.0 mL BD Vacutainer CPT tubes  (Table 
1). These tubes will be used to describe RNA expression
34 and prenylation27, 
respectively .  
 2.1 Primary Objective   
The primary objective of this ancillary study is to compare depressive symptoms among 
allogeneic HCT recipients receiving tocilizumab to a control group of allogeneic HCT 
recipients who did not receive tocilizumab. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
Secondary objectives of this ancillary study are:  
 
1) To compare levels of anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and pain between allogeneic HCT recipients who received prophylactic tocilizumab  vs. allogeneic HCT recipients who did 
not receive tocilizumab (UW control cohort). 2) To describe gene expression and Rap1 prenylation among allogeneic HCT recipients receiving prophylactic tocilizumab.

 2.3 Patient Eligibility  
 
2.3.1-2.3.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria same as parent study.  
 2.3.3 Eligiblity for the Control Arm  Consistent with eligibility criteria for the control arm study being done at UW , eligible 
participants are adult allogeneic transplant recipients who have been followed for at least 6 months post-transplant.     2.4 – 2.8 Donor Selection, Treatment Plan, Supportive Care, Participant Risk, Study Drug Information same as parent study.  
3.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
(In addition to those of parent study) 
 
3.1 Primary endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint of this ancillary study  is to compare depressive symptoms at day 
28 post-transplant for a group of allogeneic HCT recipients who receive tocilizumab as compared to a control group of allogeneic recipients not receiving tocilizumab. This will be add ressed through the General Depression subscale of the IDAS and includes 20 
questions with a scoring range of 20-100 (mean in community dwelling adult of 44.99 and standard deviation of 14.75).
35  
 
3.2 Secondary endpoints 
 
The secondary  endpoints of this ancillary study are 1) to compare depressive symptoms 
at day 100 and day 180 as well as anxiety,  fatigue,  sleep,  and pain  at day 28, day 100, and 
day 180 post-transplant for a group of allogeneic HCT recipients who receive tocilizumab as compared to a contro l group of allogeneic recipients not receiving tocilizumab; and 2) 
to describe gene expression and Rap1 prenylation among allogeneic HCT recipients receiving prophylactic tocilizumab at baseline, day 28, day 100, and day 180.  
QOL  outcomes: 
• Depression: As described in section 3.1. 
• Anxiety:  Anxiety  will be assessed using two subscale items of the IDAS including 
panic ( health population mean = 12.58, SD = 5.26) and traumatic intrusions 
(healthy population mean = 7.60, SD = 4.20).35 
• Fatigue:  The FSI will b e utilized to assess fatigue; a score of 3 or greater on items 
assessing fatigue in the past week (average of i tems 1 -3; FSI C omposite) indicate s 
clinically meaningful fatigue.36, 37 The FSI can also be evaluated using the average 
rating of the degree to w hich fatigue interfered with some general activities (0 -10; 
FSI Interference); participants’ ratings of the number of days in the past week they felt fatigued (0 -7; FSI Days); and participants’ rating of what percent of each 
day in the past week, on average, they felt fatigued (0-100; FSI Percent).

 Individuals scoring at or above the cutoff also report significantly greater scores 
on these other subscales. 
• Sleep:  Sleep will be assessed using the PSQI, with a score of >5 considered 
disturbed sleep as adjusted for cancer populations.38, 39  
• Pain:  The BPI assesses pain intensity as well as pain -related interference in 
function40, 41 BPI Pain Severity score ranges from 0 -40 (first four items), and the 
BPI Pain Interference score is a mean of the last 7 items (5a- 5g) with a range of 0 -
10. 
 Biological outcomes:  
• Gene expression:  Description of transcription factor binding motifs and CTRA 
gene expression levels will be described at all study time points.  
• Rap1 prenylation: Western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of 
isolated PBMCs will determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions as well as  the status of Rap1 prenylation. 
 
 
4.0 ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 Patient enrollment  same as parent stu dy. 
 
4.2 Guidelines for serious adverse event reporting  same as the parent study. 
Additionally, should patients endorse any thoughts of suicidality or self harm per the IDAS, the study PI for this ancillary protocol (Dr. Jennifer Knight) will contact them by 
phone. Should completion of the study surveys prompt participants to want treatment for any of the other symptoms, participants will be offered a referral for appropriate care through the Quality of Life Center at the Froedtert Cancer Center.  
 4.3 Study monitoring same as parent study. Psychosocial data and two additional tubes of blood will be collected as described above.   
4.4 Specimen collection  
 
A clinical research coordinator will collect  blood to be stored in two different tubes, a 
PAXGene RNA tub e and a 8.0 mL BD Vacutainer CPT tube,  at baseline, day 28, day 
100, and day 180 post-transplant. The PAXGene RNA tube  will be stored at -80C in the 
Neuroscience Research Center until they are batched and shipped to UCLA for gene expression analysis.  The 8.0 mL BD Vacutainer CPT tube will be sent to Dr. Carol 
Williams’ laboratory for storage  at -80C until Western blot analysis is done to assess 
Rap1 prenylation.  
4.5 Psychosocial assessments 
 
Participants will complete assessments to evaluate depression, a nxiety, fatigue, sleep and 
pain. The primary endpoint of this ancillary study is to compare depression at baseline 
and day 28, day 100, and day 180 and the secondary endpoints are to compare anxiety,  
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
C-19 
 fatigue,  sleep,  and pain  at these same time points. These self -report surveys include: 
Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS; depression and anxiety), Fatigue 
Symptom Inventory (FSI; fatigue), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; sleep), and 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; pain). Participants will also  provide information about income 
and education level at their baseline visit.  
 
4.6 Gene expression profiling  
 
The UCLA Social Genomics Core (Directed by Dr. Steve Cole, Professor, 
Hematology/Oncology, UCLA ) will conduct all gene expression profiling on obtained 
blood samples by using Illumina HT-12 human gene expression bead arrays 42. Total 
RNA will be extracted from the whole blood samples stored at MCW, subjected to quality assurance assays to test suitable mass (by spectroscopy) and integrity (by Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA Integrity Score) for analysis, and subjected to microarray target synthesis and hybridization in collaboration with the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core Laboratory using standard Illumina assay equipment and protocols. The output of 
these analyses is quantification of whole genome RNA production. 
 
4.7 Rap1 prenylation 
 
PBMCs  will be isolated from the whole blood samples collected from patients at all time 
points. Members of Dr. Carol Willia ms’ laboratory (Professor, Pharmacology and 
Toxicology, MCW) will conduct Western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs to determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions, and the status of Rap1 prenylation in the cells.  
 5.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Sample size justification  
The sample sizes of 35 patients treated with tocilizumab and 165 control patients are 
determined by the parent studies. With this sample size, our study will have 80% power to detect a 0.53 standard deviation (SD) difference between the two groups at a two-sided 5% significance level. For the primary outcome, assuming a standard deviation of 11 (based on preliminary analysis of the data from the UW cohort), differences of 5.8 points or more on the day 28 General Depression subscale of the IDAS will be detectable. This difference is almost half of the 11 point difference seen between population controls and psychiatric clinic patients.
35 
 
Descriptive analyses  
Demographic characteristics to be described for each group will include age, race, 
gender , Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), body mass index (BMI), comorbidity index 
(HCT -CI), and socioeconomic status (as defined by income and education level). 
Additional medical characteristics to be described for each group include disease, disease 
status, CMV status, conditioning regimen intensity, donor and HLA match, GVHD 
prophylaxis, and graft type. Categorical data will be presented by frequencies and 
Tac/Mtx/Toc for GVHD prophylaxis   Protocol v 8.0, Dated November 12 , 2015  
C-20 
 percentages. Descriptive summary statistics (e.g . frequency, mean, median, range and 
standard deviation) will be used to present numeric data. 
 
5.1 Analysis of primary e ndpoint  
 
SAS 9.3 or newer (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) will be used to analyze study data. We will 
conduct a one-way analyses of covarianc e (ANCOVA) including data from both control 
and intervention conditions while controlling for baseline depressive symptoms and development or presence of aGVHD to compare scores on the depressive scale of IDAS (primary objective).   
 5.2 Analysis of seconda ry endpoints  
 
5.2.1 QOL outcomes 
 
We will compare  anxiety , fatigue, sleep, and pain (secondary objectives) at all time 
points , as well as depressive symptoms at the two additional time -points via repeated 
measures linear model using all time points simultaneously while controlling for baseline status on each factor.  A mixed effects model with a random subject effect will be used, 
and the inference will focus on contrasts describing within- timep oint differences. 
Additional exploratory regression analyses adjusting for covariates that differ between the two groups will be performed. If the groups differ on more than 1- 2 covariates, 
propensity-score based adjustment will be used to reduce the number of variables in the regression models for the outcome. The same covariates, demographic, and medical characteristics as described in Section 5.0 will be used. No adjustment for multiple testing will be performed in these exploratory analyses.  
 
5.2.2 Gene  expression profiling  
 
Levels of ß-adrenergic mediated gene expression, transcription factor binding motifs, and 
CTRA gene expression profiles will be described for all study participants; baseline 
levels may be compared to later time points.  
 
5.2.3 Rap1 prenylation 
 
Western blotting on the cytosolic and membrane fractions of isolated PBMCs will determine the distribution of Rap1 in the different fractions as well as the status of Rap1 prenylation in collected  cells. Baseline Rap1 prenylation will be assessed by the first 
blood draw and may be compared to later time points.

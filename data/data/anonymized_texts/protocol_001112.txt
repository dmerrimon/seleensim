Data Analysis Plan   
The follow ing analysis populations will be defined for the study:  
 
• Intent -to-Measure (ITM) Population –  The ITM population will consist of 
all subjects who are enrolled in the study and for which the ability of each 
measurement device to measure the subject has been  established.  
 
• Safety Population – The safety population will consist of all subjects who 
are enrolled in the study . 
 
The ITM population will be the primary analysis set for all effectiveness analyses.  
The safety population will be used for the analysis of all safety variables and 
baseline characteristics.  
 
For each effectiveness endpoint, the BioStamp nPoint measurements will be 
compared to the noted comparator device or to independent observer 
measurements.  
 
For pairs of measurements collected on the co ntinuous scale (quantitative to 
quantitative comparisons), scatter plots with the 45 degree line of agreement 
superimposed will be constructed from paired observations from the two sources 
(BioStamp nPoint vs comparator) along with Bland- Altman plots of the data.  The 
mean absolute error (MAE) and the root -mean- square error (RMSE) estimates of 
agreement will be calculated for each comparison.  The standard deviations of 
each of the agreement measures will also be computed.   
 
For pairs of measurements colle cted on a categorical scale (qualitative to 
qualitative comparisons), two- way tables of agreement will be constructed for 
each comparison.  The agreement percentage will be computed for each table.  
 
The number and percentage of sensor patches in each categ ory of the adhesion

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Objective and validated assessments of physiological metrics are critical for monitoring  data and data 
trends , and as an aid to assessing disease progression and subsequent therapeutic intervention.  In 
current clinical practice and medical product development, patient historical data, patient -reported 
outcomes, and in- clinic assessments by physicians are used to evaluate biometric s, but these evaluations  
are time and context limited and present an incomplet e picture of the subject as well as his/her  current 
condition.   Some assessments are subjective, or rely on a patient’s memory and perception.  Other 
assessments are limited to a specific time interval in a particular environment, like a clinic, preventing 
accurate longitudinal assessment of fluctuations in physiologic al parameters.  This is particularly true of 
measurements taken by large stationary  clinical instruments, which may limit not only the setting for the 
measurement but may also affect the subject and change the outcome of the measurement itself.  
Wearable sensors have the potential to enable longitudinal, objective monitoring of clinical signs  across 
patient populations, but conventional wearable devices are typically comprised of rigid, packaged 
electronics, which may compromise overall subject  comfort , are often plainly visible when worn in public, 
and can interfere with activities of daily living and sleep.  Finally, emergence of smartphone and wrist -
based sensing has led to potential improvements in access and ease of use, but t hemselves carr y 
limitations in night -time sensing or in creating lower -extremity insight.  Consequently, there is a need for 
assessment tools that are unobtrusive and provide clinical quality, medical grade continuous 
assessments  from multiple body locations.    
Conformal,  body -worn sensors may provide an easy -to-use and objective alternative.  Previously, studies 
have shown that wearable sensors can be used to provide greater insight into neurological (e.g. 
Parkinson’s disease1, Huntington’s disease2, multiple sclerosis3), sleep4 (e.g. periodic limb movements, 
respiration), cardiac monitoring5 and orthopedics (e.g . physical rehabilitation6) movement and biopotential 
measurements. These studies have demonstrated that data can be collected in an unobtrusive way in 
remote settings, supporting the possibility of providing more robust, data- based evidence to the clinician 
and thus to the patient.  
The BioStamp nPoint  system combines a t raditional, electronic platform for collecting Patient Reported 
Outcomes with multiple , location- agnostic  sensors in an adhesive bandage- like form factor . These 
sensors are flexible enough to conform to the human body and eliminate the profound mismatch in 
physical properties at the interface between conventional wearable devices and the human body.  This  
new class of soft, conformal electronics and sensors interface better with the surface of  the body to 
minimize discomfort and optimize skin coupling over prolonged use and multiple data- gathering locations . 
The potential for  both in- clinic and remote,  longitudinal, multi- sensor, multi -modal, passive and prescribed 
biometric data tracking is noteworthy.    
This first clinical evaluation aims to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and ease of use of the BioStamp 
nPoint  system  as well as the safety , fidelity  and tolerability of the BioStamp nPoint  Sensors.  
2.0 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The BioStamp nPoint  system is a wireless remote monitoring platform intended for use by healthcare 
professionals and researchers for the continuous collection of physiological data in home and healthcare 
settings. The system is designed principally for dat a collectio n during research studies al though may be 
used wherever and whenever collection of the relevant data is needed.  
 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  14 
Confidential  
 
Figure 1: Illustration  of BioStamp nPoint Sensor  
The BioStamp nPoint  system centers on body -worn Wearable Sensor Patches ( “Sensors”, “ WSPs ”) which 
can be worn in both in clinic  (“supervised”)  and remote (“unsupervised”)  settings for up to 24 hours  at a 
time, and can be worn repeatedly for multiple days . Study facilitators (either researchers or physicians) 
set up data collection studies using a web- based study configuration tool, called the Web Portal.  For in -
clinic uses, the BioStamp nPoint  system includes a n Investigator  Tablet Application that study facilitators 
use to connect to and configure Sensor s. When used at home, study subjects interact with the system 
through a Mobile Phone Application, the Link App .  The Link Hub is used to charge and synchronize data 
from the Sensors .  The BioStamp nPoint  system includes an algorithm package that delivers processed 
metrics on general activity classification, heart rate, heart rate variability, posture, sleep, and respiration 
during sleep.  
2.1 Principles of Operation  
When the facilitator configures the study design via the Web Portal, the study configuration is 
transferred to the Investigator Tablet App (and Link App for remote studies).  The Investigator Tablet 
App and Link App are automatically configured for the specific study d esign, and when connected to 
Sensor s, configure them per the study design. When user entered data including activity annotations 
and survey answers are sent from the Investigator Tablet App or Link  App, the data travel to an 
MDDS storage system and are  then accessible to facilitators via th e Web Portal, which pulls the data 
from the MDDS storage system.  Sensor  data is transferred to the MDDS s torage through the Link 
Hub and Link App. If the algorithm package was activated in the study, the algorithm module retrieves 
the data from the MDDS, processes the data and generates metrics that are returned to the MDDS 
system for storage. Study facilitators can access all study data (raw and processed) through the Web 
Portal.  
2.2 Indication s for Use  
The BioStamp nPoint  system is a wireless remote monitoring system intended for use by researchers 
and healthcare professionals for continuous collection of physiological data in home and healthcare 
settings. These physiological data include heart rate, heart rate variability , respiration rate, activity 
(including step count and activity classification), and posture (body position relative to gravity). The 
system is also intended for measurement of surface electromyography and to monitor limb or body 
movements during daily liv ing and sleep. Data is transmitted wirelessly from the Sensors for storage 
and analysis.  
 
The device is intended for use on general care patients who are 18 years of age or older as a general 
patient monitor to provide physiological information. The data f rom the BioStamp nPoint  system are 
intended for use by researchers and healthcare professionals for research applications or, at the 
discretion of a qualified healthcare professional, as an aid to diagnosis and treatment. The device is 
not intended for use on critical care patients.

The purpose of this pivotal study  is to evaluate the performance, usability, and reliability of the BioStamp 
nPoint  system for continuous collection of physiological data in remote (in- home) and healthcare (in-
clinic) settings.  
The primary objective of the clinical investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of  the BioStamp nPoint  
system algorithm measurements and to e valuate t he adhesion (reliability) of the Sensor s. 
 
Safety and tolerability will be further  assessed via a follow -up telephone call.   
4.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Effectiveness  Endpoints  
The effectiveness endpoints for this study are the various types of measurements made by the 
BioStamp nPoint system. All effectiveness endpoints to be statistical ly summarized will be collected 
using the BioStamp nPoint during in clinic supervised use.  The effectiveness endpoints are as 
follows:  
 
o Heart Rate (bpm)  
o Heart Rate Variability (RMSSD3 (msec) and L F/HF Ratio4)

one minute average heart rate, RMSSD and five minute L F/HF ratio from the Actiheart device on 
each of six recor ding times for each subject.  Two readings will be taken while the subject is at 
rest, two while exercising and two while lying down.  
 
For respiration rate, the average sleep  respiration rate values will be collected at one minute time 
intervals during two separate nights of sleep on each subject using both the BioStamp nPoint  and 
the Capnostream while the subject is asleep.   
 
For the activity classification variable, each su bject will be presented with five tasks (standing, 
sitting, lying, walking and stationary bike riding) in varied order and the activity classification will 
be recorded by the BioStamp nPoint and by the independent observer.  This procedure will be 
repeated five times for each subject.  
 
For the exercise parameter number of steps taken, the number of steps taken by the subject 
during a 6 minute walk test will be recorded using both the BioStamp nPoint and a simple step 
counting device.  
 
For the sleep parameters sleep onset time and wake time, the BioStamp nPoint values and 
independent observer values will be collected on each night at the study site.   
 
Posture classification variables will be analyzed separately for each type of posture activity (sleep 
positions, stationary posture standing and stationary posture sitting). For a given posture activity, 
the posture classification will be recorded by the BioStamp nPoint and the independent observer 
for two repeats each of each ground- truth posture for each subject.  Since sleep position and 
lying posture are identical, this variable will be assessed from awake subjects to ensure that all 
postures are represented. Each repeat will generate 5 independent observations of posture. The 
posture cl assifications for each posture classification variable are given in Table 2. 
Table 2: Posture Variable and Classification  
Index  Posture Variable  Posture Classification  
1 Sleep positions  Supine, prone, left side and right side  
2 Stationary Posture Standing  Upright, lean left, lean right, lean back, lean forward  
3 Stationary Posture Sitting  Upright, lean left, lean right, lean back, lean forward  
 
In addition, sensor adhesion to the subject will be measured on a 4 point scale by the 
independent observer for each of four sensor patches on each subject following 24 hours of 
continuous wear.  The adhesion rating scale (Table 3) is as follows:  
 
Table 3: Sensor Adhesion Rating Scale  
Score  Rating  Description  
0 = ≥90% adhered  essentia lly no Sensor lift off the skin  
1 = ≥75% to <90% adhered  some edges only of the Sensor lifting off the 
skin 
2 = ≥50% to <75% adhered  less than half of the Sensor lifting off the skin  
3 = >0% to <50% adhered but not 
detached  more than half of the Sensor lifting  off the skin 
without falling off  
4 = 0% adhered – Sensor detached  Sensor completely off the skin

Usability will also be assessed by the clinician observing the subject using the system and via a 
subject questionnaire.  
 
4.2 Safety 
All adverse events (AEs) reported during the evaluation period will be collected and summarized.  
Serious AEs (SAEs) will be reported in accordance with US Code of Federal Regulation 
requirements.  
5.0 STUDY DEVICES  
The materials presented in Table 4 are the devices required for the supervised  and remote evaluation 
periods.   In addition to the investigational device, a Heart Rate Reference D evice and a Respiration 
Reference Device will be used in this study , and will be applied to the subject as shown in Figure 2.  
Identification as well as t raceability for each investigational and reference device at the study site will be 
maintained by  serial number.  
 
The Actiheart ( K052489, CamNtech Inc.,  Cambridge, UK ), used here as the Heart Rate Reference 
device,  is a commercially -available, FDA -cleared, chest -worn monitoring device that records heart rate, 
Inter-Beat-Interval (IBI), and physical activity.  It is designed for calculating and measuring h eart rate and 
Energy Expenditure in free living.  The Actiheart has two clips which attach directly to standard ECG 
electrodes. Usually one electrode is adhered at V1 or V2 (4th intercostal) and the second electrode is 
placed approximately 10cm away on the left side at V4 or V5, although this placement can be adjusted to 
be more comfortable for the subject. The number of R -waves detected is recorded, and an internal 
accelerometer senses the frequency and intensity of the subject's torso movements.  
 
The Capnostream Portable Respiratory Monitor  (K150272, Medtronic Inc.,  Dublin, IE ) used here as the 
Respiration Reference device, is a commercially -available, FDA -approved, bedside , combined  
capnography/pulse oximetry  monitor, capable of providing a complete picture of oxygenation and 
ventilation by monitoring a subject ’s: 
 
• End tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) -  level of carbon dioxide in exhaled breath.  
• Respiratory rate (RR).  
• Fractional inspired carbon dioxide (FiCO2) -  level of carbon dioxi de present during inhalation.  
• Oxygen saturation (SpO2).  
• Pulse rate (PR).  
 
It is intended to provide professionally trained health car e providers the continuous, non- invasive 
measurement and monitoring of carbon dioxide concentration of the expired and inspired breath and 
respiration rate, and for the continuous non- invasive monitoring of functional oxygen saturation of arterial 
hemoglobin (SpO2 and pulse rate).    
 
Additionally, a commercially -available manual “tally” counter will be used for counting steps.

Confidential  
8.2 Subject Identification  
Each subject will be assigned a unique subject number.  Subject numbers will not be reassigned or 
reused for any reason.  Only their assigned subject number, initials, and date of birth should identify 
subjects to the Sponsor.  The investigator must maintain a list of potential subjects and enrolled 
subjects using the Subject Screening/Enrollment Log.  At a minimum, this log is faxed (or emailed) to 
the Sponsor each week.  S ite will also maintain a Subjec t ID List in the PI’s records ensuring that  
subjects may be identified in case of product recalls or safety issues.  
 
Any potential subjects who are pre- screened can be added to the log by recording their screening 
number and initials only. Those who sign the ICF will be assigned a five- digit sequen tial number. The 
first two digits will represent the site number (i.e., 01) and the remaining three digits are a sequential 
patient number (i.e., 001, 002, 003, etc.). Therefore, the fourth subject screened at site number one 
will be Subject #01004.  
8.3 Recru itment 
Participants will be recruited via an established database at the clinical site, use of IRB approved 
flyers and posting on the clinical site website .  The completely voluntary nature of participation will be 
underscored.  
8.4 Subject  Eligibility, Pre -Screening and Exclusions  
Subjects will be asked to participate in this study and will be screened for study eligibility.   Each 
subject will receive an anonymized subject identification number at time of screening that will serve 
as the subject’s identifier th roughout the study.   A Screening/Enrollment Log will be maintained by the  
study site, in order to maintain a cumulative tracking of all screened subject s.  
8.5 Written Informed Consent 
Subject s who pass initial pre- screening will be asked to sign the study -specific Informed Consent 
form before any study -specific tests or procedures are performed.  A member of the research team  
will inform the potential subject  of the elements of the clinical study including, risks, potential benefits 
and required procedures prior to obtaining the potential subject ’s informed consent.

termination procedures will be completed for all withdrawn subjects.  All records of enrolled but 
withdrawn subjects will be retained as part of the study.  
 
8.8 Study  Assessments – In Clinic – Visit 1 (Supervised ) 
During the supervised evaluation period, subjects wil l arrive at the study clinic on Day 0.  After 
admission to the clinic, but before the start of the evaluation period, a skin inspection of planned 
sensor application sites will be conducted.   
The clinical site staff will provision  Sensors, a Link Hub, and a Link App phone to the subject  using 
the Link App. They will then apply four Sensors  and reference device sensors  to the subject . Two of 
these Sensors will be applied following instructions on the Link App; the other two are for assessing 
adhesion only, and will be applied following written instructions .  
Site staff will  then initiate and monitor the prescribed activities for the supervised  portion of the study.  
The prescribed acti vities consist of general tasks:  sitting, standing, lying down, leaning, walking,  and 
biking .  The site staff will instruct the subject throughout the evaluation.  
For each of the prescribed activities, the site staff will start an annotation in the MC10 Link App to 
indicate that the subject is starting to perform an activity and will stop the annotation after a specific 
period of time when the subject has completed the activity.  Each annotation will be tagged with a 
letter and a number. The letter and number used for the annotation of each activity performed will be 
noted on the CRF. The followi ng activities will be conducted as prescribed in sections  8.8.2  - 8.8.7.  
8.8.1  Application of the Heart Rate Reference Device  
The Heart Rate Reference Device will be applied as described in Section 5.0 , following the 
manufacturer’s IFU , 30 minutes prior to the start of study activities to allow for  sensor to body 
continuity.  Heart rate will be monitored throughout the study including during the activities in 
Table 7 and Table 8.  
8.8.2  BioStamp nPoint Sensor Application  
The cli nician will apply  sensors (turned off, no signal data) to the shank and forearm, and 
functional sensors to the chest , aligned to 60 degrees    from the transverse plane with the battery 
end pointed upwards  (left nipple to right shoulder) , and thigh, aligned vertically on the central 
thigh with the battery end pointed upwards , as prescribed by the BioStamp nPoint  system IFU.

(at least 1 phone call to the subject  on each of 2 separate days ), and document his/her effort (date 
and summary of the phone call in the source documents)  to complete the final evaluation. All results 
of these evaluations and observations, together with a narrative description of the reason(s) for 
discontinuing the subject, must be recorded in the source documents.  The Study Termination Case 
Report Form ( CRF) must document the primary reason for withdrawal or disconti nuation .   
10.0 Risk / Benefit Analysis  
10.1 Benefits  
There are no direct benefits for  the subjects  participating in this study . However, the knowledge 
gained from this study may  be important for improving short  and long - term patient monitoring and 
providing subjective data, both  in the clinic and remotely, for capturing physiological metrics that may 
aid researchers and healthcare professionals . 
10.2 Risks  
The risks of the investigational procedure to subject s are expected to be minimal under this protocol  
and are described in Section 14.5.  
The BioStamp nPoint  system sensor includes  a non- invasive biosensor that is attached to the surface 
of the skin using an adhesive sticker, and is designed to measure movement, heart rate, h eart rate 
variability,  and sleep metrics using embedded accelerometer, gyroscope, and electrodes.  The study 
is designed to assess the system’s ability to capture and analyze movement, heart rate, heart rate 
variability, and sleep.   
This is the first clinical trial for this device.  The study will enroll healthy subjects at one study site in 
the United States.   
The device will not be used in this study as an implant; it will not be used to support or sustain human 
life; it will not be of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human health in this study; and the use in this study will not 
otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, saf ety, or welfare of a subject.  H arm 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  30 
Confidential  
resulting from use of the device is not considered a serious risk.  In addition, no other study 
procedures will be performed that would place the subjects at significant risk.   As indicated in Section 
14.5, s kin irritation is an anticipated risk .  
The BioStamp nPoint  system is Non -Significant Risk under the proposed investigational study based 
on a comprehensive risk analysis per Investigational Device E xemptions, 21 C.F.R. § 812.3(m) 
(2016) and proposed use of the device10.  
10.3 Minimization of Risk and Monitoring Procedures  
MC10  has attempted to mitigate risks as much as possible through product design, testing , and 
through careful labeling and instructions for use. Risks will be further mitigated through selection of 
qualified physicians, appropriate training, and study monitoring ensured by the following:  
• Investigators who participate in the study will be experienc ed and skilled in collection of 
physiological data . Additionally, investigators, in conjunction with the investigational site, will 
have adequate resources for participation in a clinical study.    
• Each investigator will ensure oversight and approval of the study by an Institutional Review 
Board  (IRB)  prior to initiation of the clinical study at his/her investigational site.   
• The investigator and study personnel will be trained on the clinical protocol , investigational 
device and Instructions for Use.   
• Subjects will be carefully evaluated against the inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to entering 
the clinical study to ensure that their diagnosis and medical status are appropriate for 
participation i n the clinical study.   
• Subjects will be monitored throughout the follow -up period as  defined in the study protocol.   
• Any adverse events occurring during the time of the investigational procedure will be closely 
monitored and the subject  shall be followed until resolution or is judged to be chronically 
stable, and any deleterious trends investigated as early as possible.   
11.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
11.1 Introduction  
The study is a non- significant risk, prospective, non- randomized study of the perfor mance 
characteristics of the BioStamp nPoint device in healthy adult subjects.  Subjects will be enrolled in 
the trial for approximately 48 hours.  The primary objectives of the statistical analyses are to evaluate 
the agreement of the BioStamp nPoint measurements to commonly accepted measurement 
standards.   
A study center is defined as a hospital or medical office under the control and supervision of the 
Principal Investigator.   
11.2 Sample Size  
The sample size of n=25 subjects is sufficient to meet business needs of the Sponsor and is 
comparable to the size of studies with similar devic es.  An additional 5 subjects may be enrolled to 
account for a 20 % dropout rate.   
11.3 Effectiveness Variables  
The effectiveness endpoints for this study are the various types of measurements made by the 
BioStamp nPoint system. All effectiveness endpoints to be statistically summarized will be collected 
using the BioStamp nPoint during the supervised- use phase.  The effectiveness endpoints are as 
follows:  
 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  31 
Confidential  
o Heart Rate (bpm)  
o Heart Rate Variability (RMSSD5 (msec) and L F/HF Ratio6) 
o Respiration (average respiration rate)  
o Activity Classification (activities –  standing, sitting, lying, walking and other)  
o Activity Parameters - total step counts in a 6 minute walk test  
o Sleep (sleep onset time (hours, minutes, and seconds), sleep wake time (hours, minutes, 
and seconds))  
o Posture Classification (sleep posture, stationary posture standing, stationary posture 
sitting)  
 
For each endpoint, the BioStamp nPoint  measurements will be compared to a similar FDA 
approved measurement device, to other basic  or manual  measurement devices , or to 
independent observer measurements.  The FDA approved measurement devices for this study 
are the Actiheart heart rate reference device and the Capnostream portable respiratory monitor.  
Table 10 displays the comparator method for each endpoint category.  
Table 10: Endpoint Variable Group and Measurement Comparator  
Index  Endpoint Variable Group  Measurement Comparator

2 Heart Rate Variability  Actiheart Device  
3 Respiration  Capnostream Device  
4 Activity Classification  Independent Observer  
5 Activity Parameters  Manual Step Counting Device  
6 Sleep Parameters  Independent Observer  
7 Posture  Independent Observer  
 
Individual independent observers will receive training on the operation of all devices and 
execution of the study protocol before the enrollment of any subjects.   
 
For heart rate and heart rate variability, the values collected will be the one minute average heart 
rate, the one minute RMSSD , and the five- minute LF/HF ratio from the BioStamp nPoint  and the 
one minute average heart rate, the one minute RMSSD , and five minute L F/HF from the Actiheart 
device on each of six recording times for each subject.  Two readings will be taken while the 
subject is at rest, two while exercising and two while lying down.  These readings will be collected 
during the activities listed in Table 7 and Table 8. 
 
For respiration rate, the average resting respiration rate values will be collected at one minute 
time intervals during sleep  on each subject using both the BioStamp nPoint  and the Respirat ion 
Reference Device .   
  
For the activity classification variable, each subject will be presented with five tasks (standing, 
sitting, lying, walking and stationary bike riding) in varied order and the activity classification will 
be recorded by the BioSta mp nPoint and by the independent observer.  This procedure will be 
repeated five times for each subject.  
 
                                                 
 
5 RMSSD: root -mean- square of successive difference of the time intervals between successive heartbeats.  
6 LF/HF ratio: the ratio of power in the low -frequency (LF, 0.04- 0.15 Hz) and high- frequency (HF, 0.15- 0.4 Hz) bands of heart rate 
variability in the frequency domain.  
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  32

For the exercise parameter “ number of steps taken” , the number of steps taken by the subject 
during a 6 minute walk test will be recorded using both the BioStamp nPoint and a simpl e step 
counting device.  This procedure will be repeated five times for each subject.  
 
For the sleep parameters sleep onset time and wake time, the BioStamp nPoint values and 
independent observer values will be collected on each night  and morning at the study site.   
 
Posture classification variables will be analyzed separately for each type of posture activity (sleep 
positions, stationary posture standing and stationary posture sitting). For a given posture activity, 
the posture classification will be recorded by the BioStamp nPoint and the independent observer 
for two repeats each of each ground- truth posture for each subject. Each repeat will generate 5 
independent observations of posture. The posture classifications for each posture classi fication 
variable are given in Table 11. 
 
 
Table 11: Posture Variable vs Classification  
Index  Posture Variable  Posture Classification  
1 Simulated s leep positions  Supine, prone, left side and right side  
2 Stationary Posture Standing  Upright, lean left, lean right, lean back, lean forward  
3 Stationary Posture Sitting  Upright, lean left, lean right, lean back, lean  forward  
 
Sensor adhesion to the subject will be measured on a 4 point scale by the independent observer 
for each of four sensor patches on each subject following 24 hours of continuous wear.  The 
adhesion rating scale  is presented in Table 3.  
 
11.4 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined for the study:  
 
• Intent -to-Measure (ITM) Population – The ITM population will consist of all subjects who are 
enrolled in the study and for which the ability of each measurement device to measure the 
subject has been established.  
 
• Safety Population – The safety population will consist of all subjects who are enrolled in the 
study . 
 
The ITM population will be the primary analysis set for all effectiveness analyses.  The safety 
population will be used for the analysis of all safety variables and baseline characteristics.  
11.5 Analysis Subgroups  
There is no subgroup analysis planned for the study.  
11.6 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
11.6.1  Disposition and Demographics  
A table will be constructed with counts and percentages of the number of subjects who were 
screen failures, the number of subjects enrolled in the study, the number of su bjects withdrawn 
from the study before study completion, and the number who completed the study.  For those 
subjects who withdrew before completion of the study, counts and percentages of the reasons for 
withdrawal will be tabulated.   
 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  33 
Confidential  
The continuous demographic characteristics at screening will be summarized for all subjects in 
the safety population using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and number of non- missing observations).  The categorical baseline character istics 
will be summarized for the safety population using frequency counts and percentages.  
11.6.2  Effectiveness Endpoint Analyses  
For pairs of measurements collected on the continuous scale (quantitative to quantitative 
comparisons), scatter plots with the 45 de gree line of agreement superimposed will be 
constructed from paired observations from the two sources (BioStamp nPoint vs comparator)  
along with Bland- Altman plots of the data.  The mean absolute error (MAE) and the root -mean-
square error (RMSE) estimates  of agreement will be calculated for each comparison.  The 
standard deviations of each of the agreement measures will also be computed.   
 
For pairs of measurements collected on a categorical scale (qualitative to qualitative 
comparisons), two- way tables of agreement will be constructed for each comparison.  The 
agreement percentage will be computed for each table.  
 
The number and percentage of sensor patches in each category of the adhesion scoring scale 
will be tabulated.  
 
The statistical analyses of the effectiveness data will also be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) for the study.  The SAP will be written and finalized prior to database lock.    
 
11.6.3  Safety Analysis  
Prior to analysis, all AEs will be coded using the MedDRA coding dictionary. Based on these 
coded terms, TEAEs will be summarized using system organ class and preferred terms, as well 
as by relationship to the study devices. All AEs will be listed, regardless of whether or not they 
were study treatment related.  
11.7 Handling Missing Data  
In the statistical analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoints of the study, only the time points for 
each subject with evaluable endpoints for the both the BioStamp nPoint and the comparator method 
will be used in the statistical analysis, i.e., a complete case analysis.  The handling of missing values 
for all other study endpoints will be described in the SAP for the study.  
11.8 Interim Analysis  
There are no interim analyses planned for this study.   
 
12.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 Data Flow  
Data generated by the BioStamp nPoint system and the reference devices, as well as data annotated 
on the CRFs, will be extracted and time- aligned by MC10 for entry into the trial database.  During 
study execution, ground- truth data collected on CRFs and by reference devices will be stored at the 
study site.  Data collected using BioStamp nPoint will be transmitted to the MC10 Cloud for 
processing and generation of analytic outputs. The process described below allows verification that 
the extraction an d time -alignment processes do not introduce changes in the underlying data.  
 
After the final subject has completed the study, the sum total of analytic outputs from the study will be 
exported from the MC10 Cloud and stored in a read- only archive.  This archive will be entered into 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  34 
Confidential  
MC10’s Quality system, and a checksum  to uniquely represent this archive w ill be computed.  This 
checksum will be sent for entry into the trial database.  After the checksum has been entered, C TI will 
archive all ground- truth data in a read- only format and compute a checksum  on the resulting archive.  
This checksum will also be entered into the trial database.  CTI will then send the ground- truth data 
archive to MC10 for data extraction and time- alignment.  MC10 will then send the relevant data for 
entry into the trial database and subsequent analysis.  All tools to be used in this process will be 
validated.  
12.2 Data Collection  
Data management will be performed by MC10 or their designee using a validated data system as 
specified in 21 C FR 11.  Subject data will be entered into CRFs and combined with data provided 
from other sources in a validated data system that will reside in the clinical data management 
database.   
Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with applicab le MC10 or their designee’s 
SOPs; data cleaning procedures will be performed with the objective of ensuring all data fields are 
populated, and removing errors and inconsistencies in the data which would otherwise impact the 
analysis and reporting objectives, or the credibility of the final study report.   
The princip al investigator is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all study 
documentation.  The clinical monitor will collec t the originals and the investigational site shall retain 
the copies.

response, or is otherwise logically related to the investigational device, and no alternative 
cause is present.  
• Probable (Likely)  – The adverse event is likely related to the investigational device: the 
event has a temporal relationship to the investigational device, follows a known or 
suspected pattern of response, or is otherwise logically related to the investigational 
device, but an alternative cause may be present.  
• Possible (Unlikely)  – The adverse event is unlikely related to the investigational device: 
the event does not follow a clear temporal relationship to the investigational device or 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  38 
Confidential  
does not follow a known pattern of response, or is otherwise likely to be due to the 
subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy.  
• Not Related  – The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational device: the 
event has no temporal or other relat ionship to the administration of the investigational 
device follows  no known or suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is 
present.  
• Unknown  – Unable to determine the relationship based on all available information.  
14.4 Device Deficiency  
A Device Deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance (includes malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate 
labeling).  Sponsor will assess all device deficiencies that c ould have led to a serious adverse device 
effect for potential regulatory reporting requirements.   
In the event of a suspected malfunction or device deficiency, the investigational device shall be 
returned to the Sponsor for analysis. Instructions for ret urning the investigational device will be 
provided by the sponsor.  
14.5 Anticipated Device Related Effects  
As a dermal application, the BioStamp nPoint sensors  may cause mild skin irritation/reactions;  
however , these reactions can be moderate to severe. These s kin reactions (such as macular 
erythema,  allergic reactions, inflammation, pain, skin irritation/damage) are expected to be minor 
because  the patient contact material of the BioStamp nPoint was specifically selected based on its  
biocompatibility. However, these skin reactions may manifest to a more severe form (such as  burning, 
blistering, and intense redness). If an anticipated device related effect manifests in an 
uncharacteristic or  unusual manner (e.g., an effect occurs with greater severity or specific ity from that 
mentioned above), the effect should no longer be considered anticipated.  
 
Any anticipated device effect that results in a SAE or SADE must be reported to MC10 in accordance 
with the procedures outlined in Section 14.3.  
15.0 MEDICAL MONITORING   
The principal investigator will review adverse event reports as they arise and be responsible for 
determining whether to alter or stop a subject’s  participation.  Subjects are instructed to report any 
adverse effects or concerns immediately; in addition, we will directly inquire as to advers e events at the 
exit interview.  Subjects are free to terminate participation in the study at any time.  No formal Data Safety 
Monitoring Board is planned.  
  
Adverse events and unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reviewed by the 
principal investigator, who will judge whether event(s) were expected or not, or related or not to  the study.  
In addition, the investigator will also determine the best course of action to ensure subject safety.  
 
MC10 will be responsible for receiving SAE reports from the study site, gathering information from the 
study site concerning these Serious A dverse Events, reporting these SAEs to FDA on the proper forms 
within the time constraints specified in the CFR , and following up with the study site until the SAE 
resolves.   
16.0 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
16.1 Statement of Compliance  
The clinical investigations will b e in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki ( 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil  October 20 13), ISO 14155:2011 and ICH-
GCP Guidelines . 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  39 
Confidential  
• The clinical investigation shall not c ommence until approval by the IRB .   
• Any additional requirements imposed by the IRB  or regulatory authority shall be followed.  
• The Sponsor shall maintain a Clinical Trial Liability Policy with an insurance company.  
16.2 IRB Approval  
The study protocol  shall be reviewed and approved by the investig ator’s IRB or a contract IRB if the 
participating institution allows,  prior to subject  enrollment.  The Sponsor must review any proposed 
changes to the investigational plan prior to implementation.  The Sponsor and the IRB must approve 
significant changes to the investigational plan in writing by prior to implementation.  A significant 
change is one which may increase the risk or present a new risk to a subject , or which may adversely 
affect the scientific validity of the study.  
Prior to shipment of investigational devices, a signed copy of the IRB  approval letter identifying the 
clinical study and investigational site is r equired to be submitted to the Sponsor .  Investigators are 
responsible for obtaining and maintaining annual renewal of  the study by their IRB  (or according to 
renewal schedule imposed by the IRB ).  Evidence of renewal and continued IRB approval must be 
provided to the Sponsor accordingly.  
16.3 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is mandatory and must be obtained from all subject s as per local regulations, prior 
to their participation in the study.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that written informed consent from each subject, or 
the legally authorized representative of the subject, is obtained prior to the initiation of any study -
related procedures.   
Subject s who agree to participate in this study will do so voluntarily.  They will be treated on an equal 
basis with all other subject s.  
Study personnel fully knowledgeable in the purposes and procedures of the study will approach all 
prospective study participants. The facilities and settings in which prospective participants will be 
presented with the opportunity to learn about and consent to participation in the study will provide 
them sufficient quiet and unhurried time to be informed of the study, to ask questions, and between 
consent being given and the initiation of study procedur es. Study personnel will, after presenting the 
study to prospective participants, assess the subject’s understanding and autonomy by asking the 
subject to explain the study in his/her own words.  
Once that step is completed, consent will be able to be give n by the subject’s signing the consent 
form. A copy of the consent form will be given to all consented participants.   
Signed subject consent forms must be retained in the study files by the Investigator, and available for 
review by the Sponsor and/or regu latory agencies, as applicable.  
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to subjects will be revised 
whenever important new information becomes available, or if there is an amendment to the protocol 
which necessitates a change to the content of subject information and/or to the consent form.  The 
Investigator will inform the subject of changes in a timely manner, and will ask the subject  to confirm 
his/her continuation in the study by signing a revised consent form.   
Any revise d informed consent form and other written information provided to subjects must receive 
IRB, Sponsor, and regulatory agency approval, as applicable.  
16.4 Amending the Protocol  
This protocol is to be followed exactly, and will only be altered by written amendments.  Amendments 
must be approved by all parties responsible for approving the Protocol  including the IRB  prior to 
implementation. However, in situations where the amendment is regarding safety issues and there is 
   
 
 
 
Protocol: MC10- PTL-103, Revision 00  40 
Confidential  
an immediate hazard to subject s, the  amendment will be submitted  as an urgent amendment and can 
be implemented in the study prior to approval.  The Informed Consent and CRFs will be reviewed to 
ensure these are amended if necessary.  
Administrative changes that do not affect the subject  benefit/risk ratio (e.g., editorial changes for 
clarity) may be made without any further approvals.  
16.5 Protocol Deviations /Violations  and Medical Emergencies  
A protocol deviation or violation is a failure to comply with the requirements of the clinical study as 
specified in the protocol.  Examples of protocol deviations include late visits, missed visits, required 
follow -up testing not completed.  An example of a protocol violation includes enrollment of a study 
subject who fails to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria as specified in the protocol.  Each investigator 
shall conduct this clinical study in accordance with the study protocol and any conditions required by 
the reviewing IRB . 
Deviations /violations  from clinical protocol requirements will be reviewed and evaluated on an 
ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate corrective actions put into place.  The Sponsor  accepts 
the right of the Investigator to deviate from the protocol in an emergency when necessary to 
safeguard the life or the physical well-being of a study subject . Such deviations  must be reported 
within 5 working days of implementation to the IRB  and Sponsor . The Investigator must give notice of 
any emergency deviations and justification for the deviation to MC10, Inc.  and th e IRB as quickly as 
possible after the episode, in any event no later than 24 hours after the emergency.   
Each study site should maintain a list of protocol deviations that can be reviewed by the Sponsor.  
Subject numbers should be indicated for each protocol deviation on the lists.   
16.6 Pre-Study Documentation Requirements  
Prior to shipment  or receipt  of investigational product, the following documents must be provided to 
the Sponsor : 
• Signed protocol/protocol amendments  
• Signed and dated Investigator A greement(s)  
• A copy of the written IRB  approval of the protocol  
• A copy of the written IRB  approval of the Informed Consent Form   
• Signed and dated Curriculum Vitae of the Investigator(s)  
• Copy of the Investigator(s)’ current medical license(s), or equivalent  
• Signed and dated Non- Disclosure  Agreement(s) , if required  
• Signed and dated Certification/Financial Disclosure Form(s)  
16.7 Record Retention  
The Investigator will maintain all essential trial documents and source documentation that support the 
data collected on the study subject s in compliance with FDA and ICH/GCP guidelines. Documents 
must be retained until at least 2 years have elapsed since the date the investigation is completed or 
terminated or the records are no longer required to support a regulatory subm ission, whichever date 
is later. These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by agreement with the Sponsor  
or in compliance with othe r regulatory requirements. The i nvestigator will take measures to ensure 
that these essential documents ar e not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the 
investigator withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be 
transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility. The Sponsor  must receive written 
notification of this custodial change.

16.8 Criteria for Terminating Study  
The Sponsor  reserves the right to terminate the study but intends only to exercise this right for valid 
scientific or administrative reasons and reasons related to protection of subject s. Investigators and 
associated IRB will be notified in writing in the event of termination.   
Possible reasons for study termination include:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subject s enrolled in 
the study.  
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor  to suspend or discontinue development of the device.  
16.9 Criteria for Suspending/Terminating an Investigational Site  
The Sponsor  reserves the right to stop the enrollment of subject s at an investigational site at any time 
after the study initiation visit if no subject s have been enrolled or if the center has multiple or severe 
protocol violations without justification or fails to follow remedial actions.  
Possible reasons for suspending/terminating a study center include:  
• Failure to obtain written Informed Consent.  
• Failure to report SAE or UADE  to the Sponsor  within 24 hours of knowledge.

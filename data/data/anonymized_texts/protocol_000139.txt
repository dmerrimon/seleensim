  SPECIFIC AIMS  AND HYPOTHESIS  
  
Aim 1:   Determine the prevalence of and characteristics associated with diagnostic 
error (DE ) in asthma and/or COPD in an underserved population  
Aim 2:  Evaluate the effectiveness of the REDEFINE  program compared to usual care 
on health care utilization and patient -centered out comes (including respiratory 
medication use, all -cause emergency room visits, and all -cause hospitlizations)

The REDEFINE program will reduce health care utili zation and improve patien-
centered outcomes compared to  usual care.  
Aim 3:  Evaluate the cost impact and cost effectiveness of the REDEFINE  program 
versus usual care  
Hypothesis : 
The REDEFINE program will be cost -effective in the management of patients 
with COPD and asthma compared to usual care.  
   
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common chronic 
lung diseases that are diagnosed in more than 30 million adults in the United States.1,2  
However, diagnostic error (DE), considered one of the most common and harmful of patient -safety problems by the Institute of Medicine,
3,4 occur frequently with asthma 
and/or COPD and disproportionately affect minorities and the underserved. DE leads to lost opportunities to identify other chronic conditions, avoidable morbidity and mortality, unnecessary costs to patients and health systems , and poor quality of care.
3-6  
Shortness of breath or dyspnea, which is a common symptom in asthma and COPD, is also common for many other chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.  A better understanding of the impact of DE and interventions to improve  
diagnostic accuracy in asthma and COPD are of particular importance for minorities and the underserved that are disproportionately affected by conditions leading to dyspnea.  
 Spirometry is a simple, mobile, and essential test that is recommended by all 
major national and international guidelines for the diagnosis of asthma and COPD. 
7-10  
Page 2 of 13 
 However it is well known that spirometry is not routinely used in the ambulatory primary 
care setting11-19 and minorities and the underserved population are less likely to have 
spirometry leading to greater prevalence of DE.20-25  It has been estimated that 30- 50% 
of people with an exi sting diagnosis of asthma and COPD were found to be 
misdiagnosed.11,20,21,26-32  Many of these patients misdiagnose d with asthma and/or 
COPD receive unnecessary respiratory pharmacotherapy which can pose serious risks 
including pneumonia, cardiovascular events, and mortality.33-53  In the setting of DE, 
these are considered a voidable and unnecessary respiratory pharmacotherapy use in 
minorities and the underserved that are already disproportionately affected by 
cardiovascular disease54-56 increases the risk of poorer outcomes.  There is also DE in 
the diagnosis of asthma versus COPD, as these are both clinically distinct respiratory 
disorders with nuances in treatment recommendations.  It is reported that African-
Americans are c onsidered to have increasing COPD mortality and are 
disproportionately affected by asthma death rates.57-60  However, as spirometry is not 
routinely performed and DE is prevalent in asthma and COPD, a component of these 
poor outcomes may be attributable to missed or delayed diagnoses of other chronic 
conditions or misdiagnosis within asthma and COPD.  
Barri ers to the use of spirometry in primary care exist at provider and health 
systems levels.  Previous studies show that primary care providers  (PCPs) lack 
knowledge in existing guidelines and in implementing spirometry into primary care 
clinics.11,18,61-64 Beyond these barriers, PCPs struggle with logistical challenges such as 
time and workflow constraints with clinic visits lasting 1 5 minutes or less in patients with 
multiple chronic medical conditions.62,65 These predisposing and enabling factors 
explain why prior studies that included interventions to educate PCPs and incorporate spirometry by training personnel in primary care clinics have had limited results.
32,63,66-68  
A new paradigm to improve guideline based care for asthma and COPD which 
includes spirometry is needed and can lead to a better understanding of DE and improved patient safety and patient -centered outcomes.  Health Promoters or 
Community health workers (CH Ws) have been supplementing medical care by 
disseminating appropriate health care practices for underserved minority populations.   
However, studies which include diagnostic evaluations with spirometry for asthma and 
COPD have not been performed.   The REDE FINE program (Re ducing Diagnostic Error 
to Improve PatieN t SafEty in COPD and Asthma) will incorporate health promoters  
working collaboratively with PCPs to address identified barriers to guideline based care which includes spirometry for the diagnosis of asthma and COPD for patients at risk for DE.  We propose a comparative effectiveness study to better understand the epidemiology of DE and to evaluate the effectiveness and economic impact of providing the REDEFINE program to an underserved, predominantly minority population with a 
diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD at risk for DE.  
  
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
1. RESEARCH DESIGN  
 This will be a  cluste r-randomized comparative effectiveness trial conducted of patient s 
with a primary care provider  (PCP) diagnosis of COPD  and/or asthma seen in outpatient 
primary care provider clinics (i.e. Family Medicine, Miles Square Health Center, and Academic Internal Medicine)  as well as the CRC (Clinical Research Center)  at the 
University of Illinois Hospital and General Internal Medicine  and Famly Medicine C linics 
Page 3 of 13 
 at Cook County Health and Hospitals Systems (CCHHS) .   Providers will be randomized 
and their patients who fulfil l the inclusion criteria will receive the intervention or be in the 
usual care group.  Adults with a clinician -diagnosed COPD and/or asthma  at high risk 
for diagnostic error due to lack of spirometry will undergo the REDEFINE intervent ion or 
usual care based on the PCP randomization .   Outcomes will be assessed every 3 
months for up to one year.

  3. SUBJECT SELECTION, RECRUITMENT, AND INFORMED CONSENT  
 
PCP Selection , Recruitment , and I nformed consent  
 
Primary care providers (PCPs) specializing in internal medicine or family medicine with at least one half day per week outpatient clinic will be included in the study.  We 
Page 4 of 13 
 estimate a total maximum recruitment of 80 eligible PCPs from all sites (approximately  
50 PCPs  from UI Health and MSHC  sites and approximately  30 PCPs  from CCHHS) .  
The recruitment will include a combination of paper letter and email invitations with 
endorsement from the clinic directors  and other supervisors. A list of eligible  PCPs  will 
be obtained from each site from the clinic directors .  A research introduction letter will 
be mailed to the qualifying practitioners as well as an email invitation sent to their email accounts .  The letter and email will be sent simultaneously to ensure contact and will 
include a short introduction to why the research is being performed and a description of participants’ roles in the study.  Also included will be a contact number for th ose who 
would like  to volunteer or who would like additional information.  The letter will include a 
statement that there will be no penalty for not participating.  The letter will also contain a postcard with a stamp, where the eligible PCP checks to agree to participate or decline 
to participate.  The email will instruct them to reply by email to the same choices.  If a 
response is not received in 2 week s, a second  recruitment letter and email will be sent  
followed by a postcard 2 weeks later . Once a PCP  agrees to participate, informed 
consent will be obtained prior  to initiation of any study procedures.  
 
Patient Selection, Recruitment, and I nformed consent  
 
Approximately  500 patients will be recruited for this study  from the FM, AIM, MSHC  and 
GIM sites (A total of 250 from UI Health and MSHC sites and a total of 250 from 
CCHHS  site).  All sites use the same electronic medical record (EMR) system which is 
Cerner Powerchart.  An Information Systems Specialists (ISS) from UI Health  (including 
MSHC)  and CCHHS  will search the administrative data of their respective sites to 
provide a list of  patients meeting the first three of the inclusion criteria listed above and 
are scheduled to be seen in PCP clinics  or the CRC (Clinical Research Center at UIC),  
two weeks in the future.  More specifically , using electronic health records,  within the 
past 12 months, the following patients will initially be identified:  age ≥ 40 years and 
using at least one  main tenance respiratory medication (e.g. long acting beta agonists 
(LABA) , long acting anticholinergics  (LAA) ,inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS), 
phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitors  (PDE -4i), and at least one of the following 1) diagnosis 
of asthma (ICD -9 493.xx  or ICD 10 J45.xx ), 2) diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or 
chronic bronchitis (ICD -9 491.xx, 492.xx, 496 or ICD 10 J41.xx, J42.xx, J43.xx, J44.xx) . 
.In addition, our ISS will also only include those who have not had a current procedural 
testing (CPT) codes for spirometry (CPT codes:  94010, 94014, 94015, 94016, 94060, 94070, 94620)  or completed order for spirometry testing in the past 3 years.  
 Medical charts of patients will be reviewed to prescreen for eligibility for the study.  
Participants who meet preliminary eligibility criteria will be mailed a patient recruitment letter informing them of the study and our intent to contact them by telephone to complete a phone screen approximately one week before the participants’ scheduled primary care visit.  The letter will be sent 2 weeks before the planned phone screen and will have a phone number to call to opt out of the study.  A patient phone screen is conducted to confirm eligibility criteria and the participants’ verbal consent to participate 
in the study is obtained. During the call , we will confirm their scheduled appointment 
date, go over the study, answer any questions, and if the subject agrees , conduct the 
phone screen to verify eligibility criteria.  If eligible, they will be asked to participate in 
the study and if agreeable will be asked to come in 90 minutes before the clinic visit .  
Once a subject agrees to participate, informed consent wi ll be obtained prior to initiation 
of any study procedures.

 4.  DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURES  
 
A) PCP Education and Randomization:  
After obtaining PCP informed consent and prior to patient recruitment, a one hour 
educational session will be held for PCPs participating in the study. The purpose 
of this session is to provide education to PCPs about COPD, asthma, spirometry, 
and GOLD and GINA guidelines (GOLD=Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA=Global Initiative for Asthma). The educational session will 
provide continuing medical education credit to those who attend.  The learning 
objectives will be the following: 1) Review  COPD and asthma disease definition, 
presentation, diagnosis and testing including spirometry, 2) b e familiar with  the 
GOLD and GINA guidelines and recommendations for therapy.   
 
PCPs  who consented to participate in the study  and completed the education 
session  will be randomized to have their patients who meet the study criteria 
receive the intervention or usual care . 
     
B) Patient subject - Intervention:    
On the day of the outpatient  visit, subject s will be advised to arrive 90 minutes 
prior to their clinic visit  in the same building as the clinic site or the CRC (Clinical 
Research Center at UIC) .  The following information will be collected and 
procedures will be performed:  
 
1. Subject demographic and contact information  
2. Co-morbid conditions  
3. Smoking history  
4. Medication history from patient and also from pharmacy used by subjects  
5. A respiratory exacerbation history in the past year  
6. Modified Medical Research Counsel (mMRC) dyspnea scale and  COPD 
Assessment Test  
7. Quality of life measure s 
8. Pre and post -bronchodilator  (BD) spirometry  
9. De-Escalation Spirometry Screener for patients de- escalating based on 
spirometry (See Based on spirometry findings)  
10. De-Escalation Phone Script  
 
Based on spirometry findings:  
1. If the spirometry findings are consistent with COPD and/or asthma, the 
following will be provided to the provider and patient to have available during the clinic visit:  a  letter summarizing the interpretat ion of the findings  using 
GOLD /GINA  criteria  with recommendations for initial guideline driven therapy 
based on GOLD /GINA  guidelines .  Subjects will be managed by their PCP  
thereafter.  
2. If the spirometry findings are normal, with approval from the PCP, will de-
escalate respiratory medication therapy via a stepwise process and schedule patient back for a repeat pre and post bronchodilator spirometry within 1- 2 
weeks at the same time and place  as the PCP clinic session  or the CRC 
(Clinical Research Center at UIC) .  Again with the PCP approval, this 
Page 6 of 13 
 deescalation  and repeat spiromety  can occur  in 1-2 week intervals  until all 
maintenance medications are discontinued as long as the pre and post  
spirometry continues to be normal.  After each visit, the following will be 
provided to the provider and patient:  a letter summarizing the interpretation of 
the findings using GOLD/GINA criteria with recommendations for initial 
guideline driven therapy based on GOLD/GINA guidelines , if appropriate.  
Subjects will be managed by their PCP  thereafter.    
3. All spirometry test results and the subject’s assessment at the time of the test 
will be uploaded into the subject’s electronic health record for future reference.  
 
 
C) Patient subject - Usual Care :  
On the day of the outpatient visit, subjects will be advised to arrive 60 minutes 
prior to their clinic visit  in the same building as the clinic site or the CRC (Clinical 
Research Center) .  The following will be performed .  
 1. Subject demographic and contact information  
2. Co-morbid conditions  
3. Smoking history  
4. Medication history from patient and also from pharmacy used by subjects  
5. A respiratory exacerbation history in the past year  
6. Modified Medical Research Counsel (mMRC) dyspnea scale and COPD 
assessment test  
7. Quality of life measures  
 
Subjects will be advised to go to their clinics and be managed by their PCP 
thereafter.  
 At the end of the 1 year followup, the patient will be scheduled for a pre and post 
BD spirometry and undergo the s ame s pirometry protocol  (de-escalation 
protocol) as the intervention group.  
Based on spirometry findings:  
1. If the spirometry findings are consistent with COPD and/or asthma, the 
following will be provided to the provider and patient:  a letter summarizing the 
interpretation of the findings using GOLD/GINA criteria with recommendations 
for initial guideline driven therapy based on GOLD/GINA guidelines.  Subjects 
will be managed by their PCP  thereafter.  
2. If the spirometry findings are normal, with approval from the PCP, will de -
escalate respiratory medication therapy via a stepwise process and schedule 
patient back for a repeat pre and post bronchodilator spirometry within 1 -2 
weeks at the same time and place as the PCP clinic session.  A gain with the 
PCP approval, this deescalation and repeat spiromety can occur in 1- 2 week 
intervals until all maintenance medications are discontinued as long as the pre and post spirometry continues to be normal. After each visit, the following will be provided to the provider and patient:  a letter summarizing the interpretation of the findings using GOLD/GINA criteria with recommendations for initial guideline driven therapy based on GOLD/GINA guidelines, if appropriate.  Subjects will be managed by their  PCP thereafter.   
3. All spirometry test results and the subject’s assessment at the time of the test 
will be uploaded into the subject’s electronic health record for future reference.

Baseline visit (Vo):  
Same for Intervention and usual care groups :   Subjects will be provided 
$75 in cash for completing the initial study visit.   
Telephone contact (T 1-T3):  
Same for Intervention and usual care groups .  Subjects who choose to 
complete the follow -up in person or via telephone will receive $20 in cash 
at the time of the visi t or at a later specified time that is convenient for the 
subject.  
Final contact (T 4):  
Intervention:   Subjects will receive $95 in cash at the time of the their last 
visit in-person.  
Usual Care Group:   Subjects will receive $9 5 in cash  at the completion of 
the 1 year spirometry and follow -up. 
Additional spirometry visits after de- escalation of therapy:  
Same for Intervention and usual care groups (except the intervention 
group will receive this near the beginning of the study and usual care 
group will receive this  near the end of the study ):   Subjects will be 
provided a $50 in cash for each additional spirometry visit.   
 2.A. Provision to compensation:  If human subject receives over $200.00 
within one (1) calendar year, it is incumbent for the study staff to obtain the subjects social security number based on the OBFS guidelines.  However, if human subj ect receives a total under $200.00 within the calendar there is no 
need to obtain social security number from the human subject.  
 5. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
All data will be stored in a secure, locked location. Data will be entered and managed through the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). REDCap is a secure web-based application for building and managing online databases.  REDCap is provided by 
Page 9 of 13 
 the CCTS Design Analysis Core.  Data will be analyzed for clinical effectiveness using 
intention- to-treat principles.69-71 For Aim 1 , we will evaluate the misdiagnosis rates of 
the intervened and usual care groups separately at the first visit. Then compare rates 
between groups by using a generalized linear mixed model for binary outcome with two cluster levels,  PCP and hospital, to account for the dependenc e within clusters. For the 
Aim 2 , to investigate the impact of the misdiagnosis over time (4 time points: 0, 3, 6, 9, 
12 months) on the quality of life and healthcare utilization, we will fit generalized linear mixed models with time, group, and their inte raction as the main predictors.  Two cluster 
levels, PCP and hospital, will be specified in the model to account for the dependence 
within clusters
72,73 and an appropriate link function will be used for each outcome. 
Clinical important confounders will also be adjusted in the models. Before these analyses we will use descriptive statistics to describe the sample, and any assumption behind each statistical method will be examined during the analysis. A two- sided p-
value less than 0.05 would be considered as statistical significance. All the analyses will 
be conducted by using SAS 9.2 (SAS Inst., Cary, NC).  
 
For Aim 3:  Costs:   The intervention costs for the study include the cost of the 
spirometry test, the time of the CHW/health promoter, and time of pulmonologist to provide periodic oversight of spirometry validity.  In addition to estimating the costs associated with the intervention it will be important to measure the healthcare utilization for participants included in the study.  It is possible that the intervention leads to use of other healthcare resources, particularly if the patient is determined to be free of respirator y disease.  Therefore, we will measure both respiratory -related and overall 
healthcare costs.  To measure these costs, we will determine overall healthcare utilization and apply unit costs to each of the events. Using chart reviews, we will examine healthc are utilization during the follow- up period.  We will categorize 
healthcare utilization into either respiratory -related or all other healthcare use.  We will 
apply standardized prices to each of the utilization components to estimate the overall and respir atory -related healthcare resource use during the study period. The 
standardize prices will be based on either the National Committee for Quality Assurance standardize price list for their relative resource use measure or Medicare reimbursement rates.  For medications, we will rely on average wholesale price of 
medications to assign an average price to each of the COPD and asthma- related 
medications.  
 Cost-Effectiveness:  The secondary outcome measures included in the study will be 
used to estimate the effectiveness to be used in the cost -utility analysis. We will use 
responses to the EQ5D to estimate patient utility and use that in calculation of quality -
adjusted life- years (QALY).  The area under the curve will be compared between the 
two groups and the di fference will be the incremental effect used in the cost -utility 
analysis.  
Cost-utility analyses:  We will evaluate the cost -utility of the intervention compared to 
usual care over the study period using recommended methods for cost -effectiveness 
analysis .74  To compare the cost -effectiveness of the intervention to usual care, the 
findings are summarized into a ratio that provides the results in terms of the costs per 
unit of effect.  We will calculate the difference in intervention costs and respiratory -
related healthcare resource use between groups to determine the numerator of the rat io 
and the denominator will be the difference in QALYs in the cost -utility analysis.  These 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will represent the cost per gain in QALYs 
for the intervention compared to standard care.  As part of the cost -utility  analysis we 
will evaluate the uncertainty associated with the ICERs.  We will use bootstrapping 
Page 10 of 13 
 methods to generate confidence limits for the ICERs.75,76  We will display the results 
graphically on a cost -effectiveness plane and generate cost -effectiveness acceptability 
curves for the intervention compared to usual care.77,78  Cost-effectiveness acceptability 
curves display the probability of the intervention being cost -effective given various 
threshold values.78 Thus decision -makers can identify a threshold value appropriate for 
their setting and determine the probability that the intervention will be cost -effective.  We 
will also conduct sensitivity analyses that use the measure of overall healthcare 
utilization  in calculation of the costs, as there may not be perfect specificity in identifying 
respiratory -related costs during the follow -up assessments and the intervention may 
lead to differences in non- respiratory costs.  
 6. SAFETY MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT  
 Risks of intervention study  
Spirometry is a breathing test commonly utilized in the outpatient primary care setting.  
Risks and discomforts associated with spirometry are possible. The risks include shortness of breath an d on rare occasion,  the subject might experience dizziness, 
cough, or light -headedness. A medication that can open subjects’ airways may be used 
during s piromet ry testing. This medication, albuterol, is in a class of medications (i.e. 
short acting beta agonist) that  is often used to treat subjects suspected with COPD  
and/or asthma as part of usual care. A lbuterol may  sometimes cause tremors /shaking , 
nervousness, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, headache, irregular heartbeats, dryi ng or 
irritation of mouth, sore  throat, upset stomach, and coughing. These effects usually 
disappear within a short time and do not require treatment.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
The PI will review monthly data reports reviewing recruitment, consent, intervention activities, adverse events, and follow -up.  Although few, if any, intervention- related 
adverse events are anticipated in this study, the study population is at risk for poor outcomes, including life- threatening exacerbations and death  not caused by the study 
itself.  The PI will comply with prompt reporting of any adverse event to the IRB   
  7. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 Confidentiality  
To help ensure that patients’ health information remains private, we will restrict access to data collected for our study to study personnel only (via use of password- protection 
and locked cabinets for study documents).  Study ID numbers will be generated and will be used when discussing and/or reviewi ng data at study meetings.  Also, study reports 
will report results in aggregate and not contain information that can be used to identify individual patients.  
 Storage of Data  
Data will be collected from participants in the form of questionnaires and will be 
documented in the secure, password protected,  web-based Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) database available only to members of the research team.   The 
research data  will be stored securely using subject ID numbers and kept for 6 years 
after the end of the study .    
 
Page 11 of 13 
 UI Health electronic medical records (EMR) (inpatient and outpatient) will be reviewed by 
staff from UI Health and CCHHS EMR (inpatient and outpatient) will be reviewed by 
staff from CCHHS .  Data collected from  both institutions will be input into REDCap.  The 
crosswalk file with direct identifiers to the coded data will be created , encrypt ed, and 
kept on Dr. Joo’s office computer at 840 S. Wood St.  Chicago, Il  and stored such that 
only authorized inviduals will have access to patient identifying information.  Hardcopies 
of the data will not be made.

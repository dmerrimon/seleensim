OVERALL  RATIONALE FOR  PROTOCOL  AMENDMENT 04: 
Key changes in this protocol amendment are the addition to Part 1C of lower  dose levels of BMS - 
986207 (≤ 600 mg every  3 weeks) that may  be tested  in order to better  estimate the tolerability  of 
the optimal dose level of BMS -987207 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. In 
addition, the triplet combination of BMS -986207 + nivolumab + ipilimumab will be explored in 
first- line non- small cell lung cancer (1L NSCLC) participants with PD -L1 tumor cell positive 
expression ≥ 1% (Part 2C). Additional doses lower  than the dose declared  tolerable  in Part 1C may 
be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C. This will be examined in order to further develop the 
BMS -986207 program. 
This protocol amendment also updates contraception and pregnancy requirements in women of 
childbearing potential (WOCBP) and contraception requirements in males based on the available 
scientific evidence.

1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol  Title:  Phase 1/2a First -In-Human  Study  of BMS -986207  Monoclonal  Antibody  Alone  and in 
Combination with Nivolumab or with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in Advanced Solid Tumors  
Short  Title: An Investigational  Immuno -therapy  Study  of BMS -986207  Given  Alone  and in Combination  With 
Nivolumab or with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab  
Study  Phase:  Phase  1/2a 
Rationale: BMS -986207, an anti- T cell immunoglobulin (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibitory motif 
(ITIM)  domain  (TIGIT) monoclonal antibody  (mAb),  is being  studied  alone  and in combination  with nivolumab or in 
combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in humans with advanced solid tumors.  
Tumors  modulate  and evade  the host immune  response  through  a number  of mechanisms,  including  down  regulation 
of tumor -specific antigen  expression  and presentation,  secretion  of anti-inflammatory  cytokines,  and upregulation of 
inhibitory  ligands. Immunotherapeutic approaches such as checkpoint pathway blockade have demonstrated clinical 
efficacy  in several  cancers,  including melanoma,  renal  cell, lung,  and hormone -refractory  prostate  cancers.  Following 
the success of anti- cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein (CTLA -4) and anti -programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) 
pathway -targeted agents in several cancers, the field of tumor immunotherapy is rapidly expanding, recognizing the 
potential value of combination therapies.  
BMS -986207 is a fully human variant immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high 
affinity  to TIGIT  (T cell immunoreceptor  with immunoglobulin  and immunoreceptor  tyrosine -based  inhibitory  motif 
domain), a negative regulatory molecule that suppresses activation and functional responses in T cells and natural 
killer  (NK)  cells.  TIGIT  upregulation  has been  observed in cancer  patients,  in particular  on T cells,  and is co-expressed 
with of T cell exhaustion. Binding of poliovirus receptor (PVR) and Nectin- 2 (TIGIT ligands) to TIGIT 
results in suppression of T cell and NK cell function. These same ligands also bind with lower affinity to the stimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAX accessory molecule 1 [DNAM -1]) also expressed on effector T cells. Blockade 
of TIGIT  with molecules  like BMS -986207 therefore  may increase the anti-tumor  immune  response  both by removing 
the suppressive signal emanating from  TIGIT and by freeing its ligands to bind to the stimulatory receptor CD226. 
Blockade of TIGIT -mediated inhibition of T and NK cell function is hypothesized to facilitate an increase in the 
amplitude and durability of responses against a number of malignancies.  
 
Study  Population: Participants  must be at least 18 years  old and have  histologic  or cytologic  confirmation  of a solid 
tumor that is advanced (metastatic, recurrent and/or unresectable) with measurable disease per Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid  Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. For Part 2C, participants must have NSCLC, be treatment- naive, and have 
pre-existing  or prior  PD-L1 IHC results  from  testing  of tumor  tissue.  PD-L1 expression must  be tumor  cell positive  
≥ 1% f or  a participant  to be eligible  for enrollment.

OVERALL DESIGN  
This is a Phase  1/2a,  open- label  study  of BMS -986207  administered  as a single  agent,  in combination  with nivolumab, 
and in combination  with both nivolumab and ipilimumab  in participants  with advanced solid  tumors. The duration of 
the study will be approximately 6 years.  
The study  comprises  2 parts.  Part 1 includes  dose escalation  of BMS -986207 alone  (Part  1A) and in combination  with 
nivolumab (Part  1B) to determine  the MTD/RP2D,  as well as a select  dose level  of BMS -986207  in combination  with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab (Part 1C) to evaluate safety and preliminary  activity  of the triplet  combination. 
Part 1B includes a substudy conducted at a single site under site -specific Amendments 6, 7, and 8 to evaluate the 
safety  and preliminary  efficacy  of BMS -986207  in combination  with nivolumab in PD-1 naive  and relapsed/refractory 
participants with melanoma. Part 2 includes expansion cohorts to gather additional preliminary  activity,  as 
well as additional safety, tolerability, PK,  information for BMS -986207 alone (Part 2A), in 
combination with nivolumab (Part 2B), and in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in NSCLC (Part 2C). Participants  in each study  phase  will complete up to 4 periods  in the study: screening,  treatment,  safety  follow -up, and 
response/survival follow -up. The overall  study design is illustrated  in Figure  1 and the treatment  cohorts  are presented 
in Figure 2 . 
Screening : The screening period will last for up to 28 days, and will begin by establishing the participant’s initial 
eligibility and signing of the informed consent form. Participants will be enrolled using an Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).  
Preliminary Safety Cohort : The Preliminary Safety Cohort precedes participant enrollment  in Monotherapy -Dose 
Escalation  (Part  1A) of the study.  The first participant  enrolled  into monotherapy escalation  will receive  BMS -986207 
starting  at the 2 -mg dose level, followed 2 weeks later with  intra-participant dose escalation to  the 6 -mg dose level, 
and followed 2 weeks after that with  intra-participant dose escalation to the 20- mg dose level. This first participant 
will be subject  to a 5-day safety  observation  period after receiving  the first 20-mg dose.  If no dose -limiting  toxicities 
(DLTs) or other safety concerns  are observed, an additional 2 participants will be enrolled in the 20- mg dose cohort.  
Treatment: P
 articipants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B will be treated  for up to 24 weeks  (3 cycles)  with monotherapy 
(Parts 1A and 2A) or combination therapy  (Parts 1B and 2B). The treatment period will consist of up to 3 treatment

 cycles of 8 weeks. Following each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of study 
therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle. In Parts 1C and 
2C, nivolumab and BMS -986207  will be administered  every  3 weeks  and ipilimumab  will be administered  every 
6 weeks until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons specified in the protocol for up to 2 years.  
Each  monotherapy  treatment  cycle  will comprise  4 doses  of BMS -986207  administered  every  2 weeks  (q2w) or 
2 doses  of BMS -986207  every  4 weeks  (q4w) in Part 1A and 2A. BMS -986207  infusions  will take place  over 
60 minutes and will require a 60  minute observation period after all infusions in Cycle 1 for each participant. For 
participants <  42 kg on the 1600 mg dose, the infusion time will be longer than 1 hour. In Parts 1B and 2B, each 
combination treatment cycle will comprise 4 doses of BMS -986207 administered q2w or 2 doses of BMS -986207 
when  administered  q4w,  each dose administered  with nivolumab.  In Part 1B and 2B, when  both study  drugs  are given 
in combination, nivolumab will be given first, over a 30 -minute infusion period, followed by BMS -986207 over a 
60-minute  infusion period,  with a 60-minute  observation  period  after all infusions  in Cycle  1 for each participant,  and 
at least 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of nivolumab. Tumor progression and response will be assessed 
using RECIST v1.1 criteria for solid tumors. The study design is shown in Figure 2 . 
The approximate  number  of evaluable  participants  will be 241. Approximately  100 of these  participants  will be treated 
with monotherapy  and combination  dose escalation  (Part  1A and Part 1B, respectively).  Approximately  36 participants 
will be treated (6 initial participants for safety evaluation followed by evaluation of approximately 12 additional participants per dose level) with BMS -986207, nivolumab, and ipilimumab in the Triplet Cohort (Part 1C). The 
remaining (up to 105) participants  will be treated  as part of dose expansion with up to 24 participants in Part 2A  and 
41 participants in Part 2B, and 40 participants with NSCLC pre-existing 
or prior PD -L1 IHC results from testing of tumor tissue) considered to be response -evaluable, in Part 2C.

a Planned dose levels  and dose schedules  of BMS -986207  and/or  nivolumab may be modified,  and intermediate  dose 
levels of BMS -986207 added, based upon the BLRM analysis and sponsor discretion and discussion with 
investigators.  Once the safety  (during  the DLT  evaluation)  of a dose level  has been  established  (Part  1A and/or  Part 
1B), additional participants (up to 15) may be added at that dose, to better characterize the safety, dose schedule, 
PK,  profile  assessments.  
b Participants  were  enrolled  at a single  site under  site-specific  Amendments  6, 7, and 8. This substudy has been  closed 
for enrollment.  
c The safety  profile  of BMS -986207  1200  mg Q3W  combined with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg 
Q6W  has been  evaluated  in 6 subjects.  Of these  subjects,  4 were  DLT evaluable,  and 2 developed  DLTs. Per BOIN 
design, for all the remaining and future subjects, BMS- 986207 was de -escalated to 600 mg Q3W (for details, see 
Section 3.2.1.4) Planned dose levels for BMS -986207 may be further modified based on generated data and 
additional doses, including 360 mg Q3W,  may be assessed per BOIN design and for  dose optimization  analysis  at 
Sponsor discretion and based upon discussion and agreement with investigators.  
d Part 2C will enroll a minimum of 20 participants per dose level of BMS -986207.  One or two doses are planned to 
be evaluated and selected from the range of doses assessed as tolerable and not exceeding the maximum tolerated 
dose in Part 1C. If two doses will be tested at the Sponsor’s discretion, participants will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio schema between  the highest  dose selected  in Part 1C and the next lower  dose,  after at least 10 participants  will 
have been tested at the dose found safe in Part 1C.

 TREATMENT 
Preliminary  Safety  Cohort: The Preliminary  Safety  Cohort  precedes  participant  enrollment  in Monotherapy  - Dose 
Escalation  (Part  1A) of the study.  The first participant  enrolled  into monotherapy escalation  will receive  BMS -986207 
starting at the 2 mg dose level, followed 2 weeks later with  intra-participant dose escalation to the 6 mg dose level, 
followed  2 weeks  after that with intra-participant  dose escalation  to the 20 mg dose level.  This first participant  will be 
subject to a 5 -day safety  observation period after receiving the first 20 mg dose.  If there are no DLTs or other safety 
concerns observed, an additional 2 participants will be enrolled in the 20 mg dose cohort.  
 
 
Dose Escalation (Part  1A and Part 1B):  Approximately  35 participants  are expected  to be treated  during  each dose 
escalation part of the study guided by Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). Each participant will be 
administered intravenous (IV) doses of BMS -986207 per the cohort assignment as described below.  
In Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned flat dose levels for BMS- 986207 are 20, 80, 240, 800, and 
1600 mg (assuming an 80 kg participant)  q2w, in 8- week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). In 
addition,  a q4wk schedule  of BMS -986207  will be evaluated  at flat doses  of 480 mg and 1600  mg (assuming  an 80 kg 
participant).  Enrollment of the first q4w cohort will be guided by the safety, PK,  analysis  from  the 
q2wk  cohorts. Following each treatment cycle,  the decision to  treat a participant with additional cycles  of study therapy 
(up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
In Part 1B, (combination therapy dose escalation), BMS -986207 and nivolumab will be administered at flat doses of 
80 and 240 mg BMS -986207  q2w and 240 mg nivolumab q2w.  In addition,  BMS -986207 will be administered  at flat 
doses of 480, and 1600 mg q4w in combination with nivolumab administered at 480 mg q4w.  Study drugs will be 
administered in 8 -week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). Following each treatment cycle, the 
decision  to treat a participant  with additional  cycles  of study  therapy  (up to a maximum  of 6 cycles),  will be based  on 
tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
Planned dose levels may be modified, or intermediate dose levels added, based upon the BLRM analysis. Part 1B, combination dose escalation, will be initiated after at least 3 dose levels (ie, 20, 80, and 240 mg dose cohorts), have 
been  found to be tolerable  in Part 1A, monotherapy  dose escalation.  The starting  dose of BMS -986207 in Part 1B will 
be at least 1 dose level below a dose that was demonstrated to be tolerated in Part  1A. At no time will the dose for 
BMS -986207 in Part 1B exceed  the highest  tolerated  dose in Part 1A. BLRM  may indicate  evaluation  of intermediate 
dose levels that fall in -between  the planned dose levels. Any dose level increment will be limited to approximately a 
3-fold increase. Subsequently, escalation in Parts 1A and 1B may be done in parallel.  
Participants  w
 ith biopsy eligible  solid  tumors  will be enrolled  in Parts  1A and 1B. Specifically  participants  with tumor 
types  where the microbiome has  been  implicated,  in preclinical or  clinical data,  to mediate TIGIT inhibition,  such as 
but not limited to, CRC and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), will be enrolled in Part 1A. Once the safety (during the dose limiting toxicity [DLT] evaluation) of a dose level has been established (Part 1A 
and/or  Part 1B), additional  participants  (up to a total of 15) may be added  at that dose level,  to better  characterize the 
safety, PK,  profile.  
Sentinel  Participant:  For all dose escalation  cohorts,  a sentinel participant  approach  will be used with a 5-day interval 
between  the treatment  initiation  of the first participant  and the treatment  of subsequent  participants  in that dose level. 
The first participant in both  Part 1A, starting  at the 20-mg dose level,  and Part 1B will receive Cycle  1 Day 1 dose of 
study drug(s), and be observed for 5 days before additional participants receive study drugs. The first participants to 
be dosed in all subsequent dose -level cohorts will also be subject to a 5- day sentinel period. Initially, 3 participants 
will be enrolled  at the start of each dose-escalation  cohort,  in accordance with the sentinel participant  approach  above. 
However, to allow for any  unforeseen discontinuations (such as disease progression) before the 4 -week DLT period 
is completed, an extra participant may be enrolled at each dose- escalation cohort. Therefore, there will be a total of  
4 participants (3+1)  at the start of each dose-escalation  cohort,  providing the fourth  participant  is able to start the first 
day of dosing within approximately 1 week of the third participant in the same dose -escalation cohort.  
Triplet Cohort (Part 1C): Approximately 36 participants will be treated (6 initial participants for safety evaluation 
followed by evaluation of approximately 12 additional participants for each dose level tested) with BMS -986207, 
nivolumab,  and ipilimumab  in the Triplet Cohort (Part  1C). BMS -986207 will be administered  at 600 mg q3w and/or 
360 mg q3w and nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg q3w. Ipilimumab, at a dose of 1 mg/kg, will be given q6w.  A dose of 1200  mg BMS -986207  administered  every  3 weeks  has been  tested  per Amendment  03 but due to the

 DLTs observed no additional participants will be tested at this dose (see Section 3.2.1.4 ). Study drugs will be 
administered in 6 -week cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons as specified in the 
protocol for up to 2 years. Treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed RECIST v1.1 defined progression is 
permitted if the subject has investigator -assessed clinical benefit and is tolerating the treatment.  
The DLT period in Part 1C will be 42  days (6 weeks). The DLT safety monitoring during the dose evaluation phase, 
including the potential  decision  to de-escalate to a lower  dose,  will be based  on the Bayesian  optimal interval (BOIN) 
design framework with a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) rate of 30% (24%, 36%).  
Subjects  who do not complete  the DLT  observation  period  for reasons  other  than DLTs may be replaced.  De-escalation 
may be considered  if the safety  and tolerability  profiles  for the  selected  BMS -986207  dose are  deemed unacceptable, 
after discussion between the investigator (s) and the Sponsor/Medical Monitor.  
Cohort Expansion (Part 2A, 2B, and 2C) : In the cohort expansion part of the study, additional safety, tolerability, 
preliminary efficacy, PK,  information,  regarding BMS -986207 alone  and in combination  with nivolumab,  will 
be sought.  Continuous  evaluation  of toxicity  events  will be performed  throughout  enrollment  in the expansion  cohorts. 
If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment- related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all 
participants treated in cohort expansions, reassessment of enrollment will take place. Depending on the nature and 
grade of the toxicity and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a 
previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.  
In Part 2A, only CRC will be evaluated  in cohort expansion with BMS -986207  as monotherapy.  In Part 2B, the 
3 disease -restricted populations, ovarian cancer, CRC and HCC, will be investigated in cohort expansions with 
BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab.  A Fleming  2-stage  design framework  will be used as a guide  in cohort 
expansion.  
During  the expansion  phase,  participants  with CRC who have  disease progression  on BMS -986207  monotherapy  will 
be able to cross over to combination treatment (BMS -986207 + nivolumab), once the CRC expansion arms are 
enrolling. This cross -over option is not applicable during the escalation phases. CRC participants with disease 
progression who cross over to combination treatment will undergo the same efficacy and safety assessments as the main cohort. 
The purpose of Part 2C is to gather preliminary efficacy information regarding BMS- 986207 in combination with 
nivolumab and  ipilimumab  in participants with  advanced,  treatment -naive NSCLC whose tumors express  
to assess optimal dose selection for RP2D. These subjects will be treated with BMS -986207 q3w at a dose not to 
exceed  the dose declared  tolerable  in Part 1C, nivolumab 360 mg q3w,  and ipilimumab  1 mg/kg q6w.  Additional  doses 
lower than the dose declared tolerable might be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C.  
Part 2C may begin  once  there  is sufficient  safety  data from  a minimum  of 6 participants  in Part 1C. 
Continuous  e
 valuation  of toxicity  events  will also be performed  in this part of the study  If, at any time,  the aggregate 
rate of treatment- related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33%, the findings will be discussed and further 
enrollment  may be interrupted.  Depending  on the nature  and grade  of the toxicity,  and after assessing the risk/benefit 
ratio, a new dose for all participants may be initiated at a lower dose level.  
Participants with an outcome of unconfirmed progressive disease, stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), or 
complete response (CR) at the end of a given cycle will continue to the next treatment cycle. Participants will be allowed to continue study treatment until the first occurrence of either: 1) completion of the maximum number of 
cycles,  2) confirmed  PD, 3) clinical  deterioration  suggesting that no further benefit  from  treatment  is likely,  
4) intolerability to therapy, or 5) the participant meets criteria for discontinuation of study therapy. Individual 
participants with confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study therapy on a case -by-case basis after 
specific  consultation  and agreement  between  the investigator  and BMS  Medical  Monitor in settings  where  benefit/risk 
justify discontinuation of study therapy.  
Dose Limiting  Toxicities: For the purpose  of guiding  dose escalation,  DLTs  will be defined  based  on the incidence, 
intensity, and duration of adverse events (AEs) for which no clear alternative cause is identified. DLT period will be 
28 days (4 weeks) in Part 1A and Part 1B and 42 days (6 weeks) in Part 1C.  
For the purpose  of participant  management,  any AE that meets  DLT criteria,  regardless  of the cycle in which  it occurs, 
will lead to discontinuation  of study drug unless  the investigator  determines  that 1 of the agents  must be discontinued 
due to toxicity attributed to  that agent alone.  Participants experiencing  a DLT will  not be retreated with study drug,

and will enter  the safety  follow -up period of the study.  Following the last treatment  with investigational  product  (IP), 
participants who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation interval for reasons other than a DLT may be 
replaced with a new participant at the same dose level.  
Treatment  with  Additional Cycles  beyond 24 Weeks:  Participants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, or 2B with ongoing  disease 
control  (CR,  PR, SD) or unconfirmed progressive  disease,  and completing  approximately  24 weeks  of treatment,  may 
be eligible for an additional 3 cycles of study therapy in both the monotherapy (Parts 1A and 2A) and combination 
therapy (Parts 1B and 2B) parts beyond the initial 24 weeks, at discretion of the Investigator and BMS Medical 
Monitor.  Upon  completion  of 3 cycles  of study  therapy  (or up to a maximum  of 6 cycles  if applicable),  all participants 
will enter the safety follow -up period.  
The cohort expansion phase  of the study  is shown  in the figure  below.  
Schematic of Dose Escalation  and Cohort  Expansion  Phases of the Study  
Prior  to initiating  Part 1A (Monotherapy - Dose  Escalation),  a preliminary  safety  cohort will be tested  in which  a single 
participant will undergo an intra -participant dose escalation to establish safety over the 2 - to 20- mg dose range of 
BMS -986207. Thereafter, standard dose escalation panels as monotherapy and combination therapy with nivolumab 
will proceed as described below.

FOLLOW -UP PERIODS  
Safety Follow- up: After  the end -of-treatment (EOT) visit, all participants will be evaluated for  any new AEs for at 
least 100 days after the last dose of therapy. Follow -up visits will occur at Day 30, 60, and 100 ( ± 7 days) after the 
last dose or date of discontinuation.  
Survival Follow -up: In parallel with the safety  follow -up period, participants in Parts 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B will enter 
the survival follow -up period. Participants will be followed by telephone every 12 weeks from discontinuation of 
study drug/EOT  visit for a period  of 2 years, or  until death,  lost to  follow -up, withdrawal  of consent,  or conclusion  of 
the study,  whichever comes  first. Both  the response and survival  follow -up periods  will occur  simultaneously  during 
the 2 year follow -up period. Radiological tumor assessments for participants who have ongoing clinical benefit may 
continue to be collected after participants complete the survival phase of the study.  In Parts 1C and 2C, the survival 
follow -up period will continue for 2 years following the last dose of study drug or until death, lost to follow- up, 
withdrawal of consent, or conclusion of the study, whichever comes first. Survival follow -up visits will occur every 
12 weeks (±7 days) until 2 years after the last dose of study drug.  
Response Follow -up: Participants  with SD, PR, or CR at the time of study  drug discontinuation  will continue  to have 
radiologic  and clinical tumor  assessments every 12 weeks for the first year  after discontinuation of study drug/EOT 
visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive tumor assessment scans per standard -of-care guidelines, or, at a 
minimum, every 6 months up to 2 years following the last dose of study drug, or until disease progression or 
withdrawal of study consent.  
Retreatment:  Retreatment  may be allowed  for participants  in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, or 2B with disease  progression  during 
response  follow -up. Participants  completing  approximately  3 cycles  of study  therapy  (or up to a maximum  of 6 cycles, 
if applicable),  and entering  the response  follow -up with ongoing disease control  (CR,  PR, or SD), may be eligible  for 
retreatment.

In Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, the initial treatment period is up to 24 weeks (3 cycles) of dosing and the number of 8 - 
week cycles will depend on tumor  assessment at each cycle. Following each  treatment cycle, the decision to  treat a 
participant with the next cycle of study  therapy, up to a maximum of 48 weeks (6 cycles) of treatment, will be based 
on safety/benefit and tumor assessment. For Parts 1C and 2C, the treatment period is up to a maximum of 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Upon completion of these treatment, participants will 
enter a safety follow -up period.  
Details of the dose escalation and cohort expansion phase in this study  are given in the study design section and the 
schematic above.  For Parts  1A, 1B, 2A and 2B intra-participant  dose escalation/reduction  of BMS -986207,  nivolumab, 
or ipilimumab is not permitted in this study in order to allow better evaluation of the extended safety and efficacy  at 
individual dose levels and schedules. For intra -participant dose reduction of BMS -986207 in Part 1C and 2C see 
Section 5.1.2.6  and Section 5.1.2.7, respectively.  
Study treatment  will be dispensed at the study  visits.  For participants  on combination  treatment,  a 30-minute  infusion 
of nivolumab will be followed  by a 30-minute  observation  period,  followed  by a 60-minute  infusion  of BMS -986207, 
with a 60 -minute observation period after all infusions in Cycle 1 for each participant. For participants <  42 kg 
receiving  the 1600- mg dose of BMS -986207 or <38 kg receiving  the 1200 -mg dose of BMS -986207,  the infusion  time 
will be longer than 1 hour.  For participants  in Part 1C or Part 2C, a 30-minute  infusion  of nivolumab  will be followed 
by a 30-minute  observation  period;  followed  by a 30-minute  infusion  of ipilimumab,  a 30-minute  observation period, 
and by a 60- minute infusion of BMS -986207.  
Treatment  Assignment : In this open -label  study,  no blinding  will be required.  Enrolled  participants  will be assigned 
sequential participant numbers via IRT starting with  (eg, ). Enrolled  participants 
meeting  the inclusion  criteria  will be eligible  to be dosed.  In the expansion  phase  only,  participants  with CRC will be 
randomized in a 1:1 manner to either BMS -986207 monotherapy or combination therapy with BMS -986207 and 
nivolumab to eliminate the possibility of enrollment bias.  
 
STUDY  ASSESSMENTS AND  ANALYSES: 
Safety Assessments: Safety assessments will be based on  reported AEs and the  measurement  results of vital signs, 
ECGs, physical examinations,  and clinical laboratory tests.  AEs will be coded using the most current version of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the incidence of observed AEs will be tabulated and 
reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance. AEs will be assessed continuously  during the study and 
for 100 days after the last dose of BMS -986207 in the case  of monotherapy, and the last dose of BMS- 986207 and 
nivolumab, and the last dose of BMS -986207, nivolumab, and ipilimumab for combination therapy. A central/local 
laboratory will perform  the clinical laboratory tests and will provide reference ranges for these tests. Both AEs and 
laboratory  tests will be graded  using  the National  Cancer  Institute  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events 
v4.03.

 PK Assessments: Pharmacokinetics  of BMS -986207  will be derived  from  serum  concentration  versus  time data.  The 
pharmacokinetic parameters that will be assessed, following the intensive PK collection, are: maximum observed 
serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed serum concentration (Tmax), area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC[0 -T]), AUC 
in 1 dosing interval (AUC[tau]), observed concentration at the end of a dosing interval (Ctau), total body clearance 
(CLT), average concentration over a dosing  interval (Css -avg), accumulation index (AI), effective elimination half - 
life that explains the degree of accumulation observed for a specific exposure measure (T -HALFeff),  
. Individual participant PK parameter values will be 
derived  by noncompartmental  methods  by a validated  PK analysis  program.  Actual  times  will be used for the analyses.  
Immunogenicity  Assessments: Serum  samples  for BMS -986207,  anti-drug antibody 
(ADA) will be collected from all participants at specified time points.  
Efficacy  Assessments : Efficacy  assessments for the  activity  of BMS -986207,  alone,  in combination  with 
nivolumab,  or in combination  with nivolumab and ipilimumab  will be based  on tumor  measurements,  using  RECIST 
v1.1,  with computer  tomography  and/or  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  as appropriate,  at baseline,  every  8 weeks  
(± 1 week) for Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B or every 6 weeks for Part 1C and Part 2C during the treatment period, and 
every 12 weeks thereafter during the response follow -up period.

 b For participants who complete  all scheduled  cycles  of therapy,  the EOT  visit will be the same as  the last scheduled and completed  on-treatment  visit (eg, Cycle 
3 Day 43) and the start of the safety  follow -up period.  For participants  that do not complete  all scheduled  cycles  of therapy,  the EOT visit will be the most recent 
on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data), does not need to be repeated and will be considered the start of the safety follow -up period.  
c For BMS -986207, vital signs will be obtained before the infusion and then every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) until 60 minutes after compl etion  of all infusions in 
Cycle 1; oxygen saturation  to also be performed  in conjunction  with vital signs  monitoring  on these  days.  For nivolumab,  vital signs  will be obtained  before  the 
infusion  and then every  30 minutes  (± 10 minutes)  until the start of BMS -986207 infusion or per institution  guidelines  for administration  of nivolumab.  The 30- 
minute post  nivolumab infusion vital signs may correspond to the pre -infusion BMS -986207 vital signs. In  the event BMS -986207 administration is delayed, 
nivolumab vital signs will be obtained until 60 minutes after completion of the infusion. If any vital sign is abnormal (base d upon clinician assessment) at the 
final check, the participant must be observed further for a period of time, as clinically indicated. Obtainment of vital sign s surrounding study drug 
administration(s)  from  Cycle  2 on as per institutional  practice/Investigator  discretion.  For participants  < 42 kg on the 1600 mg dose,  the infusion  time will be 90 
minutes. Details of study drug preparation are found in the Pharmacy Manual, a document that will be provided separately to t he site.  
d ECGs  should  be recorded  after the participant  has been  supine  for at least 5 minutes,  and prior  to blood draws. ECGs  to be performed  in triplicate  in association 
with PK sampling, at predose,  EOI, and 4-hr post dose, on day 1 of both C1 and C2 for dose  escalation  phase  only (see Table 9.5-2 ). Single  safety  ECGs  to be 
done on Day 1 and Day 29 of all treatment cycles where ECG not performed in conjunction with PK sampling.

 3. INTRODUCTION  
This is a Phase 1/2a, first -in-human (FIH), dose escalation study of BMS -986207, an anti -T cell 
immunoglobulin  (Ig) and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based  inhibitory  motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT) 
monoclonal antibody (mAb), alone, in combination with nivolumab (anti -programmed cell death 
1 [PD -1]), and in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab (anti -cytotoxic T -lymphocyte 
associated protein 4 [CTLA -4] antibody) in humans with advanced solid tumors. 
3.1 Study Rationale  
Antibody- based  therapy for cancer  is well established  and constitutes  an important strategy  for the 
treatment of patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors.  1 In addition to the 
targeting of antigens involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival, antibodies can function 
either to activate or antagonize immunological pathways involved in cancer  immune surveillance. 
The anti -cancer, antigen -specific immune response is the result of a complex dynamic interplay 
between antigen -presenting cells, T -lymphocyte cells, and the target cancer cells.2 The critical 
balance of T cell activity  that dictates  whether endogenous anti- cancer immune  responses will be 
effective is thought to be controlled by antigen- specific stimuli sensed by the T cell receptor and 
by the combined activity of both positive (co -stimulatory) and negative (co -inhibitory) T cell 
surface molecules.3 Within the past decade, antibodies against these key receptors have been 
designed and evaluated in the clinic with encouraging results, heralding the onset of 
immunotherapy as a key pillar of anti- cancer therapy.4 
Tumors modulate and evade the host immune response through a number of mechanisms, 
including down regulation of tumor -specific antigen expression and presentation, secretion of 
anti-inflammatory cytokines, and upregulation of inhibitory ligands. Immunotherapeutic 
approaches such as checkpoint pathway blockade have demonstrated clinical efficacy in several cancers, including melanoma, renal cell, lung, and hormone -refractory prostate cancers . 
5 
Following the success of  CTLA -4 and anti -PD-1 pathway- targeted agents in several cancers, the 
field of tumor immunotherapy is  rapidly  expanding, recognizing the  potential value  of combination 
therapies.6 
TIGIT is a 26 -kDa type I transmembrane immunoglobulin superfamily member with a single 
extracellular IgV domain, an intracellular domain containing immunoglobulin tail  tyrosine motif 
and ITIM,  and a growth factor  receptor-bound protein binding  site. In healthy  individuals,  TIGIT 
is expressed on a subset of memory  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and on the majority of regulatory  T 
cells (Tregs)  and NK cells.  In the settings  of chronic viral infections  and cancer,  TIGIT  is strongly  
upregulated on CD8+ T cells and has been associated with other  of T cell exhaustion, 
including PD-1, CTLA -4, lymphocyte- activation  gene 3 (LAG -3), and T cell immunoglobulin and 
mucin domain -containing -3 (TIM -3).7,8 In human tumors, TIGIT is expressed on the majority  of 
tumor- infiltrating Tregs and CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent on CD4+ T effectors.8 
TIGIT  ligands poliovirus  receptor  (PVR) and  Nectin -2 are highly expressed  on many tumors and 
tumor- infiltrating  myeloid  cells, and likely contribute  to the immunosuppressive  tumor

 microenvironment.  Upon ligand engagement,  TIGIT  can partially  suppress T cell and natural killer 
(NK) cell activation . 9 Furthermore, TIGIT agonism leads to Treg stabilization and increased 
interleukin 10 production by Tregs.10,11 TIGIT competes for ligand binding with costimulatory 
receptor DNAX accessory molecule 1 (DNAM- 1, also CD226), which has been shown to be 
involved in tumor immune  surveillance, and TIGIT  co-expression  on the cell surface  has been  
linked to decreased  DNAM -1 signaling.8,12 
In ex vivo experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from melanoma 
patients, antibody blockade of  TIGIT/PVR interaction on  tumor antigen -stimulated CD8+ T cells 
resulted in increased proliferation and cytokine production. This activity was further enhanced when  combined with PD-1 blockade.
13Comparable studies were  conducted using PBMC from  
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with similar results.14 Studies at BMS 
have shown that TIGIT  blockade on NK cells results  in increased  activation  and lysis of 
PVR- expressing tumor cells in a DNAM- 1 expression dependent manner. BMS -986207, a fully 
human anti- TIGIT  mAb,  was designed with an inert isotype (termed  IgG1.1) to eliminate  fragment 
crystallizable region (Fc) effector function, which is intended to increase anti- tumor immune 
response by decreasing inhibitory signals and allowing increased DNAM -1 co-stimulation on 
intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells. Based on preclinical models, blockade of PD1/programmed death - 
ligand 1 (PD -L1) pathway is expected to enhance or synergize with TIGIT blockade. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 
intravenous (IV) doses of BMS -986207, administered as monotherapy, in combination with 
nivolumab, and as of Protocol Amendment 03, in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab, in participants  with  advanced solid  tumors.  This  study will also determine  the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMS -986207 to be used in future 
monotherapy and combination studies. Further details on the scientific rationale for the study design are presented in Section 5.4. 
 
BMS -986207 was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab.19 
Preliminary data from the CA020002 study have, thus far, shown some clinical benefit in 
participants with melanoma (2 participants with partial response [PR]) and prostate cancer (1 participant with PR) when BMS -986207 was combined with nivolumab. No clinical benefit was 
observed in any participants who received BMS- 986207 monotherapy (unpublished results).

 Other tumor types in this study included colorectal cancer (CRC), ovarian, breast, gastric, and 
urothelial cancer.  
Recently, reports  in the literature  have shown comparable efficacy  results  with  anti- TIGIT  agents 
in combination with anti- PD-(L)1 agents, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, in most tumor 
types.15,16 Best responses, however, were observed in those studies in 1L and previously treated 
NSCLC participants  whose tumors  expressed  PD-L1. A randomized Phase 2 study comparing the 
anti-TIGIT agent tiragolumab plus atezolizumab versus placebo plus atezolizumab in PD -L1- 
positive 1L Stage IV NSCLC patients demonstrated improvement in the overall response rate (ORR; 37% vs. 21% with atezolizumab alone). The treatment regimen was well tolerated, with safety  similar to that seen in the placebo plus atezolizumab treatment (see Section 5.4.4 for more  
details).
16 In addition, recent data presented from a Phase 1 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of the anti - 
TIGIT antibody vibostolimab plus pembrolizumab in participants with anti -PD-(L)1-naive 
NSCLC demonstrated anti -tumor activity (ORR 29% and 46% in patients with PDL1 -positive 
disease ).17 These data suggest that combining anti-TIGIT  with anti- PD-(L)1 can be safe, tolerable,  
and have clinical  benefits in PD-L1-positive  1L NSCLC patients.17 
As of 20- Oct-2021, the safety profile of BMS -986207 1200 mg Q3W in combination with 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W has been evaluated in 6 subjects with multiple metastatic solid tumors in CA020002 Part 1C. Of the 4 dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) - 
evaluable participants, 2 participants reported DLTs (Grade 3 encephalitis and Grade 3 bullous dermatitis [n = 1 each]). Per Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design, in all the remaining and future subjects, BMS -986207 was de -escalated to a lower dose (600 mg Q3W). For details, see 
Section 3.2.1.4. 
The combination of nivolumab +/ - ipilimumab is approved in 17 countries as 1L treatment for 
patients  with  metastatic non- small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  expressing PD-L1 ≥ 1% (eg, United 
States, Canada, etc.) or both PD -L1 ≥ 1% and < 1% (e.g. Japan, Argentina). This regimen is also 
recommended by the European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive 
Cancer  Network  Clinical Practice  Guidelines in Oncology as a 1L treatment  option for metastatic 
NSCLC regardless of PD -L1 expression.
18 Data  from BMS  CheckMate 227, a randomized, open- 
label Phase 3 study in participants with treatment -naive NSCLC, demonstrated that the 
combination of  nivolumab plus ipilimumab was  safe and tolerable and improved overall survival 
(OS) compared to chemotherapy  alone (PD -L1 ≥ 1% overall survival [OS] 29% vs. 18%, hazard 
ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 to 0.90).33 Thus, the nivolumab and 
ipilimumab combination is an appropriate backbone for exploring the effects  of BMS -986207 in 
PDL1 -positive 1L NSCLC. Using this triplet combination in NSCLC participants allows the 
combination of a checkpoint inhibitor -responsive patient population (NSCLC) with a checkpoint 
inhibitor combination (nivolumab + ipilimumab) that has been demonstrated to work as an appropriate therapy for this patient population. 
In the present study, to further evaluate whether TIGIT inhibition together with cancer 
immunotherapies can enhance immune activity, the safety of this triplet combination 
will be tested  in a small  group of participants  across all tumor types.  Once  safety  is established,

 1L NSCLC  participants  whose tumor cells express ≥ 1% PD-L1 will be treated  with BMS -986207 
plus nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
It is anticipated that anti- TIGIT antibody (BMS -986207), administered as a single agent, in 
combination with anti -PD1 antibody (nivolumab), or in combination with nivolumab and anti - 
CTLA -4 antibody (ipilimumab) will demonstrate adequate safety and tolerability, as well as a 
favorable risk/benefit profile, to support further clinical testing. No prospective hypotheses are 
being formally evaluated. 
3.2 Background  
3.2.1 BMS- 986207 
BMS -986207 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) mAb that binds with high affinity to 
TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
inhibitory motif domain), a negative regulatory  molecule  that suppresses activation  and functional 
responses in T cells and NK cells.  The antibody is engineered  to negate Fc gamma  receptor  (FcγR) 
binding by the introduction of 5 specific amino  acid mutations.  TIGIT  upregulation has been 
observed in cancer patients, in particular on T cells and is co- expressed with   of T cell 
exhaustion. Binding of PVR and Nectin- 2 (TIGIT ligands) to TIGIT results  in suppression of T 
cell and NK cell function. Blockade of TIGIT therefore may increase the immune anti -tumor 
response both by removing the suppressive signal emanating from  TIGIT  as well  as by freeing its 
ligands to bind to the stimulatory receptor CD226 (DNAM -1), which shares these ligands. BMS - 
986207 blocks interaction  of TIGIT  with its ligands and thereby may induce or enhance anti- tumor 
immune responses.  
3.2.1.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology  
BMS -986207 binds  recombinant TIGIT  with  an equilibrium dissociation  constant (K D) of 
and to cell surface TIGIT on activated CD8+ T cells with  a half -maximal effective concentration 
(EC50) of  . The antibody binds to recombinant cynomolgus monkey TIGIT with and 
EC50  of and to activated  cynomolgus monkey CD8+  T with an EC50  of 
BMS -986207 inhibits the binding of PVR and Nectin -2 to TIGIT  in a dose-dependent manner with 
an EC50 of  . BMS -986207 blocked the inhibitory activity of TIGIT/PVR interaction in a 
Jurkat cell line reporter assay, a T cell peptide stimulation assay, and an NK cell  redirected lysis 
assay.  In the Jurkat and NK cell assays,  TIGIT  blockade alone resulted  in increased  nuclear  factor - 
kappa- B (NF -κB) luciferase signals and increased lysis of  target cells, respectively. In the T cell 
peptide stimulation assay, the effect of  TIGIT blockade  was strongest when  combined with PD-1 
blockade, and resulted  in increased  interferon  gamma  (IFN γ) secretion  and an elevated  percentage 
of IFN γ−producing T cells. 
Due to its engineered inert Fc region, as expected, BMS -986207 does  not induce antibody - 
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) - or antibody- dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) - 
mediated killing of TIGIT -expressing target cells. In addition, BMS -986207 does not bind 
complement 1q (C1q). Based on these findings, BMS -986207- induced depletion of TIGIT - 
expressing cells is not expected. BMS -986207 showed no unexpected binding in 8 cynomolgus

 tissue types  tested.  Additionally, BMS -986207 did not mediate  spontaneous cytokine secretion  at 
detectable levels in fresh whole blood samples from  8 normal human donors. These data suggest 
that BMS -986207 treatment does not lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in whole blood. 
A number of mouse studies were undertaken to examine the role of TIGIT blockade in tumor 
settings. An MC38 colon adenocarcinoma murine tumor study in PD -1/TIGIT double knockout 
(KO) mice suggested dual blockade of TIGIT and PD -1 may be beneficial in the treatment of 
cancer through enhanced antitumor immunity. PD -1/TIGIT double KO mice showed superior 
tumor rejection as compared to the other groups. There were no tumor -free mice in the groups of 
TIGIT KO mice or wild -type mice. In the CT26 colon murine tumor model and the A20 B cell 
lymphoma murine model, TIGIT blockade with a surrogate antibody in combination with PD -1 
blockade or CTLA -4 by surrogate antibodies resulted in anti -tumor responses. In these models, 
the combination  of PD-1 blockade or CTLA -4 blockade with TIGIT  blockade resulted  in a greater 
number of tumor -free mice than either agent alone.  
The in vitro and in vivo data indicating that TIGIT blockade can enhance T cell and NK cell activation, and that TIGIT blockade (together with PD -1 or CTLA -4 blockade) enhances anti - 
tumor immune activity, support the development of BMS-986207 for the treatment of cancer. 
3.2.1.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK)  of BMS -986207 were  evaluated  in cynomolgus monkeys in 2 studies 
Following a single IV dose of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg 
or 0.5 and 3 mg/kg BMS -986207 serum  concentrations exhibited biexponential 
decline, dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure, low total body serum clearance ( 
), low volume of distribution at steady -state and long 
apparent half -life The Vss is similar  to the reported  plasma  volume in 
monkeys, indicating limited extravascular distribution. The presence of anti -drug antibodies 
(ADAs) was observed in all except 1 monkeys. Anti -drug- antibodies were detected as early as 
Day 7 and their appearance appeared to correlate with an accelerated decline in BMS -986207 
serum concentrations.  
In mice, a dose dependent tumor efficacy was observed with a combination of 10A7- mIgG1 
D265A (anti-mouse TIGIT  with a D265A mutated  inert mIgG1  isotype; the surrogate antibody for 
BMS -986207) and 4H2- mIgG1 D265A (mAb to mouse PD -1 Clone 4H2, isotype mouse IgG1- 
D265A); either  antibody had little or no tumor efficacy.  Therefore,  PK of 10A7- mIgG1  D265A in 
combination with  4H2 -mIgG1  D265A were  evaluated  in mice. After multiple intraperitoneal (IP) 
doses of 10A7 -mIgG1  D265 (10 mg/kg) alone  or in combination  with anti-mPD -1-mIgG1  D265A 
(7.5 mg/kg) at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg to female BALB/c mice bearing CT26 tumors, 10A7-mIgG1 
D265A
 exhibited  a dose-proportional increase  in exposure.  Fitting  the exposures  to a 
1-compartment PK model with an absorption compartment yielded an estimated apparent CLTs  
. 
3.2.1.3 Nonclinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical safety of  BMS -986207 was evaluated in vitro in a human tissue cross- reactivity 
study and cytokine release  and lymphocyte activation  assays with human  cells,  and in an in vivo

 1-month intermittent repeat- dose IV toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The cynomolgus 
monkey was selected as the toxicology species because BMS -986207 binds to TIGIT expressed 
on activated cynomolgus monkey T cells with a similar affinity  as TIGIT expressed on activated 
human T cells and is pharmacologically  
active in monkeys; it does not bind rodent TIGIT.  
In a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant tissue cross -reactivity study in normal human 
tissues fluoresceinated BMS -986207 produced membrane and cytoplasmic staining of 
mononuclear cells in human lymphoid  tissues and select  non-lymphoid tissues.  This staining  was 
expected  based  on TIGIT  expression  by mononuclear cell  types, such  as T cells  and NK cells.  No 
unexpected tissue cross -reactivity  was observed. BMS -986207 did not induce cytokine release or 
increase the expression  of activation   on human T, B, or NK cells in an in vitro  human 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine release  and cell activation  assay,  suggesting a low risk 
of BMS -986207-induced CRS  in humans.  
In a 1-month pivotal toxicity  study in monkeys, BMS -986207 was administered  IV as a slow bolus 
at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (once  weekly  [qw] × 5 doses).  BMS -986207 was clinically  well 
tolerated by all monkeys at 30 and 100 mg/kg doses while 3 out of  10 monkeys in the 10 mg/kg 
dose group exhibited signs of  ADA mediated  hypersensitivity reactions immediately  after dosing 
on study days 22 and/or 29 (fourth and/or fifth dose). The clinical signs were transient, 
accompanied  by increases in serum  cytokine levels  and complement  activation, and no treatment 
was required for the affected monkeys. The timing, type of clinical observations, correlative complement activation are consistent  with the formation of treatment -emergent ADA, a common 
response by monkeys to a foreign protein. This immunogenicity is not considered  to be predictive 
for
 ADA responses  in humans  (International  Council  for Harmonisation  of Technical  
Requirements for  Pharmaceuticals for Human  Use [ICH]  S6).  responses  were 
observed at all doses and included NK cell activation  and CD8+  T cell activation  and proliferation, 
and were  generally dose-independent. Based  on the lack of directly  BMS -986207- related adverse 
findings, the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be  
. In addition, for determination of the maximum 
re
commended human starting dose, was also considered  the highest non- severely  toxic 
dose (HNSTD). The HNSTD/NOAEL of   than the proposed 
starting  dose in humans (1 mg/kg) with a  corresponding plasma   of the 
projected human AUC (0-336),ss at 1 mg/kg 
 
Overall, the nonclinical toxicology assessment of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile, supporting clinical use in oncology patients. 
3.2.1.4 Preliminary Clinical  Safety Profile  
Overall, based on preliminary data as of 21- Jan-2021, the safety profile of BMS -986207 as 
monotherapy (n = 42) or in combination with nivolumab (n = 30) is manageable at the doses

 combination with nivolumab. BMS -986207 was evaluated  as a monotherapy at doses ranging from 
20 mg to 1600 mg q2w (20 mg: n = 3; 80 mg: n = 3; 240 mg: n = 4; 800 mg: n = 28; 1600 mg: n 
= 4.). A single participant was dosed using an intra -participant dose escalation approach at 2, 6, 
and 20 mg. Escalation  in this participant occurred 2 weeks after each dose with continued treatment 
at 20 mg  q2w. There  was no relationship  between  the incidence,  severity,  or causality  of AEs  and 
BMS -986207 dose level.  A majority  of treatment -related  AEs were  of Grade  1 to Grade  2, with 5 
treatment- related Grade 3 to Grade 4 AEs (Grade 3 elevated aspartate aminotransferase, n = 1; 
Grade 3 hypertension, n = 1; Grade 3 hyponatremia, n = 2; Grade 3 hyperglycemia, n = 1). 
Infusion- related AEs were reported in 1 participant, which were managed based on the updated 
protocol guidelines. There  were  no drug- related  SAEs  with monotherapy. A total of 26 deaths were 
reported in participants treated with BMS -986207 monotherapy. All deaths were due to 
complications from disease progression except  for 1 death  attributed  to aspiration  pneumonia. All 
were considered by the Investigator to be not related to study drugs. 
The safety  profile  of BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab was evaluated  at the following 
doses: 80 mg BMS -986207 + 240 mg nivolumab q2w (n = 4), 240 mg BMS -986207 + 240 mg 
nivolumab q2w (n = 4), 480 mg BMS -986207 + 480 mg nivolumab q4w (n = 18), and 1600 mg 
BMS -986207 + 480 mg nivolumab q4w (n = 4). There  was no relationship  between  the incidence, 
severity,  or causality  of AEs and the combination regimen  dose levels.  Most  AEs were  of Grade  1 
and Grade  2. With  combination therapy, treatment -related  AEs were  similar  to those  expected  
from nivolumab alone.19 A total of 13 deaths occurred in participants treated with combination 
therapy. All deaths were due to complications from disease progression and all were considered 
by the Investigator to be not related to study drug. 
As of 20- O ct -2021, the safety profile of BMS -986207 1200 mg Q3W in combination with 
nivolumab 360 mg Q3W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg Q6W was assessed in 6 participants. Of the 6 
treated participants (the first participant was a sentinel participant), 4 participants were DLT evaluable. Based on preliminary data, 2 out of the 4 DLT -evaluable participants reported 
experiencing DLTs. One participant was a 79 -year-old female with second- line (2L) pancreatic 
cancer  who was reported to have Grade  3 encephalitis.  The patient received  the triplet  combination 
once on Day 1. On Day 22, treatment  was held for Grade  2 pneumonitis, which  began on Day 12. 
On Day 40, treatment was discontinued due to disease progression. On Day 41, Grade 3 encephalitis, a DLT, was reported, treated with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil, and had improved to Grade 2 on Day 53. The participant died on Day 118 due to disease progression. 
The Grade 2 pneumonitis and Grade 2 encephalitis did not resolve. The second participant was a 73-year-old female with fourth -line (4L) melanoma who received the triplet once on Day 1 and 
developed Grade 3 bullous dermatitis, a DLT, on Day 21. Treatment with corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil was consequently initiated, and dermatitis resolved on Day 49. A total  of 
2 deaths were reported, and both were attributed to disease progression and not related to study intervention. Based  on the BOIN design, ongoing participants  in the first cohort, as well as future 
participants in the next cohort, in the dose evaluation for Study CA020002 will dose de -escalate 
to BMS986207 600 mg Q3W  in combination with nivolumab 360 mg Q3W  + ipilimumab  1 mg/kg

 3.2.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab (also referred to as BMS -936558, MDX1106, or ONO -4538) is a human monoclonal 
antibody (immunoglobulin G4 [IgG4]-S228P) that targets the programmed death -1 (PD-1) cluster 
of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. PD -1 is a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by activated T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD -1 to its ligands, 
programmed death–ligands 1 (PD -L1) and 2 (PD -L2), results in the down- regulation of 
lymphocyte activation. Inhibition of the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands promotes 
immune responses and antigen -specific T cell responses to both foreign antigens as well as self - 
antigens. Nivolumab is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and is produced using 
standard mammalian cell cultivation and chromatographic purification technologies. The clinical study product is a sterile solution for parenteral administration.  
Nivolumab is approved for the treatment of  several types of  cancer in multiple regions including 
the United States (US, Dec -2014), the European Union (EU, Jun-2015), and Japan (Jul-2014). 
Nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months as monotherapy in several 
tumor types, including NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), Classical Hodgkin 
Lymphoma (cHL),  small -cell lung cancer  (SCLC),  gastric  cancer,  squamous  cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CRC. In confirmatory trials, nivolumab as monotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS as compared with the current standard of care in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced RCC, or recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Details of the clinical activity in these various malignancies are provided in  
the US prescribing  information  (USPI) and Summary  of Product Characteristics  (SmPC).
34,20 
For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. The only exception 
is pulmonary inflammation  adverse events  (AEs),  which may be numerically greater  in participants 
with NSCLC.  In NSCLC patients,  it can be difficult to distinguish between  nivolumab- related  and 
unrelated causes of pulmonary symptoms and radiographic changes. There is no relationship between the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs and the nivolumab dose level. Additional details on the safety profile of nivolumab, including results from other clinical studies, are summarized in the nivolumab Investigators Brochure.  
3.2.3 Ipilimumab  
Ipilimumab (BMS -734016, MDX010, MDX -CTLA4) is a fully human monoclonal 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa specific for human cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA -4, 
cluster of  differentiation [CD] 152), which is expressed on a subset of activated T cells. CTLA -4 
is a negative regulator of T cell activity.  Ipilimumab  is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to 
CTLA -4 and blocks the interaction  of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86.  Blockade of CTLA - 
4 has been shown to augment T cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation  of tumor- infiltrating  T effector cells.  Inhibition of CTLA -4 signaling can also reduce 
T-regulatory cell (Treg) function, which may contribute to a general increase in T cell 
responsiveness, including the anti-tumor response.

 3.2.4 Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab Clinical Activity  
Multiple clinical studies have evaluated nivolumab combined with ipilimumab at different doses 
and schedules.  Based  on Phase 3 data showing improved survival over standard- of-care therapies, 
nivolumab combined with ipilimumab has been approved in multiple countries for the treatment of patients  with unresectable or metastatic melanoma,  intermediate  or poor risk, previously 
untreated advanced RCC, previously untreated metastatic NSCLC expressing  and 
microsatellite  instability -high or mismatch  repair  deficient  colorectal  cancer.  Details of the clinical  
activity  in these various malignancies are provided  in the USPI  and SmPC.

3.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Through the CA020002 study, some initial evidence of clinical benefit has been observed in 
patients with  advanced  cancer  especially  when  used in combination with  PD-1 inhibition. Recent 
reports with other anti- TIGIT antibodies have shown similar clinical benefit when used in 
combination with PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors.15,16 Prior to these studies, the evaluation of risk was 
based on information from nonclinical studies with BMS -986207 in monkeys ( Section 5.5.1.3) 
and potential effects based on the proposed mechanism of action. The nonclinical toxicology assessment  of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable safety  profile,  supporting clinical  use 
in oncology patients.  Because BMS -986207 blocks interaction of  TIGIT with nectin -2 or PVR, it 
has the potential to remove  an inhibitory signal to T cells and NK cells.  TIGIT  expression is limited 
to lymphoid cells, so the principal effects are anticipated to be related to the effects of inflammatory cells in specific tissues. Similar to other Immuno -Oncology (I- O) drugs, a general  
principle is to monitor for immune -mediated adverse reactions in various organ systems. 
Noninflammatory  etiologies  should be considered and discussions with the BMS  Medical  Monitor 
should be used to guide treatment. Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially 
prior to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, is recommended. 
In vitro treatment of human mononuclear cells with BMS -986207 did not induce  of 
lymphocyte activation or cytokine release. Moreover, there was no evidence for CRS in 
cynomolgus monkeys treated with BMS -986207. To assess for unanticipated potential  effects of 
lymphocyte activation, a sentinel participant will be monitored for 5 days at each dose level for Parts 1A and 1B. 
Novel monoclonal antibodies such as BMS -986207 have the potential to induce anti -idiotype 
antibodies that can be neutralizing or non- neutralizing. BMS -986207 is a fully human antibody 
and the clinical  experience with other human mAb I -O agents  is that infusion- related reactions or 
hypersensitivity reactions occur at a frequency of < 10% and are generally low grade. Severe 
infusion- related  reactions  or anaphylaxis are rare and occur at a frequency of approximately 0.1%. 
For the proposed clinical study of BMS -986207, the administration will start with a single 
participant  enrolled into monotherapy escalation,  receiving  BMS -986207 starting  at the 2 mg dose 
level,  followed 2 weeks later with intra-participant dose escalation  to the 6 mg dose level,  followed 
2 weeks after that with intra- participant dose escalation to the 20 mg dose level. This first 
participant was subject to a 5 -day safety observation period after receiving the first 20 mg dose. 
This study design  was intended to thoroughly assess the risk of any immediate  hypersensitivity

 reactions. As of 21 -Jan-2021, 1 participant out of 42 treated participants in monotherapy (2.4%) 
was noted to have an infusion- related reaction (Grade 1) with BMS -986207 treatment.19 
All BMS -986207 infusions will occur at infusion centers with medical monitoring and the 
capability to manage infusion reactions or anaphylaxis. The protocol provides a treatment 
algorithm for infusion reactions. In addition to conventional safety measures for infusion of biologic agents, all participants will undergo observation and assessment for signs of infusion reaction for 60 minutes post infusion after all infusions of BMS -986207 in Cycle 1. 
In combination therapy, BMS -986207 may potentiate  immune -mediated  adverse reactions caused 
by nivolumab and ipilimumab. The safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is well defined and 
is based  on experience with greater  than 23,500 patients  evaluated  in clinical  trials.  The frequency 
and types of immune -mediated adverse reactions are similar across multiple types of  tumors and 
are described in the Reference Safety  Information in the current nivolumab (BMS -986558) IB.
21 
Management  algorithms  for nivolumab-induced AEs involving gastrointestinal,  renal,  pulmonary, 
hepatic, endocrinopathy, skin, neurologic systems, and myocarditis are included in the protocol. 
As of 23- Mar-2021, more  than 30,000 participants  have been  enrolled in ipilimumab  monotherapy 
and combination  therapy  studies, including compassionate use programs, in several cancer types, 
allowing the safety profile to be well defined. The frequency and types of immune -mediated 
adverse reactions are similar across multiple types of tumors and are described in the Reference 
Safety Information in the current ipilimumab (BMS -734016, MDX -010) IB. 22 Management 
algorithms for ipilimumab - induced AEs are included in the protocol. 
The safety profile of nivolumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab is characterized by immune - 
related toxicities, such as diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies. The 
frequencies and intensities of these events are variable and depend on the specific doses and schedule used. In the dosing schedules selected, these events were mostly low grade and manageable with the use of  corticosteroids. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has 
shown improved efficacy over either agent alone in melanoma. 
Overall, the safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy, ipilimumab monotherapy, and the 
combination of the two are manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoing 
clinical trials. There was no MTD reached at any  dose of  nivolumab tested up to 10 mg/kg. Most 
AEs were low -grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relatively few related high -grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. 
There  was no pattern  in the incidence,  severity, or causality  of AEs with respect  to nivolumab dose 
level.  
A pattern  of immune -related AEs has been  defined, for which  management  algorithms  have been 
developed; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most high -grade events were manageable with  the 
use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms.  
Participants with newly  diagnosed metastatic or recurrent NSCLC represent a great unmet need. 
Recent  studies from other  agencies using  anti-TIGIT  antibodies in combination with PD-1/PD -L1 
inhibition have shown some clinical  benefit in  PD-L1 positive 1L NSCLC.

 antibodies, have  differed  from BMS -986207 as they have wild type Fc regions while  BMS -986207 
has an  inert  Fc region. This inert Fc  region may  provide less toxicity  in participants  when  used as 
monotherapy or in combination with PD- 1/PD -L1 or CTLA -4 inhibitors. 
The potential benefit of combination immunotherapy of BMS -986207 plus nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab in first line treatment of NSCLC is not yet known. The safety profile of nivolumab 
and ipilimumab plus BMS -986207 is expected to have no new categories of AEs compared to 
BMS -986207 monotherapy, nivolumab monotherapy, ipilimumab monotherapy, or nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab combination therapy. The frequencies and intensities of these AEs in the nivolumab and ipilimumab plus BMS -986207 combination may be higher. Preliminary data of 
CA020002 Part 1C, as per 20- Oct-2021, revealed that 2 out of 4 DLT -evaluable participants 
experienced DLTs with the combination of BMS -986207 1200 mg Q3W, nivolumab 360 mg 
Q3W, and ipilimumab 1  mg/kg Q6W (Grade 3 encephalitis and Grade 3 bullous dermatitis, see 
Section 3.2.1.4 for more details).
19 Per BOIN design, BMS -986207 dose of 1200 mg Q3W was 
reduced to 600 mg due to the reported DLTs. If needed, BMS -986207 dosing will be further 
reduced  in the setting  of SAEs  or worsening AE profiles.  When  BMS -986207 was combined with 
nivolumab, participants with melanoma (1 participant with a complete response [CR], 2 participants with partial response [PR]), and prostate cancer (1 participant with PR) experienced clinical  benefit (unpublished results).  When  1200 mg BMS -986207 was combined with nivolumab 
and ipilimumab (n = 6 treated participants), PR was observed in one participant with CRC and stable disease (SD) with NSCLC (post PD -1 therapy). No clinical benefit was observed in any 
participants  who  received  BMS -986207 monotherapy (unpublished results).  Other  tumor types in 
this study included pancreatic,  ovarian, breast, gastric, and urothelial cancer. In efforts  to reduce 
toxicity  associated with ipilimumab, a lower dose of 1 mg/kg at a 6 -week dosing interval  will be 
used. This dose of ipilimumab is currently approved for the treatment of 1L NSCLC in combination with nivolumab or with nivolumab and 2 cycles of chemotherapy. 
Patients who develop immune -related AEs may require prolonged treatment with high dose 
corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents.  This  could  increase the risk of opportunistic 
infections. Immune -related AE management algorithms in the protocol recommend antibiotic 
prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in such situations. 
The clinical studies of BMS -986207 have been designed to minimize the overall risk to 
participants. Complete blood counts and chemistry (including liver enzyme) tests will be carried 
out prior to administration of study therapy and on a weekly basis during the first 4 weeks of treatment. In addition, complete  physical examinations  (PEs)  will be conducted on Day 1 of each 
new cycle,  along with weekly  symptom- directed  targeted  PEs during the first 4 weeks of treatment. 
Due to the potential risk of exaggerated inflammatory response, participants with auto-immune disorders, who are at risk for flare of auto-immunity, will be excluded.

Continuous safety assessments will be utilized by the Investigators and Sponsor to determine 
whether dose modification, additional safety measures, or termination of  the study is required at 
any time. In addition, AEs and SAEs will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the BMS Medical 
Monitor and World  Wide  Patient  Safety  (WWPS)  representatives to monitor for any safety  signals 
or trends. As BMS -986207 is an experimental agent, it is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or 
unanticipated reactions  may occur. However,  based  on the nonclinical safety  profile  of 
BMS -986207, and with a 91- fold exposure margin  built into the planned starting  dose of 1 mg/kg 
(or 80 mg based  an average body weight of 80 kg in cancer  patients),  the potential safety  risks  are 
expected to be minimized. 
 
No additional safety  monitoring  or routine screening  tests will be required  due to the SARS -CoV- 
2 pandemic. Participants  with recent  or acute infections will be excluded or delay  start of treatment 
as defined in Section 6.2. If  a participant has a confirmed SARS -CoV- 2 infection while on study 
treatment, dose delay or interruption of study treatment is required as described in Section  8.1.

5. STUDY DESIGN  
5.1 Overall Design  
This is a Phase 1/2a, open -label study of BMS -986207, administered as a single agent, in 
combination with nivolumab, and in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in 
participants with  advanced solid  tumors.  The duration of the study will be approximately 6 years.  
The study comprises 2 parts.  Part 1 includes dose escalation  of BMS -986207 alone (Part 1A) and 
in combination with nivolumab (Part 1B) to determine the MTD/RP2D, as well as a select dose 
level  of BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab  (Part 1C) to evaluate safety 
and preliminary  activity of the triplet combination. Part 1B includes a substudy 
conducted at a single site under site-specific Amendments 6, 7, and 8 to evaluate the safety  and 
preliminary  efficacy  of BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab  in PD-1 naive  and 
relapsed/refractory  participants with melanoma.  Part 2 includes expansion cohorts to gather 
additional preliminary   activity,  as well as additional safety,  tolerability,  PK,  
information for BMS -986207 alone (Part 2A), in combination with nivolumab 
(Part 2B), and in combination  with nivolumab and ipilimumab in NSCLC (Part 2C). Participants 
in each study  phase will complete  up to 4 periods in the study: screening,  treatment,  safety  follow- 
up, and response/survival follow- up. The overall study design is shown in Figure 5.1.2.2-1. 
5.1.1 Screening  Period  
The screening  period for all parts  of the study will be up to 28 days, and begins by establishing  the 
participant’s  initial eligibility  and signing of the informed  consent  form  (ICF).  See Appendix 2 for 
details of the informed consent process and other study governance considerations. Participants 
will be enrolled using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT), and  the screening assessments 
are shown in Table 2 -1. 
If a participant  exceeds the 28-day screening  period due to a study- related  procedure 
(eg, scheduling of a  or waiting for a study -related  laboratory value), the participant 
must be re-consented, but does not require a new participant identification  number. In this 
situation,  the f ewest  number of procedures from  the initial  screening  should be repeated  to qualify 
the participant, while maintaining participant safety and eligibility.  
5.1.2 Treatment  Period  
Treatment  cohorts are illustrated  in Figure 5.1.2.2-2 . 
5.1.2.1 Treatment  in Parts  1A, 1B,  2A, and 2B 
Participants will be treated for up to 24 weeks (3 cycles) with monotherapy as will participants treated  with combination  therapy (Parts  1B and 2B). The treatment period  will consist of up to 
3 treatment cycles of 8 weeks. Following each treatment cycle,  the decision to treat a participant 
with additional cycles of study therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle. Weekly study visits will be performed for the first 4 weeks following the first dose of study drug, followed by study visits q2w thereafter.

 Following a preliminary, within -patient dose escalation, safety cohort, each monotherapy 
treatment cycle  will comprise  4 doses of BMS -986207 administered  q2w or 2 doses of 
BMS -986207 administered  q4w. BMS -986207 infusions will take place over 60 minutes  and will 
require a 60 minute  observation period following the completion of  the infusion for  the first four 
doses of Cycle 1 for each participant. A 60- minute post infusion safety observation period is 
considered appropriate given BMS -986207 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is an 
antagonist (not an agonist) and has a low likelihood of resulting in infusion reactions. For 
participants < 42 kg on the 1600 mg dose, the infusion time will be longer than 1 hour (approximately 90 minutes; see Pharmacy Manual for more detail). In Parts 1B and 2B, each combination treatment cycle will  comprise 4 doses of BMS -986207 administered q2w or 2 doses 
of BMS -986207 when  administered  q4w,  each dose administered  in combination with nivolumab.  
Nivolumab will be given  first, over a 30-minute infusion period, followed  by BMS -986207 over a 
60-minute infusion period, beginning at least 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of 
nivolumab.  
Additional infusion details are given in the Pharmacy Manual. Tumor progression and response 
endpoints will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1

In Part 1C (Triplet cohort) and Part 2C (Triplet NSCLC Expansion), each treatment cycle is equal 
to 6 weeks. Nivolumab (360 mg) will be administered every  3 weeks and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) 
will be administered  every  6 weeks at least 30 minutes  after completion  of the nivolumab infusion. 
BMS -986207 will be administered every 3 weeks at 600 mg and/or 360 mg and will be tested in 
Part 1C per BOIN design and for dose optimization. A dose not to exceed the dose declared 
tolerable  in Part 1C will be used in Part 2C. Additional doses lower  than the dose declared  tolerable 
in Part 1C might be tested for dose optimization in Part 2C. A dose of 1200 mg BMS -986207 
administered  every  3 weeks has been  tested  per Amendment 03 but due to the DLTs  observed no 
additional participants will be tested at this dose (see Section 3.2.1.4).  
Treatment  will occur until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons as specified 
in Section 8.1 for up to 2 years. Treatment beyond initial investigator -assessed RECIST v1.1 
defined progression is  permitted  if the participant  has investigator -assessed  clinical benefit and is 
tolerating the treatment, as specified in Section 5.1.4.

Investigators.  Once the safety  (during  the DLT  evaluation)  of a dose level  has been  established  (Part  1A and/or  Part 
1B), additional participants (up to 15) may be added at that dose, to better characterize the safety, dose schedule,

design, in all the remaining and future subjects in Part 1C, BMS -986207 was de -escalated to 600 mg Q3W (for 
details,  see Section  3.2.1.4 ). Planned  dose levels  for BMS -986207 may be further modified based  on generated  data 
and additional  doses,  including  360 mg Q3W,  may be assessed  per BOIN  design  and for dose optimization  analysis 
at sponsor discretion and based upon discussion and agreement with investigators.  
d Part 2C will enroll a minimum of 20 participants per dose level of BMS -986207.  One or two doses are planned to 
be evaluated and selected from the range of doses assessed as tolerable and not exceeding the maximum tolerated 
dose in Part 1C. If two doses  will be tested  at the sponsor's  discretion,  participants  will be randomized  in a 1:2 ratio 
schema  between  the highest  dose selected  in Part 1C and the next lower  dose,  after at least 10 participants  will have 
been tested at the dose found safe in Part 1C.

 5.1.2.3 Preliminary Safety Cohort & Dose Escalation (Part 1A  and 1B) 
Approximately 35 participants are expected to be treated during each dose escalation part of  the 
study guided by Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM). Each participant will be 
administered IV doses of BMS -986207 per the cohort assignment as follows: 
• The Preliminary Safety Cohort precedes participant enrollment in Monotherapy - Dose 
Escalation (Part 1A) of the study. The first participant enrolled into monotherapy  escalation 
will receive BMS -986207 starting at the 2 mg dose level, followed 2 weeks later with intra - 
participant dose escalation to the 6 mg dose level, followed 2 weeks after that with intra - 
participant  dose escalation  to the 20 mg dose level,  This first participant  will be subject  to a 5- 
day safety observation period after receiving the first 20 mg dose. No other intra -participant 
dose escalation is planned for this study. If there are no DLTs or other safety concerns 
observed, an additional  2 participants will be enrolled in the 20 mg dose cohort. Please refer 
to Appendix 13 for complete details of the Preliminary Safety Cohort  
• In Part 1A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned flat dose levels for BMS -986207 are 
20, 80, 240, 800 and 1600 mg (assuming  an 80kg participant)  q2w, in 8-week  cycles,  for up to 
3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). In addition, a q4w schedule of BMS -986207 will be 
evaluated  at flat doses of  480 mg  and 1600 mg  (assuming an 80kg participant).  Enrollment of 
the first q4w cohort will be guided by the safety, PK, analysis from the q2w 
cohorts. Following each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of  study  therapy (up to a maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at 
the end of each cycle.  
• In Part 1B, (combination therapy dose escalation), BMS -986207 and nivolumab will be 
administered  at flat doses of 80 and 240 mg BMS -986207 q2w with 240 mg nivolumab q2w. 
In addition, BMS -986207 will be administered at flat doses of 480 and 1600 mg q4w in 
combination with  nivolumab administered at 480 mg q4w. Study drugs will be administered 
in 8- week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy (24 weeks). Following each treatment 
cycle, the decision to treat a participant with additional cycles of study therapy (up to a 
maximum of 6 cycles), will be based on tumor assessment at the end of each cycle.  
 
Planned dose levels  and dose schedules of BMS -986207 and/or nivolumab may be modified, and 
intermediate dose levels of BMS -986207 added, based upon the BLRM analysis and/or sponsor 
discretion  and discussion  with  the Investigators.  Once  the safety  (during the  DLT  evaluation) of a 
dose level  has been  established  (Part  1A and/or Part 1B), additional participants (up to 15) may be 
added at that dose, to better characterize the safety,  dose schedule, PK,  profile  
assessments.  Part 1B combination dose escalation  will be initiated  after at least 3 dose 
levels have been found to be tolerable in  Part 1A monotherapy dose escalation.  The starting  dose 
of BMS -986207 in Part 1B will be at least 1 dose level below a dose that was demonstrated  to be 
tolerated in Part 1A.  At no time will the dose for BMS -986207 in Part 1B exceed the highest 
tolerated dose in Part 1A. Escalation within Parts  1A and 1B, within the constraints cited above, 
may be done in parallel.

Sentinel  Participant  
During the dose escalation phase,  a staggered  dosing (sentinel participant) approach will be used. 
The first participant in  both Parts  1A and 1B will receive Cycle  1 Day1  dose of study drug(s),  and 
be observed for 5 days, before additional participants (ie, Participant 2 onward in that cohort) 
receive study  drugs. The first participants  to be dosed in all subsequent dose level  cohorts will also 
be subject to a 5 -day sentinel period. 
Initially, 3 participants will be enrolled  at the start of each cohort, in accordance with the sentinel 
participant approach  cited  above. However,  to allow  for any unforeseen discontinuations (such  as 
disease  progression) before the 4-week  dose- limiting  toxicity  (DLT)  period is completed, an extra 
participant  may be enrolled in each dose escalation  cohort. Therefore,  there  will be a total of 
4 participants  (3 + 1) at the start of each cohort, provided that the fourth participant  is able to start 
the first day of dosing within approximately 1 week of the third participant in the same dose escalation cohort.

5.1.2.4 Dose Escalation Decisions for Monotherapy and Combination (Parts  1A 
and 1B)  
The dose escalation phase of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMS -986207, 
given alone or  in combination with nivolumab, based on DLTs, using a BLRM  model (for  
BMS -986207 as monotherapy) and a BLRM -copula model (for BMS -986207 in combination with 
nivolumab).  
Combination dose escalation  (Part 1B)  will not begin until 3 dose cohorts (i.e., 20 mg, 80 mg  and 
240 mg) have been determined to be safe in monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1A) During the 
dose escalation phase, a set of  approximately 3 participants will be treated at each specified dose 
level. Cohort tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendation will occur when at least 2 evaluable participants  within  a cohort have completed  a 4-week  DLT  period. Any toxicities 
that occur beyond the 4 -week DLT period will be accounted for in making dose level decisions 
and/or dose level modifications.  
If the potential DLT occurring in  the third evaluable participant regarding  the specific  dose level 
does not influence the dose recommendation by BLRM  or the BLRM -Copula model,  the next dose 
level may proceed without waiting for the third participant to complete the corresponding DLT observation period, after discussion and agreement between the Sponsor and Investigators. Continuous re-assessment  of dose recommendation, by BLRM  in the escalation  phase and BLRM - 
Copula in the combination phase, will be carried out for each dose level. Planned dose levels for 
dose escalation are provided in Table 5.1.2.4-1. Planned dose levels may be modified, or intermediate dose levels added, based upon the BLRM analysis.

The RP2D dose of BMS -986207, alone and in combination with nivolumab, selected for cohort 
expansion will be based  on evaluating  the recommendation from  BLRM  and an overall assessment 
of all available safety, PK/  and efficacy data.  
Once  the safety  (during  DLT  evaluation) of a dose level  has been  established  (Part  1A and/or Part 
1B), additional participants (up to a total of 15) may be added to that dose level, to better 
characterize the PK, safety   profiles  assessments.  
5.1.2.5 Dose Limiting Toxicities in Dose Escalation Phases  (Parts  1A and 1B) 
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation,  DLTs  will be defined based  on the incidence,  intensity, 
and duration of AEs for which  no clear  alternative cause is identified. The DLT  period will be 28 
days (4 weeks)  in Part 1A and 28 days (4 weeks) in  Part 1B. Any toxicities  that occur  beyond the 
4-week DLT period will be accounted for in making dose level decisions. 
For the purpose of participant management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, regardless of the 
cycle in which it occurs, will lead to discontinuation of study drug. Participants who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation period for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced with a new participant  at the same  dose level.  The incidence of DLT(s)  during the DLT  evaluation 
period will be used in dose escalation decisions and to define the MTD. AEs occurring after the 4-week DLT evaluation period will be considered for the purposes of defining the RP2D upon 
agreement  between  the Sponsor, Medical  Monitor, and Investigators, if the AEs are determined  to 
have no clear alternative cause and are not related to disease progression.  
Participants experiencing a DLT will not be retreated with study drug and will enter the safety follow -up period of the study. AEs will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03. 
5.1.2.6 Safety Evaluation Phase of Part 1C  
Up to 18 participants  per dose level  tested  will be treated  in the Triplet Cohort. BMS -986207 will 
be administered  at 600 mg and/or 360 mg q3w and nivolumab will be administered  at 360 mg q3w. 
Ipilimumab, at a dose of  1 mg/kg, will be given q6w. The DLT period in Part 1C will be 42 days 
(6 weeks).  
A dose of 1200 mg BMS -986207 administered  every  3 weeks has been  tested  per Amendment 03 
but due to the DLTs  observed no additional participants  will be tested  at this dose (see 
Section 3.2.1.4).

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 The DLT safety monitoring during the dose evaluation phase, including the potential decision to 
de-escalate to a lower dose, will be based on the BOIN design framework with target toxicity 
(DLT) rate of 30% (24%, 36%), as presented in Table 5.1.2.6-1.23,24 The BOIN design takes a 
very simple form, rendering it easy to implement in practice. It is more straightforward and 
transparent  than other model- based  and model- assisted  methods. The decisions on dose tolerability 
guided by the design are based  on comparing the observed DLT  rate at the current dose with a pair 
of fixed dose escalation and de -escalation boundaries. This allows generation of a decision table 
that guides DLT  assessment  depending on the number of participants  treated  and observed DLTs. 
The performance of  the design based on the operating characteristics is shown in Appendix 12. 
As a dose escalation is not planned in Part 1C, a design recommendation to declare a dose as 
tolerable  is based  on meeting  the same  criteria  needed to escalate.  A minimum  of 6 DLT  evaluable 
participants will be required in Part 1C to declare a dose tolerable for initiation of Part 2C. In 
addition, to better estimate tolerability of the dose level in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab,  more  participants  will be treated  even  if a dose is declared  tolerable  with n=6, for up 
to a total of 18 treated. In contrast, a design recommendation “Stay” indicates that this dose level 
needs to be evaluated further for safety to declare this dose tolerable. In that case, additional cohorts of 3-4 or more participants (depending on the number of  observed DLTs) will be treated 
up to a total of 18. If dose -de-escalation is recommended by the design based on the number of 
participants  with DLTs  observed during this dose evaluation phase ( Table  5.1.2.6-1),  then the next 
lower dose level  will be used (360 mg BMS -986207 q3w) for the remaining participants as well 
as for those currently  on treatment. In  addition, other lower doses of  BMS -986207 (200 mg q3w) 
than that seen as safe and tolerable may also be tested.  
Initially, the first 3 to 4 participants treated in the Triplet Cohort will be evaluated for DLTs. If 0 or 1 DLT  is observed during the 6- week  DLT  period, an additional 3-4 participants  will be treated 
at the same BMS -986207 dose level. If ≤1 DLTs are observed out of the first 6 DLT -evaluable 
participants, the dose will be considered safe. If 2 DLTs are observed out of 6 DLT -evaluable 
participants,  an additional 3-4 participants  will be enrolled. If ≤3 DLTs  are observed out of 9 DLT - 
evaluable participants,  an additional 3 participants  will be enrolled. If 2 DLTs  are observed out of 
12 DLT evaluable participants, the dose level will be considered safe.  
If 3
 or 4 DLTs  are observed out of 12 DLT  evaluable participants  as shown in Table  5.1.2.6-1, the 
design recommends to stay  at the same dose level, indicating that more participants may need to 
be evaluated  to determine  whether the dose level  is safe.  After considering additional information 
such as provided in Table 5.1.2.6-2 and the totality of available data including safety, 
PK/pharmacodynamics from all treated participants, a lower dose may be considered for evaluation, (eg, if 4 /12 DLTs)  or the dose may be considered safe (eg, with 3/12 DLTs) based  on 
discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor/Medical Monitor, and based on posterior probability of the  DLT  rate exceeding  the target.  Once  a dose is declared  safe based  on at least 
6 participants, an additional 6- 12 participants may be treated up to a total of 18 to continue to 
confirm the safety of the selected dose. At the same time, enrollment in Part 2C may begin. In addition, another cohort up to 18 participants  may be treated  at the next lower  dose of BMS -986207 
to optimize  dose selection.  Participants  who do not complete  the DLT  observation period for

 reasons other than DLTs may be replaced. De -escalation may be considered if the safety and

discussion between the Investigator (s) and the Sponsor/Medical Monitor.

 5.1.2.7 Cohort  Expansion (Parts  2A, 2B, and 2C) 
The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS -986207 alone and in combination with nivolumab. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout 
enrollment in the expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment -related 
toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all participants treated in cohort expansions 
2A or 2B,  the findings will be discussed  and further enrollment will  be interrupted. Depending on 
the nature and grade of the toxicity, and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to 
previously tested, lower dose levels.  
In Part 2A, only CRC will be evaluated in cohort expansion with BMS -986207 as monotherapy. 
In Part 2B, the 3 disease -restricted  populations, ovarian cancer,  colorectal cancer  (CRC)  and HCC 
will be investigated in cohort expansions with BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab. A 
Fleming 2 -stage design framework will be used as a guide in cohort expansion. 
During the cohort expansion phase, participants with CRC who have disease progression on BMS -986207 monotherapy will be able to cross over to combination treatment (BMS -986207 + 
nivolumab), once the CRC expansion arms (ie, monotherapy and combination therapy) are both enrolling. This cross- over option, for CRC  participants  only, is not applicable during the escalation 
phases.  
The purpose of Part 2C is to gather preliminary efficacy information regarding BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. Participants with advanced, treatment -naive 
NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 will be treated with BMS -986207 in combination with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab. BMS -986207 will be administered at 600 mg q3w (or tolerable dose 
as determined in Part 1C) and nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg q3w. Ipilimumab, at a dose of 1 mg/kg, will be given q6w. 
Part 2C may begin once there is sufficient safety data from a minimum of 6 participants in Part 
1C. 
Part 2C will enroll a minimum of 20 participants  per dose level  of BMS -986207. One or two doses 
are planned to be evaluated and selected from the range of doses assessed as tolerable and not 
exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in Part 1C. If two doses will be tested at the Sponsor’s discretion,  participants  will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio schema between  the highest dose selected 
in Part 1C and the next lower dose, after at least 10 participants will have been tested at the dose found safe in Part 1C. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity  events will also be performed  in this part of the study. If, at any 
time,  the aggregate rate  of treatment -related  toxicities meeting  DLT  criteria  exceeds 33%  in Parts 
2A or 2B, the findings will be discussed  and further enrollment may be interrupted.  In addition, a 
more  guided continuous safety  monitoring will be implemented  in Part 2C, 1L NSCLC expansion, 
using a Bayesian framework and specific criteria based on a posterior probability of a DLT rate exceeding  33% implemented  starting  with n=6 ( Table  10.3.8-1).  D

and 2B)  
All participants  will be treated  for up to 24 weeks (3 cycles)  with monotherapy (Parts  1A and 2A) 
or combination  therapy (Parts  1B and 2B), unless treatment discontinuation criteria  are met earlier 
(Section 8.1). Participants with ongoing disease control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed 
p 
rogressive disease, after completing approximately the initial 24 weeks of treatment, may be 
eligible for an additional 3 cycles of study therapy in both the monotherapy (Parts 1A and 2A) 
and combination therapy  (Parts  1B and 2B). These participants  will be selected on a case by  case 
basis,  after careful  evaluation  and discussion with the BMS  Medical  Monitor, to determine  whether 
the risk/benefit ratio supports administration  of further study therapy. Upon completion  of 3 cycles 
of study therapy (or up to a maximum of 6 cycles if applicable),  all participants  will enter  the safety 
follow -up period. 
Individual p articipants  with confirmed  CR will be given the option to discontinue study  treatment, 
on a case by case basis, after specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator and BMS Medical Monitor in settings where benefit/risk justify discontinuation of study therapy. 
5.1.3 Follow -up 
5.1.3.1 Safety Follow -up Period  
For participants in Parts 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B, upon completion of  3 cycles of  study therapy (or up 
to a maximum of 6 cycles if applicable), and once the decision is made to discontinue the 
participant  from  treatment,  ie, at end of treatment  (EOT),  all participants  will enter  a safety  follow- 
up period. 
In Parts 1C and 2C, participants can receive study  treatments up to a maximum of 2 years in the 
absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once a decision is made to discontinue 
treatment, the participant will enter a safety follow -up period. 
For participants  who complete all scheduled  cycles of therapy, the EOT  visit will be the same visit 
as the last scheduled and completed on -treatment visit, and will be the start of the safety follow -

 up period. For participants  who do not complete all scheduled  cycles of therapy, the EOT  visit will 
be the most recent on treatment visit (with all available safety and response data), and will not 
need to be repeated. Accordingly, for these participants, this visit will be considered the start of the safety follow -up period. 
After the EOT visit,  all participants will be evaluated for any new  AEs for at least 100 days after 
the last dose of therapy. Follow -up visits should occur at Day 30, 60 and 100 ( ± 7 days) after the 
last dose, or the date of  discontinuation ( ± 7 days). All participants will be required to complete 
the 3 clinical safety follow -up visits, regardless of whether new anti -cancer therapy is started, 
except those participants who withdraw consent for study participation. 
5.1.3.2 Response Follow -up Period (Parts  1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C) 
Participants, with SD, PR, or CR, at the time of the EOT visit or at the time of study drug 
discontinuation, will continue to have radiologic and clinical tumor  assessments every 12 weeks 
for the first year after discontinuation of study drug/EOT visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive  tumor assessment  scans as per standard  of care  guidelines, or at a minimum  of every 
6 months up to 2 years following the last dose of study drug, or until disease progression/withdrawal of study consent. Radiological assessments for participants who have ongoing clinical benefit may continue to be collected after participants complete the survival follow -up period of the study. Participants who have disease progression following an initial 
course of study therapy will not be evaluated for response beyond the EOT visit, and will be allowed to receive other tumor directed therapy as required. 
5.1.3.3 Survival  Follow -up Period  
In parallel  with the safety  follow -up period, participants in Parts  1A, 1B, 2A and 2B will start the 
survival follow -up period. Participants will be followed -up by telephone every 12 weeks (from 
EOT)  for 2 years  until death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal  of consent, or conclusion of the study, 
whichever comes first. Participants with SD, PR or CR will have both the response follow -up 
period and survival follow -up period occur simultaneously during the 2- year follow -up period. 
The duration of this follow -up is up to 2  years following the last dose of study drug, although a 
longer follow -up period could be considered in selected cases if an efficacy signal is apparent. 
Tumor assessment scans, for participants who have ongoing clinical benefit beyond the 2 year 
period following last dose of study  drug, may continue to be collected as part of standard-of- care 
treatment.  
In Parts  1C and 2C, the survival follow -up period  will continue for 2 years following  the last dose 
of study drug or until death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or conclusion of  the study, 
whichever comes  first. Survival follow -up visits  will occur every  12 weeks (±7 days) until 2 years 
after the last dose of study  drug. Study assessments are to be collected as outlined in Table 2 -5. 
5.1.3.4 Retreatment During Follow -up Periods (Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B) 
Retreatment  may be  allowed for  participants  with disease progression during the safety, response 
or survival follow -up period. Participants completing approximately  3 cycles of study therapy (or 
up to a maximum  of 6 cycles,  if applicable),  and entering  the survival follow -up period  with

 ongoing disease control (CR,  PR or SD), may be eligible  for retreatment upon disease progression. 
Eligibility  will be dependent upon participants  having confirmed  disease progression within 
12 months after the last dose of study drug, and will considered on a case by case basis, after 
careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor, to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio supports administration  of further study therapy. Participants  meeting  criteria  for 
retreatment  will have to  provide written  consent prior to  receiving any additional  retreatments,  by 
signing an ICF which describes any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts, or other alternative  treatment  options. Participants  meeting  criteria  for, and consenting to, retreatment,  will 
be treated with the originally assigned monotherapy or combination therapy regimen (eg, same dose and dose schedule as administered  during the first 24 weeks),  unless that dose and its schedule 
were  subsequently found to exceed  the MTD.  In that case,  the participant  will be treated  at the next 
lower or alternate dose and schedule. Alternatively, if the MTD has been determined at the time point when the participant is being retreated, that participant can be retreated at the MTD.  
Participants entering retreatment will follow the same Time and Events schedule as outlined in Section  2. Samples  for PK will be collected  less frequently (only at predose of each treatment 
 
5.1.4 Treatment Beyond Progression  
Treatment  beyond progression may be allowed  for a maximum treatment duration of up to 2 years 
in selected participants with initial RECIST v1.1 progressive disease, following discussion and agreement with the BMS Medical Monitor that the benefit- risk assessment favors continued 
administration  of study treatment  (eg, participants are continuing to experience clinical  benefit, as 
assessed by the Investigator, tolerating treatment, and meeting other criteria).  
A described in Section 5.4.6, accumulating evidence indicates a minority of participants treated 
with immunotherapy may derive clinical benefit despite initial evidence of progressive disease. 
Participants  will be permitted  to continue on study drug for treatment beyond initial RECIST  v1.1- 
defined progressive disease as long as they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator- assessed  clinical  benefit and no rapid  disease progression  
• Participant  is tolerating  study treatment 
• Stable  performance  status 
• Treatment  
 beyond progression will not delay  an imminent intervention to prevent serious  
• complications of disease  progression (eg, CNS  metastases)  
• Participant provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional BMS -986207, 
nivolumab, and ipilimumab treatment, using an ICF describing any reasonably foreseeable 
risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options.  
The decision to continue treatment beyond initial Investigator -assessed progression should be 
discussed  with the BMS  Medical  Monitor and documented in the study records. A follow -up scan 
should be performed within 4 to 6 weeks of original progressive disease to determine whether 
there  has been  a decrease in  the tumor size or continued progression of  disease.  Subsequent scans 
should be performed every 12 weeks until further progression is determined. If the Investigator

 feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing treatment, the 
participant  should remain  on the trial and continue to receive  monitoring  according to the Schedule 
of Activities  in Section  2. For participants who continue study  therapy beyond progression, further 
progression is defined as an additional 10% increase in tumor burden from time of initial progressive disease.  This includes  an increase in the sum of  diameters of all target lesions and/or 
the diameters of new measurable lesions compared to the time of initial progressive disease. Nivolumab, ipilimumab, and BMS -986207 treatment should be discontinued permanently upon 
documentation of further progression. 
New lesions are considered measurable  at the time  of initial  progression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes which  must have  a short axis of at least 
15 mm).  Any new lesion  considered non- measurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable  and therefore  included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm  (except for pathological  lymph  nodes, which  must  have  a short axis of at least 15 mm).  In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusion of new lesions which become measurable,  these new lesions must  demonstrate an absolute increase 
of at least 5 mm.  
5.1.5 Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees  
BMS has developed a multi -layered process to ensure safety monitoring through close 
collaboration of study site Investigators, the BMS study team, and the BMS Worldwide Patient Safety  (WWPS) -led Safety  Management Team  (SMT). This collaborative process constitutes the 
safety -monitoring plan for the study. To support safety oversight, BMS has established ongoing 
processes for collection,  review,  analysis,  and submission  of individual adverse event  reports and 
their aggregate analyses.  Because this  is an open- label  study, WWPS,  the BMS  Medical  Monitor, 
and the Investigators will have access to all data necessary for safety evaluation.  
BMS WWPS is an internal group that operates independently from the clinical team to monitor safety  across  all BMS  protocols and analyze  all accumulated  safety  data.  Within  BMS,  an SMT is 
established for investigational therapies under clinical development, and a member of WWPS chairs this team. In addition, safety signal detection is performed at least monthly and ad hoc throughout the study by the SMT composed, at a minimum,  of the WPS medical  safety  assessment 
physician (Chair of the SMT) and WWPS single -case review physician, the study Medical 
Monitor, the study biostatistician, and epidemiologist, all of whom evaluate the safety data regularly. Furthermore, the SMT routinely monitors for actual or potential issues related to 
participant  safety  that could  result in  a change in the medical  benefit- risk balance associated  with 
the use of study treatment(s). For Part 2C, continuous safety monitoring based on a Bayesian 
framework is also planned in the NSCLC cohort for ongoing evaluation of  the tolerability of the 
selected dose.  
5.2 N
 umber  of Participants 
The approximate number of evaluable participants will be approximately 241. Approximately  100 
of these participants will be treated with monotherapy and combination therapy dose escalation (35 participants  each for Part 1A and Part 1B and additional 30 participants  for the substudy of

 Part 1B), and approximately 36 participants treated (6 initial participants for safety evaluation 
followed by evaluation of approximately 12 additional participants per dose level) with BMS - 
986207, nivolumab, and ipilimumab in the Triplet Cohort (Part 1C). The remaining participants (up to 105) will be treated  as part of  dose expansion, with up to 24 participants in Part  2A and 41 
participants  in Part 2B, and 40 participants with NSCLC  and 
(pre-existing or prior PD -L1 IHC results from testing of tumor tissue) considered to 
be response -evaluable, in Part 2C. In the event more  than 25% of  the participants in Part 2C are 
found to have a PD -L1 tumor cell score of < 1%, based on central lab testing, additional 
participants  may be enrolled  in order  to have at least 30 participants with a PD-L1 tumor cell score 
≥ 1%. 
5.3 End of Study Definition  
The start of the study is defined as the first visit for the first participant screened. Similarly, the 
end of the study is defined as the last visit or scheduled procedure shown in the Time and Events schedule for the last participant. Primary study completion is defined as the final date on which data for the primary endpoint was or is expected to be collected. 
5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
BMS -986207 is  being investigated  in humans with advanced  solid  tumors; either  as monotherapy 
and in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. The study design for Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 
2B includes the following: 
• 28-day screening period 
• 24-week (3 cycles)  treatment period, with the  option of an additional  24 weeks (3 cycles) of 
treatment (granted on a case by case basis)  
− Dose  escalation  phase  
− Cohort expansion phase  
• Safety  follow -up period  
• Response/Survival follow -up period, with the possibility  for retreatment  
The study design for Parts  1C and 2C, aligned with concurrent use of nivolumab and ipilimumab, 
includes the following:  
• 28-day screening  period 
• Treatment  period  – up to a maximum of 2 years  in the absence of disease  progression or 
unacceptable toxicity 
• Safety  follow -up period  (30, 60, and 100 days ( ± 7 days) after last dose or date of 
discontinuation)  
• Survival follow-up period  – 2 years following  the last dose of study drug or until death, lost to 
follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or conclusion of the study, whichever comes first

 or the individual elements of the  study design are given below.

 5.4.1 Rationale for BMS- 986207 Monotherapy in Colorectal  Cancer  Cancer  
and Other Cancers Associated with Fusobacterium Nucleatum  
In CRC, bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum ( F. nucleatum ) are abundant in the tumor 
microenvironment. The amount of F. nucleatum DNA in CRC tissue is associated with shorter 
survival, and may potentially  serve  as a prognostic  F. nucleatum is thought to facilitate 
a tumor’s  ability  to evade immune  cell attack  through inhibition of the function of T lymphocytes  
and NK cells.25 Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes usually express TIGIT,  thus T cell activities can 
be inhibited by F. nucleatum via Fap2, a protein unique to F. nucleatum . Given localization of 
Fap2  in the colon, it is anticipated  that BMS -986207 monotherapy will be therapeutically  effective 
for CRC. F. nucleatum may play a role in mediating tumor immune escape through interaction 
with TIGIT in other indications, such as SCCHN, in which the bacterium may be isolated from 
saliva samples.26 In these  other tumors,  similarly  to CRC,  F. nucleatum activates  lymphocyte  
apoptosis by Fap2  and RadD,27 supporting the rationale  for testing  anti-TIGIT  therapy in SCCHN 
and other tumor types associated with F. nucleatum infection.  
In addition, microbiome  data will be collected  in other tumor types in expansion (HCC and ovarian 
cancer) to explore the hypothesis that the gut microbiome may condition the response to 
immunotherapy.28 
5.4.2 Rationale for the Combination of BMS- 986207 and Nivolumab  
Therapeutic antibodies with the ability to block immune checkpoint receptors, or activate 
immunostimulatory receptors, have the potential to be effective for the treatment of cancer by modulating the participant’s immune system. It has become apparent that tumors co -opt some 
specific immune -checkpoint pathways to engender immune resistance,  particularly  against T cells 
that are specific for tumor antigens.
29 Co-engagement of multiple immune receptors  on activated 
T cells (combination immunotherapy) may result in better outcomes as compared to engagement 
of a single immune receptor. Nonclinical data, evaluating the combination of BMS -986207 and 
nivolumab in the CT26 mouse, support this hypothesis ( Section 3.2.1.1). Combining the anti - 
TIGIT  mAb,  BMS -986207, with the anti- PD1 antibody, nivolumab, is an opportunity to evaluate 
the activity of therapeutic drugs targeting PD1 and TIGIT, given in combination, in humans. 
5.4.3 Rationale for the Combination of BMS- 986207,  Nivolumab,  and 
Ipilimumab  
As d iscussed  in Section  3.2.4, nivolumab and ipilimumab  have demonstrated  beneficial  effects in 
multiple tumor types in multiple clinical trials. Several studies have shown benefit of combining 
TIGIT  and PD-L1 inhibitors, particularly  in NSCLC patient  populations.15,16 There  are no studies, 
to date, which have examined the effects of both anti -TIGIT and anti -CTLA -4 in tumors in 
humans. TIGIT  and CTLA-4 are members  of the same family  of immunoglobulin- related  receptors 
that are responsible for various aspects of  T cell  immune regulation. Like PD -1 these receptors 
have inhibitory roles in T cell function. In BMS study BDX -1482- 105, anti -mouse TIGIT 
combined with anti -mouse CTLA -4 showed superior antitumor activity and prolonged survival 
compared  with antibodies administered as single agents in a CT26  mouse model.30 In the present

 CA020002 study, to evaluate whether a differentiated approach of using TIGIT inhibition and 
cancer immunotherapies can further enhance  immune activity, BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab  will first be evaluated  for safety  and proper doses of 
each drug in participants with various solid tumors (Part 1C). This safety  evaluation will then be  
followed  by evaluation of the safety  and efficacy  of this triplet  combination  in 1L NSCLC  patients 
with tumors having PD- L1 expression ≥1%.  
The above data,  together with  the recent  data  shown  for TIGIT  inhibition and PD -L1 inhibitors  in 
this tumor type, as well as that only limited participants (n=2) with NSCLC have been treated in 
the present CA020002 study , indicate  that further 
evaluation is warranted for BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab in 1L 
NSCLC participants whose tumors have ≥ 1% PD -L1 expression.31,32 
5.4.4 Rationale for the Combination of BMS- 986207,  Nivolumab and 
Ipilimumab in NSCLC  
Recent reports in the literature have shown comparable efficacy with anti -TIGIT agents, 
vibostolimab or tiragolumab in combination with anti -PD-L1 agents, pembrolizumab and 
atezolizumab,  respectively.  Modest or no anti-tumor activity  was seen when  the anti-TIGIT  agents 
were given as monotherapy in NSCLC, HNSCC, triple -negative breast cancer, or esophageal 
cancer populations. Best clinical responses were observed in these studies in 1L and previously 
treated NSCLC participants whose tumors expressed PD -L1.15,16,17,31 
A randomized Phase 2 study comparing the anti -TIGIT agent tiragolumab plus atezolizumab 
versus placebo plus atezolizumab in PD -L1-positive 1L Stage IV NSCLC patients demonstrated 
improvement in the overall response rate (ORR; 37% vs. 21% with atezolizumab alone). The 
treatment regimen was well tolerated, with safety similar to that seen in the placebo plus atezolizumab treatment. In addition, recent data presented from  a Phase 1 study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
of
 the anti-TIGIT   antibody  vibostolimab  plus pembrolizumab   in participants  with 
anti-PD-(L)1-naive NSCLC demonstrated anti -tumor activity  (ORR 29% in all patients and 46% 
in patients  with PD-L1 ≥ 1%  expression).16,17 These data suggest  that combining TIGIT  blockade 
with anti- PD-(L)1 can be safe, tolerable, and have clinical benefits in PD -L1-positive 1L 
NSCLC.16,32 
In the present CA020002 study, heterogeneous, refractory solid tumor participant populations 
primarily  with tumors  that are not anti-PD-1 responsive (eg, CRC,  ovarian, post- PD-1 melanoma) 
have been enrolled and treated either with BMS -986207 monotherapy or BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab. There was no opportunity to evaluate BMS -986207 in NSCLC 
patients in Cohorts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B. The first two participants with NSCLC were enrolled in 
Part 1C.  
Data from BMS CheckMate 227, a randomized, open- label, phase 3 study in participants with 
treatment- naive PD -L1-positive NSCLC demonstrated that, among the patients with a PD -L1 
tumor cell expression level of 1% or more, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was 
safe and tolerable and improved overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone (median

 OS=17.1 versus 14.9 months, HR=0.79, 95% CI: 0.65-0.96).33 The combination  of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab without chemotherapy is approved, per  the USPI, for adults with metastatic NSCLC 
expressing PD- L1 ≥ 1%.34,35 
Based on these data and specific indications, the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination is an 
appropriate backbone therapy  in PD-L1 positive 1L NSCLC for the addition of a novel anti- TIGIT 
agent BMS -986207. Using this triplet combination enables the use of a checkpoint inhibitors 
combination of  proven efficacy  (nivolumab  + ipilimumab),  along with the potential advantage of 
adding anti -TIGIT (BMS -986207) to a NSCLC population that appears to benefit from TIGIT 
inhibition based  on recent  studies.16,17 Inclusion  of 1L NSCLC patients  with PD-L1 expression  
≥ 1% will capture the potential benefit of an anti- TIGIT antibody in a larger population and 
promote enrollment. Recently published data support the use of anti -TIGIT antibodies in this 
population and, if proved to be effective, will fulfill the unmet need of  treatment options that do 
not include chemotherapy. 
5.4.5 Rationale for Treatment Duration  
Despite recent advances in immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the ideal treatment 
duration to achieve and perpetuate good durable response is still an area of ongoing investigation. 
Current clinical data on the time to response suggest that, most patients who show a response, do so within  the first 24 weeks  on therapy. At the time of this study’s initiation,  treatment  with BMS - 
986207, alone or in combination with nivolumab, was limited to 24 weeks (3 cycles), with an option of an additional 24 weeks (3 cycles)  based  on evaluation  of individual risk/benefit on a case 
by case basis.  
Accumulating evidence from different clinical trials in which participants with different tumor 
types were treated with nivolumab or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab indicates that most 
responses generally occur early, with a median time to response of 2 to 4 months including 
responses observed in patients with NSCLC.  
36,37, 38 A recent analysis in a melanoma study 
suggests the majority of patients who discontinue nivolumab and/or ipilimumab for toxicity maintain disease control in the absence of further treatment.  
39 For these reasons, treatments in 
Parts 1C and 2C will be given for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
5.4.6 Rationale for Treatment Beyond Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents produce atypical  clinical  response patterns  that are not usually observed 
with conventional chemotherapy. Accumulating clinical  evidence indicates  that some  participants 
treated with immune system stimulating agents may develop disease progression by the 
conventional response criteria before demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or SD.  
Two distinct nonconventional patterns have been reported: 1) a  reduction in target tumor burden 
despite the appearance of new lesion(s), and 2) a transient increase in target tumor burden in an 
initial phase, followed by subsequent tumor shrinkage.

 These phenomena were observed in the Phase 2 study (CA209003) of nivolumab in solid tumor 
patients. Two hypotheses potentially explain these phenomena. First, enhanced inflammation within tumors could lead to an increase in tumor size, which would appear as enlarged index lesions and as newly visible small non -index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and 
inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease, leading to overt signs of clinical improvement. Alternatively, in some individuals, the kinetics of tumor growth may initially outpace anti -tumor immune activity. With sufficient time, the anti -tumor activity will dominate 
and become clinically apparent. Therefore, it is important to avoid premature discontinuation of the study drug that might induce a nonconventional response pattern in some patients. 
The decision  to continue treatment  beyond investigator -assessed  progression should be discussed 
with the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study records. The assessment of clinical 
benefit should take into account whether the participant is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to 
receive further benefit from continued treatment.  
5.4.7 Rationale for Tumor  Selection  
TIGIT is expressed by activated T cells, Tregs, and NK cells, and binds the adhesion molecules 
PVR (CD155) and Nectin -2 (CD112) with higher and lower affinity, respectively.
13 PVR and 
Nectin -2 also bind to TIGIT’s co -stimulatory counterpart, DNAM -1 (CD226). DNAM -1 is an 
activating receptor expressed on NK cells, CD8+ T cells, and other immune cells.  40 Upon 
recognizing its ligands PVR and Nectin- 2, DNAM -1 promotes NK cell –mediated elimination of 
damaged cells.  
One can hypothesize that the tumors most likely to respond to anti -TIGIT therapy  are those with 
the highest PVR/Nectin -2 expression, and those with moderate -to-high immune cell infiltration. 
Accordingly, the selected tumor types of HCC, CRC, ovarian cancer, and NSCLC and their 
respective rationale for selection, are given in Table 5.4.7-1.

5.4.8 Rationale for Dose Escalation Phase Design  
The BLRM  with an overdose control principle  escalation  was selected  as an appropriate  design for 
this study. It offers  more  accuracy and efficiency  in determining  the true  MTD compared to 
rule-based methods (such  as 3 + 3 design) by incorporating  external information from preclinical 
studies as well as historical clinical trials. The Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) 
principle limits the risk of exposing participants in the next cohort to an unsafe or toxic dose. Hence, it ensures that safety is not compromised during dose escalation. Simulation results 
demonstrate that BLRM allows fast escalation when the expected toxicity is very low and with 
participants  treated  at sub- therapeutic  doses,  which  is attributed  to the adaptive Bayesian  learning 
from previous doses. In addition, BLRM has greater applicability to the combination therapy setting  compared  to other  model- based  methods. After completing  the monotherapy phases (Parts 
1A and 1B), the drug- associated  dose- toxicity  profiles  are characterized  and incorporated as prior 
knowledge into the drug combination phase of the study (Parts 2A and 2B) or used in future studies.  
For Part 1C where  a single select  dose level  of BMS -986207 will be evaluated  with potential for a 
lower dose (de -escalation), a simpler mode -assisted design framework will be used, the BOIN 
design, to evaluate tolerability based on incidence of DLTs.
23,24 Additional lower doses may be 
tested for dose optimization at the Sponsor’s discretion.  
5.5 Justification for Planned Dose  Selection  
5.5.1 The current  study is a FIH study.  
There  is no previous clinical  experience with BMS -986207.  
5.5.1.1 Introduction  
The FIH starting  dose of BMS -986207 as an immune- mediated  anti-cancer  agent was  determined 
using both toxicology- and pharmacology- (anti-tumor efficacy) -based  approaches to ensure

 participant  safety  while  limiting  the number of participants  receiving nonpharmacologically active 
doses. The toxicology -based approach utilized the HNSTD determined from a 1 -month repeat - 
dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The pharmacology- based approach leveraged the 
pharmacology data (ie,  anti- tumor efficacy)  obtained from  mouse surrogates to project the human 
effective  dose, from which  the FIH starting  dose was selected.  The starting  doses determined  from 
both approaches were  integrated,  and the lower  dose (1 mg/kg or 80 mg assuming  an average  body 
weight of 80 kg in cancer patients) derived from the pharmacology data is recommended as the 
FIH starting dose for BMS -986207. 
To further ensure a sufficient safety margin for the monotherapy  starting dose, given the absence 
of previous clinical experience with  BMS -986207, a Preliminary Safety Cohort (PSC) was added 
to the study.  In the PSC, a single participant will receive BMS -986207 monotherapy starting at 
the 2 mg dose,  with intra-participant dose escalation to  6 mg, and then to 20 mg. Following a 
5-day safety observation period for this participant following the initial administration of the 20 
mg dose, two additional participants will begin the study at the 20 mg BMS -986207 dose level. 
See Appendix 13 for complete detail on the Preliminary Safety Cohort.  
5.5.1.2 Nonclinical  Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy  
Human starting dose selection is based on preclinical pharmacological activity. The anti -tumor 
efficacy  of an anti -mouse TIGIT  antibody surrogate  (10A7- mIgG1  D265A,  abbreviated  as 10A7) 
was studied in a mouse CT26 colon adenocarcinoma model as a single agent and in combination 
with an anti-mouse PD-1 antibody (4H2 -mIgG1  D265A, abbreviated as 4H2).  In the study, 10A7 
did not have single agent activities. When combined with 4H2, 10A7 exhibited dose -dependent 
anti-tumor efficacies, and with the dose increased from 0 to 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg, the median 
tumor growth inhibition (TGI) increased  from  respectively. 
Consistently, the number of tumor- free mice in each dose group   also 
increased  in a dose-dependent manner. The effective dose of 10A7  in combination with 4H2 in the 
mouse CT26  model is considered  to be  to achieve  close to maximal  efficacy  (    TGI).  
At the effective dose level,  the Cave.14d and Cmin.14d of 10A7  are estimated  to be 
μM, respectively. Because 10A7 and BMS -986207 exhibited similar binding affinities on the 
respective activated  mouse  and human CD8+  T cells 
respectively),  the  human effective  dose of BMS -986207 is projected  to target  the steady -state Cave 
and Cmin of  , respectively. 
To project the human effective dose, the human clearance  was allometrically  scaled 
from the cynomolgus monkey data with a power exponent of   , and the human volume of 
distribution (  was assumed  to be equal  to that in cynomolgus monkeys (Please  refer to 
Table 5.5.1.2-1). Additionally, the following assumptions were made: 1) 2- compartment PK 
model; 2) dose -proportional PK; and 3) minimal impact of ADAs on PK. By  achieving the same 
Cave  and Cmin  in humans at the steady  state as the effective Cave.14d and Cmin.14d in mice,  the 
human effective  dose of BMS -986218, administered  q2w, was projected  to be 4 mg/kg (or 320 mg 
for a body weight of 80 kg).  At the equivalent  exposure of the clinical  starting  dose, the projected 
anti-tumor efficacy of its mouse surrogate 10A7 in combination with 4H2 is approximately 
TGI in the CT26 tumor model.

5.5.1.3 Nonclinical  Toxicity Data  
The nonclinical safety of  BMS -986207 was evaluated in vitro in a human tissue cross -reactivity 
study and cytokine release and lymphocyte activation assays with human cells, as well as in an  
in vivo 1- month intermittent repeat- dose IV toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
cynomolgus monkey was selected  as the toxicology species because BMS -986207 binds to TIGIT 
expressed  on activated  cynomolgus monkey T cells with a similar  affinity  as TIGIT  expressed  on 
activated  human  T cells and is 
pharmacologically  active  in monkeys. BMS-986207 does not bind rodent TIGIT.  
In a Good Laboratory Practice -compliant tissue cross- reactivity study in normal human tissues, 
fluoresceinated  BMS -986207 produced membrane  and cytoplasmic staining  of mononuclear cells 
in human lymphoid tissues and select nonlymphoid tissues. This staining was expected based on 
TIGIT  expression by mononuclear  cell types, such as T cells and NK cells. No unexpected tissue 
cross- reactivity was observed. BMS -986207 did not induce cytokine release or increase the 
expression of activation   on human T, B, or NK cells in an in vitro  human peripheral blood  
mononuclear  cell cytokine  release  and cell activation  assay,  suggesting  a low risk of 
BMS -986207-induced cytokine release syndrome. 
In a 1-month pivotal toxicity  study in monkeys, BMS -986207 was administered  IV as a slow bolus 
at doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg (5 doses/week). BMS -986207 was clinically  well tolerated  by 
all monkeys at 30 and 100 mg/kg doses, while 3 out of 10 monkeys in the 10 mg/kg dose group 
exhibited signs  of ADA mediated  hypersensitivity reactions  immediately  after dosing. The clinical 
signs were transient, accompanied by increases in serum cytokine levels and complement activation, and no treatment was required for the affected monkeys. The timing, type of clinical observations,
 and correlative  complement  activation  are consistent  with the formation  of

responses  in terms  of NK cell activation,  CD8+  T cell activation  and 
proliferation,  were  observed at all doses,  and were  generally  dose-independent. Based  on the lack 
of directly  BMS -986207- related  adverse findings, the no-observed- adverse- effect  level  (NOAEL)  
 
Overall, the nonclinical toxicology assessment of BMS -986207 has demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile, supporting clinical use in oncology patients. 
5.5.1.4 Rationale for Starting  Dose in Humans  
The selection  of the BMS -986207 starting  dose is based  on the nonclinical CT26  mouse syngeneic 
tumor model (TGM1607), for combined  BMS -986207 and nivolumab, and the pivotal repeat -dose 
IV toxicology study in monkeys. 
In the pivotal repeat -dose (5 doses/week) IV toxicity  study, the dose of 
) was established  as the HNSTD and NOAEL  dose.  Using  a safety  factor of 6, 
the maximum recommended starting  dose (MRSD)  of  was derived. This toxicity -based 
dose of  was considered an inappropriate starting dose given that dose level’s 
relationship to the projected human effective dose.  
Therefore,  the projected human effective dose derived from  CT26 mouse tumor model  was used 
to determine  the selection  of the FIH starting  dose.  At the dose of 1 mg/kg for BMS -986207 
(IV q2w), its TGI was projected as approximately   Additionally, the dose of 1 mg/kg was 
projected  with AUC (0-336h) ,ss of which has an approximate fold safety 
margin relative to the AUC[0 -168h],ss of HNSTD and NOAEL dose 
from the weekly, repeat -dose monkey study, after normalization  of the dosing interval.  
Based on the projected  TG I and the corresponding - fold safety margin, 1 mg/kg was 
selected as the FIH starting dose for BMS -986207 monotherapy, administered q2w. The 
recommended starting  human  dose of 1 mg/kg was converted to a flat dose  of 80 mg by multiplying  
by a standard  body weight assumption  of 80 kg. 
5.5.2 Rationale for Dosing Schedule  
5.5.2.1 BMS- 986207 
In this study, the BMS -986207 dosing schedule of q2w was based on the projected human half - 
life, derived from a monkey single dose study . The PK profiles of BMS -986207 in 
monkeys following a single  IV dose of 1, 10, and 100 mg/kg  were  used to project the human PK

In addition, for determination of the maximum recommended 
was also considered  the HNSTD.  The HNSTD/NOAEL  of

 parameters. The projected half- life in humans is  , which  approximates 14 days (q2w),  the 
selected dosing schedule. 
The human effective  dose of BMS -986207 administered  in combination with nivolumab in cancer 
patients,  was projected  to target steady -state average plasma  concentration  (Cave)  and minimum 
plasma concentration (Cmin) of  , respectively, equivalent to 10A7- mIgG1 
D265A Cave_14d and Cmin_14d at  the efficacious dose in CT26 mouse  tumor model. Based on 
the projected  human PK of BMS -986207, the human effective  is projected  to be 4 mg/kg IV 
administered once every 2 weeks (q2w). A flat dose of BMS -986207 (mg) will be used in this 
study, given similar exposure variability  of flat-dose as compared  to body weight- based  dosing for 
many therapeutic antibodies and practical advantages.  41 
The current protocol evaluates the q2w dosing regimen. A dosing regimen of q4w is being 
considered for the single -agent of  BMS -986207, as well as with in combination with nivolumab. 
The q4w option will benefit the patients with less frequent visits and reduce the medical burden 
from the care givers and the cancer treatment institutions.  The projected human PK profile of 
BMS -986207 is linear, and the dose for q4w dosing schedule will be based on q2w with linear 
extrapolation. The exposure, efficacy and safety, of BMS -986207 as a single agent and in 
combination with nivolumab, will be evaluated and compared with the q2w dosing schedule. Based on the totality of clinical data, the sponsor will consider to revise the dosing regimen, if appropriate.  
BMS -986207 PK was evaluated  in participants  with advanced solid  tumors  receiving  q2w (20, 80, 
240, 800, or 1600 mg) and q4w (480 or 1600 mg) doses in Part 1A, 1B and 2A of CA020002. 
Preliminary  PK results  of BMS  986207 suggest the increase in exposure is proportional across the 
dose range evaluated, which is in agreement with preclinical predictions. The CLT appears 
consistent across doses. For participants who received combination treatment with nivolumab in Part 1B, the PK of BMS -986207 appears to be consistent with that reported for monotherapy in 
Part 1A and 2A.
19 
In the Triplet Cohort (Part 1C), the initial proposed BMS -986207 dose was 1200 mg q3w based 
on lower  Cmax, similar  Cavg  and  as compared  to 1600 mg q4w,  a safe and tolerable  dose 
evaluated in combination with nivolumab in Part  1B and the projected saturation of intratumoral 
TIGIT  receptor  occupancy  at  level  to provide  optimal clinical benefit. Preliminary  data as 
per 20- Oct-2021, revealed that 2 out of 4 DLT -evaluable participants  experienced  DLTs  with the 
combination of  BMS -986207 1200 mg Q3W, nivolumab 360 mg Q3W, and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg 
Q6W  (see Section  3.2.1.4 for more  details).  BMS -986207 dose of 1200 mg Q3W was  reduced to 
600 mg per BOIN design. BMS -986207 dose of 600 mg Q3W is expected to provide half of the 
exposure as compared to 1200 mg Q3W, and a relatively high intratumoral TIGIT receptor 
occupancy at the   level. In addition, BMS -986207 dose of 360 mg Q3W may be explored 
to aid in RP2D dose selection and per BOIN design if de- escalation is needed.  
The selection  of an every -3-weeks regimen  allows  for aligning the schedule of BMS -986207 with 
combination of nivolumab q3w and ipilimumab  q6w in 1L NSCLC (See Section  5.5.2.2 and

 Section 5.5.2.3), since the primary efficacy evaluation in Part 2C will be in participants with 1L 
NSCLC.  
5.5.2.2 Nivolumab  
Nivolumab monotherapy has been extensively studied in multiple tumor types, including 
melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, cHL, SCCHN, and urothelial carcinoma, and has been safely administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg q2w. Nivolumab is currently approved for the treatment of various tumor types with monotherapy regimen of 480 mg q4w, 240 mg q2w, or 3 mg/kg q2w. When used in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy, nivolumab 360 mg q3w is approved for the treatment of 1L NSCLC.  
Based  on the clinical  experience and quantitative clinical  pharmacology understanding, nivolumab 
480 mg q4w, 360 mg q3w, or 240 mg q2w infused over approximately 30 minutes were selected 
in this study as these doses are expected to provide similar nivolumab exposures (Cavg and Ctrough), and to allow  the flexibility  of aligning doses of nivolumab at the same dosing frequency 
of BMS -986207 for the combination treatment. 
Specifically,  in the Triplet  Cohort (Part 1C) and Triplet NSCLC Expansion (Part  2C), participants 
will receive 360 mg q3w nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6w and BMS - 
986207 600 mg q3w. 
5.5.2.3 Ipilimumab  
Ipilimumab is approved as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma and adjuvant 
melanoma  with 3 mg/kg  q3w for 4 doses and 10 mg/kg q3w for 4 doses followed  by maintenance 
dose, respectively.  Ipilimumab is  also approved in combination with nivolumab for  the treatment 
of various cancers,  including melanoma,  RCC,  CRC, and  HCC with a dosing regimen  of 1 mg/kg 
q3w or 3 mg/kg q3w for 4 doses, depending on tumor type.
22 
In addition, a less frequent  but continuous ipilimumab  regimen  (1 mg/kg q6w) is  being  evaluated 
in combination with nivolumab or nivolumab plus chemotherapy in a number of  pivotal studies, 
including 1L NSCLC studies CA209227 and CA2099LA, 1L SCCHN study CA209651, and 1L 
mesothelioma study CA209743. For instance, study CA2099LA, evaluating nivolumab 360 mg 
q3w plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6w given concomitantly with 2 cycles of chemotherapy, demonstrated superior survival benefit to patients with 1L NSCLC as compared to SOC chemotherapy. The safety profile of  this triple combination regimen was reflective of the known 
safety profiles of the immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6w is currently approved for the treatment of 1L NSCLC, in combination  with nivolumab or with nivolumab and  
2 cycles of chemotherapy, and is also approved for the treatment of 1L mesothelioma, in 
combination with nivolumab.
34 
Based  on the clinical experience, low -dose ipilimumab 1 mg/kg q6w infused over approximately 
30 minutes will be examined in combination with nivolumab and BMS -986207 in the Triplet 
Cohort (Part 1C) and Triplet NSCLC Expansion (Part 2C) of this study.

 5.5.2.4 Rationale for Infusion Times  
Long infusion times (greater than or equal to 60 minutes), especially when multiple agents are 
administered sequentially to an individual, place a burden on participants and treatment centers. Establishing that investigational agents, such as BMS -986207, can be safely administered using 
an infusion time of 60 minutes  will diminish  the burden, provided there  is no change in the safety 
profile.  
In addition, a 60- minute post infusion safety observation period is considered appropriate given 
BMS -986207 is a fully human monoclonal  antibody  that is an antagonist (not an agonist) and has 
a low  likelihood  of resulting in infusion reactions. For participants <  42 kg on the 1600 mg dose, 
the infusion time will be 90 minutes. Details  of drug preparation are found in Pharmacy Manual, 
a document that will be provided separately to the site. 
In Parts 1B and 2B, when both study drugs are given in combination, nivolumab will be given 
first, over a 30 minute  infusion  period, followed  by BMS -986207 over a 60-minute  infusion period, 
beginning at least 30 minutes after completion of the infusion of nivolumab. 
Nivolumab has been administered safely over 60 minutes at doses ranging up to 10 mg/kg over 
long treatment  duration. In Study  CA209010 (a Phase 2, randomized, double- blinded, 
dose- ranging  study of nivolumab in  participants  with advanced/metastatic clear  cell RCC),  a dose 
association  was observed  for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7%  at 
0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg, and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All  the events were Grade 1 to 2 and were 
manageable.  An infusion duration of 30 minutes  for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30%  of the dose provided 
at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60 minute duration. 
Similarly, ipilimumab,  which  will be given in Part 1C and Part 2C, was safely administered  over 
90 minutes  at 10 mg/kg. In the CA184022 study, where ipilimumab  was administered  up to a dose 
of 10 mg/kg, on-study drug related hypersensitivity events (Grade 1 -2) were reported in 1 (1.4%) 
participant in  the 0.3 mg/kg  group and in 2 (2.8%)  participants  in the 10 mg/kg group.  There  were 
no drug- related hypersensitivity events reported in the 3 mg/kg group. Across the 3 treatment 
groups, no Grade  3-4 drug- related  hypersensitivity events were  reported and there  were  no reports 
of infusion reactions. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy has also been safely administered as a 90 minute infusion  in large  phase 3 studies in prostate  cancer  (CA184043) and as adjuvant therapy 
for stage 3 melanoma (CA184029), with infusion reactions occurring in participants. Administering 1 mg/kg of ipilimumab represents one -tenth of the 10 mg/kg dose and will be 
administered over one- third the time, for a lower infusion rate.  
Of note, CA209153, a Phase 3b/4 safety study of nivolumab in participants with metastatic N
SCLC who have progressed during or after at least 1 prior systemic regimen, used a 30 minute 
infusion in a cohort of participants with no safety issues. 
Overall,  infusion  reactions,  including high- grade  hypersensitivity reactions,  have been  uncommon 
with nivolumab or ipilimumab administration or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
Overall, a change in safety profile is not anticipated with a 30 -minute infusion of nivolumab or 
ipilimumab, infusion times that are consistent with the current USPIs for each drug.

meet all eligibility criteria.  
6.3 Lifestyle Restrictions  
There are no lifestyle restrictions  applicable for this study  given that the participants will receive 
the study investigational products (IPs) IV.  
6.4 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomized/entered  in the study. A minimal set of  screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements ( Appendix 10), and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes date of consent, demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAEs. 
6.4.1 Retesting During Screening or Lead- In Period  
This study allows for the re -enrollment of a participant that has discontinued the study as a 
pretreatment failure. Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments during the extended screening period will be allowed. 
The most current  result  prior to enrollment  is the value by which  study inclusion  will be assessed, 
as it represents the participant’s most current, clinical state.  
Testing for asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 infection by RT -PCR or viral antigen is not required. 
However, some participants may develop suspected or confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 
infection, or be discovered to have asymptomatic SARS -CoV- 2 infection during the screening 
period. In such cases, participants may be considered eligible for the study after meeting all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria related to active infection, and after meeting the following criteria:  
• At least 10 days (20 days for severe/critical  illness)  have passed  since  symptoms first appeared 
or positive RT -PCR or viral antigen test result, and  
• At least 24 hours have passed since last fever without the use of fever-reducing medications, 
and 
• Acute  symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath) have resolved  and 
• In the opinion of the investigator,  there  are no SARS -CoV-2 infection sequelae that may place 
the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment

beyond the protocol -specified timeframe with Medical Monitor approval. Any screening tests 
already performed which could potentially be affected by the SARS -CoV- 2 infection or its 
complications on an individual basis and agreed upon with the Medical Monitor (eg, safety labs, 
oxygen saturation, chest CT scan) should be repeated. 
7. TREATMENT  
7.1 Treatments Administered  
Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo or 
medical device intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study randomization or treatment allocation. 
An IP, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is defined as a 
pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. 
Other  medications used as support or escape medication  for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
noninvestigational products. 
All drugs used in this open- label study qualify as IPs, as per previous text, and their description 
and storage information are described in Table 7.1-1.

nivolumab and ipilimumab when these drugs are administered on the same day. Details of study 
drug preparation are found in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 
7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment  
In this open- label  study, enrolled participants,  including those not dosed, will be assigned  via IRT 
sequential participant  numbers starting  with  (eg, ). Those 
enrolled participants meeting the inclusion criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria, will be 
eligible to be dosed. Sequential numbering may  restart at   for each participating site as  the 
distinct participant identification number will ultimately comprise of the site number and participant  number, (eg,  ). In the expansion phase only, participants with CRC  will be 
randomized in a 1:1 manner to either BMS -986207 monotherapy, or combination therapy with 
BMS -986207 and nivolumab, to eliminate the possibility of enrollment bias. 
Participants  in Pa
 rt 2C with 1L NSCLC and tumor cell PD-L1 expression of > 1% based  on 
pre-existing lab results will be enrolled to receive combination therapy with BMS -986207, 
nivolumab, and ipilimumab. If more than 25% of the participants have a PD -L1 score < 1% as 
determined by the central lab, additional  participants may be enrolled in order to have at least 30 
participants with a tumor cell score of ≥ 1%.  
Participants  w ill not be replaced  if they are discontinued from  the study secondary  to an AE unless 
the AE can be determined to be unrelated to treatment. If a participant is replaced after dosing, 
then the replacement participant  will be assigned the original  participant’s number plus   The 
replacement  participant  will receive the same  treatment as the participant being replaced  but a new 
participant number will be assigned to him or her. For example, Participant 
by Participant would be replaced  
Study treatment will be dispensed  at the study visits  as listed  in Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). 
7.3 Blinding  
This is a non-randomized, open- label  study and blinding procedures are not applicable.  
7.4 Dosage Modification  
For Parts 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B intra -participant dose escalation/reduction of BMS -986207, 
nivolumab, or ipilimumab is not permitted in this study in order to allow better  evaluation of  the 
safety  and efficacy  at individual dose levels and schedules except as described  for the Preliminary

1C and 2C, see Section 5.1.2.6 and Section 5.1.2.7, respectively. 
7.4.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities  
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation,  DLTs  will be defined based  on the incidence,  intensity, 
and duration of AEs  for which  no clear alternative cause  is identified. The DLT period will be 
28 days (4 weeks) in Parts 1A and 1B. The DLT period for Part 1C will be 42 days (6 weeks). 
For the purpose of participant management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, regardless of the 
cycle in which it occurs, will lead to discontinuation of study drug unless the Investigator determines that only 1 of  the agents must be discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent 
alone. Participants who withdraw from the study during the 4- week DLT evaluation period (6- 
week DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) for reasons other than a DLT may be replaced with a new participant at the same dose level. The incidence of DLTs during the 4 -week DLT 
evaluation period (6- week DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) will be used in dose 
escalation  decisions and to  define the MTD.  AEs  occurring after the 4- week  DLT  period  (6-week 
DLT evaluation period for Parts 1C and 2C) will be considered for the purposes of defining the RP2D upon agreement between the Sponsor, Medical Monitor, and Investigators. 
Participants experiencing a DLT will not be retreated with study drug, and will enter the safety 
follow -up period of the study. DLTs  occurring after the 4- week  (or 6- week  period for Parts  1C and 
2C) DLT observation period will be accounted for in determining the RP2D for expansion. 
AEs will be graded according  to the NCI CTCAE  v4.03.  
7.4.1.1 Hepatic Dose- Limiting  Toxicity  
Any one of the following study drug- related  events will be considered a hepatic DLT (except for 
HCC participants):  
• Grade 4 elevations in serum  transaminases (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or  total 
bilirubin  
• Grade 3 elevations in serum transaminases (AST, ALT) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) that 
last longer  than 5 days, or is associated with  clinical  symptoms, or  bilirubin >  2 x ULN in the 
absence of cholestasis  
• Grade 2 elevations in AST or ALT with symptomatic liver inflammation (eg, right upper 
quadrant tenderness, jaundice, pruritus)  
• AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and concurrent total bilirubin > 2 x ULN without initial findings of 
cholestasis (elevated  ALP,  eg, findings consistent  with Hy’s  law or FDA definition  of potential 
drug- induced liver injury [pDILI]). Note that this specific category of DLT uses ULN rather 
than CTCAE grade for definition.  
 
Hepatic  DLT for HCC participants  
− AST or ALT > 10 × ULN for > 2 weeks  
− AST  or ALT  > 15 × ULN,  irrespective  of duration

− Concurrent ALT  ≥ 10 × ULN AND total bilirubin  ≥ 2 × ULN  or baseline value (if elevated 
bilirubin at study entry), AND no other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia. (For definition of p- DILI, see Section 9.2.7).  
 
7.4.1.2 Hematologic Dose- Limiting  Toxicity  
• Grade  4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days in duration  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
• Grade  3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding, or any requirement  for platelet transfusion  
• Febrile  neutropenia  
• Grade  3 hemolysis (ie, requiring transfusion  or medical  intervention such as steroids)  
• Grade  4 anemia  not explained  by underlying disease 
 
7.4.1.3 Dermatologic Dose- Limiting  Toxicity  
• Grade 4 rash  
• Grade  3 rash if no improvement (ie, resolution to ≤ Grade  1) after a 1 to 2 week  infusion  delay.  
 
7.4.1.4 Other  Dose- Limiting  Toxicities  
Any of the following  events will  be considered  a DLT:  
• Grade 2 drug- related uveitis, episcleritis, iritis eye pain or blurred vision that does not 
respond to topical therapy  and does not improve  to Grade  1 severity  within  the re-treatment 
period OR requires systemic treatment  
•  Grade 3 drug- related uveitis, episcleritis, iritis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm or neurologic 
toxicity  
• Grade  ≥ 4 hypersensitivity reaction  or Grade  3 that does not resolve to  Grade  1 in < 6 hours  
• Other  ≥ Grade  3 study drug- related  toxicity  will be considered  a DLT.  However,  the following 
Grade 3 or 4 events will not be considered DLTs:  
o Gr ade  3 or Grade  4 electrolyte  abnormalities  that are not complicated  by associated 
clinical adverse experiences, last less than 48 hours and either resolve 
spontaneously or respond to conventional medical intervention 
o Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts less than 48 hours, and either 
resolves spontaneously or responds to conventional medical intervention 
o Grade 3 or grade 4 elevation of amylase or lipase not associated with clinical or 
radiographic evidence of pancreatitis 
o Grade 3 fever not associated with hemodynamic compromise (eg,  hypotension, 
clinical or laboratory evidence of impaired end -organ perfusion)

7.4.2 Management  Algorithms for Immuno- Oncology Agents 
Immuno -oncology agents are associated with immune- related AEs that can differ in severity  and 
duration from AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. BMS -986207 and nivolumab are 
considered  I-O agents in this protocol.  Early  recognition  and management  of immune -related  AEs 
associated with I -O agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been 
developed from extensive experience with nivolumab to assist Investigators in assessing and 
managing the following groups of immune- related AEs:  
• Gastrointestinal 
• Renal  
• Pulmonary  
• Hepatic  
• Endocrinopathies  
• Skin 
• Neurological  
• Myocarditis  
 
The clinical nature of AEs events noted with BMS -986207 will determine the role of the 
algorithms for use in toxicities related to its use in this study. The algorithms recommended for the management of immune -related AEs in this protocol are in Appendix 6. 
7.4.3 Dose Delays Due To Toxicity  
Participants  who experience the following  must have  all study drug(s) withheld:  
• Potential DLTs,  until DLT  relatedness is defined.  
• Select  AEs and laboratory abnormalities: 
− ≥ Grade  1 pneumonitis  
− ≥ Grade  2 abnormality  in AST,  ALT  or total bilirubin  
− ≥ Grade  2 creatinine  
− ≥ Grade  2 diarrhea  or colitis  
− ≥ Grade  2 neurological AE 
− AE, laboratory  abnormality, or concurrent illness  that, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
warrants delaying study drug administration. 
• Confirmed  SARS -CoV-2 infection.

 Criteria for participants who  are required  to permanently discontinue both study drugs is listed in 
Section 8.2. Participants not meeting guidelines for permanent discontinuation will be permitted 
to resume therapy  based  on the criteria  specified  below in Section 7.4.3.3 . Participants eligible  to 
resume study  therapy will resume study  therapy at the nominal treatment visit following  their last 
received study medication dose. 
The end of cycle tumor assessments, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI),  or positron emission  tomography (PET),  will continue on a q8w schedule relative 
to the participant’s first dose, regardless of any treatment delay incurred.  
7.4.3.1 Criteria  for Dose Delay Secondary to Changes in AST or ALT for 
Participants with HCC  
Participants with  HCC who  experience the following  must have  the study  drug delayed:  
1) If a participant has  a baseline  AST  or ALT  that is  within  normal  limits,  delay  dosing for  drug- 
related ≥  Grade 2 toxicity (2 grade shift) 
2) If a participant has baseline AST  or ALT within the Grade 1 toxicity  range, delay  dosing for 
drug- related ≥  Grade 3 toxicity (2 grade shift) 
3) If  a participant has baseline AST  or ALT  within  the Grade  2 toxicity  range,  delay  dosing for a 
2-fold drug -related increase in AST or ALT or for AST  or ALT values 8 × ULN (whichever 
is lower)  
4) H epatic DLT  as defined in Section  7.4.1.1  
 
 
It is recommended to monitor elevations in AST or ALT approximately every 3 days until levels 
peak  and begin to decline.  BMS -986207 dosing can be resumed  where  criteria  to resume treatment 
are met ( Section 7.4.3.3) 
7.4.3.2 Protocol -Specific Recommendation for Management  of Hepatic Events 
in HCC Participants  
The algorithms  recommended for the management  of immune -related  AEs in this  protocol are in 
Appendix 6. Protocol -specific recommendation for the management of hepatic events in HCC 
participants are as follows:  
• Dose  delay  criteria  for hepatic events are outlined in Section  7.4.3.1. If AST  or ALT  levels do 
not improve with a dose delay  of 3 to 5 days, or if the levels  worsen, steroid  therapy should be 
initiated at 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone or oral equivalent 
• For ALT  or AST  levels  > 8 x ULN,  steroid  therapy should be initiated  promptly  at 
1 to 2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV, intramuscularly, or oral equivalent 
• For all participants receiving steroid treatment for hepatic events, the BMS Medical Monitor 
should be consulted within 24 hours after initiation of steroids. Gastroenterology consult is 
recommended 
• If AST or ALT levels do not improve within 3 to 5 days after the start of steroid therapy, or 
the levels worsen  after the start of steroid therapy, discussion with the BMS  Medical  Monitor 
regarding the possibility of adding mycophenolate mofetil 1 g twice daily should occur

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • Tapering of steroids can start once AST or ALT levels have declined by 1 CTCAE grade. 
Steroids should be tapered slowly, over no less than 1 month 
 
As outlined in Section 7.4.3.3, study therapy may resume when AST or ALT have returned to 
Grade  1 or baseline unless  the AE meets  the criteria  for permanent discontinuation ( Section  7.4.4). 
The BMS Medical Monitor must be consulted prior to resuming nivolumab for all participants who required steroid intervention. 
7.4.3.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment  
Subsequent dosing with study therapy may resume once drug- related nonDLT AEs resolve to 
Grade 1 or baseline.  
Participants experiencing AEs not meeting criteria for permanent discontinuation as outlined in 
Section 7.4.4 may resume treatment with study medication under the following criteria:  
• Participants may resume treatment with study drug when the drug- related AE(s) resolve to 
Grade ≤  1 or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
− Participants  may resume treatment in the presence  of Grade  2 fatigue  
− Participants who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug- related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity  
− Participants  with Grade  2 uveitis, episcleritis,  iritis, eye  pain or blurred  vision not meeting 
DLT criteria (Section 8.2 ) must resolve to baseline prior to resuming study therapy  
• For participants with Grade 2 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin elevations, dosing may resume 
when  laboratory  values return  to baseline,  and management  with corticosteroids  (if needed), is 
complete  
• Participants  with combined Grade  2 AST/ALT  and total bilirubin values meeting  DLT  criteria 
(Section 7.4.1.1) should have treatment permanently discontinued 
• Participants with  confirmed  SARS -CoV-2 infection may resume  treatment after 1) at least 10 
days (20 days for severe/critical illness) have passed since symptoms first appeared,  positive 
RT-PCR test result, or positive viral antigen test result; 2) resolution of acute symptoms 
(including at least 24 hours has passed  since  last fever  without fever  reducing medications); 3) 
evaluation by the Investigator with confirmation that there are no sequelae that would place 
the participant at a higher risk of receiving investigational treatment; and 4) consultation by the Medical Monitor. For suspected cases, treatment may also resume if SARS -CoV- 2 
infection is ruled -out and other criteria to resume treatment are met.  
• Prior to re -initiating on -study treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting 8 weeks 
due to SARS- CoV-2 infection, the Medical Monitor/designee must be consulted. 
 
• C
riteria  for HCC Participants:  
− Participants with baseline Grade 1 AST, ALT,  or total bilirubin who require dose delays, 
for reasons other than a drug- related hepatic event, may resume treatment in the presence 
of Grade 2 AST, ALT, or total bilirubin increases.

 − Participants who require dose delays for drug- related increased AST, ALT, or bilirubin 
may resume treatment when hepatic parameters are at baseline or Grade 1, and after 
discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor 
− Participants with AST, ALT or bilirubin values meeting permanent discontinuation 
parameters (Section 7.4.4) should have treatment permanently discontinued 
• Drug -related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline before 
treatment is resumed. Participants with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a 
steroid taper over at least 1 month, may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with, and 
approved by, the BMS Medical Monitor 
• Participants with drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement, may resume treatment  
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the participant should restart treatment at the next 
nominally scheduled timepoint per protocol.  
Even  if the criteria  to resume  treatment  are met, the consideration to re-initiate  study therapy  under 
the following exception will be made on a case by case basis after considering the overall benefit/risk profile, and in consultation between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Any AE with clinical risk will be assessed on a case by case basis with the Investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor, to determine the risks  and benefits  of continuing on therapy following resolution versus 
discontinuing therapy permanently. 
7.4.4 Exceptions to Permanent  Discontinuation Criteria  
Any drug- related AE occurring at any time that meets DLT criteria as outlined in Section 7.4.1 
w
ill require  permanent  discontinuation unless the Investigator determines  that only 1 of the agents 
must be discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent alone, with the exception of the  
following : 
• Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain that returns to Grade 1 or baseline 
within 3 days with medical intervention  
• Grade 3 pruritus or rash that returns to Grade 1 or baseline within 7 days with medical 
intervention  
• Isolated  Grade  3 or 4 electrolyte  imbalances/abnormalities  that are not associated  with clinical 
sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 3 days  of 
their onset 
• Grade  4 neutropenia < 7 days in duration  
• Grade  4 lymphopenia or leukopenia  
• Grade 3 or 4 increase in amylase or lipase that is not associated with clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis  
• Grade  3 infusion reactions  that return to  Grade 1  in < 6 hours  
• Grade 3 fever not associated with hemodynamic compromise (eg, hypotension, clinical, or laboratory evidence of impaired end-organ perfusion)

• Grade  3 fatigue  
• Grade 3 or 4 drug -related endocrinopathy AEs, such as adrenal insufficiency, 
adrenocorticotropic hormone, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance,  which  resolve 
or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid 
hormones) or glucose -controlling agents, respectively, may not require discontinuation after 
discussion with and approval from the BMS Medical Monitor 
• Any event that leads to delay in dosing, lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose, requires 
discontinuation, with the exception of the following: 
− Dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug- related AEs are 
allowed. Prior  to re-initiating  treatment  in a participant  with a dosing delay  lasting  
> 6 weeks from the previous dose, the BMS Medical Monitor must be consulted. Tumor 
assessments  should continue as per protocol even  if dosing is delayed.  Periodic  study visits 
to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks, or more 
frequently if clinically indicated, during such dosing delays. 
− Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occur for non drug- related 
reasons may not require  discontinuation, if approved by the BMS Medical Monitor. Prior 
to re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks, the BMS 
Medical Monitor must be consulted.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued nivolumab dosing.  
 
All participants who discontinue IP should comply with protocol  specified follow -up procedures 
as outlined in Section  8.2. The only exception to this requirement is when  a participant withdraws 
consent for all study procedures including post treatment study follow -up or loses the ability to 
consent freely (eg, imprisonment, involuntarily incarceration for the treatment of either a 
psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study treatment is  discontinued prior to the participant’s  completion  of the study, the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the appropriate case report form (CRF) page.  
7.4.5 Management  of Drug -related Infusion Reactions  
Since  BMS -986207 and nivolumab contain only  human Ig  protein sequences,  they are unlikely to 
be immunogenic and induce infusion or hypersensitivity reactions. However, if such a reaction were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like reactions. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusion reactions should be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Monitor and reported as an SAE. Infusion reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 guidelines. 
Treatment  recommendations for infusion reactions  are provided below and may be modified  based 
on local treatment standards and guidelines, as appropriate.

 For Grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):  
• Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes before study drug administrations. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction requiring therapy or infusion interruption but 
responding
 promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  such as antihistamines,  nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids, or prophylactic 
medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours): 
• Stop the study drug infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the participant 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 
325 to 1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor participant until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid and/or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased  to 100%  of the original infusion  rate. Monitor participant closely.  If symptoms  recur, 
then no further BMS- 986207 or nivolumab will be administered at that visit.  
• For future infusions, the following prophylactic premedications are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg should be administered at least 30 minutes before study drug infusions. If necessary, 
corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade 3 or 4 symptoms (severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to 
symptomatic  medication  and/or brief  interruption  of infusion]; recurrence  of symptoms following 
initial improvement; hospitalization indicated for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]; Grade 4: Life -threatening; pressor or ventilatory support indicated):  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of study drug. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline and 
treat the participant as follows: recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Participant should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Study drug will be permanently  discontinued except  for a Grade  3 infusion  reaction  that returns to Grade  1 in less 
than 6 hours. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor participant until recovery of the symptoms. 
 
In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized  or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

7.5 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
The IP should be stored in a secure area according  to local regulations. It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to ensure that IP is only dispensed  to study participants.  The IP must be dispensed 
only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  
The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with 
the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment should not be dispensed and contact BMS immediately. 
Study treatment not supplied by BMS will be stored in accordance with the package insert.  
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS  or not) must be maintained  that 
includes all processes required to ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
documentation of drug storage, administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconstitution, and use of required processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets). 
Storage facilities for  controlled substances must be  securely  locked  and substantially  constructed, 
with restricted access to prevent theft or diversion, as applicable by local regulations.  
Refer  to the current  version  of the IB and/or Pharmacy  Manual  for complete storage, handling, and 
dispensing information.

measles, mumps, rubella) during treatment and until 100 days post- last dose 
• Administration of investigational SARS -CoV- 2 vaccines is not allowed during the study. 
Participants  may receive approved SARS -CoV-2 vaccines while  continuing on study treatment 
at the discretion  of the Investigator.  Non-live SARS -CoV-2 vaccination  is considered  a simple 
concomitant medication within the study. 
• Treatment of active SARS -CoV- 2 infections or high -risk exposures, including use of 
investigational therapies, is allowed and should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
The following medications are prohibited during the study (unless utilized to  treat a drug related 
AE): 
• Immunosuppressive agents  
• Immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids  (except  as stated  in Section  6.2) 
• Any concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy  (ie, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, 
extensive, nonpalliative radiation therapy, or standard or investigational agents). 
 
7.7 Treatment After the End of the Study  
At the conclusion of  the study, participants who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit may be 
eligible to receive BMS -supplied study treatment. Study treatment may be provided via an 
extension of the study (a rollover study requiring approval by responsible health authority and 
ethics committee or through another mechanism at the discretion of BMS).  
7.7.1 Permitted Therapy  
Participants  are permitted  the use of the following  treatments:  
• Topical, ocular,  intra-articular,  intra-nasal,  and inhalational corticosteroids  
• Adrenal replacement  steroid  doses ≥ 10 mg daily  prednisone equivalent  
• A brief (less  than 3 weeks)  course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast  dye allergy) 
or for treatment of nonautoimmune conditions (eg, delayed- type hypersensitivity reaction 
caused by a contact allergen)  
 
8. DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
8.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment  
BMS  reserves the right to terminate  access to BMS  supplied study treatment if any of the following 
occur: a)  the study is terminated due  to safety  concerns; b) the development  of the BMS -986207 
is terminated for other reasons, including, but not limited, to lack of  efficacy and/or not meeting 
the study objectives; c) the participant can obtain the study medications from a government sponsored or private health program. In all cases, BMS will follow local regulations.

 • Participants  MUST  discontinue the IP  (and nonIP at the discretion  of the Investigator) for  any 
of the following reasons:  
• Documented disease progression as defined by RECIST  v1.1 ( Appendix 5) unless participants 
meet criteria for treatment beyond progression (Section 5.1.4 ) 
• Clinical deterioration while receiving active study therapy that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator,  indicates that continued participation  in the study is not in the best interest of the 
participant  
• Protocol-defined reasons  for permanent  discontinuation ( Section  7.4.4) 
• Any drug- related  AE occurring  at any time that meets  DLT  criteria  as outlined in Section  7.4.1  
will require permanent discontinuation unless the Investigator determines that only 1 of the 
agents must be discontinued due to toxicity attributed to that agent alone. Exceptions to 
permanent discontinuation are listed in Section 7.4.4. 
• Participant  requests to stop study treatment and/or participation  in the study 
• Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,  indicates that continued participation  in the study is not in the best interest of the 
participant  
• Termination  of the study by BMS  
• Loss of ability to freely  provide consent  through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease) illness. (Note: Under specific circumstances, a participant who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant. Strict conditions apply and BMS approval is required.) 
• Inability  to comply with protocol  
• Discretion  of the Investigator  
• Pregnancy  
− Individual participants with confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study 
therapy on a case by case basis after specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator and BMS Medical Monitor in settings where benefit/risk justifies discontinuation of study therapy. 
 
Discontinuation of the study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the Investigator when a participant meets  one of  the conditions outlined in Section 9.2.7 (p-DILI) or 
if the Investigator believes that it is in best interest of the participant.  
Refer  to the Schedule of Activities  for data to be collected  at the time of treatment  discontinuation 
and required follow-up, and for any further evaluations that can be completed. 
In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator must immediately, within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy, notify the BMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study 
treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Refer to Section 9.2.5 Pregnancy.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 All participants  who discontinue study  treatment should comply  with protocol  specified  follow -up 
procedures as outlined in Section 2 . The only exception to this requirement is when a participant 
withdraws consent for all  study procedures, including post treatment  study follow -up or loses the 
ability  to consent  freely  (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated  for the treatment of either 
a psychiatric or physical illness).  
If study treatment is  discontinued prior  to the participant’s  completion  of the study, the reason  for 
the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
8.1.1 Discontinuation Due to Further Progression (Confirmed Progression)  
A radiographic assessment  should be performed  at each scheduled  tumor assessment,  4 to 6 weeks 
following initial disease progression, to determine whether there has been continued progressive disease  or not. Participants  should discontinue study therapy upon evidence of further progression, 
defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression  should be used as the reference  baseline 
for comparison with the postprogression assessment. 
Any new lesion considered nonmeasurable at the time of initial progression may become 
measurable and, therefore, must be included in the tumor burden measurement according to the 
following:  
• For solid  tumors : New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if 
the longest diameter  is at least  10 mm (except  for pathological lymph nodes, which  must have 
a short axis of at least 15 mm).  
 
For statistical analyses that include the Investigator- assessed progression date, participants who 
continue treatment beyond initial  Investigator -assessed,  RECIST  v1.1-defined progression will be 
considered to have Investigator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial progression 
event.  
8.1.2 Assessment  Schedule for Participants with Post -progression Treatment  
Participants should continue to receive monitoring according to the on- treatment assessments in 
Section 2. Radiographic assessment, by CT (preferred) or MRI described in Section 9.4.5, is required when participants continue post -progression treatment. For participants  that discontinue 
post progression treatment with study therapy, no additional radiographic assessments will be required.  
8.1.3 Post  study  Treatment  Study Follow -up 
In this study, safety is a primary endpoint. Post study follow -up is of critical importance and is 
essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who discontinue study treatment must continue to be followed- up for collection of outcome and/or 
survival follow -up data as required and in line with Section 5.1.3.3.

 8.2 Discontinuation from the Study  
Participants  who request  to discontinue study treatment will remain  in the study and must  continue 
to be followed for protocol specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a 
participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons 
previously authorized by participant to provide this information. 
• Participants should notify the Investigator of the decision to withdraw consent from future 
follow -up in writing, whenever possible. 
• The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the Investigator,  as to whether the withdrawal is from  further treatment with study treatment  only 
or also from study procedures and/or post treatment study follow -up, and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
• In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, 
publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately 
directed in accordance with local law.  
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
 
8.3 Lost  to Follow -up 
• All reasonable efforts  must  be made to locate participants  to determine  and report their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the participant. 
• Lost to follow -up is defined by the inability  to reach  the participant  after a minimum  of 
3 documented phone calls,  faxes,  or emails as well as lack of response by participant to 
1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical 
records.  
• If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods  to 
obtain date and cause of death. 
• If Investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the 
study has been  included in  the participant’s  informed  consent,  then the Investigator may  use a 
Sponsor retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up 
portion of the study. 
• The site staff  and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health 
registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. 
• If after all attempts,  the participant  remains  lost to follow-up, then the last known alive  date as 
determined  by the Investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s  medical 
records.

 9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities. Protocol waivers 
or exemptions are not allowed. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct. 
• Study governance considerations in terms  of compliance and reporting of AEs are available  in 
Appendices 2 and 3. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s  routine  clinical management  (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities.  
• All immediate  safety  concerns must be discussed with BMS immediately  upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment  
 
9.1 Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy assessments for the  activity of BMS -986207, alone, in combination with 
nivolumab, or in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab will be based on tumor 
measurements,  using RECIST  v1.1, with CT and/or MRI,  as appropriate. In Parts  1A, 1B, 2A, and 
2B, assessments will be performed at baseline, q8w (± 1 week) during the treatment period, and 
q12w for the first year after discontinuation of study drug/EOT visit. Subsequently, they will continue to receive tumor  assessment  scans as per standard of care guidelines, or at a minimum of 
every 6 months up to 2 years following the last dose of study drug, or until disease progression/withdrawal of study consent. In Parts 1C and 2C, contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, 
CT/MRI  of the abdomen, pelvis, and all other  known and/or suspected  sites of disease should occur 
every 6 weeks starting from date of first dose (±  7 days) for the first 12 months (week 48), then 
every  12 weeks (± 7 days)  until the end of year 2, then every  12 weeks  (± 14 days) thereafter  until 
disease progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs later. The same imaging modality must be used for all assessments, per RECIST v1.1 ( Appendix 5). Tumor assessment 
should be performed prior to initiating next cycle of treatment. Unconfirmed PR/CR must be confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial assessment finding.  
Only  data for the procedures and assessments specified  in this protocol should be submitted  to the 
Sponsor or Designee on a CRF.  Additional procedures and  assessments may be performed  as part 
of standard of care.  However,  data for these assessments should remain  in the participant’s  medical 
record  and should not be provided to the Sponsor  or Designee,  unless specifically  requested  from 
BMS or designee.

Protocol  Amendment  No: 04 
Date:06 -Jan-2022  110 
Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet  the definition of an AE or SAE and remain  responsible for following  up AEs that 
are serious, considered  related  to the study treatment  or the study, or that caused  the participant  to 
discontinue before completing the study. 
Contacts for SAE  reporting are specified  in Appendix 3 . 
9.2.1 Time Period and Frequency for  Collecting AE and SAE Information  
The collection  of nonserious AE information  should begin at initiation  of study treatment until the 
follow -up contact,  at the time points specified  in the Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of an observational period intended to 
establish a baseline status for the participants.  
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the BMS -986207 IB represent the Reference Safety Information to 
determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting.
19 Following the participant’s written 
consent to  participate  in the study, all  SAEs,  whether related  or not related  to study drug, must be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. 
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing. The Investigator must report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified procedure.  Please 
note the following adverse event reporting requirements:  
• Medical  occurrences that begin before  the start of study treatment  but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF section. 
• All SAEs  will be recorded  and reported to the Sponsor or Designee within  24 hours.  
• The Investigator will submit any updated SAE  data to the Sponsor within  24 hours of this being 
available.  
 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been  discharged  from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably  related  to the study 
treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 
The method of evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 
9.2.2 M
 ethod of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of  a participant.  In order to prevent reporting  bias, participants  should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of AEs.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious (Section 9.2). 
• Follow- up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate. 
• All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. 
• All SAEs  and AEs (including  non-serious AEs)  associated  with confirmed  or suspected  SARS - 
CoV- 2 infection will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, the event is deemed irreversible, the participant is lost to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 9.2.3 ) or for suspected cases, until SARS -CoV-2 infection is ruled- out. 
 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow -up each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and nonserious AEs of special interest (as 
defined in Section  9.2) will be followed -up until resolution,  until the condition stabilizes,  until the 
event is otherwise  explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  8.3).  
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.  
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the IB and will notify the Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.  
 
The Sponsor or Designee will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320. A SUSAR (Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction)  is a subset  of SAEs  that will be reported to the appropriate regulatory  authorities 
and Investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 
9.2.5 Pregnancy 
If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is pregnant or may have been  pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 months after product administration,  the Investigator must immediately  notify  the BMS  Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. The Investigator must also complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to the BMS Designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Appendix 3. 
Follow- up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where  applicable,  offspring  information,  must be reported  on the Pregnancy

 Surveillance Form.  Protocol- required  procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be 
performed on the participant. 
9.2.6 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured  on the nonserious AE  CRF 
page or SAE electronic Report Form, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back -up 
option when the electronic system is not functioning. 
• Any laboratory test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets the definition  of an SAE 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy  
 
It is expected that, wherever possible, the clinical rather than the laboratory term would be used 
by the reporting Investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
9.2.7 Potential  Drug -induced Liver  Injury (p-DILI) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver- related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a p- DILI event. All occurrences of p -DILIs meeting the defined 
criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9.2 for reporting details).  
Potential drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
• ALT  or AST  elevation  > 3 x ULN  
AND  
• Total bilirubin > 2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase), 
AND  
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransaminases elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited  to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or acute 
liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. 
 
Specifically  for HCC: p- DILI  is defined as: 
• Concurrent ALT ≥ 10 × ULN AND total bilirubin ≥  2 × ULN or baseline value (if elevated 
bilirubin at study entry), AND 
• No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limited  to, tumor progression, acute viral hepatitis,  cholestasis,  pre-existing 
hepatic disease or the administration of other drug(s), herbal medications and substances 
known to be hepatotoxic.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 This is the standard drug-induced liver injury  definition across  the BMS  HCC program.  
The key responsibilities for investigators during p- DILI assessment include: (i) Early detection, 
medical evaluation (including the exclusion of other potential causes) and rapid laboratory 
confirmation of liver- related abnormalities, and (ii) BMS notification of p -DILI cases via SAE 
forms. Following the gathering and assessment of relevant clinical information, BMS is responsible for: (iii) Timely evaluation and triaging of p -DILI cases, (iv) Expedited reporting of 
p-DILI cases and (v) Expanded review of p- DILI cases including a detailed assessment of all 
available clinical information, investigations and biochemical data.  
Investigators are  expected  to monitor ongoing routine  and ad  hoc hepatic laboratory  test results  to 
rapidly determine whether a participant meets p -DILI criteria. They are expected to promptly 
notify BMS of all p -DILI cases. p -DILI cases may be identified by abnormal liver biochemistry 
values,  whether or not they are accompanied  by liver- related  signs and/or symptoms. In both cases, 
expedited confirmation  with  repeat  laboratory  testing  should occur within  3 business days using a 
Hepatic Laboratory Panel (ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP). Any participant with an abnormal Hepatic Laboratory  Panel  that meets  p-DILI  criteria  is a candidate for study  drug discontinuation. 
Any confirmed p -DILI  events must be reported (along with  a description of the clinical findings) 
to BMS as an SAE within 24 hours of confirmation. 
An extensive clinical history, examination and appropriate investigations should be obtained to exclude cholestatic and other apparent  causes that may explain the observed abnormalities  in liver 
function and/or hepatic signs and symptoms.  Other  apparent causes include, nonexhaustively and 
by way of example only: infectious diseases (such as active hepatitis A, B and C), congenital diseases (such as Gilbert’s syndrome), neoplastic diseases (such as HCC), autoimmune diseases (such as primary biliary cirrhosis) and the use of concomitant hepatotoxic medications (such as antibiotics,  the oral contraceptive pill and herbal medicines).  All investigations to exclude potential 
causes of liver function abnormalities or hepatic signs and/or symptoms should be guided by relevant factors such as the participant’s age, gender, clinical history, and signs and symptoms.  
9.2.8 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, including electrocardiogram (ECG), X -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not 
required by protocol, should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 
9.3 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as the accidental  or intentional administration  of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. For this study, any dose of BMS -986207 greater  than the assigned  dose, and considered excessive 
and medically important by the Investigator, will be considered an overdose. 
All intentional overdose taken  with possible suicidal/self -harming  intent must  be reported  as SAEs 
(see Section 9.2).

Date:06 -Jan-2022  114 
Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 In the event  of an overdose  the Investigator  or treating  physician should:  
• Contact the Medical  Monitor immediately  
• Closely  monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs  and laboratory  abnormalities  until BMS -986207 
can no longer be detected systemically  
• Obtain  a plasma  sample for PK if requested  by the Medical  Monitor (determined  on a case by 
case basis)  
• Document the quantity of the excess  dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF 
 
Decisions  regarding dose interruptions or modifications  secondary  to an overdose will be made by 
the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of  the 
participant.  
9.4 Safety  
Planned time points for all safety  assessments are listed  in the Schedule of Activities  (Section  2). 
9.4.1 Physical Examinations  
Refer  to Schedule of Activities  for timing  of assessments in Table  2-1, Table  2-2, Table  2-3, Table  
2-4, Table 2 -5, and Table 2 -6. 
9.4.2 Vital Signs

The effect of BMS -986207 on the   will be evaluated by a central reader using ECG 
data collected in triplicates and conducted during the monotherapy and combination dose 
escalation  only (Part 1A and Part 1B) (eg, 1 ECG test equals 3 consecutive individual 12- lead 
ECGs performed 5 minutes apart). For the purposes of monitoring participant safety, the 
Investigators will review the 12 -lead ECGs using their site’s standard ECG machines throughout 
the study. The will be applied to each ECG reading. 
9.4.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.  
A local laboratory will perform the analyses and will provide reference ranges for these tests. Results of clinical laboratory  tests performed on Day -1 must be available prior to dosing. 
The laboratory  tests that will be performed  for study  participants  are shown in Table  9.4.4-1 . 
Results of all laboratory  tests required by  this protocol  must be provided to  the Sponsor, recorded 
either on the laboratory pages of the CRF or by another mechanism as agreed upon between the 
Investigator and BMS (eg, provided electronically). If the units of a test result differ from those printed on the CRF, the recorded laboratory values must specify the correct units. Any abnormal

 9.4.5 Imaging Assessment for the Study  
Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance, that are not directly associated with the 
objectives of the protocol, should be evaluated and handled by the Study Investigator as per standard medical/clinical judgment.  
Central  assessments are not planned for this study, however copies of  all scans will be stored for 
possible future  central  analysis, if  determined  to be necessary by BMS. At  the Sponsor’s  discretion, 
scans may be collected centrally to be reviewed by independent radiologists. 
Computer  Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Contrast- enhanced CT scans acquired on dedicated CT equipment is preferred for this study. CT 
with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are to be performed for tumor assessments. CT scans should be acquired with 5 mm slices with no intervening gap (contiguous). 
Should a participant have  a contraindication  for CT IV contrast,  a noncontrast CT of the chest  and 
a contrast enhanced MRI of  the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained. MRIs should be acquired 
with slice thickness of < 5 mm with no gap (contiguous). 
Every  attempt  should be made to image  each participant using an identical  acquisition  protocol on 
the same scanner for all imaging timepoints.  
Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: 
Combined modality scanning such as with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET/CT is increasingly 
used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the 
recommendations outlined here may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation  correction  CT portions of a combined FDG- PET/CT are of limited  use in anatomically 
based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic  contrast enhanced CT scans for  anatomically based  RECIST  measurements. 
However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG -PET/CT is of identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral  contrast) then the CT portion of the FDG- 
PET/CT can be used for RECIST  1.1 measurements.  Note,  however, that the FDG- PET portion of 
the CT introduces additional data which may bias an Investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.  
MRI Brain  
A MRI  of the brain  is required  at screening  if a participant  is symptomatic  or has a history  of brain 
metastasis. Participants with a history of brain metastasis should have surveillance MRI approximately every 12 weeks, or sooner if clinically indicated. 
MRI brain scans during on- study treatment and follow -up periods are required only if there is a 
prior history  of lesions present  at screening,  or as clinically  indicated  for new signs and symptoms 
that suggest CNS involvement.

 Bone  Scan  
Bone scans can be used to evaluate the presence of metastatic disease, and should not be used as 
modality for assessment of measurable metastatic disease.  
9.5 Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
The PK of BMS -986207 will be derived from serum concentration versus time data when 
appropriate. The PK parameters that will be assessed, following the intensive PK collection, are 
shown in Table 9.5-1. 
Table  9.5-1: Pharmacokinetic  Parameters 
 
Parameters  Definition  
 
Cmax  Maximum  observed serum  concentration  
Tmax  Time  of maximum  observed serum  concentration  
AUC(0 -T) Area  under  the serum  concentration -time curve  from  time zero to time of last quantifiable 
concentration  
AUC(TAU)  Area  under  the concentration -time curve  in one dosing  interval  
Parameters  that may potentially  be assessed following  the dose administration  in Cycle  2 Day 1 
Ctau Observed  concentration  at the end of a dosing  interval  
CLT Total body clearance 
Css-avg Average  concentration  over a dosing interval  (AUC[TAU]/tau) 
AI_TAU  Ratio  of an exposure  measure at steady  state to that after the first dose (exposure  measure 
includes AUC[TAU])  
T-HALFeff  Effective  elimination  half-life that explains  the degree  of accumulation  observed  for a 
specific exposure measure (exposure measure includes AUC[TAU])  
Parameter  to be reported  separately  
 
 
Individual participant PK parameter values will be derived by noncompartmental methods by a validated PK analysis program. Actual times will be used for the analyses.  
Table 9.5 -2, Table 9.5-3, and Table 9.5-4 list the sampling schedule to be followed for the 
assessment  of PK and immunogenicity. Further  details of blood collection and processing  will be 
provided to the site in the Laboratory Manual. 
All predose samples should preferably be taken within 30 minutes before the start of any dose 
infusion. In Part 1C and 2C, as shown in Table  9.5-4 end-of-infusion (EOI) PK samples for BMS - 
986207, nivolumab, and ipilimumab  should be taken  immediately  following  the last drug infusion 
(preferably within 5 minutes after end of the infusion) on the contralateral arm (ie, the arm not used for the infusion). Since  the EOI PK sample is drawn  with the intent of accurately  estimating 
the maximum concentration  (Cmax)  of the drug, draw the EOI-PK after all the study drug has been

 infused. If the site infuses drug without a flush, then collect the EOI -PK sample within 
approximately 5 minutes  after end of infusion. If a flush  is administered  to clear  the IV lines  of the 
drug and to ensure delivery of the entire drug dose, then draw the EOI -PK sample within 
approximately 5 minutes  after the end  of the flush. If the end of  infusion is delayed to beyond the 
nominal infusion duration, the collection of  this sample should also be delayed accordingly. On- 
treatment PK samples are intended to be drawn relative to actual dosing days. For Part 1A, 1B, 
2A, and 2B, EOI PK samples for BMS -986207 or nivolumab should be taken following the 
instructions noted in Table 9.5-2 and Table 9.5-3. 
If a dose occurs on a different day  within the cycle due to delays or minor schedule adjustments, 
PK and ADA samples should be adjusted accordingly. If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the predose sample should be collected  just prior to  the delayed  dose. However,  if a 
predose sample is collected but the dose is subsequently delayed, an additional predose sample should be collected.  ‘Event Kit - Dose  Delay’  should be used in the event  that a predose PK sample 
was obtained and the participant is not dosed on that same day. Following consensus of the Investigator and the BMS Medical Monitor, an additional  PK and/or ADA sample may be taken 
following  a SAE  or important medical  event  using  an ‘Event  Kit - AE’. Further  details  of sample 
collection, processing, and shipment will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.

10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Sample Size Determination  
10.1.1 Dose Escalation  
During the dose escalation phase, an adaptive dose escalation scheme (BLRM for monotherapy 
and BLRM -copula for combination therapy) employing the escalation with overdose control 
(EWOC) principle will be used. The method is fully adaptive, makes use of all the information available at the time of each dose assignment, not just data from  the current  dose level,  and directly 
addresses the ethical need to control the probability of overdosing. The targeted toxicity rate in this study is in the range  of [16%, 33%).  The boundary is similar  to the toxicity  boundary used by 
a rule -based design (ie, 3 + 3 design) in that a minimum is set at 16% (~ 1 in 6) DLT rate and a 
maximum at 33% (~ 2 in 6) DLT  rate. The use of the EWOC principle  limits  the risk of exposing 
patients in  the next  cohort to an unsafe dose by ensuring the posterior probability of the DLT  rate 
exceeding 33% at any dose is capped at 30%.  
The maximum  number of participants treated  will be 35 for each dose escalation  part 
(BMS -986207 monotherapy [Part 1A], BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab [Part 1B]). 
However,  simulation  studies with various scenarios show  that the expected  number of 
DLT -evaluable participants is no more than approximately 20. ( Appendix 12).  
Approximately 3 participants  will be treated  at the starting  dose levels  of BMS -986207 or 
BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab. While the BLRM/BLRM -copula will use DLT 
information from the DLT period only, clinical assessment will take into consideration of the 
totality  of available data including PK/  from  all treated  participants  encompassing  monotherapy 
and combination therapy, in assigning a dose level for the next cohort of 3 participants. At least

 6 DLT -evaluable participants will be treated  at the MTD.  At most 12 DLT -evaluable participants 
will be treated  at each dose level.  Additional participants (up to a total of 15) may be treated at  or 
any dose level below the estimated MTD for further evaluation of safety, PK,  parameters as 
required.  
The model-recommended MTD  is the dose that satisfies  the following three  conditions:  
1) The empirical posterior probability that the “DLT  rate of 16% - <33%”  is greater  than a 
pre-specified value (i.e., 50%);  
2) Th is  probability  needs to be the largest  amongst the dose levels that satisfy  the EWOC 
condition (i.e., the probability that the “DLT rate > 33%” must be less than 30%);  
3) Minimum number of participants  (i.e., 6) were  treated  at this dose level.  
 
The final recommended MTD/RP2D will be based on the recommendation from the 
BLRM/BLRM -copula and overall clinical  assessment  of all available safety,  PK,  and efficacy 
data. Lower  doses of BMS -986207 may be tested  if none of the planned doses are found to be 
tolerable as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. Such decisions will be made after 
discussion and agreement between the Investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor. 
10.1.2 Safety Evaluation Phase (Part 1C)  
The safety of triplet therapy will be evaluated across the tumor types in up to approximately 18 
treated participants per dose level who receive triplet therapy based on the number of DLTs observed. Assuming a DLT target of 30% (24%, 36%) the BOIN design framework will be used to guide decisions in this setting, including potential de- escalation  to a lower  dose of BMS -986207 
in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab, if warranted by the observed results (see Table  5.1.2.6-1).  In addition, calculations  related  to the risk of a BMS -986207 dose level  selected 
as tolerable are shown expressed as a posterior probability of toxicity in Section 5.1.2.2 (Table  
5.1.2.6-2 ). 
10.1.3 Cohort Expansion  
The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS -986207 alone or in combination with nivolumab. 
However,  the sample size is strictly based on efficacy, specifically  on the target ORR relative to 
historic response rate.  
10.1.3.1 Cohort Expansion in Part 2A and Part 2B  
Part 2A will be an expansion phase  of the BMS -986207 monotherapy in  participants  with CRC at 
1 dose level.  Part 2B will be an expansion phase for BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab 
in participants  with CRC,  HCC,  and ovarian  cancer.  Each  disease cohort expansion will be handled 
independently and there will be no multiplicity adjustment.  
The Fleming 2 -stage design  framework will  be used as a guide  for the expansion cohorts  in 
Parts  2A and 2B.
42,43 The total sample  size for each expansion cohort will be calculated  to provide 
a reasonable false -positive rate (FPR)  <10%  and false-negative rate (FNR)  < 10% based  on

 assumptions of true (target) and historic  ORR for each indication. The assumed  historic  and target 
response rates may  change over time and may need to be adjusted by  the time when the response 
data from this study are available.  The sample size and operational characteristics of using a 
2-stage design, as an example, are provided in Table 10.1.3.1- 1, although this is not used for 
statistical hypothesis testing. Using a 2- stage design provides an option to stop early for futility, 
as well as a signal of preliminary   activity  for strong-go, early  on. Enrollment may 
continue into Stage  2, while  the planned number of participants for Stage  1 are followed for 
efficacy evaluable tumor assessments. There will be no stopping of a disease cohort for efficacy, 
although an early plan for the next stage of clinical development may be initiated. Sample sizes may need to be increased in order to explore differential responses between  expressed 
and nonexpressed groups. 
Guided by Table 10.1.3.1-1, approximately  11 CRC participants  will be treated  with BMS -986207 
monotherapy in Stage 1. Assuming the  true response rate is 20% in this population when treated 
with BMS -986207 monotherapy, if there  are 2 or more  responses in 11 participants,  it may trigger 
an expansion of the clinical development plan after careful evaluation of all available data 
including duration of response and safety profile. The probability to observe such a favorable response is approximately 68%  if in fact the treatment is efficacious.  If there  is no response  in 
11 treated  participants,  the cohort may be stopped for futility.  The probability of early  stopping for 
futility  is approximately 80% if in fact the treatment is inefficacious,  eg, 2%. If there  is 1 response, 
an additional 13 participants may be treated  to collect  more  data.  At the end of Stage  2, if there  is 
1 or no response, further clinical development may not be warranted. If there are 2 or more 
responses, it may show evidence of treatment efficacy.

 10.1.3.2 Cohort Expansion in Part 2C  
Part 2C will be an expansion phase of the BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and 
ipilimumab  in participants  with advanced  treatment -naive NSCLC whose  tumor cells express  
≥ 1% PD-L1. 
The sample size for Part 2C is based  on assessing  an initial  activity  signal as estimated 
by the ORR following treatment in the triplet combination arm and to provide additional 
information for the safety profile in the 1L NSCLC population. 
One or two doses are planned to be evaluated in Part 2C and a minimum of 20 participants are 
enrolled per dose level  of BMS -986207. So approximately 40 evaluable participants in total  with 
1L NSCLC with tumor cell PD -L1 expression of ≥ 1% will be treated with BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
In the event pre -existing PD -L1 results are not confirmed by the central lab test, additional 
participants (up to 20%) will be enrolled to achieve a sample size of 40 evaluable participants.  
The following Bayesian posterior probability (PP) criteria will be used to assess signal of anti - 
tumor activity with benchmark of 36% as unfavorable ORR and 56% as desirable ORR:44,45 
• An activity  signal is based  on ORR satisfying  the dual criteria: PP (ORR ≥ 0.56 ) 
≥ 40% and PP (ORR  ≥ 0.36) ≥ 80% 
• A lack of activity  signal  is based  on ORR meeting  the criterion: PP (ORR ≥  0.36) < 20% 
A beta prior distribution beta (1, 1) for ORR and Binomial Bin (n, ORR)  likelihood for number of 
responders were used.  
Based  on the above criteria, for each dose level  a total of 20 evaluable participants  in Part 2C will 
provide approximately 6.5% chance to show   activity  when a true ORR is  36%, and at 
least 63% chance of showing activity signal if the true ORR is 56% or more (see Table 10.1.3.2-  
1) 
The ORR thresholds for efficacy  signal  (responders ≥ 11/20) and lack of efficacy  (≤ 6/20) and the 
operating characteristics of the posterior probability criteria are shown in Table 10.1.3.2-1.

 2C to further evaluate the safety  of the triplet combination in the NSCLC population, in addition 
to that in Part 1C, as described below.  
A Bayesian framework  will be utilized for continuous monitoring of  toxicity in Part 2C based on 
AEs meeting  DLT  criteria.46 Observed  incidence  rates of treatment- related  toxicities  meeting  DLT 
criteria (defined in Section  7.4.1) will be evaluated relative to a boundary (number of DLTs) 
associated with higher chance of the true DLT rate exceeding 33%. 
Bayesian safety monitoring boundaries are established using a non- informative prior, Beta (0.5, 
0.5). The posterior distribution is Beta (0.5+ n, 0.5+( m-n)), where m is number  of treated Part  2C 
participants  and n is  the subset  of these  m participants  who experience treatment- related  toxicities 
meeting DLT criteria. All treated Part 2C participants are considered evaluable. The criterion for 
excess toxicity is based on a posterior probability (PP) of treated Part 2C participants with toxicities meeting DLT criteria > 33% | cumulative data exceeding 80%. If the criterion is met during continuous monitoring in Part 2C, there is greater  than 80% PP that the DLT rate exceeds 
33%; based on the observed data, the dose level may be re- evaluated and, based  on the totality  of 
data, a lower dose may be administered to the remaining participants. The cutoff number of participants with DLT needed to meet the criterion depends on the number of evaluable 
participants, with a final boundary of 14 participants with a DLT out of 37 or more.

 APPENDIX  2 STUDY GOVERANCE CONSIDERATIONS  
The term ‘Participant’ is  used in the protocol to refer  to a person who has consented  to participate 
in the clinical research  study. The term ‘Subject’  used in the eCRF  is intended to refer to a person 
(Participant) who has consented to participate in the clinical research study.  
REGULATORY AND ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
This study will be conducted in accordance with: 
• Consensus ethical  principles derived from international guidelines, including the Declaration 
of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) 
International Guidelines Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
• As defined by the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH)  
• In accordance with the ethical  principles  underlying European Union Directive  2001/20/EC  
• United  States  Code of Federal  Regulations, Title  21, Part 50 (21CFR50)  
• Applicable local  requirements.  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol  and any amendments 
and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opinion by Institutional 
Review  Board/Independent Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC),  and regulatory authorities according to 
applicable local regulations prior to initiation of the study.  
All potential serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or designee immediately. A serious breach  is a breach  of the conditions and principles of GCP  (occurring  in any country) in connection 
with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity  of 1 or more subjects of the study  or the scientific value of the study. 
Personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform their respective tasks.  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where  sanctions have  been  invoked or where 
there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  
INSTITUTIONAL  REVIEW  BOARD/INDEPENDENT  ETHICS COMMITTEE  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, participant recruitment materials (e.g., advertisements),  and any other written  information  to be  provided to  subjects.  The investigator or 
BMS  should also provide the IRB/IEC  with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling 
information to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
The investigator,  Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IEC  with reports,  updates and other 
information (e.g., expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regulatory requirements or institution procedures.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 COMPLIANCE WITH  THE PROTOCOL  AND PROTOCOL  REVISIONS  
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable opinion of an amendment from the IRB/IEC (and if applicable, also by local health authority) except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects.  
If a deviation  or change to  a protocol is implemented  to eliminate  an immediate  hazard(s)  prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opinion(s) the deviation or change will be submitted, as 
soon as possible to: 
• IRB/IEC  for 
• Regulatory Authority(ies),  if applicable  by local  regulations (per national requirements)  
 
Documentation of approval/favorable opinion signed by the chairperson or designee of the 
IRB(s)/IEC(s) and if applicable, also by local health authority must be sent to BMS.  
If an amendment substantially alters the study design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant: (1) the consent form must be revised and submitted to the IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opinion; (2) the revised  form  must be used to obtain consent from  subjects 
currently enrolled in the study if they are affected by the amendment; and (3) the new form must be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.  
If the revision is  done via an administrative  letter,  investigators  must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
FINANCIAL  DISCLOSURE  
Investigators and sub- Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information  on financial interests  during the course of 
the study and for 1 year after completion of the study. 
INFORMED CONSENT  PROCESS  
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly  and fully  informed  about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  
In situations  where  consent cannot be given to subjects,  their legally  acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly  and fully  informed  about the purpose, potential risks,  and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate.  
Sponsor or designee will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local)  sample 
informed consent form which will include all elements required by ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. The sample informed consent form  will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

which  the participant is most proficient  prior to clinical  study participation.  The language must 
be non-technical and easily understood. 
• Allow time necessary for participant or participant's legally acceptable representative to 
inquire about the details of the study.  
• Obtain  an informed  consent signed and personally dated  by the participant or the  participant's 
legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent 
discussion.  
• Obtain  the IRB/IEC’s  written  approval/favorable opinion of the written  informed  consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior to the beginning of  the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.  
 
If informed consent is initially given by a participant’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and  the participant subsequently becomes capable  of making  and communicating his  or 
her informed  consent during the study, consent must  additionally be obtained from the participant.  
Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the participant's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, 
should fully inform the participant or the participant's legally acceptable representative or legal guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the participant's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be documented.  
The confidentiality  of records that could  identify  subjects must  be protected, respecting  the privacy 
and confidentiality  rules  applicable to regulatory  requirements,  the subjects'  signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.  
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to participant records.  
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are the most important considerations  and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.  
SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the source data are accurate, legible, 
contemporaneous, original and attributable,  whether the data are hand- written  on paper  or entered 
electronically.  If source data are  created  (first entered),  modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, 
or transmitted electronically via computerized systems (and/or any other kind of electronic 
devices) as part of regulated clinical trial activities, such systems must be compliant with all applicable laws and regulations governing use of electronic records and/or electronic signatures. Such  systems may include, but are not limited  to, electronic medical/health  records (EMRs/EHRs), 
adverse event tracking/reporting, protocol required assessments, and/or drug accountability records).

 CASE REPORT  FORMS  
An investigator  is required  to prepare and maintain  adequate and accurate case histories  designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual treated 
or entered as a control in the investigation. Data that are derived from source documents and reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source documents or  the discrepancies must be 
explained. Additional clinical information may be collected and analyzed in an effort  to enhance 
understanding of product safety. CRFs may  be requested  for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported or identified during the course of the study. 
For sites using the Sponsor or designee electronic data capture tool, electronic CRFs will be prepared  for all data collection  fields  except  for fields  specific  to SAEs  and pregnancy, which  will 
be reported on the electronic SAE form and Pregnancy Surveillance form, respectively.  If 
electronic SAE form is not available, a paper SAE form can be used. Spaces may be left blank only in those circumstances permitted by study- specific CRF completion guidelines provided by 
Sponsor or designee. 
The confidentiality  of records that could  identify  subjects must  be protected, respecting  the privacy 
and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The investigator  will maintain  a signature  sheet  to document signatures  and initials  of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs. 
The completed  CRF,  SAE/pregnancy CRFs,  must be promptly  reviewed,  signed, and dated  by the 
investigator or qualified physician who is a subinvestigator and who is delegated this task on the Delegation of  Authority  Form.  Subinvestigators in Japan  may not be delegated  the CRF  approval 
task For electronic CRFs, review and approval/signature is completed electronically through the BMS electronic data capture tool. The investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of the changes and corrections.  
Each individual electronically signing electronic CRFs must meet Sponsor or designee training 
requirements and must only access the BMS electronic data capture tool using the unique user 
account provided  by Sponsor or designee. User  accounts are not to be shared  or reassigned  to other 
individuals  
MONITORING  
Sponsor or designee representatives will review data centrally to identify potential issues to determine a schedule of on -site visits for targeted review of study records.  
Representatives of BMS  must be allowed  to visit all  study site locations  periodically to assess the 
data quality  and study integrity.  On site they  will review  study  records and directly  compare them 
with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with the investigator, and verify that the 
facilities remain acceptable. Certain CRF pages and/or electronic files may serve as the source documents:  
In addition, the study may be  evaluated  by Sponsor or designee internal  auditors  and government 
inspectors who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.

 The investigator  must  notify  BMS  promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities, 
and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to Sponsor or designee. 
RECORDS RETENTION  
The investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) must retain all study records and source 
documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for  the period specified by BMS or designee, whichever is longer. The 
investigator (or head  of the study site  in Japan)  must contact  BMS  prior to  destroying any records 
associated with the study.  
BMS or designee will notify the investigator (or head of the study site in Japan) when the study 
records are no longer needed. 
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred  to a mutually  agreed  upon designee (e.g., another investigator, study site, IRB).  Notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to BMS or designee. 
RETURN OF STUDY TREATMENT  
For this study, study treatments  (those supplied by BMS,  a vendor  or sourced  by the investigator) 
such as partially used study treatment containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed on site.  
If.. Then  
Study treatments supplied by BMS 
(including its vendors 
 
    
 
Study treatments  sourced  by site, not 
supplied by BMS (or its vendors) 
(examples include study treatments 
sourced from the sites stock or 
commercial supply, or a specialty pharmacy)  Any unused study treatments supplied by BMS can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled 
by the responsible Study Monitor unless study treatments containers must be immediately destroyed as required  for safety,  or to meet  local  regulations (e.g., 
cytotoxics or biologics).  
If study treatments  will be returned, the return  will be 
arranged by the responsible Study Monitor. 
It is the investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to 
dispose of all containers according  to the institutional 
guidelines and procedures. 
 
It is the investigator’s  or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal, provided that procedures 
for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, and 
institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate  records of disposal are kept. 
The following minimal standards must be met:  
• On-site disposal  practices  must not expose humans to risks  from  the drug. 
• On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.

filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy provided to BMS upon request. 
• Records are maintained that allow for traceability of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identification of  the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, i.e., incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor must be documented. 
• Accountability and disposal  records are complete,  up-to-date,  and available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.  
 
It is the investigator’s  or designee’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty  containers.  
If conditions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Study  Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study treatments provided by BMS (or its vendors). Destruction of non - study 
treatments  sourced by the site, not supplied by BMS,  is solely  the responsibility  of the investigator 
or designee.

 APPENDIX 3  ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS: 
DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW UP AND REPORTING  
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse Event  Definition:  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexisting  medical  condition in a clinical  investigation participant administered  study treatment 
and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of  study  drug, whether or not 
considered related to the study treatment.  
Events Meeting  t he AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
results from other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements),  including those that worsen  from  baseline,  considered  clinically  significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of  the investigator.  Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safety assessments should only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis.  
• Exacerbation  of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing  condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Signs, symptoms,  or the clinical  sequelae of a suspected  drug-drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose,  as a verbatim  term (as reported by the 
investigator),  should not be reported  as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such  overdoses should be reported regardless  of 
sequelae and should specify "intentional overdose" as the verbatim term. 
Events NOT Meet
 ing the AE  Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE. 
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). 
 
DEFINITION OF SAE 
If an event is not  an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE  even if serious conditions 
are met.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of  death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe)  
Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing  hospitalization  (see NOTE 
below)  
NOTE:  
• The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs  in BMS  clinical studies:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective  surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine colonoscopy) 
• medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases 
• admission  encountered for  another life circumstance  that carries no bearing  on health  status 
and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason)  
• admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy in the absence of any other  SAEs  (applies 
to oncology protocols)  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
Is an important  medical  event (defined  as a medical  event(s) that may not be immediately life - 
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed  in the definition  above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event. (See Section 9.2.7 for the definition of potential DILI.)

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • SAEs, whether related or not  related  to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
• SAEs  must be recorded  on the SAE  Report Form.  Pregnancy and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) must follow  the same transmission  timing 
and processes to BMS as used for SAEs (see Section 9.2.5 for reporting pregnancies). 
EVALUATING  AES AND SAES 
 
Assessment  of Causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  study  intervention  and 
each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal  relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out. 
• The Investigator will use clinical  judgment to determine  the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated. 
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE,  the investigator must  document in the medical  notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There  may be situations  in which  an SAE  has occurred  and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always  make an assessment  of causality  for every  event  before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to Sponsor.  
• The Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: 
Follow- up SAE reports must include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new 
information becomes available, the SAE  report must be updated and submitted within 24 
hours to BMS  (or designee)  using the same procedure used for transmitting  the initial SAE 
report.  
All SAEs  must  be followed  to resolution or stabilization.

 APPENDIX 4  WOMEN  OF CHILDBEARING  POTENTIAL  DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
Appendix 4 provides general information and definitions related to Woman of Childbearing 
Potential and methods  of contraception that can be applied to  most clinical  trials.  For information 
specific to this study regarding acceptable contraception requirements for female and male participants, refer to Section 6.1 of the protocol. Only the contraception methods as described in 
Section 6.1 are acceptable for this study.  
DEFINITIONS  
Woman of Childbearing  Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. 
Women in the following  categories  are not considered  WOCBP:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal  female with  1 of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
− A postmenopausal state is defined  as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman  over age 
45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years  must  have a serum  follicle -stimulating  hormone (FSH)  level  
> 40 mIU/mL  to confirm menopause.  
 
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. Suggested guidelines for  the duration  of the washout  periods  for HRT  types  are presented  below. Investigators 
should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
• 1-week  minimum for vaginal hormonal  products (rings, creams,  gels)  
• 4-week minimum for transdermal products  
• 8-week  minimum for oral products

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.  
End of Relevant Systemic  Exposure  
End of relevant systemic exposure is the timepoint where the Investigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP) or any active major metabolites have decreased to a concentration that is no longer 
considered to be relevant for human teratogenicity or fetotoxicity. This should be evaluated in context of safety  margins  from the no-observed- adverse- effect  level  or the time required for 5 half- 
lives of the IMP to pass.  
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION  
Local  laws and regulations may  require use  of alternative  and/or  additional  contraception  methods.  
 
Highly  Effective  Contraceptive Methods  That  Are User Dependent  
Failure rate of < 1% per year when  used consistently  and correctly.a 
• Combined (estrogen - and progestogen- containing) hormonal  contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation and/or implantation. (This  method of contraception can only be used 
by WOCBP  participants in studies where  hormonal  contraception is permitted  by the study 
protocol.)b 
− Oral (birth  control pills)  
− Intravaginal (rings)  
− Transdermal  
• Combined (estrogen -and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception must begin at 
least 30 days prior to initiation of study therapy.  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation. (This 
method of contraception can only be used by WOCBP participants in studies where 
hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol.)b 
− Oral 
− Injectable  
• Progestogen- only hormonal contraception must begin at least 30 days prior to initiation of 
study therapy. 
Highly  Effective  Methods  That  Are User Independent  
• Implantable progestogen- only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation and/or implantation. (This method of contraception can  only be used by WOCBP 
participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the study protocol.)b 
• Intrauterine  device.

• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS). (This method of contraception can only be 
used by WOCBP participants in studies where hormonal contraception is permitted by the 
study protocol.)b,c 
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion.  
• Vasectomized  partner  
Having a vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been 
confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
A vasectomy  is a highly effective  contraception  method provided that the participant  is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual  abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from  
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability  of sexual  abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation  to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
• Continuous abstinence must begin  at least 30 days prior to initiation  of study therapy.  
• It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2.  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participant chooses to forego complete abstinence.  
• Periodic abstinence (including, but not limited to, calendar, symptothermal, postovulation 
methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea 
method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study.  
NOTES:  
a Typical use failure rates may differ from failure rates when contraceptive methods are used consistently and 
correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants in clinical studies.  
b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception 
would  be ineffective  or result  in increased  exposures  that could  be potentially  hazardous.  In this case,  alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. For information specific to this study regarding permissibility of hormonal contraception, refer to 
Sections 6.1  INCLUSION CRITERIA and 7.6.1  PROHIBITED AND/OR 
RESTRICTED TREATMENTS of the protocol.  
c IUSs  are acceptable methods  of contraception  in the absence  of definitive  drug interaction  studies  when  hormone 
exposures  from  intrauterine  devices  do not alter contraception  effectiveness.  For information  specific  to this

 APPENDIX  5 RECIST  1.1 CRITERIA  
1 ASSESSMENT  OF OVERALL  TUMOR  BURDEN AND MEASURABLE 
DISEASE  
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline  and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  Measurable disease 
is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable tumor lesion. When computed tomographic (CT) scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or non -measurable as 
follows:  
1.1 Measurable Lesions  
Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10 mm by CT/magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  scan (CT/MRI  scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm)  
• 10-mm caliper  measurement  by clinical  examination (lesions  that cannot be accurately  
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable)  
• 20 mm by chest  X-ray 
• Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must  be □ 15 mm  in the short  axis when  assessed  by CT  scan  (CT scan  slice  thickness is 
recommended to be no greater  than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed. 
 
1.2 Non-Measurable Lesions  
• All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <  10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with □ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non- measurable lesions  
• Lesions considered truly non- measurable include the following: leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites,  pleural  or pericardial  effusion, inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic involvement 
of the skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques 
 
1.3 Special  Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability  
1.3.1 Bone Lesions  
• Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging  techniques to measure bone lesions. However,  these techniques can be used 
to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic  bone lesions  or mixed lytic -blastic lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components that 
can be evaluated  by cross  sectional  imaging techniques such as CT or MRI,  can be considered 
Clinical  Protocol

Protocol  Amendment  No: 04 
Date:06 -Jan-2022  171 
Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 as measurable lesions if the soft tissue  component meets  the definition  of measurability 
described above.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
1.3.2 Cystic Lesions  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
• ‘Cystic  lesions’  thought to represent  cystic  metastases can be considered as measurable lesions 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions 
are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
1.3.3 Lesions with Prior  Local  Treatment  
Tumor lesions  situated  in a previously irradiated  area,  or in an area subjected  to other loco-regional 
therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there  has been  demonstrated  progression in 
the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by Methods of Measurements  
1.4.1 Measurement of Lesions  
All measurements  should be recorded  in metric  notation (mm).  All baseline evaluations should be 
performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment. 
1.4.2 Method of Assessment  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based  evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical examination.  
1.4.2.1 CT/MRI Scan  
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is based on the assumption that CT/MRI slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
1.4.2.2 Chest X -ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest  X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly  defined and surrounded by aerated 
lung.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 1.4.2.3 Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥  10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography including a  ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is  suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical examination and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.  
1.4.2.4 Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement.  If new lesions  are identified  by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised. 
1.4.2.5 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  
The utilization  of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.  
2 BASELINE  DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’  AND ‘NON -TARGET’ 
LESIONS  
2.1 Target Lesions  
When  more  than 1 measurable lesion  is present  at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions 
total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), 
should be representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in  the sum, then as noted  below, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline 
sum diameters  will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.  
2.1.1 Lymph Nodes 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified  as target lesions must meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of 
≥ 15 mm by CT scan . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded 
or followed. 
2.2 Non-Target  Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions  should  be followed  as ‘present’ , ‘absent’ , or in rare cases ‘unequivocal

 progression’ . In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).  
3 TUMOR  RESPONSE EVALUATION  
3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial  Response ( PR): At least a 30%  decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions , taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At  least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking  as reference the smallest  sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition  to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5  mm. ( Note: The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered 
progression.)  
Stable Disease (SD) : Ne ither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
3.1.1 S pecial  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target Lesions  
3.1.1.1 Lymph Nodes 
Lymph nodes merit special  mention since they are normal anatomical  structures  that may be visible 
by imaging  even if not  involved by tumor. Pathological  nodes that are defined as measurable  and 
may be identified  as target lesions must  meet  the criterion  of a short  axis of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan . 
Only  the short  axis of these  nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. Nodes that have  a short axis 
< 10 mm are considered  non-pathological and should not be recorded  or followed.  
3.1.1.2 Target  Lesions That  Become ‘Too Small  to Measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded  at each subsequent evaluation,  even  when  very small (eg, 2 mm).  If the radiologist is able 
to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.  
However,  when such a lesion  becomes difficult  to assign  an exact  measure to then:  
• If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is derived from the 5- mm CT slice thickness 
(but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness).

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 3.1.1.3 Target  Lesions That  Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
• When non- nodal lesions ‘fragment’,  the longest diameters of  the fragmented portions should 
be added together to calculate the target lesion sum.  
• As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal  diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have  truly  coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable,  the vector  of the longest diameter  in this instance  should 
be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.  
 
3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target  Lesions  
While  some  non- target  lesions may actually  be measurable,  they need  not be measured  and instead 
should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
Complete  Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non- target  lesions . All lymph  nodes must be non- 
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -P D: Persistence of 1 or more  non- target  lesion(s) above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. (Note: The 
appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
3.2.1 S pecial  Notes  on Assessment  of Non-Target  Lesions  
The concept  of progression of non- target disease requires additional explanation as follows:  
3.2.1.1 When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease  
• To achieve ‘unequivocal  progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an 
overall level of  substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. 
• A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status.  
 
3.2.1.2 When the Subject Has Only Non- Measurable Disease  
• To achieve ‘unequivocal  progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
• A modest ‘increase’ in the size of 1 or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status.  
• Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified (by definition: if all 
lesions are non- measurable), a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non- measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable  disease:  that is, an increase  in tumor burden representing 
an additional  73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural  effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’  
Clinical  Protocol

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. 
• If ‘unequivocal  progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point.  
 
3.3 New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding  of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal: that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (eg, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions).  This is  particularly  important 
when  the subject’s baseline lesions show partial or complete  response.  For example,  necrosis of a 
liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion  identified  on a follow-up study  in an anatomical  location that was not scanned  at baseline 
is considered  a new lesion  and will indicate  disease progression. An  example  of this  is the subject 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan ordered that reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion  is equivocal, for example because  of its small  size, continued  therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify  if it represents truly  new disease. If repeat  scans confirm there is definitely 
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
3.3.1 FDG -PET Evaluation  
While [
18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of the qualitative assessment of FDG -PET scanning 
to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). 
New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm: 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of  PD based 
on a new lesion. 
• No FDG- PET at baseline  and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: 
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
CT, this is PD.  
− If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial  positive  FDG- PET 
scan).

4 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
4.1 Timepoint Response  
A response assessment should occur at each timepoint specified in the protocol.  
For subjects who have measurable disease at baseline Table 4.1 -1 provides a summary of the 
overall response status calculation at each timepoint.

SD = stable disease.  
 
 
Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation  
When  no imaging/measurement  is done at all at a particular timepoint,  the subject  is not evaluable 
(NE)  at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion  measurements  are made at an assessment,  the case 
is also considered NE at that timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have changed the assigned timepoint response.

 4.1.1 Confirmation Scans 
• Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required at least 4 weeks following 
initial assessment to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  
 
4.2 Best Overall Response: All Timepoints  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject are known. It is the best 
response recorded from the start of  the study treatment until the date of objectively documented 
progression based on RECIST v1.1, taking into account any requirement for confirmation, or the 
date of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first in the study. The subject’s best 
overall response assignment  will depend on the findings of both target  and non- target  disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  
Best response is defined as the best response across all timepoints with  subsequent confirmation. 
Complete  or partial  responses may be claimed  only if the criteria  for each  are met  at a subsequent 
timepoint as specified in the protocol (generally 4 weeks later).  
In this circumstance,  the best overall response can be interpreted  as specified  in Table  4.2-1. When 
SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum time from 
baseline.  Measurements  must have met the SD criteria  at least once after study entry  at a minimum 
interval (in general, not less than 6 to 8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

a If a CR is truly met at first timepoint,  then any disease seen at a subsequent timepoint, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since the disease must have reappeared after CR). 
The best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may 
be claimed  when  subsequent  scans  suggest  small  lesions  were  likely  still present  and in fact the subject  had PR, not 
CR at the first timepoint.  Under  these circumstances,  the original  CR should  be changed  to PR and the best response 
is PR.  
 
4.3 Duration of Response  
4.3.1 Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of  overall response is measured  from  the time measurement  criteria  are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study).  
The duration of overall complete  response is measured  from the time measurement  criteria  are first 
met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
4.3.2 Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of randomization) until the criteria for progression are met,  taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).

 APPENDIX 6  MANAGEMENT  ALGORITHMS  FOR  IMMUNO -ONCOLOGY 
AGENTS  
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all immuno -oncology agents and regimens. 
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to standard medical practice. Non -inflammatory etiologies should be considered and appropriately 
treated.  
Corticosteroids  are a primary  therapy  for immuno -oncology drug- related  adverse events.  The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory patients with low - 
grade toxicity.  The lower  bioavailability of oral corticosteroids  should be taken  into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.  
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.  
The frequency  and severity  of the related  adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno-oncology agent or regimen being used.

CLASSIFICATION  
Heart failure is usually classified according to the severity of their symptoms. The table below 
describes the most commonly used classification system, the New York Heart Association (NYHA)  Functional Classification.  It places patients  in one of four categories based  on how much 
they are limited during physical activity. 
 
Class  Patient Symptoms  
I No limitation  of physical activity.  Ordinary  physical activity  does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath). 
II Slight limitation  of physical activity.  Comfortable  at rest. Ordinary  physical 
activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
III Marked  limitation  of physical activity.  Comfortable  at rest. Less than ordinary 
activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. 
IV Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.  
 
Class  Objective  Assessment  
A No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms and no limitation 
in ordinary physical activity. 
B Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild symptoms and slight 
limitation during ordinary activity. Comfortable at rest.  
 
C Objective  evidence of moderately  severe cardiovascular  disease.  Marked  limitation 
in activity  due to symptoms, even  during less -than-ordinary  activity. Comfortable 
only at rest.  
D Objective  evidence of severe  cardiovascular  disease.  Severe  limitations.

 APPENDIX  10    CONSORT  PUBLISHING  REQUIREMENTS  
The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) encompasses various initiatives 
developed by the CONSORT Group to alleviate the problems arising from inadequate reporting of randomized controlled trials.  
The CONSORT  Statement  
The main product of CONSORT is the CONSORT Statement, which is an evidence -based, 
minimum set of recommendations for reporting randomized trials. It offers a standard way for authors to prepare reports of trial findings, facilitating their complete and transparent reporting, and aiding  their critical  appraisal  and interpretation. CONSORT  2010 is the current version of the 
statement and supersedes the 2001 and 1996 versions. 
The CONSORT  Statement  comprises a 25- item checklist and  a flow  diagram.  The checklist  items 
focus on reporting how the trial was designed, analyzed, and interpreted. The flow diagram displays the progress of all participants  through the trial. The checklist  and flow diagram are freely 
available for viewing and downloading at the CONSORT website (http://www.consort - 
statement.org/consort-2010). The CONSORT  Statement  is endorsed  by general  medical journals, 
specialty medical journals, and leading editorial organizations. CONSORT is part of a broader effort, to improve the reporting of different types of health research, and indeed, to improve the quality of research used in decision- making in healthcare.  
CONSORT  2010 Guideline  
The CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 guideline is intended to improve the reporting of parallel -group randomized controlled trial (RCT), enabling readers to 
understand a trial's design, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and to assess the validity of its results. This can only be achieved through complete adherence and transparency by authors. CONSORT 2010 was developed through collaboration and consensus between clinical trial 
methodologists, guideline developers, knowledge translation  specialists,  and journal editors 
(see CONSORT group  ). CONSORT 2010 is the current version of  the guideline and supersedes 
the 2001 and 1996 versions. 
CONSORT  “Explanation and Elaboration” Document  
The CONSORT “Explanation and Elaboration” document explains and illustrates the principles 
underlying the CONSORT Statement, and should preferably be used in conjunction with the CONSORT  Statement.  In addition, extensions of  the CONSORT Statement have been  developed 
to give additional guidance for  RCTs  with specific designs,  data and interventions. The CONSORT 
website ( http://www.consort-statement.org/consort-2010)  contains the current definitive version 
of the CONSORT 2010 Statement and up- to-date information on extensions.

DETAILS FOR BAYESIAN LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL (BLRM AND BLRM - 
COPULA),  PARTS 1A, 1B, AND BAYESIAN OPTIMAL  INTERVAL  (BOIN),  PART  1C 
DESIGN  
1 BLRM  MODEL  SETUP FOR  BMS -986207 MONOTHERAPY  
1.1 Monotherapy Methodology Description  
An adaptive 2- parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression Model  (BLRM) guided by the escalation 
with overdose control (EWOC)  principle1,2,3 will be used to guide the dose escalation  of 
BMS -986207 monotherapy in the monotherapy phase, providing dose recommendation during 
dose escalation.  
The BLRM will be fitted on the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) data during the first 4 weeks of 
treatment accumulated throughout the dose escalation to model the dose -toxicity relationship of 
BMS -986207 in the monotherapy dose escalation phase. 
The dose -toxicity relationships for BMS -986207 monotherapy is assumed to follow a logistic 
model:  
logit (pi) = log(a1) + {31log(d1ij ∗), 
1 
where pi is the probability of toxicity at dose level  d1i. Note that the a 1 and {31 parameters are 
assumed positive, and d∗ is the reference dose for BMS -986207 (please refer to the meaning of 
a1 and {3 1 in Section 1.2.1 for detailed implementation). 
1.2 Prior  Specification for BMS- 986207 Monotherapy  
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distributions for model parameters, 
which include parameters ( a1, {31) for BMS -986207. The prior distributions for BMS -986207 
single agent  activity  were  derived  using a weakly  informative  prior,  as well as discussion with the 
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) clinical team.  
Derivation  of prior distribution  of these  parameters is provided in the following  subsections.  
1.2.1 Prior Derivation for  BMS -986207 Parameters  (log (a1), log (P 1)) 
A weakly informative prior will be used for parameters (a 1, {31) for BMS -986207 to reflect the 
potential of the different toxicities of BMS -986207 and allow for considerable prior uncertainty. 
Further details  are provided  below.  
Weakly Informative Prior  
• The median  DLT  rate at the reference  dose (BMS -986207 at 1600 mg qd) was assumed to be 
30%, that is, mean (log( a1)) = logit (0.3) = log(0.3/(1 -0.3)) = -0.847. 
• A doubling in dos e was assumed  to double the odds of DLT,  that is, mean(log( {31)) = 0. 
• The standard  deviation of log( a1) was  set to 1.53 using the following steps:

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • If the toxicity probability range was set to be [1%, 99%], then the toxicity interval would be 
logit (0.99) -logit (0.01) = 9.19. 
• To cover 99.7%  of the variance,  the toxicity  interval will cover  6*sd (log( a1)), which  gives us 
sd (log( a1)) = 9.19/6 = 1.53. 
 
Correspondingly, the standard deviation of log( {31) was set to 1, which allows for considerably 
larger prior uncertainty for the dose toxicity.  
1) The correlation  between  log( a1) and log( {31) was set to 0. 
2) log(a1) and log( {31) follow  a bivariate  normal distribution.

2 BLRM  MODEL  SETUP FOR  BMS- 986207 AND NIVOLUMAB 
COMBINATION  
2.1 Methodology Description for Combination Therapy  
Toxicity profiles of both BMS -986207 monotherapy and nivolumab monotherapy will be 
incorporated to develop the combination model framework. A copula -type model will be used to 
cover all general combination cases, including additive and synergistic effects. The combination 
of the 2 treatments will be explored using a Bayesian hierarchical model by utilizing the toxicity 
profiles  of the single agents as prior marginal profiles  for the combination. The following copula- 
type model4 will be used to describe the probability pij of toxicity when dose level i of agent A 
and dose level j of agent B are administered in combination:  
m 1/ n 1/y yl 
pij = 1 − exp(− [ {−log(1 − pi )} yl + {−log(1 − qj )} l]  ), 
where p i is the prespecified  best guess toxicity  probability  for agent A, qj is the prespecified  best 
guess toxicity  probability for agent B, m and n characterize the individual drug effect,  and 
y1 characterizes the drug -drug interactive effect.  
The joint toxicity framework models the toxicity rates of both agents as well as their interaction 
effects in a 7 -parameter hierarchical model, where each monotherapy dose- toxicity relationship 
will be characterized by a 2 -parameter BLRM model (see Section 1.1 ). There are 3 additional 
parameters for the copula -type model, 1 for each agent ( m and n) as well as 1 for the interaction 
term (y 1). A dose -toxicity surface will be characterized for different dose combinations of these  
2 agents. 
As there are currently no historical data  or prior knowledge to indicate how much information is 
to be borrowed for each of the single  agents,  parameters  m and n are both set to  be 1, meaning

2 borrowing 100% of the information from  the 2 agents. The above formula is then simplified into 
a 5-parameter model as follows:  
1/ 1/y yl 
pij = 1 − exp(− [ {− log(1 − pi)} yl + {− log(1 − qj)} l]  . 
 
 
Since only a fixed nivolumab dose (240 mg) will be used in the BMS -986207 and nivolumab 
combination, this surface will be simplified into a 2 -dimensional dose -toxicity curve. Posteriors 
for the corresponding 5 parameters (2 logistic  regression  parameters  [a1, {31] for BMS -986207 and 
2 logistic regression  parameters [ a2, {32] for nivolumab, as well as 1 interaction  parameter  for the 
copula- type model [ y1, which will be discussed in detail in the following section]) will be fitted 
into the in -house developed model. It implements the above- described theoretical setup.  
2.2 Prior  Specification for Combination Therapy  
2.2.1 Marginal  Prior for BMS -986207  
Posterior information on log( α1) and log( β1) from the monotherapy  part of  the study will be used 
as marginal BMS -986207 prior for combination with nivolumab. This prior information is not 
prespecified and will be continuously updated when additional DLT information from the 
monotherapy is available.  In the simulation  (see Section  3, the  prior of  BMS -986207 as described 
in Section 1.2.1 (Table 1 ) is used for illustration purposes because no real -time DLT data are 
available at this time.  
2.2.2 Marginal  Prior  Derivation for Nivolumab Parameters (log( α2), log(β2)) 
Similar to BMS -986207 monotherapy in the monotherapy phase,  the logistic  model for nivolumab 
is as follows: 
logit (qj) = log(a2) + {32log(d2jj ∗), 
2 
where  qj is the probability  of toxicity  at dose level  d2j. Note  that the a2 and {32 parameters  are 
assumed positive, and d∗ is the reference dose for nivolumab.  
The toxicity  profile  of nivolumab has been  studied in several  studies.  A bivariate  normal prior for 
the nivolumab model parameters (log( α2), log( β2)) was obtained by extracting a posterior of 
nivolumab using DLT  and safety  data from the Study CA209003, which  is used later as the meta - 
analytical -predictive (MAP) prior for nivolumab.  
The MAP  prior for the model parameters (log(α2), log(β2)) was obtained in the following  steps. 
First, a prior distribution for nivolumab was developed: 
• The medianb  DLT  rate at the reference dose (3 mg/kg every  2 weeks)  was assumed  to be 10%, 
that is, mean (log( α2)) = logit(1/10) = log(1/9) = -2.197.  
• A doubling in dose was assumed  to double odds of DLT,  that is, mean(log( β2)) = 0. 
• The standard  deviation of log( α2) was set to 2, and the standard  deviation  of log( β2) to 1, which 
allows for considerable prior uncertainty for the dose -toxicity profile.

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • The correlation between log( α2) and log( β2) is assumed to be 0 (assuming independence of 
log(α2) and log( β2)). 
• In addition, heterogeneity between the historical study and current study was incorporated 
using a meta -analytic  predictive approach by defining between -trial standard  deviations τ1 and 
τ2 for log( α2) and log( β2), respectively. The between- trial variability is assumed to be 
moderate. Therefore, τ 1 and τ2 were set to follow a log -normal distribution, with mean 
log(0.25) and log(0.125), respectively, with a common standard deviation log(2)/1.96. 
 
With  this prior, the clinical  trial data below (Table  2) were  used to generate the posterior for 
nivolumab, which is then used as the MAP prior for this study (Table 3).

Note:  Nivolumab prior information was  based  on a milligram -per-kilogram dosing instead of flat 
dosing. If real pharmacokinetic (PK)  data from this study show difference  from  the milligram- per- 
kilogram assumption, the nivolumab prior will be revisited and modified accordingly. 
2.2.3 Prior  for Interaction Parameters for Joint  Toxicity of BMS- 986207 and 
Nivolumab Combination 
A gamma prior distribution for the interaction parameter γ1 is derived to reflect the current 
uncertainty  about  the toxicity  profile of the combination  of BMS -986207 and nivolumab. Although 
no PK drug -drug interaction is expected, the possibility of a significant positive interaction 
between BMS -986207 and nivolumab cannot be totally excluded. The interaction parameter γ1 
was chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty to allow for the possibility that the 
interaction may be positive or negative. Therefore, the following assumptions are made for the interaction parameter:  
Clinical  Protocol 
BMS -986207  CA020002

Protocol  Amendment  No: 04 
Date:06 -Jan-2022  205 
Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • γ1 follows  a gamma  distribution  and with a mean  centered  at 1.1, which  means  the combination 
of 2 agents is likely to have only a small synergistic effect.  
• The 97.5 percentile of γ 1 is log(3), that is, a 3 -fold increase in odds of DLT due to the 
interaction over independence at the starting dose of the combination.  
 
This model assigns the highest probability to there being small synergistic interaction and also 
allows  for the potential of larger synergism of the toxic profiles.  It also does not completely  ignore 
the possibility  of antagonism because there is a 40% prior probability that γ1 is less than 1.  
3 BLRM  DECISION  RULE FOR  DOSE ESCALATION  AND SIMULATION  
Dose escalation recommendations for BMS -986207 monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab will be based  on the inference from the Bayesian  posterior and the probability that the 
true DLT rate for each dose lies in 1 of the following categories:  
• [0%,  16%)  under- dosing 
• [16%, 33%)  targeted  toxicity  
• [33%, 100%]  excessive toxicity  
 
These boundaries are similar to the toxicity boundaries used by a rule -based design (ie, 3 + 3 
design) in that a minimum is set at 16% (~ 1 in 6) DLT  rate and a maximum  at 33% (~ 2 in 6) DLT 
rate. Following the principle of EWOC, dose  recommendations for  the next cohort will be based 
on the Bayesian model after DLT information becomes available during the DLT period, 
accounting for all of  the available data from the administered doses, and the candidate doses are 
the ones fulfilling the overdose criterion that  there is less than 30% chance of excessive toxicity. 
Only the candidate doses will be considered for the next cohort. While the Bayesian model will use DLT information from the DLT period  only, clinical assessment will take into consideration 
of the totality of available data including PK/  from all treated participants.  
Stopping  R
ules:  
The following is the general  stopping rules  of BLRM  (-Copula) during Dose  Escalation:  
• If all of 30 DLT  evaluable participants  are treated.  
• If all of the current pre- specified  doses are considered  intolerable  according to the pre- specified 
cutoff (ie, EWOC  criteria),  then the model will recommend  stopping the current  dose level  and 
a new dose level lower than the current lowest dose level  will need to be identified.  
• The maximum number of participants in a dose level will be 12. This limit is set to avoid 
instances in  which  the model could recommend  adding subjects  indefinitely  to a specific dose 
level due to uncertainty in the tolerability profile.  
• If, for a specific dose level,  6 subjects have been  treated  and the chance of determining  that the 
dose level  to be the “target” dose is > 50%, then the model will suggest to stop and declare the 
current dose level to be MTD.  
• Mo del -recommended MTD:  
• The MTD  is the dose that satisfies  the following 3 conditions:

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 • (1) The empirical posterior probability that the ‘DLT  rate of 16% -< 33%’  is greater  than 50%,  
• (2) This probability  needs  to be the largest  among the dose levels  that satisfy  the EWOC 
condition (ie, the probability that ‘DLT rate ≥ 33%’ must be less than 30%);  
• (3) Minimum number of participants  (ie, 6), were  treated  at this dose level.  
 
Final  M TD/RP2D:  
The final recommended MTD/RP2D will be based on the recommendation from the 
BLRM/BLRM -copula and overall clinical  assessment  of all available  safety,  PK/  and efficacy 
data.  Lower  doses of BMS -986207 may be tested  if none of the planned doses are found to be 
tolerable as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab. Such decisions will be made after 
discussion and agreement between the investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor. 
 
3.2 Simulation  Parameters  
One thousand trial simulations  were  used for each scenario.  All simulations  were  run using EAST  
6.3.1® software  for BLRM  model for BMS -986207 monotherapy and in-house developed  code via 
R and Openbugs for BLRM -copula method for BMS -986207 in combination  with nivolumab. The 
number of subjects to be treated  in each cohort in a specific dose level  and the stopping rules  used 
to declare MTD are defined as:  
• Fixed  cohort size: 3 
• Probability  of overdosing: < 30% 
• Probability  of achieving  the target toxicity: > 50% 
• Maximum number of participants treated: 30 
• Minimum number of participants  treated  at a given  dose level  in order to declare MTD:  6 
• Maximum  number of participants  at a dose:12  
 
The provisional  dose levels for BMS -986207 monotherapy are 80 -1600 mg. For the combination

Section  3.2.1 demonstrates operating characteristics of BLRM  for monotherapy and Section  3.2.2 
demonstrates operating characteristics of BLRM- copula for combination therapy accounting for 
joint toxicity of the combination therapy. 
3.3.1 Operating Characteristics of BLRM for Monotherapy  
Three scenarios were investigated by selecting (1) dose- DLT relationship derived by prior, (2) 
narrow safety  window in order to explore how EWOC limits  the risk of exposing participants  from 
a toxic dose level, and (3) all doses above the target toxicity.

performs  well  in the hypothetical scenarios investigated  by correctly  identifying  the MTD  at least

The average sample size was no more than 20 participants. The results show how the EWOC 
principle limits the risk of exposing participants from  unacceptable toxic dose levels, eg, 50% or 
above. Overall, the scenarios illustrated above demonstrate that the model performs well by correctly  identifying  the MTD  ranging from 50% to 83% in the hypothetical scenarios investigated 
while limiting participants from receiving unacceptable toxic dose levels  
4 BLRM  INTERIM  MONITORING CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE 
PROVISION OF DOSE RECOMMENDATIONS DURING DOSE- 
ESCALATION 
In order to provide a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the models, different hypothetical 
scenarios exploring all possibilities are examined. For the simplicity of illustration purposes, a static cohort size of  3 subjects is applied for dose levels 80 mg, 240 mg, 800 mg and 1600 mg in 
the BMS -986207 monotherapy and for the dose level  80 mg in the combination  setting. This cohort 
size could vary during the actual  clinical  trial, and the BLRM  (-Copula) models are designed to fit 
various different cohort sizes, adaptively. In general, there are 4 possible scenarios for a specific dose level,  which  are 0 DLT  observed in 3 total subjects in that cohort (denoted as 0/3), 1 DLT

observed in 3 subjects (1/3), 2 DLTs observed in 3 subjects (2/3), and 3 DLTs observed in 3 
subjects (3/3).  
During interim monitoring, posterior probabilities will be updated when there is new DLT information available. The following three visualization plots will be produced to reflect  the real 
time dose- DLT  relationship, to quantify benefit (in the form of target dosing) and risk (in the form 
of overdosing and underdosing) during model’s  recommendation process,  and to facilitate  clinical 
team’s interpretation of the model recommendations for the final decision making:  
• Dose -DLT  profile  for the doses ranging between  0 mg and 1600 mg (Figure  1). 
• Stacking histograms displaying predictive probabilities  on DLT  rates  classified  into 3 different 
categories (Underdosing, Target dosing and Overdosing) ( Figure 2).  
• Box plots summarizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples of predicted DLT 
rates for the 5 pre -specified dose levels ( Figure 3 ).

Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  1: 
Figure 1 is a snapshot of an updated dose -DLT profile with DLT information available at dose 
level 80 mg for combination studies. The dose -DLT profile is captured with a continuous dose 
spectrum ranging from 0 mg to 1600 mg, which is a slice of the dose -DLT surface of the 
combination of two  drugs with  Nivolumab fixed  at 240 mg. For each dose within  the range, there 
is a corresponding distribution  of the predicted  DLT  rates calculated  from  the posterior samples of 
the model parameters.  This figure will be updated each time new DLT  information  becomes

available from the combination studies. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS -986207 
monotherapy.  
In Figure  1, there are 3 different quantiles (2.5%, 50%, and 97.5%) plotted to characterize the 
current  trend  of the toxicity  profile  (as shown by the 50%  quantile), as well  as the  variation  of the 
dose- DLT profile (as shown by the 2.5% percentile and the 97.5% percentile), according to the 
accumulation of DLT data from all previous and current dose levels. The toxicity boundaries 
(0.16 and 0.33) are illustrated in two dotted horizontal lines to benchmark the way in which the 
dose-DLT profile is trending. 
Intermediate  dose levels  can be identified  using different  boundary cutoffs.  For example,  using the 
50% percentile curve (green highlight), which represents the nearly average DLT distribution for 
each dose level,  the 300 mg could be a potential intermediate  dose level  corresponding to the lower 
pre-specified DLT rate boundary of 0.16, and the 1600 mg could be a fitted MTD dose level 
associated with the upper boundary of 0.33. 
Moreover, if all of the current pre -specified doses are considered intolerable (overdosing 
probabilities >  0.3 for combination therapy, a case not shown on the current Figure 1),  the model 
will recommend to stop the current dose level, and the clinical team can leverage the current 
updated dose -DLT curve to pinpoint a new dose, which is lower than pre -specified lowest dose 
(80 mg) by using the DLT rate boundaries.

and Overdosing)

 Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  2: 
Figure 2 is a snapshot of stacking histogram  with DLT information available at dose level  80 mg 
for the combination  studies.  This figure  will be updated each time new DLT  information  becomes 
available in the combination setting. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS -986207 
monotherapy.  
When recommending the next dose level, the model will first exclude doses that are intolerable 
(with overdosing probabilities >  30%, the rate that has been specified for BMS -986207 in 
combination with nivolumab). Among those qualified candidate doses that are considered 
“tolerable”,  the model will select  the dose that maximizes  the probability of being within  the target 
toxicity range (DLT rate of 16% up to 33%).  
As illustrated  in Figure 2 , when  there  is 0 DLT  observed out of 3 subjects for the dose level  80 mg 
and 1 DLT  out of 3 subjects for the dose level  240 mg, the distribution  of predicted  DLT  rates will 
be characterized into  possibilities falling into 3  different categories. First, dose levels of 800 mg 
and 1600 mg for BMS -986207 are excluded according to the higher -than-cutoff (0.3 for 
combination therapy) overdosing probabilities (0.364 for 800mg and 0.503 for 1600mg). Among 
the remainder of tolerable  dose levels  (80 mg and 240 mg), the BLRM -Copula model recommends 
the dose  that maximizes the probability of being within the target dosing interval. Therefore, the 
model’s recommendation would be to escalate to 240 mg, which is associated with the highest target dosing probability of 0.342 compared with that of 80 mg (0.231). 
Similarly (although not shown on Figure 2 ), according to the rules specified above, the model 
could possibly recommend to de -escalate to a lower dose level than current treated dose level, 
extend the current dose level,  or even  recommend  to stop and identify  a new dose level  lower  than 
80mg, the lowest pre -specified dose level. Please refer to description of Figure 1 for details on 
how to specify the new dose levels.

Interpretation  and usage  of Figure  3: 
Figure 3 is a snapshot with DLT information available at dose level 80 mg for the combination 
setting. The dose- DLT  distributions  calculated  from  the posterior samples of the model parameters 
are characterized in the format of boxplots for the pre -specified dose levels. This figure will be 
updated each time there is new DLT information available. Similar graphs will also be produced 
for the BMS -986207 monotherapy. 
This plot supplements the information provided in Figure 1 . It allows for a more in -depth and 
focused visualization of general trend of dose -DLT relationship, as well as the magnitude and 
variability in the DLT rates for each pre -specified dose level. 
4.1 Example of the BLRM  using BMS- 986207 Monotherapy Dose Escalation  
According to safety consideration and clinical judgement, the dose level 80 mg is recommended as the starting  dose for BMS -986207 monotherapy. With  the current  BMS -986207 prior specified 
in the Section  1.2.1 and all available DLT  information  up to 240 mg, a corresponding decision tree 
illustrating  various models’  recommendations under  all possible scenarios (for dose levels of 800 
mg and 1600 mg) is provided in Figure 4 . 
Tracing a branch of  the decision tree in Figure 4 illustrates  the decision making process. Taking 
the left -most branch of the tree  as an example, starting  at 80 mg, there  was 0 DLT observed at 
80 mg in the real clinical  trial, the model  recommended  to escalate to 240 mg (The  BLRM  actually 
recommends escalating to dose level  800 mg but since this is a 10 fold increrase of dose and this

type of dose skipping is not allowed  the dose level  240 mg is selected),  one level  above the current 
treated dose level according escalation rules per protocol (as detailed in Protocol Section 5.1). 
Additionally,  there  was 0 DLT  observed  at 240 mg in real data,  the model recommended  to escalate 
further one dose level to 800 mg. 
As illustrated  in Figure 4, there  are 6 potential decision  paths for  dose levels 800 mg  and moving 
onwards up to 800 mg. During the actual  clinical study, the tree would be narrowed or deepened 
based on actual DLT. The clinical team will be able to leverage this decision tree to preview 
decisions at each interim monitoring step and to plan proactively.

5 BOIN  ESCALATION DESIGN SIMULATION  WITH  2 DOSE LEVELS,  PART  
1C 
The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design framework will be used to guide the safety 
evaluation of BMS -986207 in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab  in Part 1C. The design 
is typically  also used to determine  maximum  tolerated  dose (MTD)  selection in  cases where  more 
doses are evaluated.5,6 
As a single dose level  of BMS -986207 will be evaluated  in this triplet  combination  (with  potential 
for a de -escalation if needed), the goal in this study part is to assess if the dose is tolerable. 
Therefore  MTD  reference  below (as in typical multi- dose level  design) represents a ‘tolerable

Approved  v 71.0 930104927  7.0  
 dose’ in Part 1C. As an escalation  decision is not  of interest in Part 1C, a design recommendation 
to declare a dose as tolerable is based on meeting the same criteria needed to escalate.  
The target toxicity rate for the MTD is ɸ = 0.3 and the maximum sample size is 12. Participants 
will be enrolled  in cohorts of 3. The BOIN design framework  uses the following  rule optimized  to 
minimize the probability of incorrect dose assignment, to guide dose escalation/de- escalation:  
• If the observed  DLT  rate at the current dose is ≤ 0.236, declare the dose tolerable;  
• If it is ≥ 0.359, de- escalate the dose to the next lower  dose level; 
• Otherwise, stay  at the current  dose. 
 
The design MTD selection approach described next, is included for general information on the 
design; however, it is not  used in this study. After the trial is completed,  selection  of the MTD is 
based on isotonic regression as specified in Liu and Yuan (2015).5 Specifically, the MTD is the 
dose for which the isotonic estimate of the DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate. If there are ties, select the higher dose level when the isotonic estimate is lower than the target DLT rate and select the lower dose level when the isotonic estimate is greater than or equal to the target DLT rate. 
5.1 Operating characteristics of BOIN  design with 2 dose levels  
Table 6 shows the operating characteristics of the trial design based on 1000 simulations of the 
trial using the BOIN Design  Desktop Program.
7 The operating characteristics  show that the design 
selects the true MTD (tolerable dose), if  any, with high probability and allocates more patients to 
the dose levels with the DLT rate closest to the target of 0.3.

 APPENDIX  13    PRELIMINARY SAFETY COHORT  
1 PRELIMINARY SAFETY COHORT  FOR  PHASE 1, PART  1A 
1.1 Justification for the Preliminary Safety Cohort  (PSC):  
The FIH starting dose of BMS -986207 monotherapy, as an immune -mediated anti -cancer agent, 
was determined using both toxicology- and pharmacology- (  efficacy) -based 
approaches to ensure participant  safety  while  limiting  the number of participants  receiving  
nonpharmacologically active doses. The toxicology -based approach utilized the HNSTD 
determined from a 1 -month repeat -dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The 
pharmacology- based  approach  leveraged  the pharmacology data (ie,  efficacy)  obtained 
from mouse surrogates to project the human effective  dose, from  which  the FIH starting  dose was 
selected.  The starting  doses determined  from  both approaches were  integrated,  and the lower  dose 
of 1 mg/kg (or  80 mg  flat dose, assuming  an average body weight of  80 kg in cancer  participants) 
was recommended as the starting monotherapy dose for BMS -986207. 
Subsequent to discussions with FDA, to further ensure a sufficient safety margin for the 
monotherapy starting dose, given the absence of previous clinical experience with BMS -986207, 
a Preliminary Safety Cohort (PSC) was added to the study. In the PSC, a single participant will receive BMS -986207 monotherapy starting  at the 2-mg dose, with intra-participant dose escalation 
to 6 mg, and then to 20 mg. Following a 5- day safety observation period for this participant 
following  the initial administration  of the 20- mg dose,  2 additional participants  will begin the study 
at the 20- mg BMS -986207 dose level. 
At the conclusion of the 4- week  DLT  period for these 3 participants in the PSC,  which  respectively 
begins with the first administration  of the 20- mg dose for each of the 3 participants in the PSC, if 
no DLT is observed, the main study protocol will begin  with participants  receiving  BMS -986207 
monotherapy at the 80 mg dose level.  If a DLT  is observed in the PSC,  the BLRM  will be initiated. 
A decision  whether to treat additional patients  at the same dose level,  or escalate the dose, will be 
based on a recommendation from the BLRM and overall clinical assessment with all the safety, pharmacokinetic  data..  
1.2 S
 tudy Design for PSC:  
In the PSC,  the first cohort of 3 participants  will be administered  intravenous (IV) doses of BMS - 
986207 as follows: 
The starting dose of 2 mg of BMS -986207 will be assigned to the first participant, followed by 
intra-participant dose escalation  after 2 weeks to 6 mg, and then 2 weeks later to 20 mg, if no DLTs 
are observed in any of the dose intervals. After the participant clears a 5 -day safety observation 
period at the 20- mg dose level, 2 additional  participants will be enrolled at the 20 -mg dose level. 
The 4 -week DLT period for all participants in the PSC begins with the first 20 -mg dose 
administration. For  these PSC participants, subsequently, flat dose levels of 20 mg will be given 
q2w, in 8-week cycles, for up to 3 cycles of study therapy. 
All the procedures for this PSC, in regard to the study design, study population, treatment, 
discontinuation criteria  and study assessments/procedures,  are the same  as described  in respective

 Sections 5 , 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the main protocol. The objectives, endpoints, and statistical 
considerations ( Section 4 and Section 10) of the main protocol also apply to the PSC. The only 
exceptions to the provisions of  the main protocol for the PSC are the Treatment Periods and the 
Pharmacokinetics,  Immunogenicity  sampling schedules for the first participant 
undergoing intra-participant dose escalation.  These exceptions to the main  protocol are detailed  
below.  
1.2.1 Treatment Periods  
The first participant will receive BMS -986207 as monotherapy at the starting dose of 2 mg. The 
infusion will take place  over  5 minutes and will  require a 60-minute observation period following 
the completion of the infusion. A 60-minute post infusion safety  observation period is considered 
appropriate given BMS -986207 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that is an antagonist (not 
an agonist) and has a low likelihood of resulting in  infusion  reactions.  The participant  will follow 
the assessments  and procedures described  below  and, after 2 weeks,  if no DLT  occurs in that 
2-week interval, the participant will proceed to the next dose infusion of BMS -986207 at 6 mg. 
This infusion will take place over 10 minutes and will require a 60 -minute observation period 
following the completion of the infusion. After another 2 -week observation period, if no DLT 
occurs in that 2-week  interval,  the participant  will then escalate to the next dose level  of 20 mg. At 
this dose level,  a treatment  cycle  will be comprised  of 4 doses of BMS -986207 administered  q2w. 
At the 20- mg dose level, BMS -986207 infusions will take place  over 60 minutes and will require 
a 60- minute observation period following the completion of the infusion for the first 4 doses of 
Cycle  1 for the participant, as described in Section 5.1.2 of the main protocol. After the first 
participant clears a sentinel period of 5 days with no safety issues observed, 2 new participants 
will be enrolled  in the study to start treatment  of BMS -986207 at the 20-mg dose level.  These 
2 participants will follow all the same study  procedures and evaluations as described in the main 
protocol. The PSC Treatment Scheme is summarized in Table 1.2.1-1 below. 
Vital signs and pulse oximetry  monitoring, as outlined in Section  2, w ill  be performed  for all dose 
level administrations of BMS 986207.

The main purpose of this amendment is to add q4w dosing regimen to both the BMS -986207 
monotherapy and the combination nivolumab and  BMS -986207 dosing  schedule. The less frequent 
q4w dosing schedule may benefit patients by decreasing the number of  time drug is infused and 
will also reduce the potential medical  burden from the care givers and cancer  treatment institutions. 
Additional changes  to the protocol provide clarity  in executing the clinical  study.

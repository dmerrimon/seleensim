1.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
 Scientific background and basis for hypothesis(es) to be teste d. Include justification for 
conducting study and results of similar studies or pilot data.   
 
Informal Caregivers of Cancer Survivors . Informal caregivers are people within the survivor ’s social  
network, related by blood or emotional attachment, who provide emotional, informational and/or instrumental  
support. 52 The value of this unpaid labor force of 44 million caregivers in the United States 53 is estimated to be  
at least $306 billion annually, 54,55 with 5.7 million caregivers providing care to cancer survivors. 56 Caregivers of  
canc er patients become involved in complex care activities 57 for an average of 14 months. 58,59  A shift to patient -
centered care is facilitated by engaging the caregivers and requires the understanding of  survivors ’ and 
caregivers ’ outcomes resulting from such engagement. 60,61 Caregivers exp erience a range of  psychological 
problems, disruption of daily routines, financial burdens, and role changes that accompany the  care recipient ’s 
cancer diagnosis and treatment. 62-64 Caring for the survivor often has negative consequences  to the caregiver ’s 
family resources and health. 65,66 Caregivers have poorer physical health than those in the  general population, 
reflected by higher prevalence of arthritis, chronic back pain, and heart disease. 67 Between  30-50% of 
caregivers  experience increased psychiatr ic morbidity, fatigue, sleep impairment. 68-70 Psychological  distress 
among caregivers is often present at levels equal to or greater than among cancer survivors. 40,71 -81 Risk of 
these morbidities is particularly high among c aregivers who are female, 82-84 less educated, 85 younger in  age, 86 
and who are caring for younger adult survivors. 87,88 These findings explain increased use of health care  
services among caregivers of those recently diagnosed with cancer. 89,90   
Meaningful i nvolvement in the survivor ’s car e may also have a positive impact on caregivers ’ health, 91-94 
which improves the quality of care they provide to the survivors. 95-98 For these reasons, interventions providing  
caregivers with tools such as the SM SH are highl y valuable. 99,100 Further, psycho social interventions that 
directly  improve caregivers ’ health, 101 reduce psychological distress and address problem -solving and 
communication  skills, 102 are also potentially beneficial to survivors and their caregivers. The  proposed research 
will deliver  psychosocial (TIP -C) and educational (SM SH) interventions and test their optimal sequencing for 
survivors with  known levels of distress and symptom severity as well as their impact on their caregivers who 
often experience  distress and associated other sympto ms (e.g., poor sleep, fatigue).  
Symptom burden in cancer survivors.  Physical and psychological symptoms are aggravated while cancer  
survivors are in treatment. 103,104 Survivors ’ symptom burden 105-112 is often the prima ry reason for altering or  
stopping chemotherapy 113,114 leading to suboptimal treatment at the very least, 115-117 and life threatening  
recurrence or metastasis at the extreme. 118,119 The prevalence of specific symptoms (e.g., fatigue, pain,  
depression, anxi ety, disturbed sleep, nausea and vomiting, neuropathy) 120-125 varies by cancer diagnosis,  
treatment type, gender, ethnicity and age, 98,99 variables that will be empirically tested as potential tailoring  
factors in decision rules that will be formulated in this research. The number of symptoms reported by cancer  
survivors can be as high as 14. 126 127 Approximately 30% of cancer survivors report psychological distress  
(depression and anxiety). Major depression occurs in approximately 16%, and subthreshold depress ive 
disorders occur in 22% of cancer survivors during treatment. 28 These prevalence rates are about 3 times  higher 
than in the general population. Even when dep ression and anxiety do not meet threshold for clinical  diagnoses, 
these symptoms are still assoc iated with significant health impairments, yet are highly  treatable, 128,129 and will 
be in this trial, potentially saving healthcare costs and improving outcome s. Further, in our past studies, Latinas 
with breast cancer reported a higher number and more sy mptom burden/distress than did non -Hispanic white 
women with similar diagnoses. 31 Therefore, we will enroll an  ethnically diverse sample (includes 30%  
Hispanic/ Latino participants) in this trial to address a significant  symptom management need. Given the  
increasing population of Hispanic cancer survivors, providing and  testing an intervention in the participant ’s 
primary language could have national significance.  A series of longitudinal studies 130-133 including those 
conducted by this team 130,131 , found an  association  between increasing symptom prevalence and poorer 
physical and emotional functioning. Our team ’s past  work 134 and that of others 135 documented the a ssociations 
between reductions in symptoms and lower number  of hospitalizations, office and ED v isits.10 The proposed 
interventions are significant because they will address  the multiple symptoms experienced by survivors during 
treatment and the associated  health care service use.

 2.0 OBJECTIVE(S)/SPECIFIC AIMS  
 Purpose and spe cific aims of the stud y. 
 
Informal caregivers, typically family members or friends, provide more than half of the care needed for the 5.7  
million cancer survivors in the United States, often with negative health consequences. At least 30% of  
survivors and t heir caregivers repor t psychological distress (depression and anxiety) and such distress may  
interfere with optimal symptom management. This study will support both members of the survivor -caregiver  
dyad in the management of the survivor ’s cancer - and trea tment -related symptom s and the dyad ’s 
psychological distress.  
Design : We will use the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)  
design, a newer adaptive design. The SMART moves beyond a traditional RCT to a precision approach to  
determine the  right treatment at t he right dose with the right sequence for the right survivor -caregiver dyad. We  
will use two evidence -based interventions: Symptom Management and Survivorshi p Handbook (SMSH) and 
Telephone Interpersonal  
Counseling (TIP -C). While we have established the o verall efficacy of thes e interventions, but individuals differ  
in responses. When an intervention does not initially work, clinic logic is to either extend the timeframe or  
prescribe a different intervention. Yet, such alternatives are seldom tested nor ev idence -based. However, they 
will be in this study.  
Sample: We will enroll 298 survivors with elevated depression or anxiety who are  undergoing chemotherapy or 
targeted therapy for a solid tumor and their 298 caregivers.  
Procedure : Dyads  will be initially ran domized to SMSH  alone or TIP -C +SMSH . If the survivor ’s elevated 
depression or anxiety does  not respond to SMSH  alone by week 4, dyads will be re -randomized to continue 
with SMSH  to give it more time or  to TIP -C+SMSH . Outcome data will be collected at base line, weeks 13 
(post -intervention) and 17 (follow -up). Assessments during weeks 1 -12 will docum ent changes in symptoms, 
intervention receipt, enactment and  fidelity.  
Specific aims : 1) Determine if dyads in the TIP -C+SMSH  as compared to the SMSH  alone group  created  by 
the first random ization will have: a) lower depression, anxiety, and summed severity of 13 other symptoms  at 
weeks 1 -12, 13, and 17 (primary outcomes); b) lower use of healthcare services (hospitalizations, urgent  
care or emergency department [ ED] visits) during 17 weeks (secondary outcomes); c) greater self -efficacy,  
social support, and l ower caregiver burden during weeks 13 and 17 (potential mediators). 2) Among 
nonresponders  to the SMSH  alone after 4 weeks, determine if dyads assigned to TIP -C+SMSH  as compared 
to the  SMSH  alone group created by the second randomization will have better prim ary and secondary 
outcomes and  potential mediators at weeks 5 -12, 13, and 17. 3) Test the interdependence in survivor ’s and 
caregiver ’s 
primary and secondary  outcomes. 4) Determine which characteristics of the dyad are associated with  
responses to the SMSH  alone during weeks 1 -4 and optimal outcomes for the dyad during weeks 1 -12, 13 and  
17 so as to determine tailoring variables for the decision rules of indiv idualized sequencing of interve ntions.  
Findings will be used to improve symptom management and reduc e distress in survivor -caregiver dyads.   
 
 
3.0 SAMPLE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA  
 Specific inclusion/exclusion requirements which must be met for entry.   
 
Inclus ion criteria for the survivors are: 1) age 18 or older; 2) undergoing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or 
targeted therapy for a solid tumor cancer;  3) able to perform basic activities of daily living; 4) cogniti vely 
oriented to time, place, and person (det ermined  by recruiter) ; 5) repor ting severity of >2 on depression or >4 on 
anxiety using a 0 -10 standardized scale; 6) able to speak and understand English or Spanish; 7) access to a 
telephone and 8) has a caregi ver who can  be in any relationship role (e.g. , spouse, sibling, parent, frie nd) who 
can participate with them.  
 
Exclusion  criteria are: 1) diagnosis of a psychotic disorder in the health record; 2) nursing home resident; 3) 
bedridden; 4) currently receiving  counseling and/or psychotherapy. Inclusion criteria for the caregivers are : 1) 
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 5 
 age 18 or  older; 2) able to speak and understand English or Spanish; 3) access to a telephone; 4 ) not currently 
receiving  counseling and/or psychotherapy; and 5) not currently treated for cancer.  
 
The advantages of these  inclusion criteria are i n study  generalizability. Solid tumors have been selected  
because cancer - and treatment -related symptoms can be effectively managed in this population with the two  
interventions (see section C2). Site of cancer and other prognostic  factors will be controll ed in r andomization  
(see C7). Thus, groups compared in study hypotheses will be balanced on disease and treatment  
characteristics. The cut -offs of >2 on depression and >4 on anxiety indicate their presence at moderate or  
severe lev els based on established interfe rence -based cut -points. 224 The need to screen on depression and  
anxiety is premised on a meta -analysis that psychosocial interventions are most beneficial for those with  
elevated distress. 225,226 By allowing surviv ors to sel ect their own caregivers, findin gs would be generalizable to  
the cancer survivor population who may be single or rely on other people for support. The exclusion of  
caregivers currently treated for cancer will preserve the distinguishability of th e “survivo r” and “caregiver ” roles  
within the dyad. Our prior research indicates that participation in counseling and/or psychotherapy for either  
dyad member is rare during survivors ’ treatment. These exclusion criteria will not substantially limit the  
population bu t will eliminate potential confo unding of the intervention effects with extraneous influences.  
 
4.0 PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT/ENROLLMENT  
 Describe how study participants are to be recruited and enrolled i n the study with ap propriate 
contact  phone nu mbers, et c. Stratification factors, parti cipant characteristics which are 
balanced across treatment arms or used to determine intervention doses are described here.  
The randomization scheme is included here if applicable.  
 
Sample. We will recruit 298 dyads (see below fo r power ), allowing for 22%  attrition, for a final post -attrition  
sample of 232 dyads available for analysis. Based on the demographic characteristics of the AZ population,  
the sample will consi st of approximately 60% non -Hispanic white, 30% Hispanic/ Latino, 3% each African  
American  and Asian American, and 4% American Indian participants . There is an ample pool of cancer 
survivors available to meet enrollment targets. Of the estimated  35,810 newly  diagnosed cases of cancer 227 in 
AZ in 2017, the majorit y were solid tumors. Conservativ ely, we  will have easy access to about 3000 survivors 
with our existing sites, of which approximately one third  (n=1000) should satisfy the inclusion criteria. Following 
the initial recruitment contact, we anticipate about 1 0% will consent to participate, thus we can recruit 100 
dyads per year. Given this team ’s past successful  recruitment at the UACC and community sites (letters of 
support), the proposed study will easily meet the  recruitment goal of 99 dyads each year of th e 3 years of 
recruitment.  
Sample  size and  power considerations. To determine sample size, we started at the right of the  
schematic in Figure 1 (the second randomization) and moved from right to left to determine the needed  
number of consenting dyads. To po wer the comparisons on primary o utcomes f or the groups created by the  
second randomization (Aim 2), we used the effect size of Cohen ’s d=0.39 (adjusted for baseline), the smallest  
seen in the preliminary data for TIP -C against an educational intervention ( Table 1) to conservatively estim ate 
sampl e size requirements. We further adjusted this effect size for the reduction in error variance due to 10  
repeated measures of primary outcomes. In past studies, Pearson correlation coefficients between pairs of  
repea ted measures of depression, anxi ety and s ummed severity of other symptoms ranged from r=0.36 to  
0.77, resulting in the range of the adjusted effect sizes from d=0.54 to 0.84. Using the smallest adjusted  
d=0.54, the required sample size is 60 per group crea ted by the second randomization,  for powe r of .80 or  
greater in two -tailed tests at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Moving from left to right in Figure 1  (schematic) , 120 dyads from two groups created by the second 
randomization will  be non -responders to t he SMSH  alone. From past work, re sponse rate to the SMSH  on 
depression and anxiety  was approximately 30%, 228 therefore 120 non -responders will be 70% of 172 
randomized to the SMSH  alone in  the first randomization. The comparison of these 172 to 60 dyads al located 
to the TIP -C+SMSH  in the fir st randomization will have power of 0.95 to detect the effect size of 0.54 (adjusted 
for the repeated measures) in  testing the hypothesis associated with Aim 1. The tests of mediation and 
interdependence effects in Aim 3  will have an even greater power bec ause of further reduction in error 
variance. Aim 4 is exploratory, thus formal  power considerations are not applicable. In summary, the total 
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 6 
 required post -attrition sample size for all  specific aims is N=232. To account  for 22% attrition based on past 
work, we will need 298 dyads to consent.  
Recruitment and retention of participants.   
Accrual.  Recruiters have research roles and do not provide direct care at the sites. They will approach  
surviv ors during clinic visits and  explain the study. Survivors can ch oose to consent at that time or take the  
packet home to discuss with their caregivers. Recruiters will follow up during a clinic visit or by phone to further  
explain the study, answer question s, and discuss the study wit h caregivers. If the survivor or car egiver give  
verbal consent over the phone, the participant will return the signed consent forms with witnessed signature in  
a postage paid envelope. If the consent forms are not returned withi n one week, the recruiter wi ll call the  
participant to ask that the signed consent forms be mailed if they wish to participate.  
Recruiter training . The study Coordinator will conduct recruiter training that includes didactic information,  
role-playing, and r eturn demonstration of recr uiting per script. Recruiters will i ntroduce the study to survivors:  
17-week study duration, randomizations to TIP -C+SMSH  versus SMSH  alone to help manage symptoms, 12  
weekly calls and three interviews, no cost to study participati on, risks/benefits, and i ncentives.  
Subject incentives.  We will  provide gift cards for completing baseline, 13 and 17 -week  assessments.  
Incentive payments not only significantly improve recruitment rates 229, but there are no significant differences in  
key d ependent variables for t hose offered versus those not  offered an incentive. 230 Provision of incentives  
equivalent to the demands of participation is vital to successfully recruiting minorities into research and getting  
a culturally representative diverse s ample. 231-234 After ever y assessment, participants will receiv e thank you  
letters and gift cards from a large retail merchant in graduated amounts ($40 after 1 st, $50 after 2 nd and $60  
after 3 rd). The total compensation will be $150 for about 6 -10 hours of  participants ’ time over  17 weeks.  
Strategies to minimize attr ition.  1) Recruiters will emphasize the importance of participating in the entire  
intervention each week. 2) Survivors and caregivers will be asked to mark their calendars for study calls. 3) 
email or text reminders ab out upcoming telephone contacts will b e sent if agreed to by participants. 4) Weekly  
calls will maintain contact with all participants for the entire study duration. 5) Graduated compensation for  
assessments will be provided. These s trategies have worked w ell in the past. Participants will be assured of  
the confidentiality of all information and that refusing to participate will not alter their care. Survivors will  
continue to receive standard medical and nursing care and  may seek ca re from their health pro viders for any  
health problems that a rise. For dyads that refuse to participate, the recruiter will seek consent to collect their  
de-identified demographic data and ask about the reason for refusal. These data help us understand who  
declines and contribute  to external va lidity and generalizab ility of the findings.  
Community ties and cultural sensitivity.  We use experienced staff members with extensive ties to the  
local survivorship communities. The study brochures will be developed in English and in Spanish  with 
community advisors. 31,210 Seven  principles of language competence, cultural competence, ethical conduct,  
mission or purpose, empathy, graciousness and credibility 235 will be incorporated in all interactions. We will  
show cultural sensitivity along tw o dimensions. 236,237 Surface structur e involves matching messages to  
observable ‘superficial ’ characteristics of the target population (e.g., speaking English or Spanish). Deep  
structures involve incorporating some of the socio -cultural, historical, enviro nmental and psyc hological forces  
that influence health behaviors. For example, we will incorporate the value of personalismo by talking about  
participants ’ lives at the beginning of sessions. Participants from past studies have appreciated the flexibility  
and respect ( respeto) inherent in our  caregiver definition, which allowed survivors to choose the person to  
participate. 238 These techniques allow us to personalize our interactions, addressing both personal and cancer  
issues of concern. This approach is critical to gain  trust ( confianza ). 
Randomization. Following the baseline interview, dyads will be randomized to either SMSH  alone (N=172  
post-attrition) or to TIP -C+SMSH  (N=60 post -attrition). A minimization algorithm will be programmed by Dr.  
Sikorskii t o balance arms by r ecruitment location,  site of cancer, stage of cancer (early versus late), type of  
treatment, and survivor ’s relationship to the caregiver (spouse vs non -spouse). 239 The second randomization  
will occur for those who do not respond to the SMSH  alone after the  first 4 weeks using  the same approach as  
the first randomization except in 1:1 ratio. The study coordinator will run the computer algorithm from the main  
study office (Tucson) to ensure allocation, concealment, and blinding.

 Describe res earch design, methods and all study procedures    
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 7 
  
We will use two evidence -based interventions extensively tested against active and passive controls in  
traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While  overall efficacy of these interventions  has been  
established 7,15,16,29 -31, individuals differ in their responses. When an intervention does not initially work, clinical  
logic is to either extend the timeframe or prescribe a different intervention. Yet, th ese alternatives are seldom  
tested and n ot evidence -based. The proposed project advances beyond a traditional RCT of testing fixed “one 
size fits all ” interventions to the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) 32-37 design to build  
the ev idence base for intervention sequencing that accounts for heterogeneity of responses.  The first 
intervention, a printed Symptom Management and Survivorshi p Handbook  (SMSH) with strategies for self -
management of  symptoms common during chemotherapy 15,16,30 will be given to bot h survivor and caregiver 
(the dyad). SM SH strategies, if successfully enacted by the dyad, produce positive symptom responses for the 
survivor. However,  psychological distress of the survivor or the caregiver may diminish the receipt and  
enactment of the SM SH strategies and also exacerbate the sev erity of other symptoms 38 which, in turn, 
produces poor symptom  responses. 39 Research by this team 40,41 and others 42-48 has documented dyadic effects 
where survivors ’ psychosocial distress impact s that of the caregiv er and vice versa. 49 The survivor ’s and 
caregiver ’s distress  exhibit similar trajectories. Therefore, the second intervention tested in sequencing is the 
8-week telephone  interpersonal counseling intervention (TIP -C) to manage psycholo gical distress of the  
dyad. 8,50 This project will determine w hich dyads require which  intervention sequence: SMSH  alone, SMSH  
alone stepped up  with TIP -C based on demonstrated needs after giving SM SH alone 4 weeks of time, or a 
combined TIP -C+SM SH for the first 8 weeks then SMSH  alone for 4 weeks. Dyads will be initiall y randomized 
to either SMSH  alone or TIP -C+SMSH  (Figure 1). If  the survivor ’s depr ession or anxiety does not respond to 
SMSH  alone at week 4, dyads will be re -randomized to the TIPC+  SMSH  or continue with SM SH alone. 
Outcome data will be  collected at baseline, weeks 13 (post -intervention) and 17  (follow -up). Brief assessments 
during weeks 1-12 will track  any change in the dyad ’s symptoms, intervention receipt,  enactment and fidelity. 
Assessmen ts and interventions are  telephone -delivered in English or Spanish bas ed on participant preference, 
as done in past studies. 8,50,51  
 
Design . We selected the SMART design (F igure 1) for this study over alternative designs (e.g.,  
implementation designs) beca use the SMART design allows a precision or personalized approach to  
determine the right treatment at the right dose with the right sequence for the right survivor -caregiver  dyad.  
SMART designs, although newer, show promise in developing the sequences of ev idence -based interventions  
for more efficient and individualized patie nt- and caregiver -centered care. We will use findings from this study  
to create an algorithm for clini cally meaningful decision making about symptom management for survivors and  
their ca regivers to be tested in future implementation/dissemination studies. We w ill recruit 298 cancer  
survivors undergoing chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or hormonal therapy fo r a solid tumor at the NCI  
designated  University of Arizona Comprehensive Cancer Cen ter (UACC, Tucson and Phoenix locations) and  
at Arizona community onco logy settings. The survivors will be screened for moderate or severe depression  
and/or anxiety prior to enrollment and identify the informal caregivers who will participate in the study.  
Following enrollment, informed consent and baseline interview of both  survivor and caregiver, the dyad will be  
randomly assigned to either: 1) SMSH  alone or 2) TIP -C+SMSH  for 8 weeks followed by continued SMSH  
alone for  
4 weeks. During 12 weeks following initial randomization, all participants will receive weekly telephone con tacts 
to assess symptoms, deliver the assigned intervention and assess its enact ment and fidelity. After the initial 4  
weeks in the SMSH  alone group, the survivor ’s response to the in tervention will be determined. If the survivor  
responds (defined as a redu ced score on depression and/or anxiety) (See C9a. Primary Outcomes), the dyad  
will continue with the SMSH  alone for 8 more weeks. If the survivor is a non -responder (defined as no  
improvement or a worsening score for depression and/or anxiety), the dyad wil l be re-randomized to either  
continue with SMSH  alone for 8 more weeks, or add 8 weeks of TIP -C. The rationale for using the survivor ’s 
response as the criterion for re -randomizatio n is from the extensive evidence of interdependence in survivor  
and caregive r outcomes presented, and on the caregiver ’s focus on the survivor ’s outcomes. T he rationale for  
timing of the assessment of response and re -randomization to add the TIP -C interven tion after 4 weeks is  
based on past testing of the SMSH ,15,16,30 where median  time to response on psychological distress ranged 
from 14 to 24 days. Post -intervention and follow -up telephone assessments are at weeks 13 and 17.

 Analytic Methods  
Data manage ment.  All data will be entered into the secure web -based database. Quarterly quality  
assurance checks of the da ta will be performed by the RA supervised by Dr. Sikorskii. De -identified data will  
be transferred into SAS 9.4 for analyses. The distributions o f outcomes and potential covariates will be  
assess ed, outliers will be invest igated by inspecting the residuals , and models described below will be fit with  
and without outliers to examine their influence on the results.  
Attrition Analyses and Handling of Missing Data.  We will compare dyadic characteristi cs of those who  
completed t he study to those who did not within  their designated group to inform the generalizability of findings.  
Attrition will also be compared between each pair of randomized groups. The  regression techniques described  
below allow for m issing at random (MAR) mech anism. 264 If patterns of missing dat a indicate potential not  
missing at random (NMAR) mechanisms, then models describing missing mechanisms will be considered  
(e.g., pattern -mixtu re models), 265,266 and sensitivity analyses will i nvestigate the robustness o f the results.  
Primary Analysis.  Prima ry analyses will follow the intent to treat approach.  
Aim 1, Hypothesis 1: Dyads initially randomized to the TIP -C+SMSH  will report lower dep ression, anxiety, 
and 
summed severity of other symp toms at weeks 1 -12, 13, and  17, and lower unscheduled health servi ces use,  
higher self -efficacy and social support, and lower caregiver burden at weeks 13 and 17 as compared to those  
initially randomized t o the SMSH  alone. This hypothesis will be tested usi ng statistical model #1 tha t relates  
repeated measures of the surv ivor or caregiver outcome y (one at a time) to the group assignment variable 
𝑥𝑥1, outcome at baseline 𝑥𝑥2, time entered as a class var iable to model potentially non -linear patterns, and 
other  covariates. For norma lly distributed outcomes, this model wi ll be fit as a linear mixed effects model 
(LME).  Generalized linear mixed eff ects (GLME) modeling will be used if outcome is not normally distributed 
and cannot be normalized using transformations. For health service use, statistical model #1 will be 
imple mented  as a GLME model with Poisson distributed errors, or as a zero -inflated  Poisson or negative 
Binomial model  based on the distribution  of the counts of different health services uses. Each type of health 
services use (e.g.,  hospitalizations, ED visits) will be analyzed separately. The explanatory variables including 
study group  will be  evaluated as predictors of ze ro inflation (whether o r not the count is zero), and also as 
predictors of the  magnitude of the count when it is not zero. The main effects of the group variable 𝑥𝑥1will be 
tested.  
Aim 2, Hypothesis 2: Dyads where su rvivors do not respond to the SMSH  alone  during weeks 1 -4 and have  
TIP-C added during weeks 5 -12, will report lower depression, anxiety, and summed severity of other symptoms  
at weeks 5 -12, 13, and 17 , and lower unscheduled health services use, higher self -efficacy and social support,  
and lower caregiver burden at weeks 13 and 17 as compared to those who are re -randomized to continue with  
the SMSH  alone. The strategy described under the analyses for Ai m 1 will be implemented for the repeated  
outcome measures during weeks 5 -12 and weeks 13 and 17 th at will be related to group assignment from the  
second randomization, symptom severity during week 4, time, and covariates.  
Mediation analyses for Aims 1 and 2. To test for mediation, the study group will be treated as the  
independent variable, and each of the potential mediators (one at a time) will be tested for their effect on the  
symptom outcome variable at weeks 13 and 17, with the baseline measure of that  respective symptom  
outcome variable treated as a covariat e. Caregiver burden will be tested only a t the individual level, but social  
support and self -efficacy will be tested at the individual and dyadic levels. We will use a bias corrected  
bootstrapping a nalytic strategy 267,268 based on 5000 bootstrap samples to  estimate confidence intervals around  
the indirect effect of study group on the outcome variable, through the mediator. To establish mediation, the  
95% confidence interval around the indirect effect  must not include 0.  
Aim 3 examines the dyadic interdepend ence in outcomes between survivors and car egivers. This  
interdependence will be modeled and tested with the actor -partner interdependence mediation model  
(APIMem) 269 in structural equation modeling.  The APIMem estimates three classes of effects: actor effe cts 
(e.g., person A independent variable ( IV)→person A dependent variable (DV)), caregiver (partner) effects (e.g.,  
person A IV →person B DV), and mediation effects (e.g., person A IV → person B Media tor→ person A DV) in  
an omnibus mode l. These models will s pecify correlations between the survivors ’ and caregivers ’ IVs as well  
as covariances between the error terms of the mediators and outcome variables, recognizing that these  
residuals will covary bet ween dyad members due to unmeasured common causes. We will  fit both a saturated  
version of the model in which all actor, partner, and mediation effects are free to vary and compare that with a  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 9 
 constrained model in which the effects for one dyad member are constrained equal to the correspondi ng 
effects of the othe r dyad member. The χ2 difference test will determine whether the more parsimonious  
constrained model or the unconstrained model will be interpreted. This test will also indicate whether the effect  
for survivors is significantly differ ent from that of careg ivers. These models  will test whether baseline to week  
17 changes in survivors ’ outcomes of depression, anxiety and summed severity of other symptoms are  
mediated by the intervening (week 13) state or caregivers ’ outcomes or potential covariates.  
Explorato ry Aim 4. The dyadi c characteristics of responders will be compared to those of non -responders  
using t -tests, chi -square or Fisher ’s exact tests. Character istics found to differ, along with mediators and other  
covariates listed in section C9d will be furth er considered as po tential future tailoring variables. The decision  
rule (𝑑𝑑1, 𝑑𝑑2) specifying the first and second intervention to achieve optimal out come will be using the 
Qlearning  optimization method 258,270 -272 implemented in SAS PROC QLEARN. 273 27 4 The Q -learning al gorithm  
proceeds backwards from the last decision to the first. Two Q -functions will be considered. The function  
𝑄𝑄2(𝐻𝐻2) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌2|𝐻𝐻2] is the expectation of the second stage outcome 𝑌𝑌2 given history after 2 stages, 
denoted by 𝐻𝐻2: dyadic ch aracteristics, outcomes observed during weeks 1 -12, 13 and 17, and interventions 
received. The  function 𝑄𝑄1(𝐻𝐻1) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌1 + max 𝑄𝑄2(𝐻𝐻2)] uses history through the first intervention stage 
𝐻𝐻1. The conditional  expectations i n the Q -functions w ill be estimated from regression analyses for the primary 
outcomes, and the  optimal decision rules will be found using backward induction by maximizing these 
functions. 275,276 The product  of this analysis will be identification of tailor ing variab les to op erationalize the 
decision rules of selecting the  optimal first intervention and switching from SMSH  alone to TIP -C+SMSH . 
These personalized decision rules can  then undergo testing in a future confirmatory RCT.  
 
6.0  MEASURES/DAT A COLLECTIO N INSTRUMENTS

Include complete copies  of all fo rms, interview g uides, survey questionnaires,  in Appendi x I.  
 
Measures  
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement I nformation Syste m (PROMIS) 249 measures are suitable for both  
survivors and caregivers, have be en developed using sophisticated measurement techniques, tested with over  
21,000 individuals, calibrated to produce T -scores based on the general population, and  are available i n either 
English or Spanish. The available short forms have evidence of good re liability and validity. 249 Our other  
measures also have good reliability ( α > .80) 41,84,178,205 and validity, have been translated 240 and tested with  
Spanish sp eaking participa nts in our pilot studies. 31  
Primary outcomes.  
Caregiv ers’ and survivors ’ symptoms  will be measured using the adapted General Symptom Distress Scale  
(GSDS), 124,250 a brief instrument that allows for a quick assess ment of symptoms, w hich is especially impor tant 
during weekly calls. It evaluates 15 symptoms: sho rtness of breath, nausea, vomiting, pain, sleep difficulties,  
bowel problems, numbness or tingling, skin rashes or sores, swelling in hands and feet, difficul ty concentrating,  
poor appetite, cough, dep ression, anxiety, fatigue. Respondents indicate presenc e of each symptom (yes/no)  
and rate their severity on the scale from 1 to 10. The ability to manage symptoms is also assessed on a scale  
from 1=cannot manage to 10=can manage ex tremely well. The GSDS h as good test -retest and internal  
consistency reliabilit y and predictive and construct validity in both English and Spanish. 250 The 0 -10 ratings of  
depression and anxiety and the summed severity of other 13 symptom s will be derived a t each weekly contact,  
baseline, 13, and 17 week interviews.  
Survivors ’ symptom response on depression and/or anxiety during weeks 1 -4 as a criterion for 
rerandomization.  Response will be assessed using the depression and anxiety items o f the GSDS 
administ ered during weekly calls  to survivors. Based on the inclusion criteria and estab lished and validated 
symptom cut points , 224 survivors will enter with moderate or severe depression and/or anxiety (one symptom 
or both) . The  cut-points ar e anchored in how m uch symptoms are distres sing the participant by interfering with 
enjoyment of  life, social relationships, and general daily activities. Participants indicate the severity/distress 
from 1 to 10. For  depression, the mild category correspon ds to a severity sc ore of 1, the moderate c ategory 
corresponds to  scores 2 -3, and scores of 4 -10 fal l into the severe category. For anxiety, the mild category is 
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 10 
 severity of 1 -3, the moderate category corresponds to scores 4 -5, and the severe category is 6 -10. Survivors 
who start at  severe or moder ate on depression and/or anxiety symptoms at intake and end at a lower category 
by the week  4 observation will be called responders to t he intervention .228 If a symptom was mild at intake, 
symptom  response would n ot be applicable. B ecause responders demons trate substantial improvement 
anchored to  symptom distress after 4 weeks, responders will continue with the SMSH  only intervention for 
another 8 weeks.  Non-responders to the intervention are survivors who do not re spond on either or both 
symptoms. 224,251,2 52 Non-responding survivors and their caregivers will be re -randomized to either continue with 
the SMSH  alone for  8 weeks to give it addit ional time or add TIP -C for 8 weeks to rigorously test the value 
added by the  more  intensive int ervention in Aim 2. To tal intervention time is 12 weeks.  
Caregivers ’ and survivors ’ depression and anxiety . PROMIS -short forms 8: depression  and anxiety 253-256 will be 
administered at baseline, 13 and 17 week telephone interviews to prov ide greater detail and precision in the  
measurement of these outcomes, as compared to single GSDS items administered in weekly calls. We chose  
8-item short forms to minimize respond ent burden while maintaining measurement precision.  
Secondary outcomes.  Secondary outcomes are  caregivers ’ and survi vors’ hospitalizations, urgent care or  
ED visits during the study. In baseline, week 13 and 17 interviews over the telephone, each dyad member  will 
be asked to recall ED visits and admissions to hospitals and, if th ey occurred, their reasons and duration.  
Recall period will be 3 months in baseline and week 13, and 1 month in week 17 interviews. Extensive  
previous research 2-5 documents self -repor t is a reliable and valid method to collect health services use data  
espe cially when standar dized methods are used  and the recall period is short, as in this project. Self -report is  
the only reasonable and cost -effective way to assess healthcare use, as it  would be impossible to access  
health (medical) records across the multip le systems and paye rs used by participant s in this study.  
Potential mediators . 
Caregivers ’ and survivors ’ self-efficacy.  PROMIS 4-item short forms  (sf) will be administered in interview s.253-256 
Self-efficacy specific to symptom management will be captured  by the GSDS item d escribed above.  
Careg ivers ’ and survivors ’ social support . PROMIS 4-item-sf for emotional support and PROMIS Informational 
Support 4a will be  used in interviews. 253-256 
Caregiver Reaction Assessment Tool. 257 This caregiver burden tool was developed and val idated with  
caregiv ers of patients wi th chronic conditions. It has 5 subscales: impact on schedule, caregiver ’s esteem,  
family support, impact on health, and impact on finances, with Cronbach ’s alphas exceeding 0.70.  
Potential Covariates and Future Tailori ng Variables.  These  variables will be  assessed during baseline 
interviews of survivors and caregivers. Demographic  characteristics include caregivers ’ and survivors ’ age, 
education, work, ethnicity, race, acculturation, marital  status, relationship between  survivor and the c aregiver, 
and livi ng arrangement. Comorbidity will be measured  with the Bayliss tool that queries the presence of 20 
comorbidities, 258 and we will also collect height and  weight to calculate BMI. The validity and reliability of self -
reported height an d wei ght are adequate 259-261, and  health risk estimates associated with BMI values are 
virtually the same, whether based on self -report or  measured BMI values. 262 Caregiver ’s activities of survivor 
care will be measured using a checklist 19, and quality  of relationship will be me asured using a 6 -item index 
designed to assess the relationship quality. The index  has established reliability with samples of married 
couples 263 and has also been used to capture survivors ’ perceptions of the quality o f relationship with  their 
friend/fami ly caregiver. Preferred language of intervention  delivery will be tracked. Receipt and enactment of 
intervention strategies are measured during weeks 1 -12. Receipt will be measured by the num ber of completed 
weekly sess ions. Enactment of the SMSH  strategie s is assessed at the beginning of calls during weeks 2 -12 
as described in section C8c. Enactment of the TIP -C will  be measured by tracking the implementation of 
behaviors discussed and complet ion of the assigned  homework  as documented in c ounselor ’s field notes for 
each session. Assessment of survivors ’ radiation,  surgery, chemotherapy, targeted or hormonal therapy (dose, 
type, dates received), cancer site and stage, and  medications (e.g., supp ortive agents for symptoms) will be 
collected f rom health record  data corresponding  with the time -on-study. Every effort has been made to keep 
respondent burden to a minimum and to distribute  any burden over the course of the study. If needed, we can 
divide the assessments into two s essions over two  days. Yet, few part icipants requested such  
accommodations in past studies.  
 
 
7.0 DETAI LED DESCRIPTION OF INTERVE NTION  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 11 
 Describe in detail for intervention studies or indicate otherwise by checking below:  
 
Interventions. We deliver interventions via the telep hone (see section  C2e for rationale) at convenient  times 
for both the survivor and c aregiver, including evenings and weekends.  
Symptom Management and Survivorship Handbook  (SMSM). is an evidence -based self -care management 
guide specific to each  symptom. 84-87 Each module is  presented in an identical format (frequently asked 
question s): what the symptom  is, how people describe the symptom, the causes of the symptom including 
medications, and a set of  
strategies presented in bullet points for managing the symptom. For each sym ptom, there are indications as to  
when and for what reasons to contact the oncology pract ice; other resources for management are listed. The  
previously tested English version will be translated into Spanish using an adaptation of Brislin ’s 
translation/back  translation process 240 used by this team in the past. Profe ssor Jaime Fatás -Cabeza, Director  
of the Undergraduate Translation and Interpretation Program at the University of Arizona, will oversee the  
translation. Cultural experts will perform back transla tions of a random sample  of pages from the SMSH  for 
compariso n to the original English language versions, and all discrepancies corrected between the back  
translated and original English language pages. Finally, a focus group of six Spanish -speaking Latino s will 
discuss the transl ation in terms of understandability (language level and complexity), use of idioms, and  
consistency of meaning. Focus group data will be used to finalize the SMSH  translation and layout (i.e. 
design).  
Survivors and caregivers will be m ailed the Handb ook in the participant ’s preferred language following the  
baseline interviews. During each week, staff will call the survivors and then their caregivers. The call will begin  
with the assessment of  symptoms using the General Symptom Distr ess S cale (GSDS, described in measures).  
For each symptom rated  at 4 or higher on a 0 -10 scale of severity, the survivors will be referred to the SMSH  
for 
symptom self -management. The threshold of 4 was selected base d on the NCCN guidelines for symptom  
monitorin g and management 83 and used successfully in past work. 75,76,81,82,89 During weeks 2 -12, the survivor ’s 
calls will begin with assessing SMSH  use since the last call (intervention enactment), followed by the  
admin istration of the GSDS and referral to t he SMSH . During weekly calls to caregivers, symptoms will also be  
assessed using GSDS. The caregivers will be notified of any current symptoms above threshold experienced  
by survivors and directed to the SMSH  to assist the survivors in intervention enactme nt. Shari ng symptom  
information between survivor and caregiver will  be part of the informed consent. During weeks 2 -12, the  
caregiver ’s calls will begin with assessing SMSH  use for the management of survivors ’ symptoms, followed by  
the GSDS, summary of sur vivors ’ symptoms and referral to the SMSH . Calls will last about 10 m inutes.  
 
 
Telephone Interpersonal Counseling Intervention (TIP -C). Social work counselors with a master ’s 
degree and beh avioral health and oncology expertise will deliver the 8 -week TIP -C intervent ion (Table 2).  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 12 
 During weekly contacts, the counselors targe t social support behaviors using interpersonal communications  
techniques. Interpersonal communication facilitates proces sing stressful affective reactions to a cancer  
diagnosis and treat ment, marsh alling instrumental support for assistance with roles and f unctions,  
informational support for advice and information, and appraisal support for gauging and adjusting to the  
stres sor. Counselors can personalize the counseling intervention for th e specific needs or interests as  
expressed during sessions while still  adhering to a structured protocol. For example, one survivor may need to  
focus on depression and family issues (e.g., r ole transitions such as job loss) rather than on anxiety and  
resou rce issues (e.g., transportation, lack of insurance) . This approach is  consistent with survivorship care  
recommendations 241 and recent evidence showing that improved psychological well -being  occurs when an  
intervention addresses practical resource needs. 242 
 Each sur vivor and caregiver receiving the TIP -C+SMSH  intervention wi ll receive one 40 -minute  
telephone call per week for 8 weeks (8 sessions). The first 10 minutes of the call will follow th e SMSH  only 
intervention procedures (see C8c). The next 30 minu tes will be d evoted to the delivery of TIP -C. The TIP -C 
sessions will in corporate the symptoms assessment performed at the beginning of the call as follows:  
discussion of depression, anxiety and  stress per protocol and referral to the SMSH  for symptoms. Th e final 4  
week s will be SMSH  only. The TIP -C intervention protocol is the same for both survivor and caregiver, the 
same  counselor will be assigned to both members of the dyad and sessions conduct ed in either Spanish or 
English.  
Counselors call the survivo r and caregiver  at separate convenient times to ensure they have adequate time 
and privacy to participate. Numerous interventions for ca ncer survivorship use individually delivered methods  
243-245 as we will use in this study. Dyadic delivery (i.e., both p resent at the s ame time) is not required and  
separate delivery resolves tw o major obstacles associated with delivering TIP -C to both mem bers 
simultaneously. 1) Participants may be unwilling to discuss certain issues when the other dyad member is  
present su ch as discussin g concerns that they have about each other. In such cases, the counselor can be an  
effective bridge between the two. Othe r times, participants may wish to discuss personal concerns (e.g.,  
survivor dying). 2) Scheduling and technological diff iculties multip ly when both members must speak on the  
phone with a third p arty at the same time.  
Training and intervention fidelity.  Intervention protocol fidelity will be assured using established methods  
outlined by the NIH Treatment Fidelity Workgroup o n consistency i n dose, providers, delivery, and receipt of  
the interventio n.246 TIP-C interveners will receive 24 hours of education, augm ented by additional books and  
articles, about cancer diagnosis and treatment, psychological distress, and interpersona l counseling  
techniques with training protocols from previous studies. 41,205,209,247 Counselors will listen to 8 -10 hours of  
counseling se ssions recorded for training purposes. Drs. Badger and Segrin will conduct training that will  
continue until the couns elor is rated a s achieving > 90% on protocol implementation. Annual re -training occurs  
throughout the study . 
The intervention fidelity prot ocols used in past studies will be used in this study. All sessions will be  digitally 
recorded and about 10% randomly  reviewed throu ghout the study to maintain quality, with written and  
verbal feedback given to the counselors. Drs. Badger and Segrin will s upervise the intervention quality control  
activities. Through weekly case supervision, we will maintain fidelity of t he intervention  and counselor  
adherence to protocols. We will evaluate ad herence (number required elements discussed/ total number of  
eleme nts). 142,153,206 Drs. Badger and Segrin will listen to all sessions in English from the first 5 dyads (40 hours  
of su pervision) and then randomly review 10% of sessions throughout the study.  A bilingual counselor will  
review sessions in Spanish using estab lished protocols as in past studies. No one with less than 90%  
adherence will receive new cases until retraining has occurred, and D rs. Badger or Segrin will assume  
responsibility for those existing cases. Following retraining, 5 dyads will be monitored to  ensure  that >90%  
adherence is achieved and then we will return to randomly selected monitoring for quality control. Anyone  
unable t o adhere to the standardized protocols after a second retr aining will be replaced.  
Intervention reproducibility.  Interventions  must be standardized , yet the complexities of symptom distress  
demand a flexible approach to preserve the relevanc e of TIP -C for the individual. We will determine the  
amount of elements p ersonalized to the specific needs of the individual within the struc tured protocol (number  
of personalized elements/ total number of elements). We will then examine the effect of pers onalization (e. g., 
more discussion of socioeconomic needs with one partic ipant vs. another), if any, on outcomes. Counselors  
will keep detailed field notes after each session assessing intervention length, rapport, responsiveness, topics  
discussed, homewor k completed and  satisfaction. Our past adherence rate of >85% far exceeds  the rate

 reported for community mental health patients who return for face -to-face appointments. 248 Participants who  
miss sessions (occurrence is rare) will be rescheduled, as we wil l obtain multip le points of contact (e.g., home,  
cell, work telephone, e -mail address). If we fail to contact within the week, we will schedule the following week.  
We will also send an e -mail, text, or letter asking the participant to call us. Attrition ra tes and reasons  will be 
documented, including being unable to reach the s urvivor or the caregiver or expressed desire to discontinue.  
 
 
 
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Analysis Plan for answering objectives including  endpoint definitio ns, patient accrual 
objec tives, and  estima ted duration of study. This s ection should b e developed in consultation 
with appropriat e biostatistician.  
  
Potential Covariates and Future Tailori ng Variables.  These variables will be assessed during baseline 
interviews of survivors and caregivers.  Demographic  characteristics include caregivers ’ and survivors ’ age, 
education, work, ethnicity, race, acculturation, marital  status, relationship between  survivor and the caregiver, 
and living arrangement. Comorbidity will be measured  with the Bayliss too l that queries the presence of 20 
comorbidities, 258 and we will also collect height and  weight to calculate BMI. The validity and reliability of self -
reported height an d weight are adequate 259-261, and  health risk estimates associated with B MI values are 
virtually the same, whether based on self -report or  measured BMI values. 262 Caregiver ’s activities of survivor 
care will be measured using a checklist 19, and quality  of relationship will be measured using a 6 -item index 
designed to assess the  relationship q uality. The index  has established reliability with samples of married 
couples 263 and has also been used to capture survivors ’ perceptions of the quality o f relationship with their 
friend/family caregiver. Preferred language of intervention  delivery will be  tracked. Receipt and enactment of 
intervention strategies are measured during weeks 1 -12. Receipt will be measured by the num ber of completed 
weekly sess ions. Enactment of the SMS H strategies is  assessed at the beginning of calls during wee ks 2-12 
as descr ibed in section C8c. Enactment of the TIP -C will  be measured by tracking the implementation of 
behaviors discussed and complet ion of the assigned  homework  as documented in counselor ’s field notes for 
each session. Assessment of survivors ’ radiation,  surger y, chemotherapy, targeted or hormonal therapy (dose, 
type, dates received), cancer site and stage, and  medications (e.g., supp ortive agents for symptoms) will be 
collected from health record data corresponding  with the time -on-study. Every effort has been made to keep 
respondent burden to a minimum and to distribute  any burden over the course of the study. If needed, we can 
divide the assessments into two s essions over two  days. Yet, few participants requested such  
accommodations in past stu dies.  
 
Scientifi c Rigor a nd Transparency . The scientific rigor of this study is ensured by the randomized  design, 
complete inclusion/exclusion criteria defining the population to which findings would be generalizable,  
reproducible manualized protocol for t he interventions , trackin g of intervention fidelity, dose, receipt and  
enactment, use of measures with solid evidence of reliability and validity, blinding of data collectors,  
transparent assessment and statistical analysis plans including attention to bia ses and the miss ing data.  
 
Sex as a biological variable. We will consider survivors ’ and caregivers ’ sex as covariates in all  analyses. 
Past research indicates that the survivor -caregiver relationship (spouse/partner versus other) is a  
key factor that may influence outcom es62,165 for the dyad over and above sex. Relationship will be controlled in  
randomization and considered along with sex as a covariate and potential future tailoring variable.  
 
Analytic Methods  
Data management.  All data will be entered int o the secure web -based database. Quarterly quality  
assurance checks of the da ta will be performed by the RA supervised by Dr. Sikorskii. De -identified data will  
be transferred into SAS 9.4 for analyses. The distributions of outcomes and potential covariate s will be  
assess ed, outliers will be investigated by inspecting the residuals , and models described below will be fit with  
and without outliers to examine their influence on the results.  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 14 
 Attrition Analyses and Handling of Missing Data.  We will compare dyad ic characteristi cs of those who  
completed the study to those who did not within  their designated group to inform the generalizability of findings.  
Attrition will also be compared between each pair of randomized groups. The regression techniques described  
below allow for m issing at random (MAR) mechanism. 264 If patterns of missing dat a indicate potential not  
missing at random (NMAR) mechanisms, then models describing missing mechanisms will be considered  
(e.g., pattern -mixture models), 265,266 and sensitivity  analyses will i nvestigate the robustness of the results.  
Primary Analysis.  Prima ry analyses will follow the intent to treat approach.  
Aim 1, Hypothesis 1: Dyads initially randomized to the TIP -C+SMSH  will report lower depression, anxiety, 
and 
summed sever ity of other symp toms at weeks 1 -12, 13, and 17, and lower unscheduled health servi ces use,  
higher self -efficacy and social support, and lower caregiver burden at weeks 13 and 17 as compared to those  
initially randomized to the SMSH  alone. This hypothesis will be tested usi ng statistical model #1 that relates  
repeated measures of the surv ivor or caregiver outcome y (one at a time) to the group assignment variable 
𝑥𝑥1, outcome at baseline 𝑥𝑥2, time entered as a class variable to model potentially non -linear patterns, and 
other  covariates. For normally distributed outcomes, this model wi ll be fit as a linear mixed effects model 
(LME).  Generalized linear mixed eff ects (GLME) modeling will be used if outcome is not normally distributed 
and cannot be normalized using transformations. For health service use, statistical model #1 will be 
imple mented  as a GLME model with Poisson distributed errors, or as a zero -inflated  Poisson or negative 
Binomial model  based on the distribution of the counts of different health services uses. Each type of health 
services use (e.g.,  hospitalizations, ED visits) will be analyzed separately. The explanatory variables including 
study group  will be  evaluated as predictors of ze ro inflation (whether or not the count is zero), and also as 
predictors of the  magnitude of the count when it is not zero. The main effects of the group variable 𝑥𝑥1will be 
tested.  
Aim 2, Hypothesis 2: Dyads where su rvivors do not respond to the SMSH  alone  during weeks 1 -4 and have  
TIP-C added during weeks 5 -12, will report lower depression, anxiety, and summed severity of other symptoms  
at weeks 5 -12, 13, and 17, and lower unscheduled health services use, higher self -efficacy and social support,  
and lower caregiver burden at weeks 13 and 17 as compared to those who are re -randomized to continue with  
the SMSH  alone. The strategy described under the analyses for Aim 1 will be implemented for the repeated  
outcome measure s during weeks 5 -12 and weeks 13 and 17 th at will be related to group assignment from the  
second randomization, symptom severity during week 4, time, and covariates.  
Mediation analyses for Aims 1 and 2. To test for mediation, the study group will be treate d as the  
independent variable, and each of the potential mediators (one at a time) will be tested for their effect on the  
symptom outcome variable at weeks 13 and 17, with the baseline measure of that respective symptom  
outcome variable treated as a covari ate. Caregiver burden will be tested only a t the individual level, but social  
support and self -efficacy will be tested at the individual and dyadic levels. We will use a bias corrected  
bootstrapping analytic strategy 267,268 based on 5000 bootstrap samples to estimate confidence intervals around  
the indirect effect of study group on the outcome variable, through the mediator. To establish mediation, the  
95% confidence interval around the indirect effect must not include 0.  
Aim 3 examines the dyadic interdepe ndence in outcomes between survivors and car egivers. This  
interdependence will be modeled and tested with the actor -partner interdependence mediation model  
(APIMem) 269 in structural equation modeling. The APIMem estimates three classes of effects: actor ef fects 
(e.g., person A independent variable ( IV)→person A dependent variable (DV)), caregiver (partner) effects (e.g.,  
person A IV →person B DV), and mediation effects (e.g., person A IV → person B Mediator → person A DV) in  
an omnibus mode l. These models will  specify correlations between the survivors ’ and caregivers ’ IVs as well  
as covariances between the error terms of the mediators and outcome variables, recognizing that these  
residuals will covary between dyad members due to unmeasured common causes. We wi ll fit both a saturated  
version of the model in which all actor, partner, and mediation effects are free to vary and compare that with a  
constrained model in which the effects for one dyad member are constrained equal to the correspondi ng 
effects of the ot her dyad member. The χ2 difference test will determine whether the more parsimonious  
constrained model or the unconstrained model will be interpreted. This test will also indicate whether the effect  
for survivors is significantly differ ent from that of car egivers. These models will test whether baseline to week  
17 changes in survivors ’ outcomes of depression, anxiety and summed severity of other symptoms are  
mediated by the intervening (week 13) state or caregivers ’ outcomes or potential covariates.  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 15 
 Explora tory Aim 4. The dyadic characteristics of responders will be compared to those of non -responders  
using t -tests, chi -square or Fisher ’s exact tests. Character istics found to differ, along with mediators and other  
covariates listed in section C9d will be fur ther considered as potential future tailoring variables. The decision  
rule (𝑑𝑑1, 𝑑𝑑2) specifying the first and second intervention to achieve optimal out come will be using the 
Qlearning  optimization method 258,270 -272 implemented in SAS PROC QLEARN. 273 274 The Q -learning algorithm  
proceeds backwards from the last decision to the first. Two Q -functions will be considered. The function  
𝑄𝑄2(𝐻𝐻2) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌2|𝐻𝐻2] is the expectation of the second stage outcome 𝑌𝑌2 given history after 2 stages, 
denote d by 𝐻𝐻2: dyadic characteristics, outcomes observed during weeks 1 -12, 13 and 17, and interventions 
received. The  function 𝑄𝑄1(𝐻𝐻1) = 𝐸𝐸[𝑌𝑌1 + max 𝑄𝑄2(𝐻𝐻2)] uses history through the first intervention stage 
𝐻𝐻1. The conditional  expectations  in the Q -functions will be estimated from regression analyses for the primary 
outcomes, and the  optimal decision rules will be found using backward induction by maximizing these 
functions. 275,276 The product  of this analysis will be identification of tail oring variab les to operationalize the 
decision rules of selecting the  optimal first intervention and switching from SMSH  alone to TIP -C+SMSH . 
These personalized decision rules can  then undergo testing in a future confirmatory RCT.  
 
Potential Difficulties/L imitations and Alternative Approaches  
Potential problems from recruitment and retention will be minimized by the  
use our previous methods yielding high retention rates with no differential attrition between conditions.  
Potential problems in interventio n delivery will be minimized by implementing protocols to maintain intervention  
fidelity. There are no high -risk aspects of this trial, and all procedures are non -invasive. We recognize that in  
addressing depression and anxiet y our efforts might inadverten tly produce detrimental psychological  
responses. Should this occur , our experienced interventionists will refer the survivor and/or caregiver to mental  
health services. Because randomizations may not account for all possible e rror sources, we will adjust fo r 
baseline values of outcomes in the analysis to provide added control over possible confounding preintervention  
influences. Three primary outcomes (depression, anxiety, and summed severity of other  symptoms) and all 
hypothes es are stated a priori. In the exploratory analyses, the Benjamini -Hochberg or  Hochberg 
adjustment 277-279 will be used to control the false discovery rate.

10.0 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
 Describe p lans to monitor adherence to s tudy protocol, integrity of data collection and 
intervention d elivery.  Include a ny plans regarding project  quality assurance.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan . This behavioral intervention study meets the definition of a clin ical 
trial. Data and Safety Mo nitoring will be accomplished through multiple approaches:  
Institutio nal Review Board (IRB) - All procedures related to data collecti on and safety will be approved 
by the University of Arizona (UA) Health Sciences Center IRB a nd by the independent Arizona Cance r 
Center  Office of Clinical Trials. Processes will be establishe d to guide collection, transfer and storage of 
data and  training  of staff to ensure data safety. Quality assurance (QA) reviews of data and staff will be 
performed as  described below.  
 
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 17 
 1. Secu rity Procedures for Collection, Transfer and Storage of Electron ic Data. Electronic files will 
consist  of enrollment data, surve y data at two time points, symptom data collected during the weekly 
calls,  interventionist ca ll data for survivors allocate d to TIP-C + SMS H and survivor’s medical record 
data (collected at en rollment and during medical record audit after survivors complet e their 13 week  
interviews). First, enrollment data with identifiers will be stored separatel y from the study data. Second,  
all compu ters that will store data at the central location will be p assword protected. The system will  
have a secure login along wit h audit control mechanisms to meet the HIPAA guidelines. Third, servers  
will utilize state -of-the art security processes. E lectronic copies of forms, such as the consent or HIPAA  
authorization  form will be stored on a secure dedicated server with appropria te firewalls. The system  
will use encryption (SSL certificate) to transfer data between the m achines. This technology is th e sam e 
as that used for online e -commerce applications to protect con sumer information. Servers are scanned  
for viruses and systems a re in-place to detect attempts at unauthorized entry. All transactions to the  
database are st ored in archive logs as re -do data and a re accessible to enable quick recovery of all  
data should t he need arise. Backup files are written nightly to back up serve rs. 
 
2. Security Procedures for Collection, Transfer and Storage of Paper Data. Paper files w ill consist of  
consent and aut horiz ation forms and medical record audits. Paper copies of all forms  will be faxed to  
the central study office for data entry. Faxed  copies of medical records will be retained in locked  
storage cabinets at UA accessible only to study personnel.  
 
3. Traini ng of  Staff.   
Recruiters - will follow UA institutional processes for en rollment of patients to clinical  trial(s). Training by 
the study  Coordinator will occur in order to ensure recruiters understand eligibility  criteria, study design 
and goals. Training w ill emp hasize strategies to maximize enrollment and  retention of minori ty 
participants. Additionally, training will occur to assure rec ruiters understand the  function and importance 
of data gathered during the medical record aud it at enrollment. Training w ill include co mpletion of 
simulated cases. Booster training sessions wi ll be scheduled as needed.  
Interviewers/Data Collectors - will b e carefully instructed and trained in appropriate interviewing  
techniques and will receive re gular monitoring by the stud y Coord inator to ensure the ethics of research  
and scientific integrity  and protection of confidentiality. Participants are asked prior  to each interview if  
they want to continue and are given a toll-free number to contact UA if  they have questions or  
conc erns.  
Interventionist s- TIP-C interventionists will receive 24 hours of  education, augmented by additional  
books and articles, about ca ncer diagnosis and treatment, psychological distress, and interpersonal  
counseling techniques  with training protocols dev eloped  in previous studies (Appendix C). The  
interventionists will list en to 8 -10 hours of counseling sessions recorded for training pu rposes. Drs.  
Badger and Segrin will conduct interventionist training that will continue until  the interventionists are  
rated as  achieving > 90% on protocol implementation. Annual re -training w ill occur throughout the  
study . 
Medical Record Auditors  – will b e the recruiters or are employees of each recruitment site with  
oncology experience but train ed by the study Coordinator on col lection of data for this study.  
Training will target job descript ions, and roles and responsibilities of group members and will c onsist of  
1) an overview of project objectives, theoretical framework, and research design an d rationale, 2)  
background a nd tra ining on collecting data free from bias, 3) information on scale and item response  
issues; 4) protection of human patients and co nfidentiality issues; and 5) data and intervention  
monitoring and quality assurance procedure s. Activities for training w ill consist of lectures, discussion,  
 
 4. Monthly Meetings – Monthly me etings with all research staff will be conducted to review accru al, 
attrition, discuss problems and/or concerns and ensure everyone understands and is follow ing the  
protocol.  
5. Quality  Assura nce Activities for Project Staff – Quarterly quality assurance ( QA) will involve engaging 
in good data management activities. Pr ocedures that include checking the integrity of data storage and  
examining frequency distribu tions to look for anomalies such as  an excessive number of “don’t know”  
responses or problems with skip patterns will be in place.  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 18 
  
Recruiters – Enrollment data wil l be monitored monthly for completeness and consistency. If any  
missing data are identified, the completion of missing f ields wi ll be requested and questions clarified  
during quarterly QA revi ew of the data.  
 
Interviewers - The level of quality of each inte rviewer and the interview process are monitored monthly  
by the study Coordinator and Investig ators. A cadre of well -trained inte rviewers at UA is available and  
used by this team in previous st udies. Early in the study, until proficiency is reached, the int erviewers  
digitally record every interview for QA. Following initial training, interviewers w ill be required to record  
and submi t 1 interview each month for review. There is no identifying inf ormation recorded. Booster  
training sessions are held with inter viewers on a scheduled basis. Written feedback on the quality of the  
telephone interview is p rovided to all interviewer s followi ng review of each recording.  
Interventionists - All sessions are  digitally recorded and about 10% randomly reviewed throughout t he 
study to maintain quality, with written and verbal feedback given to the counselors. Drs. Badger and  
Segrin will sup ervise th e intervention quality control activities. Through weekly case s upervision, we will  
maintain fidelity of the intervention and co unselor adherence to protocols. We will evaluate adherence  
(number re quired elements discusse d/ total number of element s). Drs. Badger and Segrin will listen to  
all sessions in English from th e first 5 dyads (40 hours of supervision) and then randomly revi ew 10% of  
sessions throughout the study. A bilingual counselor will r eview sessions in Spanis h using established  
protoc ols as in  past studies. Counselors who do not maintain 90% adherence will  not be given new  
cases until retraining has occurred, and Drs. Badger or Segrin will assume responsibility for those  
existing cases.  Following retraining, 5  dyads will be monitored t o ensure  that >90% adherence is  
achieved and then we will return to rando mly selected monitoring for quality control. Anyone unable to  
adhere to the standardized protocols is replaced after a second retrain ing. 
 
Data - Quality assu rance reports will be pre pared on a  quarterly basis by the statistical research  
assistant supervise d by Dr. Sikorskii and reviewed by the study Coordinator and inv estigative team.  
That is, for the internal audit, someone independent  of the data collector w ill check the data. Data from 
10% o f the recorded interviews and intervention sessions compared to database entries. The  
acceptable error rate is 0.3 %, i.e., 3 out of 1,000 fields. All errors are corrected during the QA check.  
Dr. S ikorskii will oversee p reparation of the data re port distr ibuted to all investigators at least 5 days  
before the scheduled  meeting. The report will include the summary of cumulative and quarterly accrual,  
randomization, cumulative attrition, and attrition by study group, gender,  and race/ethnicity, adve rse 
events  and serious adverse events, data completeness and quality, and study Consolidated Standards  
of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) chart . Reports will also inform the Investigators about missing, invalid,  
or inconsistent data on selected key variables. F or the ext ernal oversight, Dr. Jessica Rainbow  who is  
not involved in the study has agreed to participate in QA meetings.  
 
6. Identificati on of Adverse Effects - The following will be considered serious adverse events (SAE): 
death,  attempted suicide, major  depression , breach of confidentiality. Death, attempted suicide and 
major  depression would not occur as a direct result of study intervent ions, however, could be 
encountered during  implementation of this study due to the inclusion criteria of cancer survi vors. A 
breach in confidentiality may  result from participation in this stu dy. The investigators have successfully 
trained staff to monitor  and protect  confidentiality of participants in large research studies conducted 
over the pas t two decades. Similar t raining  strategies will be incorporated for training of staff in this 
study . Additionally, all research staff will complete  the human subje cts and HIPAA certification training.  
 
The following will be considered adverse events (AE): s evere symptoms requirin g hospitaliz ation or  
urgent care. Again, severe symptoms are not expected to  result from participation in this study but may  
result from can cer, its treat ment or other existing comorbid conditions.  
 
Averse events and serious adverse events  may be identifie d during imp lementation of the experimental  
protocols and are monitored by t he Investigators in several ways.  
Interviewers: Interviewers may  identify both s erious adverse events and/or adverse events  
   
 
Protocol Version Da te:  3/3/2022    Page 19 
 during completion of telephone in terviews or telephone c alls to sche dule telephone interviews.  
Interventionists: The interventionist s may identify both serious adverse events and/or adverse  
events  during their te lephone contacts with the participants.

At randomisation/baseline, 24 subjects with SCD will be randomised in a 3:3:3:2:1 
ratio into 3 VIT -2763 dose groups to receive either 60 mg twice daily ( BID) (120 
mg/day, Cohort  1), or 120 mg BID (240 mg/day, Cohort 2), or 120  mg 3 times 
daily ( TID) (360 m g/day, Cohort 3) and 2 placebo groups (BID, Cohort 4a or TID, 
Cohort 4b).  
All subjects will be dosed for 8 consecutive weeks.  
Duration:  The expected duration of subject participation is a maximum of 16 weeks, 
including a non -treatment screening period of up to 4 weeks ( 28 days), an 8 -week 
(56±4 days) treatment period , and a 4 -week (28±4 days) safety follow -up period.  
Treatment:  Active Treatment  
VIT-2763 oral capsules of 2 dosage strengths (30  mg and 60  mg) with identical 
size, shape, and colour will be available. Capsules will be administered orally to 
achieve the specified dose and according to the administration schedule below.  
Placebo Treatment  
Matching placebo capsules to VIT -2763 will be available, administered orally, and 
according to the administr ation schedule below.  
Administration Schedule  
Randomisation to all dosage groups will be done by using a validated  centralised  
interactive web response system (IWRS) and will be stratified by genotype  
(HbS/S - HbS/βT0).

Note:  N/A=Not applicable.  
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Subject has provided the appropriate written informed consent before  any 
study -specific procedures are performed including screening procedures.  
2. Ability to understand the requirements of the study and abide by the study 
restrictions, and agreement to retur n for the required assessments.  
3. Male or female subjects with confirmed diagnosis of SCD, including only 
HbS/S  or HbS/β T0 genotype.  
4. Subjects who had  at least 1 and no more than 10 VOC episodes reported 
within 12 months prior to screening. Note: A VOC episode is defined as a 
documented episode of acute chest syndrome or acute painful crisis for the 
main indication of SCD, which led to health -professional instructed 
prescription or use of opioids (excluding codeine)  for moderate to severe pain.  
5. 18 to 60 years of age inclusive at the time of screening.  
6. Body weight ≥ 40 kg and ≤1 20 kg at screening and baseline.  
7. Absolute reticulocyte count or percentage  reticulocyte count >1.5  × upper limit 
of normal ( ULN) during screening.  
8. Subjects on concomitant hydroxyurea treatment must be on a stable dose 
(mg/kg) for ≥3  months prior to screening Visit V1. There should be no planned 
dose adjustments during the course of the study in the opinion of the 
Investigator.  
9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy tests 
at screening (serum pregnancy test) and before randomisation  (urine 
pregnancy test) , must have stopped breastfeeding as of first dose, and must 
either commit to true abstinence fr om heterosexual contact (which must be 
reviewed on a monthly basis and source documented) or must be willing to use 
adequate contraceptive precautions , i.e., highly effective method of birth 
control. Abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method  if it is in 
line with the subjects’ usual and preferred lifestyle, and periodic abstinence 
(calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods) is not an acceptable method 
of contraception. Female subjects must agree to use adequate contraception 
during the s tudy and until at least 1 week after the last dose of investigational 
medicinal product (IMP) or requirements from other co -medications taken, 
e.g., hydroxyurea or according to local requirements, whichever is longer. 
Effective contraception (highly effect ive method of birth control, i.e., with a 
failure rate of <1% per year, when used consistently and correctly) such as 
implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives (see below), intra uterine  
devices, sexual abstinence, or vasectomised partner must be used.

 Non-childbearing potential includes being surgically sterilised at least 
6 months prior to the study.  
Note: For female subjects participating in this study, continuous use of 
hormonal contraception alone is not sufficient, because potential interacti ons 
via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes may alter the efficacy of hormonal 
contraception. The continuous use of hormonal contraception by a female 
subject should be combined with the use of a condom with spermicide or 
adequate and approved alternatives by th e (fertile) male partner.  
Exclusion 
Criteria:  1. Subjects with confirmed SCD diagnosis other than HbS/S and HbS/βT0 . 
2. Haemoglobin ( Hb) level <6.0  g/dl in any subject o r >10.4  g/dl for female 
and >11.0 g/dl for male subjects  at screening Visit V1.  
Note: The Hb value at screening Visit V1 will be used for eligibility 
determination  based on the central lab oratory  result . However, the baseline Hb 
value determined at Visit V2 (Day  1 pre-dose)  also needs to be within  the 
above specified range  based on the local laboratory result . 
3. Having received RBC transfusion therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening, or 
ongoing or planned RBC transfusion therapy during the course of the study 
(includin g chronic, prophylactic, or preventive transfusion to treat SCD).  
4. Subjects with a s erum ferritin level of <30 µg/l at screening . 
5. Calculated transferrin saturation (TSAT) level <25% at screening. However, in 
case the total iron-binding capacity  (TIBC ) level  is within normal ranges of the 
central laboratory values, the subject will not be exclude d. 
6. Subjects being hospitalised for SCD -related events (including pain crisis and 
VOC) within 14 days before the screening visit. Note: SCD must have been 
the main cause for the hospitalisation to fulfil this criterion .

aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase, above 3 -fold the  ULN range at 
baseline.  
8. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <45  ml/min/1.73  m2 at screening. 
Note: eGFR should be estimated according to Chronic Kidney Disease 
Epidemio logy Collaboration formula (CKD -EPI).  
9. Newly diagnosed folate deficiency anaemia  (i.e., folic acid <2  ng/ml) , which is 
considered clinically relevant by the Investigator  at screening . Subjects with 
known folate deficiency anaemia who are on ≥12 weeks stable replacement 
therapy at screening are eligible.  
10. Subjects with history of partial  or total splenectomy within 3 months prior to 
the screening visit.  
11. Any history or clinically important finding of cardiac or pulmonary disorders,

Screening Visit V1 (Day -28 to Day -1) 
• The Investigator  will obtain written informed consent/assent from potentially 
eligible subjects and/or legally acceptable guardian before any trial -related 
procedure is performed.  
• Subjects who have  a documented diagnosis of SCD according to inclusion 
criteria will be scre ened to determine potential eligibility . 
• Subject demographics and baseline characteristics will be assessed according 
to Table 1. Events, including medical/surgical history, physical examination, 
body weight and height, and vital signs including seated blo od pressure and 
pulse rate  will be assessed . 
• A single 12 -lead ECG will be performed . 
• As of the date of informed consent for each subject, the sites will document in 
the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) all serious adverse events 
(SAEs)/AEs and changes/ad ditions made to previous and concomitant 
medications. SAEs will be reported no later than 24 hours after the 
Investigator’s awareness of the event.  
• Blood tests using peripheral venipuncture will be drawn to determine if the 
subject is eligible according to  the inclusion and exclusion criteria  (including 
an optional genotyping test) . 
• During the same blood draw, a serum pregnancy test (beta  human chorionic 
gonadotropin ( hCG) ) will be taken for females of childbearing potential.  
• A urinary dipstick test will be  drawn to test pH, protein, glucose, ketone, and 
blood.

either on the day of the first dose of study treatment  (randomi sation day) , or on 
the day before the planned randomisation day. Subjects may attend Visit V4 
the afternoon/evening before and stay overnight to facilitate compliance and 
study proced ures on Visit V4. Note: A planned overnight stay prior to study 
treatment administration or the night before Visit V4 do not fulfil the 
seriousness criteria of an SAE unless there is a medical requirement.

Study Safety Oversight  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee the safety 
and conduct of the tria l on an ongoing basis. The DSMB will include  medical and 
statistical representatives. The DSMB will regularly, but also in an ad -hoc manner 
as needed, assess the safety information of the enrolled subjects,  and can provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor re garding stopping the study , or discontinuing a 
treatment arm , or otherwise modifying the study design or conduct.  
Sample Size:  This is an exploratory Phase 2a study of VIT-2763  in SCD subjects, therefore no 
formal sample size calculation was conducted.  
A total of 24 subjects will be randomised in a 3:3:3:2:1 ratio at baseline to either 
VIT-2763  or to placebo.  
Eligible subjects will be randomised to either VIT-2763  or placebo using a 
validated centralised IWRS  that automates the random assignment of treatment 
groups to randomisation numbers.  Stratified randomisation (balanced allocation 
across treatment groups) will be used according to genotype (HbS/S – HbS/β T0). 
If more than 1 subject in any dose cohort withdraws or drops out between signing 
informed consent and the V6 visit, the subject will be replaced until at least 
5 subjects , with no major protocol deviation impacting the primary objective of the 
trial, per treatment/placebo arm have passed  Visit  V6. 
Study Sites:  About  20 or more sites in 5 or more countries.  
Statistical 
Methods:  No formal power calculations will be performed for the sample size due to the 
experimental nature of this trial.  
An interim analysis is not planned for this study.  
Demographic data will be summarised by treatment.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 2023  Page 18 of 108 
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population  includes all subjects randomly assigned to a 
treatment group . The per -protocol set (PPS) consists of all subjects who, in  
addition to the ITT  criteria, completed the study, and had no major protocol 
deviations.  
The ITT population  will be used for the analysis of the primary and secondary 
endpoints related to haemolysis markers. These analyses will also be repeated on 
the PP S. 
The secondary and exploratory safety endpoint s will be calculated based on the 
safety population, including all randomised subjects who received at le ast one 
VIT-2763  dose or placebo.  
The ITT  population and the PPS will be used for the analysis of other  exploratory 
endpoints.  
Concerning the safety data, the total number of events and number (%) of subjects 
with an event will be presented by MedDRA SOC and PT on overall subjects 
receiving VIT-2763 , by dose group  and on all subjects receiving placebo . 
Mean s, standard deviations, medians, ranges, and confidence intervals will be 
presented for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages will be 
presented for categorical and ordinal variables. Further details will be specified in 
the Statistical Anal ysis Plan ( SAP). 
A population PK approach will be applied to estimate PK parameters (C max, 
clearance, distribution volume, AUC ).

 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
VIT-2763  (2-(2-{[2-(1H-benzimidazol -2-yl) ethyl] amino} ethyl) -N-[(3-fluoropyridin -2-yl) 
methyl] -1,3-oxazole -4-carboxamide trihydrochloride) is a  small molecule, which has been 
identi fied by Vifor Pharma as  a ferroportin (FPN) inhibitor acting similar to  hepcidin.  
FPN is the only known iron transporter in mammals mediating iron transfer into the blood 
stream. FPN is mainly expressed on intestinal enterocytes, spleen and liver macrophag es, 
and hepatocytes. On the basolateral membrane of intestinal enterocytes, FPN exports the 
dietary iron into the plasma . On spleen and liver macrophages and hepatocytes, FPN 
exports endogenous iron recycled from the Hb of senescent RBCs and released from the 
liver stores, respectively  [1]. The action of FPN is antagonised by hepcidin, a 25 -amino 
acid peptide, which is mainly produced in hepatocytes. Its tra nscription is downregulated 
by erythropoiesis, anaemia, and hypoxia , and it is upregulated by inflammation and high 
systemic iron levels. Hepcidin binds to and triggers internalisation and degradation of FPN , 
and by this causes a rapid drop in serum iron l evels [ 2,3]. 
1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options  
Iron is essential for cell survival. It is a key component of Hb, cytochromes, myoglobin, 
and of many enzymes. It is involved not only in the transport, storage, and use of oxygen, 
but also in major metabolic pathways. Consequently, iron homeostasis in the body is 
closely regulated , and imbalances may become pathogenic. Iron deficiency may result in 
anaemia; iron overload syndromes in siderosis,  i.e., the iron deposition in organs, which 
may lead to multiple organ dysfunction and damage [ 4]. Primary iron overload syndromes 
arise from mutations, e.g ., in genes of human haemochromatosis protein, haemojuvelin, 
hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, and FPN. Secondary causes for iron overload are SCD , 
other inherited , or acquired anaemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, chroni c liver diseases, 
and transfusions  [5]. 
SCD  is a multisystem disease and  is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders 
worldwide. This often -devastating  disease is associated with episodes of acute illness and 
progressive orga n damage [ 6,7]. The pathophysiology of SCD  arises from a single amino 
acid alteration in adult Hb, the expression of which is primarily limited to R BCs. The 
pathological single amino acid substitution (Glu to Val) at the sixth position of the β -chain 
of HbS results in HbS instability and polymeri sation  [8]. Following deoxygenation of HbS, 
and aggregating  into polymers, the RBC changes shape (‘sickles’) owing to this polymer 
induced distortion. This distort ion is the fundamental basis for the haemolytic anaemia, 
vaso-occlusion associated with painful events, organ dysfunction and shortened lifespan in 
patients with SCD  [9]. 
The consequences of haemolysis include the immediate effects of RBC loss, such as 
anaemia and expansion of erythropoiesis with increased reticulocytosis.  Oxidative changes 
in the sickle RBC promote haemolysis, depletion of nitric oxide, exce ss reactive oxygen 
species and endothelial activation. It is estimated that about one -third of haemolysis in SCD 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 32 of 108 
 is intravascular, owing to mechanical destruction o f deformed and inelastic sickle RBCs , 
whereas two -thirds i s extravascular, resulting from removal of abnormal sickle RBCs by 
the reticuloendothelial system  [10]. 
Erythrocyte transfusion has an established role in the management of both acute and 
chronic complications in SCD . Transfusion corrects anaemia, decreases the percentage of 
HbS, suppresses HbS synthesis, and reduces haemolysis, all of which are of potential  
benefit.  Chronic blood transfusion is inevitably associated with iron overload, although the 
pattern of haemosiderosis seems different to that described in thalassaemia; in particular, 
most iron loading occurs in the liver, with little cardiac iron deposi tion [ 11]. 
Curative therapies, such as h aematopoietic stem cell transplantation or gene therapy are 
limited to a small patient population or are not yet ava ilable. Chronic transfusion is 
generally used for primary or secondary stroke prevention  [9]. 
Acute pain crisis may be managed with pain medications , including opioids and may 
require additional in -patient or outpatient treatments , including hydration, transfusion, 
supplemental oxygen, and a variety of other treatments.  Currently approved therapies such 
as hydroxyurea address some of the pathologies in SCD . Hydroxyurea is used to reduce the 
number of acute pain crises in those with frequent or severe crises and in those with a 
history of  acute chest syndrome or severe an aemia. Within the past several years , a few 
new treatment options , such as  L-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor , have gained 
regulatory approval in the United States ; however , the evidence for  the clinical 
effectiveness  of these treatments  has been  controversial  [12]. 
Drugs that target  the broader sequelae of SCD are needed , and prevention of h aemolysis 
might provide a novel therapeutic option. Overt iron deficiency in patients with SCD has 
been associated with reduction of HbS in s ickle RBCs and decreased markers of h aemolysis  
[13,14]. 
VIT-2763  is developed by Vifor Pharma as a novel oral drug targeting FPN, and as such 
for the treatment of secondar y iron overload and conditions in which iron metabolism is 
involved: ineffective or otherwise disturbed erythropoiesis, including (but not limited to ) 
hereditary haemochromatosis, haemoglobinopathies  (e.g., thalassaemia and SCD ), or 
myeloproliferative/dysplastic disorders (e.g., polycythaemia vera and myelodysplastic 
syndrome , respectively) . Further more , the oral FPN inhibitor VIT-2763  has shown positive 
results on h aemolysis, h aemodynamics, and prevention of vaso-occlusion in a  model of 
SCD [ 15]. 
Since no FPN inhibitors or hepcidin -mimetic drugs are yet available for the treatment of 
iron loading an aemias including SCD , VIT-2763  would be considered as a first -in-class 
drug.

 1.2 Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
1.2.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology and Pharmacological Activity  
VIT-2763  is an inhibitor of the iron exporter FPN and acts similarly to hepcidin. Through 
its action on FP N, hepcidin controls the major iron flows into the plasma. Similar to 
hepcidin, VIT-2763  induces FPN internalisation, ubiquitination, and degradation. As a 
consequence, VIT-2763  blocks iron export into plasma. Nonclinical pharmacology studies 
demonstrated that VIT-2763  prevents dietary iron absorption presumably by blocking 
intestinal FPN. In hereditary haemochromatosis, inappropriately low hepcidin expression 
leads to increased dietary iron absorption and organ overload. Accordingly, prevention of 
iron abs orption by VIT-2763  decreased liver iron concentration in 2 haemochromatosis 
mouse models.  
In vitro studies in cells expressing FPN have demonstrated that VIT-2763  was similar in 
potency to hepcidin in a hepcidin -FPN binding and internalisation assay (half  maximal 
inhibitory concentration: 9±5  versus 13±4  nM). VIT-2763  decreased serum iron levels in a 
dose-dependent manner in mice comparable to hepcidin and inhibited intestinal iron 
absorption in rats. Further studies in disease -specific animal models have demonstrated 
expected effects based on the pharmacology of VIT-2763 . Importantly, iron restriction by 
the oral FPN inhibitor VIT-2763  has shown to improve  haemolysis, systemic and vascular 
inflammation , to reduce  apoptosis of RBCs  and thereby improve blood flow  in the Townes’ 
mouse model of SCD . 
1.2.1.1 Absorption, Distribution, Biotransformation , and Elimination  
The oral bioavailability depends on species and dose; it ranged from 16  to 51% in rats and 
up to 85% in dogs. Higher than proportional plasma concentrations with increasing dose 
could be due to nonlinear excretion, resulting from saturation of clearance.  
Distribution in rats was widespread , with the highest measured tissue radioactivity at 1 hour 
post-dose. Rapid accumulation was observed in particular in the kidney pyramid, but also 
in the adrenal medulla and mammary glands (females). Twenty -four hours post -dose, 
radioactivity was not detectable or at very low level s with the exception of adren al medulla , 
preputial gland , and mammary tissues.  
In vitro, VIT-2763  was shown  to be a substrate of P-glycoprotein , organic anion transporter 
3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1) and MATE -2K, and likely also of 
the organic cation transpor ter 1 (OCT1) and OCT2. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes 
have shown that VIT-2763  is mainly metabolised by CY P 3A4 and to some extent by 
CYP  2D6. VIT-2763  showed high clearance in rats  and moderate clearance in dogs, both 
in vitro and in vivo.  In human hepatocytes and liver microsomes, low levels of metabolism 
have been observed. The abundance of individual metabolites was different across species, 
whereby the metabolites in the human in vitro samples (one of them being unique to human ) 
were all  detected with low quantities . 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 34 of 108 
 Mass balance data in rats revealed  primary excretion in  urine (53.7% of total radioactive 
dose) and bile (20.6% of total radioactive dose) . No parent VIT-2763  was detected in 
another bile  duct cannulated rat study indicating that VIT-2763  metabolites or conjugation 
products are excreted in bile.  The majority of the radioactivity in urine and bile accumulated 
within 8 hours and the vast majority of the radioactivity was eliminated within 24  hours of 
dose administration.  The sec ond peak observed in rat plasma was less pronounced in bile 
duct cannulated  compared to non -bile duct cannulated  animals, suggesting that 
enterohepatic circulation occurs.  
CYP 2B6, CYP 3A4 and CYP 1A2 were not induced by VIT-2763 . A weak inhibitory 
potenti al for CYP 1A2 at a targeted dose of 240  mg and for CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4 at a 
60 to 240  mg dose was concluded in vitro. In vitro transporter inhibition indicated a weak 
inhibitory potential for OCT2, OCT1, MATE1 , and MATE2 -K. Clinical studies of 
VIT-2763  with concomitant medications have not been performed.  
1.3 Nonclinical Safety Data 
1.3.1 Long-term Toxicity 
VIT-2763  was tested in studies up to 26 weeks in the rat and 39 weeks in the dog. In 
addition, two 28 -day studies were conducted in juvenile rats.  
Findings in the rat mainly resulted from the pharmacology of VIT-2763  and included iron 
deficiency anaemia due to dec reased circulating iron concentrations and consequences 
thereof (e.g., cardiomegaly). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 
600 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, in the 14 -day study, 100 mg/kg/day in the 13 -week 
study (due to significant anaem ia at 200 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks) and 150 mg/kg/day, the 
highest dose tested, in the 26 -week study.  
Findings emanating from the pharmacology of VIT-2763  were also noted in the dog. The 
NOAEL was 30 mg/kg/day in the 14 -day study (due to the severity of th e observed clinical 
signs, i.e., vomiting, decreased activity and tremors and other findings at 100 mg/kg/day), 
75 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested, in the 13 -week study and 30 mg/kg/day (due to 
significant anaemia at 75 mg/kg/day after 13 weeks) in the 39-week study. The ECG 
changes identified in the safety pharmacology study were confirmed in all studies, 
i.e., increases in PR, QRS and/or heart rate at ≥30 mg/kg 1 hour after administration.  
1.3.2 Safety Pharmacology  
VIT-2763  demonstrated no impact on the central nervous and respiratory system  in rats and 
the NOAEL was 600  mg/kg. The half maximal inhibitory concentration  in the human 
ether -à-go-go related gene assay was 27 μM. The no observed effect level in the dog 
cardiovasc ular safety study was 10  mg/kg, based on an increase in QRS at 30 and 75  mg/kg. 
Additionally, an increase of PR for 75  mg/kg was observed. There were also sporadic 
increases in heart rate. The magnitude of the PR and QRS increases followed the PK of 
VIT-2763 with most significant increases occurring around 1  hour post -dose. Statistically 
significant QRS increases from baseline were observed 0.5 to 4 hours after 75  mg/kg and 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 35 of 108 
 1 to 2 hours after 30  mg/kg. No impact on ECG waveform morphology or on cardiac 
function was observed.  
1.3.3 Mutagenicity  
VIT-2763  is not genotoxic  based on the available weight of evidence . VIT-2763  was 
negative in the Ames test. The mouse lymphoma assay was negative  after short -term 
incubation but positive after long -term incubation . The in vivo micronucleus assay and 
comet assay w ere negative.  
1.3.4 Carcinogenicity  
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed.  
1.3.5 Paediatric Use 
Clinical studies in paediatric patients have not y et been performed.  
Two 28 -day studies were conducted in juvenile rats. In 1 study, iron deficiency anaemia 
was induced by feeding 3-week -old male Wistar rats a low iron diet for 9 days, by which 
time all animals had developed anaemia, and which was compare d with repeat 
administration of VIT-2763 . VIT -2763 and a low iron diet similarly induced iron deficiency 
anaemia in juvenile rats. This effect could only be reversed with administration of 
intravenous iron in animals on a low iron diet. In those administer ed VIT -2763, intravenous 
iron treatment resulted in iron sequestration in spleen and liver. The second study treated 
3-week -old juvenile rats for 7 days (5 days on drug; 2 days off) and 4 days (3 days on drug 
and 1 day off) with 300 mg/kg VIT-2763  and was well tolerated. Expected pharmacological 
effects on RBC parameters were observed, with no differences between the dosing 
regimens.  
The consequences of iron deficiency in human are well understood and there is extensive 
knowledge of the effects of iron defi ciency in developing children. In addition, parameters 
associated with iron metabolism and RBC parameters can be monitored during the clinical 
studies, ensuring that patients on VIT-2763  will not become iron deficient. Both EMA and 
FDA have confirmed that no further studies in juvenile animals are required to include 
adolescents or children as young as 6 months in clinical trials with VIT -2763.  
1.3.6 Reproductive Toxicity  
There are no data from the use of VIT -2763 in pregnant women. Studies in animals have  
shown reproductive toxicity.  
Data of nonclinical studies of the effect of VIT -2763 on pregnancy and fertility indicate  
that women of childbearing potential should use highly effective methods of contraception  
whilst taking VIT -2763 and until at least 1 week afte r the last dose. No data on  
breastfeeding has been generated yet, so breastfeeding must be discontinued during  
treatment with VIT -2763 and for at least 1 week after the last dose.

 1.4 Summary of Completed Clinical Studies  
1.4.1 Study VIT -2763-101 
A Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers with the title “A Phase 1, Double -blind, Randomised, 
Placebo -controlled Study on the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and 
Pharmacodynamics of Single and Multiple Ascending Doses of VIT-2763  in Healthy 
Subjects”, Protocol No. VIT -2763 -101, EudraCT No. 2017 -003395 -31, has been 
performed  [16]. 
The study consisted of a single  ascending dose part (Part A) and a mul tiple ascending dose 
part (Part B) to assess the safety, tolerability, PK , and pharmacodynamics  (PD) of 
ascending single and multiple oral doses of VIT-2763 . The primary endpoint in this 
first-in-human study was to collect the incidence of AEs and SAEs by changes in vital signs, 
clinical laboratory, 12 -lead ECG and cardiac telemetry examinations and physical 
examination findings following single and multiple oral doses compared to baseline.   
Secondary endpoints were to characterise the PK of VIT-2763  and to measure PD 
parameters to identify potential surrogate markers of VIT-2763  mechanism of action after 
single or multiple oral dosing.  
Treatment with single oral doses ranging from 5 mg to 240  mg and  a 7-day treatment with 
oral doses of 60  mg once daily  (QD), 120  mg QD, 60  mg every 12  hours , and 120 mg every 
12 hours were well tolerated by healthy male and female volunteers . Following single dose 
all treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) were of mild severity. There were no SAEs 
reported and no discont inuations due to AEs. Following 7 -day repeated treatment , all 
TEAEs were mild or moderate. There were no SAEs reported and no discontinuations due 
to AEs. There were no findings of clinical relevance with respect to vital signs, 12 -lead 
ECG, telemetry , or physical examination.  
The PK analyses revealed that the initial oral absorption of VIT-2763  was relatively fast, 
most subjects had detectable levels already at 15  to 30 minutes post -dose, and T max for 
VIT-2763 ranged from 0.50 to 3  hours post -dose. A secon d peak or shoulder in the 
concentration -time profile was observed around 3  to 4 hours post -dose (from 15 mg dose). 
The exposure over the dose range of 5 mg to 240 mg was slightly more than dose 
proportional for C max, AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf. 
Following multiple oral dose for 7 days up to 120 mg every 12  hours there was no apparent 
change in absorption and accumulation was minimal. The apparent volume of distribution 
following single oral administration was moderate ranging from 64.3 to 145 l in dicating 
moderate distribution to tissues. The geometric mean t 1/2 ranged from 1.9 to 5.3 hours 
following single oral dosing and from 2.07 to 3.80 hours  on Day 1 and from 2.61 to 
5.26 hours on Day 7 following repeated dosing.  
Following both single and mult iple dosing, a temporary decrease in mean serum iron levels 
and a temporary decrease in mean calculated % TSAT was seen at all VIT-2763  dose levels 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 37 of 108 
 between 4 -hours  and 12 -hours post -dose. Following both single and multiple dosing, a 
temporary increase in m ean serum hepcidin levels was seen at doses of 60/120/240 mg for 
single dosing and at all VIT-2763  multiple dose levels. Maximum mean serum hepcidin 
levels were observed between 1 -hour and 4 -hours post -dose for the highest single dose 
levels of 60 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg, and for all 4 multiple dose levels. No dose related 
effects were observed with respect to serum ferritin, serum transferrin, serum erythropoietin  
and serum soluble transferrin receptor  levels on both Day 1 and Day 7.  
1.4.2 Study VIT -2763-THAL-201 
A Phase 2a trial has recently been completed (Q4, 2021), with study sites in the EU, 
Thailand, Israel, and Lebanon. Study VIT -2763 -THAL -201 was a double -blind, 
randomised, placebo -controlled, parallel group trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, 
PD, and preliminary efficacy of multiple doses of VIT -2763 in 25 adult subjects with 
non-transfusion dependent (NTD) thalassaemia . After database lock, topline results were 
generated January 2022.  
The primary safety endpoints were reported or observed AEs and SAEs, changes in vital 
signs (blood pressure and pulse rate and respiratory rate), clinical laboratory safety tests 
(haematology, serum biochemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), 12 -lead ECG, and 
physical examination findings.  
The first s ubject in Study VIT -2763 -THAL -201 was enrolled in June 2020 (in Lebanon). 
Blinded interim results in 10 adult subjects were obtained in Q1/2021 and revealed no 
safety concerns as judged by the Safety Review Committee ; topline results of all subjects 
have b een analysed (Q1/2022) ( Investigational New Drug (IND) , Section 1.11.4), 
demonstrating that VIT -2763 was safe and well tolerated. The interim analysis also showed 
that VIT -2763 had significant target engagement with FPN, lowering consistently and 
throughout the treatment period serum iron and TSAT. The study could not show 
significant changes from baseline in clinically relevant blood biomarkers such as Hb, RBC 
count, MCHC, MCV, reticulocyte counts and reticulocyte Hb content. Learnings from 
Study VIT -2763 -THAL -201 suggest that TID dosing may be required to achieve the full 
efficacy of vamifeport, and PK and PD samples will needed to be collected at additional 
time points to fully understand the effects of vamifeport.  These results led to the 
amendment of this study protocol (see Section 2.3).

 2. RATIONALE  
2.1 Rationale to Investigate the Effects of VIT-2763 in SCD 
While there is good evidence that overt iron deficiency is associated with a decrease in the 
severity of h aemolysis, evidence of a clinical benefit is limited because studies are few and 
assessment of the severity of the disease is difficult.  It has been shown that overt iron 
deficiency induced by repeated erythrocytapheresis in 2 patients with sickle cell an aemia  
was associated with a decrease in reticulocytes, with only a slight decrease in the blood Hb 
concentration. The lower red cell production from lack of iron appeared to have been 
compensated by the improvement in red cell survival. Following the induc tion of overt iron 
deficiency, a remarkable decrease in the number of pain crises over 30 months of 
observation was seen in 1 patient and the healing of recalcitrant leg ulcers was seen in the 
other. Iron deficiency did not appear to have any apparent dele terious effects  [13]. Other 
authors described 2 patients in whom overt iron deficiency induced by repeated 
phlebotomies was associated with a remarkable de crease in the number of pain crises 
during 4 years of observation  [14]. 
In the Townes mouse model of SCD , VIT-2763  showed reduced intravascular haemolysis 
markers, such as plasma LDH , haeme, and bilirubin  [17]. Furthermore, VIT-2763  lowered 
markers of vascular inflammation and oxidativ e stress, for instance  soluble vascular cell 
adhesion molecule 1 , soluble platelet -selectin , and xanthine oxidase . The RBC indices of 
Townes mice treated with VIT-2763  showed changes attributable to iron -restricted 
erythropoiesis: decrease in RBC counts, Hct, MCV , MCH , reticulocyte Hb content , and 
CHCM . Small changes in CHCM are expected to have a large impact on HbS 
polymeri sation rate , which is proportional to HbS conc entration  in RBCs with a factor of 
about 1030 and therefore on all the ensuing sequelae such as h aemolysis and vaso-occlusion 
[18]. Accordingly, VIT-2763  reduced blood cell adhesion in venules, restored blood flow 
and prevented vaso -occlusion in the Townes model of SCD as demonstrated by intravital 
fluorescence video microscopy. In addition, VIT-2763  significantly lowered the relative 
spleen weight of Town es mice, suggesting improved extramedullary erythropoiesis and 
decreased clearance of RBCs.  
Hence, iron restriction by the oral FPN inhibitor VIT-2763  lowers the concentration of HbS 
and has the potential to alleviate VOC  and thereby to improve h aemodynami cs in SCD, 
presumably by reducing h aemolysis and vascular inflammation.  
2.2 Study Design Rationale  
This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group trial that explores 
3 different dosing regimens of VIT -2763: 60 mg BID, 120 mg BID and 120  mg TID.  
The treatment duration of 8 weeks is considered sufficiently long enough to explor e the 
effect s of VIT-2763  on markers of haemolysis, haematological indices, and vascular 
inflammation, safety and tolerability, iron and erythropoiesis related blood parameters , pain 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 39 of 108 
 and quality  of life, and at the same time to discern possible negative effects on iron  
restriction over time.  
Subjects in this study will be required to have  experienced  at least 1 and no more than 
10 VOC  episodes  reported within 12 months prior to screening , in order to define a 
symptomatic disease status , but to exclude the most severe ly impacted subjects , e.g.,  those 
who suffer  from additional comorbidities . There is no commonly agreed threshold in the 
number of VOC  episodes  experienced in patients with SCD.  A study including more than 
8,500 patients with a follow -up period of 2.7 years evaluated the prevalence rate of VOC 
episo des (uncomplicated and complicated VOC episodes ), and the primary reasons for 
emergency room visits and in -patient admissions for SCD patients  [19]. During the 
first-year follow -up period, an average of 2.79 VOC episodes were identified per SCD 
patients, with 1.06 VOC episodes treated in  the in-patient setting and 0.90 VOC episodes 
treated in the emergency room without admission . The defined baseline characteristic of 
having experienced at least 1 to no more than 10 VOC episodes ensures  that subjects are 
sufficiently stable , while this threshold is in line with the overall prevalence of VOC  
episodes  in the target population and compares well with the baseline characteristics of 
SCD patients in similar early clinical trials conducted in the past [ 20]. Hence, the likelihood 
that subjects will suffer from VOC episodes during the 8 -week treatment schedule while 
participating in the main trial is considered low.  
Patients with homozygous HbS /S and the compound heterozygous con dition HbS/β T0 
thalas saemia  present  amongst the most prevalent SCD genotypes and are clinically very 
similar [21]. 
A required  Hb threshold between 6.0 g/dl and 10.4 g/dl for female and >11.0 g/dl for male 
subjects  at the time of screening is considered  appropriate , as it typically covers most 
patients with HbS/β T0 thalas saemia  and HbS/S genotype . In addition, ineffective 
erythropoiesis is expected to be more pronounced in HbS/ βT0 because of the 
beta-thalassaemia  genotype.  
Subjects with absolute reticulocyte count or % reticulocyte count >1.5 × ULN  during 
screening are eligible. The reticulocyte count is useful as a marker to estimate the degree 
of erythropoiesis and the appropriateness of the bone marrow response to an aemia . Absence 
of reticulocytosis in an aemia  usual ly signals a problem with the bone marrow such as an 
aplastic an aemia , and points to a lower impact on ineffective erythropoiesis . The 
reticulocyte count is reported to be elevated between 4  to 15% in  samples from  SCD  
patients  [11,22-24]; however , a threshold of 1.5 × ULN seem s plausible in this trial  to target 
those patients who might respond best following VIT-2763  administration . 
VIT-2763 lowered serum iron in rodents, d ogs, and humans (healthy volunteers and 
non-transfusion  dependent beta -thalassaemia patients) suggesting similar mechanism of 
action of VIT -2763 in these species [ 15,16] (see IND, Section 1.11.4 ). The PD effect of 
VIT-2763 in humans can be monitored by determination of p lasma iron levels (acute effect) 
and haematological RBC indices (chronic effect). In addition, biomarkers for haemolysis, 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 40 of 108 
 inflammation and haemopoietic/erythropoieti c activity in SCD patients will be assessed as 
preliminary efficacy readouts.  Data from the completed first -in-human study  [16] revealed 
that oral ad ministration of VIT-2763  to healthy male and female volunteers for up to 
7 consecutive days , QD or BID dosing , and at up to 240 mg total daily dose was well 
tolerated with no safety findings of clinical relevance. Short -term treatment in adult 
subjects was well tolerated with no difference between active dose groups and placebo both 
in terms of frequency and intensity of AEs following single and multiple doses. The human 
PK profile exhibited dose linearity and only slight dose super -proportionality for C max and 
AUC at steady -state PK.  
Topline results from the first patient study ( IND, Section 1.11.4) revealed that oral 
administration of 120 mg QD or 120 mg BID of VIT -2763 to male and female NTD  
beta-thalassaemia patients for 12 weeks was well tolerated with no safety findings of 
clinical relevance. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated wi th no difference between 
active dose groups and placebo both in terms of frequency and intensity of TEAEs. 
Furthermore, VIT -2763 showed a comparable PK profile, as previously observed in healthy 
volunteers ( IND, Section 1.11.4). The Sponsor assumes that th e PK profile in the target 
patient population of this study will not differ from previous results in humans.  
Placebo treatment will be used in a minority of adult SCD  subjects in order to discriminate 
potential side -effects of active treatment from non -active treatment, and to explore the 
natural variability of haemolysis markers and iron-related markers and biomarkers for 
haemopoietic/erythropoietic activity. Placebo  treatment in this study does not bear an 
additional risk for the study participants  and wi ll allow subjects  to keep their standard of 
care.  
In order to maintain the subjects’ usual medical treatment, s ubjects will be allowed to be 
concomitantly treated with hydroxyurea and must be on a stable dose for ≥3 months prior 
to screening. Hence , the use of a placebo arm is considered ethically justified.  In case there 
is a need for a hospitali sation or further medical care during the course of the trial, based 
on the judgement of the treating physician, subjects may need to be withdrawn from IMP 
intake. In order to assess changes in the laboratory parameters, and changes of the well -
being of subjects randomised into the study, a  DSMB  will be established  to protect the 
safety of study participants.  
2.3 Dose Selection 
2.3.1 Summary  
This protocol was amended on the basis of results from Study VIT -2763 -THAL -201, where  
-thalass aemia patients were  treated with either QD or BID doses of 60 or 120 mg  of 
VIT-2763  for 12 weeks. VIT-2763 -treated patients experienced dose -dependent reductions 
of total serum iron and TSAT from Week 1 to EoS. However, n o changes in relevant 
haematological biomarkers such as Hb could be detected. The Sponsor wants to explore at 
its best the PD range o f VIT-2763  in this Phase 2a study , therefore change s in dose and 
dosing frequency ha ve been implemented  to ensure a more sustained iron restriction . The 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 41 of 108 
 proposed dose levels and dosing frequencies are considered to be safe after an analysis of 
all currently available nonclinical , clinical and simulation  data of VIT-2763 . 
2.3.2 Justification of Safety 
The nonclinical risk assessment for the first -in-human study  (VIT-2763 -101) focused on 
minimising the risk for increase in QRS  duration  and P R interval , on the basis of 
observations made in dog studies  [16]. As this effect was transient and followed the PK 
profile of VIT-2763 , Cmax is considered the most relevant parameter for monitoring the risk 
of changes in QRS  duration  and increased PR-interval . In the current study at each study 
visit pre -dose and 2 hou rs post -dose (approximately  at T max) ECG assessments will be 
performed to monitor  this risk.  
The Sponsor expects that VIT -2763 will have similar PK characteristics in patients with 
SCD  as previously reported for both healthy volunteers [ 16] and patients with NTD 
beta-thalas saemia  (IND, Section 1.11.4). VIT -2763 is quickly eliminated in humans  
(elimination half -life 2 -5 hours) and no relevant accumulation has been detected in any of 
the studies where PK measurements have been  performed.  Therefore, the VIT -2763 C max 
values for the proposed dose levels are expected not to exceed the plasma concentrations 
observed previously in hu mans even with a 120 mg TID dosing regimen.  For further 
analysis please refer to the IND, Section 1.11.4.  
Our estimated cumulative 24 -hour AUC exposure (20,250.00 ng/ ml; IND, Section 1.11.4) 
of 120 mg TID VIT-2763  plasma concentrations at steady -state leaves a safety margin to 
the AUC at NOAEL doses of the rat repeat -dose toxicity studies of 2 -12 times [25,26,27] 
and 1 -4 times to the AUC at NOAEL doses of the dog repeat -dose toxicity studies 
[28,29,30]. We consider the safety margins for the 120 mg TID VIT-2763  dose level to be 
adequate for this Phase 2a exploratory study in patients.  Signs of chronic excessive PD 
effects (i.e., iron deficiency or anaemia ) that may occur, can be detected early on with the 
current study setup  as haematological safety parameters w ill be monitored throughout the 
study  (every 2 weeks) . For a more detailed analysis please refer to the IND, Section 1.11.4.  
2.3.3 Justification of Dose 
The PD effects after approximately  2 hours of VIT-2763  administration in the 
VIT-2763 -THAL -201 study clearly demonstrated that VIT-2763  acted as a n FPN inhibitor, 
at both dosing regimens  and induced a mean baseline -corrected change in TSAT of -26.2% 
(±18.6%) and -46.8% (±23.6%) for the QD and BID regimens , respectively,  after 12 weeks 
of treatment. The placebo group achieved a mean baseline -corrected change in TSAT 
of -1.3%  (±2.3%) after 12 weeks of treatment.  On the other hand, the PD effects did not 
translate into effects on the ineffective erythropoiesis of treated patients; Hb levels, as well 
as RBC counts, MCHC , MCV, reticulocyte counts and reticulocyte Hb content did not 
change after 12 weeks of treatment ( IND, Section 1.11.4 ). Several hypotheses  may explain 
these results ; however , the Sponsor believes that an insufficient  sustained serum iron 
restriction in between drug administrations may be the cause  for such disconnect . VIT-2763  
has a short elimination half -life (2-5 hours) after repeat -dose administration that leads to 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 42 of 108 
 insufficient  drug concentration s to ma intain constant low serum iron levels, in particular 
when VIT-2763  is applied only QD. 
Consequently , in this exploratory Ph ase 2a study  adult subjects will receive for 8 weeks 
either 60 mg BID VIT-2763  (Cohort 1), 120 mg BID VIT-2763  (Cohort 2), 120 mg TID 
VIT-2763  (Cohort 3) or placebo (Cohort  4a and 4b ) (see Figure 1 and Table 2). 
Animal models of SCD with 2 administrations of VIT -2763 during the day, showed 
significant  clinical benefit. However, data obtained from the VIT -2763 -THAL -201 study 
indicate that higher doses or more frequent dosing is required  to sustain iron restriction  
throughout the whole dosing period . Signs of chronic excessive PD effects (i.e., anaemia ) 
can be detected early on ; haematological safety parameters will be monitored  throughout 
the study  (every 2 weeks) . The selected VIT-2763  dose levels and dosing frequencies in 
this Phase 2a exploratory study are considered to be safe  and are intended to explore at its 
best the potential therapeutic PD range of VIT-2763  in this patient population. Different 
levels o f serum iron restriction (doses of 120 mg, 240 mg and 360 mg) and different 
fluctuations of induced peak and trough serum iron  throughout a 24 -hour period  (BID and 
TID)  are explored. It is still unknown if a more sustained serum iron restriction (TID) or 
more fluctuating (BID) serum iron levels translate into better clinical outcomes in SCD.  
That is the reason why  in the current protocol a broad range of doses and  dosing regimens 
is explored.

 4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 2a, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group trial in 
SCD subjects. Multiple doses of VIT -2763 will be administered at 3 dose levels and with 
2 different dosing frequencies (60 mg BID, 120 mg BID, 120 mg TID).  
A total of 24 subjects with confirmed diagnosis of SCD will be randomised into 4 cohorts 
(either VIT -2763 or corresponding placebo) (see Figure 1 and Table 2) through a secure 
and validated centralised IWRS  that automates the random assignment of treatment groups 
to randomisation numbers. Stratified randomisation (balanced  allocation across treatment 
groups) will be used according to genotype (HbS/S - HbS/βT0).  
At baseline, subjects will be assigned to 60 mg BID VIT -2763 (Cohort 1), 120 mg BID 
VIT-2763 (Cohort 2), 120 mg TID (Cohort 3) and placebo (Cohort 4a and 4b). If mor e than 
1 subject in any dose cohort withdraws or drops out between signing informed consent and 
the V6 visit, the subject will be replaced until at least 5 subjects, with  no major protocol 
deviation  impacting the primary objective of the trial , per treatme nt/placebo (Cohort s 4a 
and 4b)  arm have passed Visit V6. 
Subjects eligible for randomisation will receive a randomisation number. Randomised 
subjects who terminate their study participation for any reason , regardless of whether the 
IMP was taken or not, will retain their randomisation number. The next subject will be 
given the next randomisation number.  
An independent DSMB  will oversee the safety and conduct of the trial on an ongoing basis. 
The DSMB  will b e comprised of medical and statistical representatives. The DSMB  can 
provide recommendations to the Sponsor regarding stopping the study or discontinuing a 
treatment arm or otherwise modifying the study design or conduct. The DSMB  will review 
safety data o n a periodic , but also as needed on an ad -hoc manner,  basis as defined in the 
DSMB  Charter.  
Treatment stopping rules for individual subjects are defined in Section 5.4.2 . 
The expected duration of subject participation is a maximum of 16 weeks: a non -treatment 
screening period of a maximum of 4 weeks (28 days), an 8 -week treatment period and a 
4-week safety follow -up period.  The schedule of assessments i s provided in Table 1. 
4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study  
The expected duration of subject participation is a maximum of 16 weeks , including  a 
non-treatment screening period of up to  4 weeks ( 28 days), an 8-week (56±4 days) 
treatment period and a 4 -week (28±4 days) safety follow -up period.  
The overall end of trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient participating 
in the trial and the end of patient data collection.

 5. SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS 
5.1 Number of Subjects  
No specific sample size calculations have been performed for this study.  
It is planned to randomise 24 subjects in a 3:3:3:2:1 ratio into 3 VIT-2763  dose groups and 
2 placebo group s (Cohorts 4a and 4b) . 
5.2 Inclusion Criteria  
The following inclusion criteria must be met for each subject:  
1. Subject has provided the appropriate written in formed consent before any 
study -specific procedures are performed including screening procedures.  
2. Ability to understand the req uirements of the study and abide by the study restrictions, 
and agreement to return for the required assessments.  
3. Male or female subjects with confirmed diagnosis of SCD, including only HbS/S or 
HbS/βT0 genotype.  
4. Subjects who had at least 1 and no more tha n 10 VOC episodes reported within 
12 months prior to screening. Note: A VOC episode is defined as a documented 
episode of acute chest syndrome or acute painful crisis for the main indication of SCD, 
which led to health -professional instructed prescription or use of opioids (excluding 
codeine) for moderate to severe pain.  
5. 18 to 60 years of age inclusive at the time of screening.  
6. Body weight ≥ 40 kg and ≤ 120 kg at screening and baseline.  
7. Absolute reticulocyte count or percentage reticulocyte count >1.5  × ULN d uring 
screening.  
8. Subjects on concomitant hydroxyurea treatment must be on a stable dose (mg/kg) for 
≥3 months prior to screening Visit V1. There should be no planned dose adjustments 
during the course of the study in the opinion of the Investigator.  
9. Female  subjects of childbearing potential, must have negative pregnancy tests at 
screening  (serum pregnancy test)  and before randomisation  (urine pregnancy test) , 
must have stopped breastfeeding as of first dose, and must either commit to true 
abstinence from he terosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis 
and source documented) or must be willing to use adequate contraceptive precautions, 
i.e., highly effective method of birth control. Abstinence should only be used as a 
contraceptive method if i t is in line with the subjects’ usual and preferred lifestyle, 
and periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods) is not an 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 47 of 108 
 acceptable method of contraception. Female subjects must agree to use adequate 
contraception during the s tudy and until at least 1 week after the last dose of IMP or 
requirements from other co -medications taken, e.g., hydroxyurea or according to 
local requirements, whichever is longer. Effec tive contraception (highly effective 
method of birth control, i.e., with a failure rate of <1% per year, when used 
consistently and correctly) such as implants, injectables, combined oral 
contraceptives (see below), intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence,  or vasectomised 
partner must be used. Non -childbearing potential includes being surgically sterilised 
at least 6 months prior to the study.  
Note: For female subjects participating in this study, continuous use of hormonal 
contraception alone is not suffic ient, because potential interactions via CYP enzymes 
may alter the efficacy of hormonal contraception. The continuous use of hormonal 
contraception by a female subject should be combined with the use of a condom with 
spermicide or adequate and approved alt ernatives by the (fertile) male partner.  
5.3 Exclusion Criteria  
The following criteria exclude a subject from participating in this trial:  
1. Subjects with confirmed SCD diagnosis other than HbS/S and HbS/βT0 . 
2. Hb level  <6.0 g/dl or >10.4  g/dl for female and >11.0 g/dl for male subjects  at 
screening Visit V1.  
Note: The Hb value at screening Visit V1 will be used for eligibility determination  
based on the central lab oratory  result . However, the baseline Hb value determine d at 
Visit V2 (Day  1 pre-dose) also needs to be within the above specified range , based 
on the local laboratory result . 
3. Having received RBC transfusion therapy within 4 weeks prior to screening, or 
ongoing or planned RBC transfusion therapy during the cour se of the study (including 
chronic, prophylactic, or preventive transfusion to treat SCD).   
4. Subjects with a serum ferritin level of <30 µg/l at screening . 
5. Calculated TSAT level <25%  at screening. However, in case  the TIBC is  within 
normal ranges of the central laboratory values, the subject will not be excluded . 
6. Subjects being hospitalised for SCD -related events (including pain crisis and VOC) 
within 14 days before the screening visit. Note: SCD must have been the main cause 
for the hospitalisation to fulfil this criterion.  
7. Chronic liver disease or history of live r cirrhosis, and/or alanine aminotransferase or 
aspartate aminotransferase, above 3 -fold the ULN range at baseline.

16 March 202 3 Page 48 of 108 
 8. eGFR <45  ml/min/1.73  m2 at screening. Note: eGFR should be estimated according 
to CKD -EPI formula . 
9. Newly diagnosed folate deficiency anaemia  (i.e., folic acid <2  ng/ml), which is 
considered clinically relevant by the Investigator at screening. Subjects with known 
folate deficiency anaemia who are on ≥12 weeks stable replacement therapy at 
screening are eligible.

5.4 Withdrawal of Subjects  
5.4.1 Withdrawal of Subje cts from Study  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time without having to 
provide a reason. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the appearance of a new health 
condition requiring care or medications prohibited by the protocol , unacceptable AE, 
refusal to continue treatment, or at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s best 
interest.  
If a subject withdraws from the study at any time either at his or her request or at the 
Investigator’s discretion, the reason(s)  for withdrawal must be recorded on the relevant 
page of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. Subjects who withdraw from the 
study prematurely (with the exceptions of “withdrawal by subject ” and “lost to follow -up”) 
should undergo all study assessm ents as per Visit V6 , if possible.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 51 of 108 
 It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE. In any case, 
every effort must be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures (see 
Section 8.7). If a subject is discontinued due to an AE, the event should be followed by the 
Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilisation has occurred.  
All AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilisation , or the subject is lost to follow -up 
and cannot be contacted.  
If a subject refuse s to continue study procedures, the reason for refusal should be fully 
documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study -specific eCRF. 
Although subjects are not obliged to give a reason for withdrawing consent, the Investigator 
will mak e every effort to obtain the reason, while fully respecting the subject’s rights. If 
the subject withdraws from the trial without providing a reason, the source documents and 
the eCRF should document the reason for discontinuation as “withdrawal by subject ”. 
5.4.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from Study Drug  
IMP must be stopped if any of the below criteria may apply:  
• Serum transaminases ( alanine aminotransferase  or aspartate 
aminotransferase ) >3  × ULN range and total bilirubin >2  × ULN (confirmed by 
subsequent repeat ≥24 hours apart).  
• Hb level < 5.7 g/dl or a n Hb decrease of >1 .5 g/dl from last visit . 
• Ferritin level <15 µg/l.  
• Increase of QTcF interval of 60 ms over baseline on 2 consecutive 12-lead ECG 
measurements, and/or any QTcF ≥500 ms.  Note: Occurrence of this condition would 
qualify the subject for permanent discontinuation  from the study  (see last paragraph in 
Section 5.4.2 ). 
• Atrioventricular con duction delays on 2 consecutive 12-lead ECG measurements:  
− Absolute PR interval prolongation >240 ms.  
− Relative PR interval change >25% from baseline or previous visit.  
− Second -degree atrioventricular block or higher.  
− Symptoms and signs of decreased cardiac o utput.  
• Unexpected clinically relevant worsening of complications related to SCD, as per 
Principal Investigator  assessment.  
• Major protocol deviations, including noncompliance or lost to follow -up. 
• Participation in any other clinical study during the duratio n of this clinical study.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 52 of 108 
 • Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary . 
• Incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) 
illness.  
• Inability to comply with the protocol or study proc edures.  
Any permanent subject withdrawal from study medication needs to be discussed and agreed 
with the Medical Monitor. Withdrawing a subject from study drug can be temporary, and 
the study medication might be reinitiated upon resolution of withdrawal reason and 
consultation  and agreement with Medical Monitor . 
5.4.3 Study Stopping Rules  
A DSMB  will regularly , and as needed on an ad -hoc manner,  assess the safety information 
of the enrolled subjects , and can provide recommendations to the Sponsor reg arding 
stopping the study or discontinuing a treatment arm or otherwise modifying the study 
design or conduct.  
5.5 Re-screening  of Subjects  
A subject can only be randomised once in the trial. If a randomised subject withdraws  
consent for further follow -up, the  subject cannot be re -screened. However, a  subject who 
fails to meet the protocol inclusion/exclusion  criteria  (e.g., clinically significant bacterial,  
fungal, parasitic , or viral infection s which require therapy , folate deficiency anaemia ) can 
be re -screened at a later time point.  Before randomisation (Visit V2 ), re-screening may be 
considered at the discretion of the Investigator and in consultation with the Sponsor . The 
subject must sign a new  written informed consent and will be allocate d a new screening 
number.

 6. STUDY TREATMENTS  
6.1 Treatment Blinding  
This study is conducted in a double -blind fashion1. The IMPs  (VIT-2763  30 mg, 60  mg, or 
placebo) are provided as identical white opaque hypromellose Size 0  hard capsules  in white 
high-density polyethylene ( HDPE ) bottles with identical labels . The appearance of the 
placebo capsules is identical to the VIT-2763  dosage strengths  (30 mg and 60 mg) 
expressed as drug substance base.  To minimi se the potential for bias, treatment 
randomisa tion information will be kept confidential by the unblinded biostatistician and 
will not be released to the Investigator or site personnel until the study database has been 
locked. The blind will be maintained for subjects  and site personnel . The Sponsor  (except 
a defined study independent team  and clinical trial supply manager ), all CRO  staff (except 
staff required for the development of the randomisation schedule  and outputs for the DSMB ) 
are blinded.  The DSMB  members  will be unblinded.  
The Sponsor/CRO staff who may be unblinded will be identified prior to final breaking of 
the blind . If the Investigator  or site personnel  becomes aware of a subject’s study treatment 
assignment, efforts should be made to not disclose treatment  assignments to o ther study 
staff, subjects, or their caregivers . 
Subjects should refrain from discussion of their IMP with the site staff or other subjects, 
and any questions regarding the physical properties or appearance of the IMP should be 
directed to the dispensing Investigational Pharmacist only.  
During the study, the blind will only be broken under particular cond itions that are specified 
in Section 6.1.1 . 
6.1.1 Unblinding  
The study blind will only be broken for an individual subject in the following situations:  In 
case of a medical emergency, when knowledge of the treatment arm that was administrated 
is relevant for the treatment of the subject.  
• When reporting of the treatment arm to the Health Authorities is required, e.g., for 
reporting a suspected unexpected ser ious advers e reaction (SUSAR) (see 
Section  10.7.2 ). 
• If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the knowledge of the treatment arm is 
therefore necessary (see Section 10.8.3 ). 
 
 
1This study is a double -blind study,  although subjects receiving oral treatment TID will know that they are not in the 
BID treatment cohorts, subjects will still be blinded for verum and placebo. Similarly, subjects randomi sed into the BID 
treatment cohorts will know that they are not in the TID treatment cohorts, nevertheless all subjec ts are blinded within 
their cohort.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 54 of 108 
 If breaking of the blind is required, the unblinded information should be, wherever possible 
accessible only to those clinical site staff who need to be involved in the diagnostic workup, 
treatment , or medical follow -up of the subject (e.g., in case of a medical emergency or  a 
pregnancy), or those involved in the safety reporting to external regulatory bodies (e.g., in 
case of a SUSAR or a pregnancy).  The responsibility to break the treatment code in 
emergency situations resides solely with the Investigator. However, if in th e opinion of the 
Investigator, the situation allows , the study Medical Monitor may be contacted for 
discussion in advance. The Investigator may inform the subject and/or his/her treating 
physician of the treatment assignment.  Unblinding by IWRS must always  be performed 
according to the procedures that are specified in applicable Standard Operating Procedures.

At randomisation/baseline, 24 subjects with SCD will be randomised in a 3:3:3:2:1 ratio 
into 3 VIT -2763 dose groups to receive either 60 mg BID (120 mg/day, Cohort 1), or 
120 mg BID (240 mg/day, Cohort 2), or 120 mg TID (360 mg/day, Cohort 3) and 2 placebo 
groups (BID, Cohort 4a or TID, Cohort 4b).  
All subjects will be dosed for 8 consecutive weeks.  Compliance will be documented  in the 
eCRF  as detailed  in the eCRF  completion guidelines . The f irst dose of IMP will be 
administered  in-hospital at the V2 visit (Day 1). The compliance and exact timing of the 
treatment will be ensured by the study personnel.  Subjects will receive IMP for home intake 
until the  next visit. The subject should return all IMP to site at the following visit where 
accountability is done and receives new IMP according to randomisation and Table 1 to 
ensure compliance. Compliance  for the take -home IMP will be assessed on the basis of the 
prescribed number of IMP capsules, the duration of treatment, and the quantity of dispensed 
and returned IMP capsules . 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 56 of 108 
 The Investigational Pharmacist or dedicated site staff will inform the study personnel if any 
compliance issues (e.g., <80% of expected usage) are identified so that the subject can be 
retrained on proper dosing and administration.  
6.3.2 Dosing and Administration Guidelines  
At randomisation/baseline (Visit V2/Day  1) IMP will be assigned by IWRS as per the 
randomisation scheme (see Figure 1) and administration schedule (see Table 3). For 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 4a, the IMP total daily dose will be split in to 2 doses  per day, 1 in the 
morning and 1 in the evening. The first dose of IMP will be administered at site from the 
assigned IMP kits. A single dose out of the assigned kit s of 30 mg or 60  mg VIT -2763 or 
placebo caps ules will be administered orally in the morning with about 240  ml water at 
least 1 hour before meals between 06:00 and 10:00  am. The evening dose will be 
administered 12 hours (±1 hour) after the morning dose with water 1 hour apart from  meals.  
The evening  dose may be administered outside the clinic.  
For Cohorts 3 and 4b, the IMP total daily dose will be split in to 3 doses  per day, 1 in the 
morning, 1 in the afternoon and 1 in the evening. The first dose of IMP will be administered 
at site from the assigned  IMP kits. A single dose out  of the assigned kits of 60  mg VIT -2763 
or placebo capsules will be administered orally in the morning with about 240  ml water at 
least 1 hour before  meals between 0 6:00 and 10:00  am. The afternoon dose will be 
administered 8 ho urs (±1 hour) after the morning dose with water 1 hour apart from a meal. 
The evening dose will be administered 16 hours (±1 hour) after the morning dose with 
water 1 hour apart from any meal.  The afternoon and evening dose may be administered 
outside the clinical site.

Subjects will take the assigned IMP for home intake until the next visit. At each visit, the 
IMP for that day will be administered at site (subjects need to be informed that they will  be 
receiving the IMP at site for the next visit).  
Two VIT-2763  dosage strengths (30 mg, 60 mg) and placebo are available and will be used 
accordingly to achieve the specified doses  and to maintain the blind . 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 57 of 108 
 Subjects randomised to placebo will be administered orally 2 or 3 single doses of placebo 
matching to VIT -2763 as per randomisation scheme and administration schedule. The 
placebo will match the VIT -2763 capsules used in the respective cohort.  
If a subject forgets to take an IMP dose  (independent of BID or TID dosing ), this forgotten 
dose can be safely taken when reali sed that there are at least 4 hours left to the next planned 
dose. Conversely, if less than 4 hours remain until the next scheduled dose, the 
recommendation is to wait and  only take the next dose.  
6.4 Package and Labelling  
VIT-2763  (30 mg and 60 mg) and placebo capsules in HDPE bottles will be supplied to the 
investigational site as double -blind IMP with identical  appearance . 
IMP labels will comply with local requirements.  
6.5 Study Treatment Allocation  
Each eligible subject will be assigned to 1 of 5 groups through a secure and validated IWRS 
as described in Section 6.3.2 . Stratified randomis ation (balanced allocation across treatment 
groups) will be used according to genotype (HbS/S - HbS/βT0).  
Subjects will be assigned to VIT -2763 120 mg (Cohort 1), VIT -2763 240 mg (Cohort 2), 
VIT-2763 360 mg (Cohort 3) and placebo (Cohort 4a and 4b).  
All su bjects randomised to each cohort will remain on their respective treatment schedules 
until EoT.  
6.6 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability  
6.6.1 Site Supply  
Once a site has been approved to receive IMP, the site will be supplied with an initial stock 
of VIT-2763  (dosage strengths of 30  mg and 60  mg) and placebo . The need for IMP 
resupply will be assessed on a regular basis taking into account the number of subjects 
enrolled, and the number of subjects i n screening at the site.  
If a subject is not able to visit the site for IMP resupply in cas e of extraordinary events 
(e.g.,  COVID -19 pandemic), a direct shipment of the study drug to the subject  home/place 
of stay can be implemented, if allowed by the loca l regulations. The shipment will be 
performed by a logistics provider in a traceable and preferably temperature -controlled 
manner, after agreement with the Investigator and on the basis of an Investigator’s 
prescription. The process will be documented adeq uately. Written information on the dose 
regimen will be provided to the subject  along with contact information to site for any 
questions subject may have. The subject will return any unused IMP and empty IMP 
packages by a logistics provider or during the n ext on -site visit as instructed by the 
Investigator.  For further details refer to  Section 8.8. 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 58 of 108 
 6.6.2 Storage 
Upon receipt, all IMPs should be stored accordi ng to the instructions specified on the drug 
labels and accessible to authorised personnel only.  
Each site should have a calibrated thermometer  that records minimum and maximum 
temperatures daily  or the temperature should be monitored continuously using a 
temperature monitoring system . Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log 
should be updated by site personnel at least every workday . This log must be available for 
review by the Monitor/Clinical Research Associate  during on -site monitoring visits.  Should 
the storage temperature be outside the range, the IMP must be quarantined immediately , 
and the Sponsor contacted for guidance.  
6.6.3 Accountability  
The Investigator at each site is responsi ble for the storage and accountability of the IMP  
supplies. The Investigator will ensure that adequate records of the receipt, dispensation , 
administration , and return of the IMP are kept and that the IMP is used only for subjects 
enrolled in the study. Al l data regarding the IMP (including kit and /or batch numbers) must 
be recorded in the eCRF  and on any other relevant forms provided.  
Each study site will maintain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all IMPs dispensed 
and returned. At the end of the study, 1 copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should 
be sent to the Sponsor for the central study file. The original will be kep t in the site files.  
After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all unused materials will 
be returned to the Sponsor. All used IMP containers will be retained at the site by the 
Investigator/qualified designee for the Study Monitor’ s verification. The decision to 
destroy IMPs  at the site must first be made by the Sponsor. If IMP is destroyed at the site, 
the Investigator will forward the certificate of destruction to the Sponsor.  
6.7 Drug Dose Modification  
6.7.1 Procedures for Overdose  
Excessi ve doses of VIT -2763 could cause severe and transient hypoferraemia. Based on 
nonclinical data, ECG monitoring is recommended, and standard emergency treatment 
should be applied. In addition, it theoretically may warrant acute medical management 
following  transient changes in serum iron parameters, e.g., if concurrent (additional) blood 
loss or haemolysis is suspected or if Hb measurements are low enough to cause symptoms 
of decreased oxygen delivery. While it is unlikely that this may occur under the cont rolled 
environment of this study and based on dose -response relationship examinat ions obtained 
from the first -in-human trial in healthy volunteers , further dosing in any affected subjects 
must be stopped immediately and  depending on the observed or reporte d signs or symptoms 
of the subject, standard medical care should be provided.  When VIT-2763  overdose may 
lead to very unlikely cardiac dysrhythmias or widened PR interval or increased QRS 
duration due to block of sodium channel, further VIT-2763  dosing will be stopped,  and it 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 59 of 108 
 may warrant administration of sodium bicarbonate in particular in case these subjects are 
hypotensive and/or comatose. Additional emergency and intensive care must be provided 
in case deemed necessary at the discretion of th e Investigator.  
6.8 Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment  
Prohibited therapies in this study will include the following treatments : 
• Prior or concomitant use of any medication that is known to prolong the QT/QTc 
interval or the PR/QRS interval, within 4 weeks prior to screening  and until EoS . 
• Previous oral or intravenous iron therapy ≤4 weeks prior to screening and until EoS. 
• Any known strong or moderate inhibitors and/or inducers of CYP 3A4 enzyme within 
4 weeks prior to randomisation and during treatment period, or any known strong 
CYP  2D6 inhibitors or inducers, as of 4 weeks prior to screening and until EoS.  
• Receipt of HbS polymerisa tion inhibitors (e.g., voxelotor), L-glutamine, erythropoietin 
stimulating /maturation  agent treatment, crizanlizumab or any other haematopoietic 
growth factor treatment within 5 half -lives of the respective drug  prior to 
screening /Visit V1, or anticipated need for such agents during the study.  
• Any prior gene therapy.  
• Use of chronic anticoagulant therapy unless treatment stopped at least 4 weeks  prior to 
randomisation. Anticoagulant therapies used for prophylaxis for surgery or high -risk 
procedures as well a s low molecular weight  heparin for superficial venous thrombosis 
and chronic platelet aggregation inhibitors including acetylsalicylic acid  are allowed.  
• Iron chelation therapy and RBC transfusion . 
• Current treatment or participation in any other investigational drug study within 
4 weeks prior to screening /Visit V1  and until EoS . 
In case any subject warrants medical care during the course of the study, the Investigator 
will be permitted to prescribe t reatment(s) at their discretion, in order to protect the 
subject’s safety and well -being and according to acceptable standards of medical care.  
Any concomitant treatment given for any reason during the course of the study must be 
recorded on the eCRF and i n the subject’s medical records, including dosage, start and stop

 7. RISKS/PRECAUTIONS  
7.1 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use 
The safety , tolerability , and preliminary efficacy of multiple doses of VIT-2763  in adult 
subjects  with S CD will be investigated in this Phase 2a clinical trial.  
The results of a Phase 1 clinical trial in 72 healthy volunteers showed that treatment with 
single oral doses of VIT -2763 ranging from 5 mg to 240 mg and 7 -day treatment with 
VIT-2763 oral doses of 60 mg QD, 120 mg QD, 60 mg BID, and 120 mg BID was well 
tolerated and no SAEs or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. Safety and tolerability 
data from a Phase 2a clinical study in 25 NTD beta -thalassaemia subjects showed that 
treatment with multiple oral doses of VIT -2763 ranging from 60 mg QD to 120 mg BID 
was well tolerated with a few safety findings of clinical relevance. No SAEs were reported, 
and all AEs were mild to moderate. Treatment regimens showed no differences between 
active and placebo dose groups, both in terms of frequencies and intensity of TEAEs.  
In both studies, there were no findings of clinical relevance with respect to vital signs, 
12-lead ECG, or physical examination throughout the trials. With limited clinical  data 
about previously observed adverse reactions from human studies being available, no 
serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are considered expected by the Sponsor for the 
purpose of expedited safety reporting of SUSAR and annual/aggregate safety reporti ng. 
Excessive doses of VIT -2763 could cause severe and transient hypoferraemia. Based on 
nonclinical data, ECG monitoring is recommended, and standard emergency treatment 
should be applied.  
Caution should be exercised in subjects  with:  
• Iron deficiency  
• Clinically relevant deviations in RBC  or WBC  counts  
Based on the nonclinical safety findings, caution should be exercised in subjects  with:  
• History or clinical finding of cardiac disorders such as clinically relevant cardiac 
arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, coronar y disease, valve disorder, or heart failure  
• Prior or concomitant use of any medication slowing cardiac conduction (PR and QRS 
interval prolongation), or that prolongs the QT/QTc interval  
7.2 Fertility, Contraception and Lactation  
7.2.1 Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of VIT-2763  on human fertility. VIT-2763  produced no 
effects on male or female fertility or early embryonic development at oral doses up to 
200 mg/kg/day in rats . 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 61 of 108 
 7.2.2 Pregnancy  
Data of nonclinical studies of the effect of VIT -2763 on pregnancy and fertility indicate 
that women of childbearing potential should use highly effective methods of contraception 
whilst taking VIT -2763 and until at least 1 week after the last dose. No data on 
breastfeeding has been generated yet, so brea stfeeding must be discontinued during 
treatment with VIT -2763 and for at least 1 week after the last dose.  
Highly effective methods of contraception for female subjects participating in this trial are:  
• Intrauterine device, implants  
• Injectables, and combine d oral contraceptives  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomised partner  
• Sexual abstinence  
• Subject has been surgically sterilised at least 6 months prior to the study  
For female subjects participating in this study, continuous use of hormonal contraception  
alone is not sufficient, because potential interactions via CYP enzymes may alter the  
efficacy of hormonal contraception. The continuous use of hormonal contraception by a  
female subject should be combined with the use of a condom by the male partner; the  
condom should then be used together with a spermicide or adequate and approved  
alternatives.  
For men participating in this study no contraceptive measures are needed.

 8. STUDY PROCEDURES  
For a detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol required assessments, visits 
and visit windows) please refer to Table 1. 
8.1 Screening Visit /Visit 1 (Day -28 to Day -1) 
Before any study -specific procedures are performed, the subject will receive an explanation 
of all study procedures and must sign and date a written ICF approved by an Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB) or equivalent Ethics Committ ee (EC) (see Section 13.2 for additional 
requirements).  
The following activities will be performed at Visit V1: 
• The Investigator will obtain written informed consent/assent from potentially eligible 
subjects and/or legally acceptable guardian before any trial -related procedure is 
performed  
• Review of inclusion a nd exclusion criteria . Any outstanding eligibility criteria (see 
Section 5.2 and Section  5.3) not available during screening  needs  to be available before 
randomisation, including genotyping  (local laboratory haemoglobinopathy 
evaluation/Hb electrophoresis ; see Inclusion Criterion 3), in case not available 
previously  
• Collect demographic  information  
• Review m edical/surgical history  
• Perform p hysical examination . Body systems to be assessed include general appearance, 
head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat), cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological, lymph nodes, and skin  
• Assess  vital signs , e.g., systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , and pulse , after 
subject has rested for at least 5 minutes  
• Record b ody weight  and h eight  
• Perform a single 12-lead ECG  
• As of the date of informed consent for each subject, document in the eCRF all 
SAEs/AEs and changes/additions made to previous and concomitant medications. 
SAEs will be reported as they occur, but no later than 24 hours after th e Investigator’s 
awareness of the event  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 63 of 108 
 • Draw b lood tests using peripheral venipuncture to determine if the subject is eligible 
according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria : 
− Blood sample for optional genotyping for SCD in case no genotype diagnosis exi sts 
(local laboratory)  
− Blood sampl e for assessment of high sensitivity C -reactive protein  (central  
laboratory)  
− Serum ferritin, and TSAT  (for exclusion criteria  only) (central laboratory)  
− Serum pregnancy test (only in females of childbearing potential) for central 
laboratory  assessment

measurement only if positive dipstick  
− Urinary microalbumin, creatinine,  and microalbumin/creatinine ratio (spot urinary 
sample, morning void)  
• Dispense 1 copy of all 6 ASCQ -Me forms  
• Inform subject to complete  all ASCQ -Me forms the day before th e next visit (baseline 
visit/V2)  
8.2 Baseline/Randomisation/Visit 2  (Day 1) 
To accommodate local hospital practice, the subject may attend the V2 visit either on the 
day of the first dose of study treatment  (randomi sation day), or on the day before the 
planned  randomisation day. Note: A planned overnight stay prior to study treatment 
administration does not fulfil the seriousness criteria of an SAE unless there is a medical 
requirement.  
If a subject  cannot return to the site post -randomisation for a study visit  in case of 
extraordinary events (e.g. , COVID -19 pandemic), the Investigator will conduct a remote 
visit (e.g. , telemedicine, phone call), a visit at the subject home, or in facilities near to the 
subject ’s home to evaluate subject safety and eligibility to continue the study therapy, if 
applicable and as per local country guidance  (see Section 8.8).

 8.7 EoS (Follow-up) Procedures /Visit 7 (Day 84) 
On completion of the study (Visit 7/Day 84 ±4 days), all assessments  per Table 1 should be 
performed.  
All subjects whether completing the treatment or who have withdrawn prematurely, will  be 
followed up for 4 weeks (28 ±4 days  after EoT ) after their last administration of IMP to 
collect, at a minimum, any potential new AEs and concomitant medications (or other 
endpoints as defined in Table 1). If the Investigator has not seen the subject at  in-hospital  
visit at the end of the reporting period, the Investigator must attempt 3 telephone calls to 
the subject, and if  there is no response, the source documents and the eCRF should 
document the reason for study discontinuation as “lost to follow -up”. 
The following activities will be performed at Visit V7: 
• Perform physical examination . Body systems to be assessed include general appearance, 
head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat), cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, 
musculoskeletal, neurological, lymph nodes, and skin  
• Assess vital signs, e.g., systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure, and pulse, after 
subject has rested for at least 5 minutes

• Record  VOC episodes (number of events and  pain intensity  (NRS: 0 -10) compared to 
historical VOC episodes). Assess visceral infarctions as per standard of care  
8.8 Allowed Adaptations for Assessments During Site Visits  
To provide some flexibility for specific assessments during the site visits, which can be 
performed post -dose instead of pre -dose as required per the current protocol, the following 
assessments must  be performed  before VIT -2763 morning dose administration at the site:  
• Collection of AEs and changes/additions made to concomitant medications  
• Vital signs assessment  
• Pre-dose single 12 -lead ECG  
• Pre-dose PK blood sample  
• Blood sample to assess Hb to confirm eli gibility at Visit V2 to assess whether  the study 
therapy can be continued ( Visits V2–V5) (local laboratory)  
• Blood sample for pre -dose iron -related parameters  
After Visit V2, the following assessments can also be  performed post VIT -2763 morning 
dose adminis tration at the site:  
• Physical examination  
• Body weight recording  
• RBC blood smear (local laboratory) to assess for sickling cells (central laboratory)  
• Urinalysis sample for central laboratory  
• Blood sample for haematology panel/RBC indices (sample for central  laboratory)

16 March 202 3 Page 74 of 108 
 Other assessments not mentioned within this list are to be followed as per protocol.  
8.9 Allowed Adaptations in Case of Extraordinary Events, e.g., 
COVID-19 
Extraordinary events may call for specific measures to maintain subject sa fety and 
guarantee conduct of clinical investigations according to established general and specific 
guidelines and regulations to meet agreed regulatory, quality, and scientific expectations.  
For this, the following adaptations are considered for specific situations:  
• Site visits are not possible within the defined time window, possibly leading to delayed : 
− Physical examination: consultation by local physician, follow -up assessment and 
guidance on drug adaptations via phone, remote visits at subject’s home (e.g., home

 9. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Demographics and Medical History  
Subject’s demographics (gender, age, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics  
including body weight , and medical history will be taken during the  baseline visit. 
Information to be collected will include the aetiology and clinical  presentation of SCD  
(including HbS /S or HbS/β T0) and SCD -related events  (including pain crisis  and VOC  
episodes , 8 weeks before baseline ), and the date when SCD  was first diagnosed, and  other 
clinically rel evant past and present medical conditions which were  diagnosed/occurred up 
to at least 6 months prior to signing the informed consent and/or  for which the subject is 
currently treated. Any medically important conditions sustained  by the subject which 
exten d beyond 6 months prior to informed consent, should also be  reported in the medical 
history eCRF. Also, the date of the last RBC transfusion obtained  will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
9.2 Symptoms and Signs of Anaemia  
The Investigator must assess signs and symptom s associated to anaemia in SCD : 
• Fatigue, weakness  
• Shortness of breath  
• Pale or yellowish skin  
• And others as per standard of care, including laboratory assessments  
Any new clinically relevant symptom or sign of worsening of SCD  associated  anaemia, or 
any other comorbidity, as assessed by the Investigator, must be reported as an  AE (see 
Section 10). 
The SCD  associated genotype, clinical presentation and RBC transfusion needs  received 
during the past 24 weeks prior to randomisation which are part of the inclusion  criteria, 
must be documented in the source data (see  Section 5.2). 
9.3 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
The body systems to be assessed include : 
• General appearance  
• Head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat)  
• Cardiovascular  
• Respiratory  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 77 of 108 
 • Abdom en 
• Musculoskeletal  
• Neurological  
• Lymph nodes  
• Skin 
In the study, physical examination is performed at screening /Visit V1 (i.e., Day  -28 to 
Day -1) and on Visit s V2 (Day  1), V4 (Day  28), V6 (Day 56), and V7 (Day  84). Facultative 
physical examinations can be performed on indication, i.e., symptom -directed, on all other 
visits.  
Vital signs measurements include diastolic blood pressure , systolic blood pressure , and 
pulse rate. Vital signs are assessed at every v isit. Vital signs should be performed before 
IMP administration (trough) , after a resting period of at least 5 minutes. Any new clinically 
relevant change as assessed by the Investigator, in blood pressure readings, pulse rhythm 
or rate must be reported as  an AE (see Section 10). 
9.4 12-lead ECG  Assessment  
The subject should be resting quietly for a minimum of 5 minutes prior to obtaining the 
single 12 -lead ECG (locally).  
Each lead shall be recorded for at least 3 beats at a speed of 25  mm/s. The following 
parameters will be recorded: ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval and 
QTcF. These parameters plus the judgement by the physician will  be entered in the eCRF. 
Print -outs of ECGs will have to be signed, dated , and filed at the site.  
At baseline, the Investigator must document clinically relevant ECG findings on the 
appropriate baseline eCRF pages and in the subject’s hospital records. Any  new clinically 
relevant ECG finding , or aggravation/worsening of an already existing finding as assessed 
by the Investigator, must be reported as an AE (see Section 10). 
9.5 Documentation of Prior and Concomitant Treatments  
All medications and treatments prescribed at the moment of informed consent must be 
documented on the appropriate eCRF pages. In addition, treatments prescribed up to at least 
3 months prior to obtaining the informed consent must be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF pages, irrespective if the treatment is still ongoing at the time of screening. All 
changes to or addition of concomitant treatments as of informed consent must be re corded 
(including changes in dose, change in formulation, starting or stopping medications) in the 
eCRF. If the indication for changing a subject’s concomitant treatment constitutes a new 
medical condition or a worsening of an existing clinical  condition w hich is considered by 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 78 of 108 
 the Investigator as being clinically relevant, the indication must be documented as an AE 
(see Section 10). 
9.6 ASCQ-Me 
The ASCQ -Me system is a set of questions assessing varying aspects of  quality of life 
associated with SCD.  The total ASCQ -Me measure set consists of both computer -adaptive 
and static (i.e., fixed ; short forms ) scales  [31]. However, in this study the  short  paper form s 
will be used , and these forms need to be completed  out by the subject . 
The paper forms cover 6 topics : 
1. Pain episodes , frequency, and severity  (assessing the last 12 months)  
2. Social functioning impact (assessing the last 30 days)  
3. Emotional impact (assessing the last 7 days)  
4. Pain impact  (assessing the last 7 days)  
5. Sleep impact  (assessing the last 7 days)  
6. Stiffness impact  (assessing the last 7 days)  
9.7 Laboratory Parameters  
In case of pandemic ( e.g., COVID -19) related restriction  and impossibility  of sample 
shipment, or inability of subject to visit the site, inform the Medical Monit or of the study, 
and laboratory assessments  may be performed in a local laboratory at site or near to 
subject’ s home . In order to ensure subject’s safety and study data continuity , these 
parameters should  include  at minimum : haematology panel, chemistry panel , and urine 
pregnancy  test. 
9.7.1 Local Laboratory Parameters  
The following laboratory parameters will be assessed locally : 
• Hb levels from Visit V2 to Visit V5. 
• RBC smear sickling preparation from baseline  (Visit V 2) to EoS (Visit V7).  
• Optional blood sample for SCD genotyping.  
• Urine pregnancy tes t: beta-hCG for females of childbearing potential from baseline/V2 
to EoS/V7.

 10. EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES 
10.1 Definition  of AE 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which doe s not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational ) product, whether or not related to the IMP. 
10.2 AE Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. The AE 
reporting period ends at the last study contact Visit  7/28±4 days after EoT . 
10.3 Eliciting AE  
If the subject reports an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient 
information in order to assess causality  and providing rationales for assessment . This may 
require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone contacts , etc.  
In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non -leading question, 
such as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non -leading 
way about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. 
This information should be collected prior to completion of assessments at all study visits. 
In addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be 
clinically significant by the Investigator will be assess ed as AEs.  
10.4 Assessing AE  
10.4.1 Intensity/Severity  
The intensity of certain events e.g. , laboratory parameters, may be determined according to 
the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs, where the Common Terminology Criteria 
grades relate to severity as follows:  
1. Mild  
2. Moderate  
3. Severe  
4. Life-threatening  
5. Death  
Every change in intensity of a particula r AE experienced by the subject during  the event is 
recorded.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 82 of 108 
 It is important to note the distinctions between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a 
classification of intensity of a specific event  (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial 
infarction); howev er, the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache). An SAE  is an adverse reaction which e ither results in death, is 
life-threatening, requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing 
hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  It is an AE that meets any of the regulatory specified criteria required 
for designation as seriousness (described in Section  10.7.1 ), i.e., a headache may be severe 
(interferes significantly with subject's usual function ) but would not be classified as serious 
unless it met one of  the criteria for SAEs.  
10.4.2 Causality and Reporting  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship 
to the IMP  and any auxiliary medications  for each AE and SAE. The Investigator should 
decide whether, in his or her med ical judgement, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by the investigational product , providing the rationales for his 
assessment . 
If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE/SAE should be 
classifi ed as unrelated or unlikely related and an alternative suspected aetiology should be 
provided if available (i.e., concomitant medications, intercurrent illness/events). Otherwise, 
if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untes ted, for suspecting a 
cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the 
AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE should be considered certainly, probably/likely, or possibly 
related with a rationale behind this assessment provided.  
The foll owing additional guidance may be helpful:  
Term Relationship  Definition  
Certain  Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to 
drug intake  
• Cannot be explained by disease or other drugs  
• Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically)  
• Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e., an 
objective and specific medical disorder or a recognised pharmacological 
phenomenon)  
• Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary  
Probable/  
Likely  Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to 
drug intake  
• Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs  
• Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable  
• Rechallenge not required  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 83 of 108 
 Term Relationship  Definition  
Possible  Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to 
drug intake  
• Could also be explained by disease or other drugs  
• Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
Unlikely  No • Event or laboratory test abnormality with a time to drug i ntake that makes a 
relationship improbable (but not impossible). Disease or other drugs 
provide plausible explanation  
Unrelated  No • Event or laboratory test abnormality which is clearly related to 
circumstances not connected with the drug intake  
 
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the IMP is determined to be “certainly, 
probably/likely, or possibly related”, the event will be considered to be related to the IMP 
for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
10.4.3 Outcome Categorisation  
Outcome may be classified as: recovered/resolved (i.e., without sequelae); 
recovered/resolved with sequelae; recovering/resolving; not recovered/not resolved; fatal; 
or unknown  (if follow -up is not possible).  
If the outcome of an SAE is reported as recove red/resolved with sequelae, the Investigator 
should specify the type of sequelae on the SAE form. If the outcome of an SAE is reported 
as unknown, the Investigator should specify (on the SAE form) the rationale why unknown 
was selected . 
“Fatal” should be r ecorded as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than 1 AE 
is possibly related to the subject's death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the 
AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is the most plausible cause of death. All other 
ongoing AE/SAEs will be recorded as not recovered/not resolved at the time of death.  
In case of a fatal outcome, the Investigator should provide a working diagnosis (event 
which caused outcome, e.g., death due to fatal myocardial infarction) instead of rep orting 
only death , and an autopsy report should be provided whenever available where possible. 
If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), this working diagnosis 
should be replaced by the established cause of death.  
Although “fatal ” is usually an outcome of an event, events such as sudden death or 
unexplained death should be reported as SAEs.  
10.5 Recording and Reporting  
10.5.1 Persistent or Recurrent A E 
AEs that extend continuously, without resolution, between trial assessments should only be 
recorded once in the eCRF.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 84 of 108 
 The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated to 
reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens.  
AEs that resolve and subsequently recur should have each recurrence recorde d separately 
in the eCRF.  
All AEs persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by the Investigator 
through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilisation, or the subject is lost to 
follow -up and cannot be contacted. The outcome must be documented in the subject’s 
source documents.  
10.5.2 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than individual signs and 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory valu es. However, if a constellation of signs and/or 
symptoms cannot be medically characterised as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time 
of reporting, each individual event should be recorded in the eCRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, all pre viously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should 
be nullified and replaced by 1 AE report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date 
that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
The Investigator shou ld use standard medical terminology/concepts; avoid colloquialisms 
and abbreviations. Only 1 AE term should be recorded in each event field in the eCRF.  
10.5.3 Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the screenin g visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the medical history eCRF. A pre -existing medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study. When recording suc h events on the AE eCRF, it is 
important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
10.5.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Not every out -of-range laboratory result quali fies as an AE. A laboratory investigation 
result must be reported as an AE if it is clinically significant  and meets any of the following 
criteria:  
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treat ment interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalaemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 85 of 108 
 • Presents shift of a parameter from a normal value to a pathological value, or results i n 
a deterioration of Common Terminology Criteria  grade, or a further worsening of an 
already pathological value  
• Is clinically significant in the Investigator’s judg ement  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judg ement should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an AE. When evaluating such changes, the extent of 
deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the refe rence range, either 
while continuing treatment or after the EoT with the IMP, and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration.  
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are pathological  laboratory values which were 
not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations should be performed 
until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation 
(e.g.,  concomitant disease) is found for the patholo gical laboratory values.  
The Investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore 
represents an AE. If the Investigator considers  such an AE as serious (e.g.,  medically 
significant event fulfilling criteria per Section 10.7.1 ), it must be reported as an SAE.  
If a laboratory ab normality meeting the above criteria is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
only the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a laboratory abnormality meeting the above criteria is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recor ded in the eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if 
the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., “elevated potassium,” as opposed 
to “abnormal potassium”).  
If the laboratory abnormality can be characterised by a precise clinical term per st andard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE; for example, hypercalcaemia or 
hypoglycaemia. Observations of the same laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded in the eCRF unless the aetiology changes . The initial severity 
of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time 
the event worsens.  
All pathological laboratory findings/values diagnosed throughout the treatment period 
should be reviewed by the Investigat or to provide a final clinical assessment in view of the 
dynamic of laboratory changes/abnormalities.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 86 of 108 
 10.5.5 Worsening of the Disease Under Study  
Signs or symptoms of the disease under study (SCD) that ha ve unexpectedly worsened in 
severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study should be recorded as 
AEs or SAEs, and clearly marked as worsening of the signs or symptoms in the eCRF .  
10.5.6 Abnormal Vital Signs and Other Abnormalities  
Not eve ry abnormal vital sign, ECG, or other safety assessment qualifies as an AE. A result 
must be reported as an AE if it meets the AE definition (Section  10.1) any of the following 
criteria:  
• Accompanied by clinical symptoms or lead s to a diagnosis (in such case the symptom 
or diagnosis will be recorded as an AE)  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, 
or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention, a change in concomitant therapy, or subject referral 
for further testing outside the protocol  
• Clinically significant abnormality in the Investigator’s judg ement  
It is the Investigator’s responsib ility to review all vital sign s, ECG, and other safety findings. 
Medical and scientific judg ement should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.  
If a clinically significant abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  high blood 
pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant abnormality from visit to visit should not be 
repeatedly recorded in the eCRF unless the aetiol ogy changes. The initial severity of the 
event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the 
event worsens.  
10.6 ADR and Reference Safety Information  
10.6.1 Adverse Drug Reaction  
An adverse reaction is a response to a medical produ ct (any dose administered)  that is 
noxious and unintended  related to any dose administrated . A causal relationship between 
an IMP  and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility . This means that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
All AEs judged as having a reasonable causal relationship to a n IMP will be designated as 
ADRs . 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 87 of 108 
 10.6.2 Reference Safety Information  
The Reference Safety Information presents the basis for expectedness assessment of an 
adverse reaction for exp edite reporting and annual safety reporting, as well as surveillance 
of subject’s safety in a clinical trial by regulatory (and ethic) bodies.  
With limited clinical data about previously observed adverse reactions from human studies 
being available, no ser ious ADRs are considered expected by the Sponsor for the purpose 
of expedited safety reporting of SUSARs and annual/aggregate safety reporting.  
10.7 Serious Adverse Event  
10.7.1 Definition of SAE 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occur rence which either results in death, is 
life-threatening, requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing 
hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect : 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (the term life -threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe)  
• Requires in -patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation , unless 
elective surgery (a planned, non -emergency medical procedure)  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an imp ortant medical event (i.e., medically significant)  
Medical and scientific judg ement should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events should also be considered as serious.  
Any worsening of a pre -existing medical condition or any new medical condition that meets 
the above SAE criteria should be considered as an SAE.  
The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the Sponsor (or its delegate , e.g., CRO ), any 
AEs for which the issue of seriousness i s unclear or questionable.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 88 of 108 
 10.7.1.1 Situations That Are Not Considered S AEs 
The following situations are not considered as SAEs:  
• Visits to the emergency room or hospital department that do not result in a hospital 
admission lasting more than 24 hours  
• Elective or pr e-planned surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened  
• Routine health assessments requiring admission not associated with any deterioration 
in condition  
• Social admission (lack of housing, family circumstances, etc.)  
• A planned overnight stay f or logistical reasons only prior to study treatment 
administration does not fulfil the criteria of an SAE unless there is also a m edical reason 
for the admission  
10.7.2 SAE Reporting  
The SAE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. Th e SAE 
reporting period ends 4 weeks  following the last study visit or until  at least 4 weeks  after 
last IMP administration, whichever is longer. The final follow -up visit may be conducted 
as a telephone call rather than a formal visit, but the Investigator must report any SAEs that 
occur during this period. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact 
with the subject (or his/her relatives), th e Investigator must provide a written statement 
(recorded in the subject’s source documents) to the Sponsor (or its delegate, e.g., CRO), 
confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up. Follow -up information must be handled in 
the same way and reported w ithin the same time frame as the initial SAE report . 
A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator 
within  4 weeks  after the last study visit or until at least 4 weeks  after the last IMP 
administration, whichever is longer, whether considered treatment -related or not, must be 
reported to the Sponsor  (or its delegate, e.g., CRO ). Death is an outcome and not an event; 
therefore, the cause of death is required whenever known. If an autopsy was performed, an 
autopsy repor t should be provided. If an autopsy was not conducted, a death certificate 
should be provided, if obtainable.  
Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., related) to the IMP and discovered 
by the Investigator at any time after the study should be reported. A rationale for the 
assessment of a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator. Any safety 
information that is obtained after clinical database lock will be documented in the safety 
database and implications for handling the data  in the clinical database assessed on an 
individual case basis.  
The occurrence of an SAE must be immediately reported to the Sponsor  (or its delegate , 
e.g., CRO) within 24 hours of awareness by facsimile, email , or telephone/via electronic 
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential

 data capture  or as defined in the study monitoring plan . This includes all SAEs (independent 
of relationship to study treatment).  
The onset date of the SAE is defined  as the date the signs and symptoms/diagnosis became 
serious (i.e., met at least one of the criteria for seriousness; see Section 10.1). If the 
condi tion started as a non -serious event and then became serious, 1 AE and 1 SAE will be 
recorded. The resolution date of the SAE is defined as when the symptoms resolve, or the 
event is considered chronic (e.g., sequelae) or stable, and/or if the seriousness c riteria are 
no longer applicable.  
10.7.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
The definition of a SUSAR is a ny ADR (see Section 10.6.1 ) that is both serious (see 
Section  10.7.1 ) and unexpected (per the Reference Safety Information ; see Section 10.6.2 ) 
that, based on the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor,  is felt to have a reasonable  
possibility or  suspected causal relationship to a n IMP . 
10.7.3.1 SAE Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor will notify all Investigators of all SAEs requiring expedited reporting to  
Regulatory Authorities.  
The Investigator is responsible for notifying the Institutional EC  in accordance with local  
regulations of all SAEs that occur. The Investigator must review and file the safety report  
with the I nvestigator ’s Brochure . 
10.7.4 Unblinding Tre atment Allocation  
The Sponsor will only report SUSARs for which the treatment allocation of the subject is 
unblinded to the pertinent Competent Authority. Investigators should only receive blinded 
information unless unblinded information is judged necessar y for safety reasons.  
When an event may be a SUSAR, the blind should be broken only for that specific subject  
(Section 6.1.1 ). 
Unblinded information should only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the 
safety reporting to pertinent Regulatory Authorities, ECs, and the Medical Monitor (i.e.,  the 
individual performing ongoing safety evaluations during the study) . Unblinding must 
always be performed according to the procedures that are specified in applicable CRO 
Standard Operating Procedures.  
10.8 Special Situations  
10.8.1 Definition of Special Situations  
The following are defined as special situations:  
• Use of an IMP during pregnancy or breastfeeding  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 90 of 108 
 • Use of an IMP in a paediatric or elderly population (if this is not the population under 
investigation)  
• Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing or 
administration of an IMP during the study  
• Medication misuse: an intentional a nd inappropriate use of an IMP not in accordance 
with the protocol dose, route of administration, and/or the indication(s)  
• Medication overdose: the administration of a quantity of IMP given per administration 
or cumulatively  per day which is above the prot ocol maximum recommended permitted 
dose 
• Drug interaction involving IMP 
Special situations including medication errors impacting subject’s compliance shall be 
assessed taking into consideration the full period of drug intake and based on criteria 
defined in  the study -specific protocol deviation list.  
Suspected AEs associated with medication errors of the IMP or use outside that foreseen 
in the protocol (e.g., overdose,) are also considered as ADRs. Any special situation 
occurring with/without ADR/AE shall be  recorded in the study -specific documentation.  
10.8.2 Special Situation Recording  and Reporting  
All special situations have to be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documents. 
The Investigator should also complete and submit the Sponsor paper Special Sit uation form 
immediately (i.e. , within 24 hours of awareness) to the Sponsor, following the same 
procedure as for SAEs (Section 10.7.2 ). 
If any special situation leads to an SAE (see Section 10.8.1 ), then the event has to be 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (or its delegate , e.g., CRO) within 24 hours of 
awareness by facsimile, email , or telephone/via electronic data capture , and as defined in 
the safety management plan.  
10.8.3 Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events  
10.8.3.1 Definition of Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events  
When a female subject becomes pregnant during the study and study treatment has been 
administered to the subject, the outcome of the pregnancy needs to be monitored and the 
safety of the mother and unborn child need to be safeguarded (as per  protocol, pregnancy 
is an ex clusion criteria). Therefore, the outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal 
births) must be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the 
study or the study has been completed.  
 
 
VIT-2763 -SCD -202, Version 4.0 Confidential  
16 March 202 3 Page 91 of 108 
 Women of child bearing  potential, defined as a premenopausal female capable of becoming 
pregnant, must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to randomisation. IMP should 
not be initiated by the Investigator until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been 
obtained.  
Highly e ffective contraception must be used in female subjects before beginning IMP, 
during study dosing, and  until at least 1  week following discontinuation of IMP or if 
co-medication is used that requires contraception, e.g., hydroxyurea, as per Prescription 
Information, or according to local requirements, whichever is longer, even when there has 
been a history of infertility, unless due to hysterectomy.  The Investigator should be always 
consulted in all cases of contraceptive discontinuation during the study.  
Highly e ffective contraception must be used (refer to synopsis) unless abstinence is the 
chosen method (abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line 
with the subjects’ usual and preferred lifestyle, and periodic abstinence (calen dar, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) is not an acceptable method of contraception) or 
subject has been surgically sterilised at least 6 months prior to the study. Please also refer 
to the exclusion/inclusion criteria (Section 5). 
A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant during 
the study and be instructed to stop taking IMP. The Medical Monitor must be co ntacted 
immediately to break the blind. The Investigator should counsel the subject and discuss the 
risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the foetus.  
The Investigator/Sponsor is responsible for monitoring the subject and pregna ncy outcome. 
Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 
90 days postpartum (or otherwise as appropriate). It will be the responsibility of the Sponsor, 
together with the appropriate support of the Investigator, to obtain this information.  
10.8.3.2 Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events Recording and Reporting  
Any report of pregnancy recorded for any female subject or for a female partner of a male 
subject should be reported to the Sponsor /CRO  within the same timelines as a n SAE, i.e., 
within 24 hours of awareness. The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) 
must be followed up and documented, even if the subject was discontinued from the study. 
Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or indu ced), premature birth 
(before 37 weeks gestational age) , or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and 
should be reported using the study -specific Sponsor  SAE form.  
All pregnancies occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject within 
30 days after discontinuation of the IMP  should be reported within the same timelines as 
an SAE to the Sponsor/ CRO.

 10.8.4 AEs of Special Interest  
10.8.4.1 Definition of AEs of Sp ecial Interest  
An AE of special interest is a medical occurrence specific to the product or program me, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is 
appropriate. Such an event, depending on the nature and the ou tcome, may be serious (see 
Section 10.7.1 ) or non -serious.  
There are currently no AEs of special interest identified for this study.

 12. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
12.1 Statistical Methods  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc. 
SAS/STAT, Cary, NC). The d etailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of 
the data collected in this trial will be documented in a SAP that will be finalised prior to 
database lock and the unblinding of the study.  
For continuous parameters, s umm ary statistics will include the number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation , quartiles, minimum and maximum , and the 95% confidence interval of 
the mean (if appropriate). For categorical parameters, summary statistics will include 
counts , percentages , and the 95% confidence interval of the percentage s (if appropriate ) in 
each category . 
Summary statistics will be provided on overall subjects receiving VIT -2763, by dose and 
for all subjects receiving placebo . Subjects from Cohort 4a and Cohort 4b will be combined 
into 1 placebo group.  
12.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations  
No specific sample size calculations have been performed for this study.  
It is planned to randomise  24 subjects in a 3:3:3:2:1 ratio into 3 VIT-2763  dose groups and 
2 placebo group s. 
12.3 Randomisation  
All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will  
maintain a list of subject numbers and subject names to enable records to be found at a  later 
date.  
Randomisation of the subject will be performed before start of treatment with IMP using a 
validated centralised IWRS . Stratified r andomisation (balanced all ocation across treatment 
groups ) will be used according to  genotype ( HbS/S - HbS/β T0). 
Subjects eligible for randomisation will receive a randomisation number. Randomised  
subjects who terminate their study participation for any reason regardless of whether the  
IMP was taken or not, will retain their randomisation number. The next subject wil l be 
given the next randomisation number.  
Subjects included to replace subjects who withdraw or drop out or with major protocol 
deviations impacting the primary objective of the trial, will be assigned to the same cohort 
as the subjects they are replacing.

 16. PROCEDURE FOR MODIFICATION OF PROTOCOL OR 
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY 
16.1 Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator will not deviate from the protocol without prior written approval from the 
Sponsor , except in medical emergencies. In the event of a medical emergency, the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor Medical Expert as soon as possible. Any other change 
to the protocol must be implemented as an amendment to the protocol  (see Section 16.2). 
The criteria describing protocol deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be 
documented in the SAP.  
16.2 Protocol Amendments  
Protocol amendments, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to subjects, 
must be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor . Each applicable Regulatory 
Authority/IRB/IEC will review and approve amendments prior to their implementatio n. 
Regulatory Authority/IRB/IEC approval need not be obtained prior to removal of an 
immediate hazard to subjects.  
16.3 Study Termination  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time. 
Reasons for termination may  include (but are not limited to) unsatisfactory subject 
enrolment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol or G ood Clinical Practice , or data recording is inaccurate 
and/or incomplete.  
In term inating the study, the Sponsor  and the Investigator will assure that adequate 
consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. Both parties will arrange 
the procedures on an individual basis after review and consultation and in accordan ce with 
the study contract.  
To protect clinical trial subjects from immediate hazards to their health and safety, urgent 
safety measures, e.g., procedures (including temporary halt of a study) that are not defined 
by the protocol, may be initiated immediat ely by the Investigator or Sponsor and without 
the need to gain prior authorisation by Regulatory Agencies and Competent 
Authorities /Ethic Committees . Detailed guidance and training regarding procedures for 
immediate reporting of urgent safety measures will be provided to the Investigators and 
sites prior to study initiation.

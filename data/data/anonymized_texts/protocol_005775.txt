Name of Sponso r/Company: OmegaD LLC  
Name of Investigational Product: OmegaD softgels and placebo softgels  
Name of Active Ingredient: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/doc osahexaenoic acid (DHA), Omega -3 
fatty acids in  the triglyceride form  
Title of Study:  A Randomized, Multicenter, Double -Masked, Placebo -Controlled Study of the Safety 
and Efficacy of OmegaD Softgels in the Tr eatment of Dry Eye Disease  
Studied Period (Years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: September  2016  
Estimated date last patient completed: May 2017 Phase of Development:  
3 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of  twice daily 
(BID) dosing of  OmegaD softgels  in the treatment of subjects with dry eye disease.  
Methodology: This will be a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study. 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days (12 weeks)  as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID  (2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before 
breakf ast and 2 softgels 5 –  10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before 
breakfast and 2 softgels 5 –  10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels  to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and placebo 
will be identical- appearing softgels.  
At Screening (Day -7 to Day -1), sites will obtain s igned informed consent, demographic information, 
medical/ocular and concomitant medication histories, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of 
childbearing potential only), conduct screening examinations (tear osmolarity testing, meibomian gland 
dysfunction grading, tear break -up time (TBUT), Schirmer’s test), and assess adverse events (AEs) . 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 0) and the site 
will update concomitant medications and conduct baseline examinations  (Ocular Surface Disease Index 
(OSDI) questionnaire , tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, slit lamp examination, 
TBUT) . Continuing eligibility for enrollment will require tear osmolarity ≥  312 mOsm/L and 
meibomian gland dysfunction as defined by a grade  of 1 or 2 on  the meibomian orifice size scale in at 
least one eye  at both  Screening and Baseline,  TBUT ≤  7 seconds in both eyes  at both Screening and 
Baseline , and the Schirmer’s test score from  Screening  must be  ≥ 5 mm  in both eyes . The qualifying 
osmolarity level  and meibomian orifice size  grade  must be present in the same eye at both Screening 
and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . After inclusion/exclusion criteria are review ed, the site will 
randomize eligible subjects.  The Omega -3 Index score will be assessed via fingerstick blood sample 
and site personnel will dispense study medication  and a daily study medication diary and assess AEs.  
Subjects will take 2 softgels twice da ily 5 to 10 minutes before a meal (ie, 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes 
before breakfast and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner). Daily reminders to take the medication 
will be provided, and subjects will document their compliance in terms of number of softg els taken in 
the study medication diary on a daily basis.

    Methodology (Continued):  
Each subject will return to the site at Day  42 (± 7 days) along with all unused study medication and the 
study medication diary  and site personnel will update concomitant m edications, conduct a slit lamp 
examination, dispense study medication, assess AEs, and perform study medication accountability  and 
diary review .  
Subjects will return to the site at Day  84 (± 7 days) , along with all unused study medication and the 
study m edication diary , for final safety and efficacy evaluations . Site personnel will update 
concomitant medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential), conduct 
all ophthalmic assessments as specified  in the Schedule  of Procedures,  the Omega -3 Index via 
fingerstick blood sample , assess AE s, and perform study medication accountability  and diary review .  
Both eyes will be assessed at each visit. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be 
documented from signing of informed con sent at Screening to Day 84.  
Number of Patients (Planned): Approximately 164 subjects are planned to be enrolled; 
approximately 82 subjects in each treatment arm at approximately 15 clinical sites ; however, when 
90 subjects have completed treatment  a rev iew of treatment compliance will be conducted . If more than 
10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized  to achieve 
a study population in which  90% are compliant .

Visit 2 (Day 0): Baseline  
The site will update concomitant medications, conduct baseline examinations including  the OSDI, tear 
osmolarity testing, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, slit -lamp examination, and TBUT and then 
review inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
In order to meet inclusion re quirements, subjects must have tear osmolarity ≥ 312 mOsm/L and 
meibomian gland dysfunction as defined by a grade  of 1 or 2 on the meibomian orifice size  scale in at 
least one eye  at both Screening and Baseline , TBUT  ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes at both Screen ing and 
Baseline , and the Schirmer’s test score from Screening  must be > 5 mm in both eyes. The qualifying 
osmolarity level  and meibomian orifice size  grade  must be present in the same eye at both Screening 
and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . The study  eye will be the worse eye at Baseline as defined by 
lower TBUT score ; if both eyes score equally  on TBUT , the eye with the higher tear osmolarity score 
will be chosen, and if still equal , the right eye  will be the study eye . Site personnel will then randomize 
eligible subjects, perform the HS -Omega -3 Index Test will be via fingerstick blood sample, 
dispense/document study medication and a daily study medication diary and provide instructions for use, and assess AEs.  
Subjects should be reminded to bring all  study medication and the study medication diary to the 
clinical site at Visit 3 (Day 42). If the study medication and diary are  not brought to the site, the visit 
must be rescheduled.  
Visit 3 (Day 42 ± 7 days):  Safety and Accountability Visit  
The site wil l collect unused study medication and the study medication diary, update concomitant 
medications, perform a slit -lamp examination, dispense study medication, assess AEs, and conduct 
study medication accountability and diary review.  
Subjects should be reminded to bring all study medication and the study medication diary to the 
clinical site at Visit 4(Day 84). If the study medication and diary are not brought to the site, the visit 
must be rescheduled.  
Visit 4 (Day 84 ± 7 days): Final Treatment Visit  
The sit e will collect unused study medication and the daily study medication diary, update concomitant 
medications, perform urine pregnancy test, conduct final ophthalmic examinations (OSDI, tear 
osmolarity, meibomian gland grading, slit -lamp examination, TBUT, a nd Schirmer’s test),  Omega -3 
Index via fingerstick blood sample, assess AEs, and conduct final study medication accountability and 
diary review.  
Clinical site personnel will document all received and returned study medication at each visit  and 
review the s tudy medication diary . Study medication accountability will be conducted by the monitor at 
each applicable monitoring visit.  
If a study subject is discontinued from study medication before Visit 4 or is generally noncompliant 
with the protocol, every effor t should be made to keep the subject in the study and conduct all study 
visits as scheduled or, failing that, to perform all Visit 4 procedures at the visit the subject is discontinued.

    Efficacy Assessments:  
Signs: TBUT, tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, Schirmer’s test (anesthetized).  
Symptoms: OSDI questionnaire.  
Pharmacokinetics: Omega -3 Index Test  
Safety Assessments: Safet y assessments will include slit -lamp examination, collection of AEs, and 
documentation of concomitant medicat ions.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint s:  
The primary  efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hypotheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion.  
• Mean change from baseline in TBUT in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
• Mean change from  baseline in OSDI score at Visit 4 (Day 84)  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. In order 
to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order described above. If the null hypothesis for the TBUT  endpoint c an be rejected at P ≤ 0.05, the OSDI  endpoint 
will be tested at P ≤ 0.05.  
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint:  
• Proportion of subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction grade of 0 on both meibomian 
orifice  size and telangiectasia scales in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
• Mean change from baseline in tear osmolarity in the study eye at Visit 4 (Day 84).  
• Mean change from Screening in Schirmer’s test (anesthetized) score in the study eye at 
Visit  4 (Day 84).  
Safety Endpoint:  
• Incide nce of adverse events.  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Population:  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT): The ITT population will include all randomized subjects.  
• Per protocol (PP): The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the study through Visit 4 and who did not deviate from the protocol in any way likely to seriously affect 
the primary outcome of the study. 
• Safety: The safety population will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of 
the study medication.

    Statistical Methods (Contin ued):  
Statistical Analyses:  
Analysis of TBUT , meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osmolarity, and Schirmer’s test  scores will 
utilize the designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by  lower TBUT score ; if both eyes 
score equally  on TBUT , the eye with the higher tear osmolarity score will be chosen, and if still equal  
the right eye  will be the study eye ) to assess the significance of the differences between OmegaD and 
placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the subject.   
Statistical  significance for the comparison of means will utilize the t -test or analysis of covariance. 
Statistical significance for binary data will be assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's exact, or 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical 
variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary tables will be 
supporte d with individual subject data listings.  
Sample Size:  
TBUT: A sample size of 82 in each group will have 95% power to detect a difference in means of 
2.07 seconds assuming that the common standard deviation is 3.5 using a two- group t -test with a 0.05 
two-sided significance level.   
OSDI:  A sample size of 82 in each group will have approximately 95% power to detect a difference in 
means of 11.390 assuming that the common standard deviation is 20.0 using a two -group t -test with a 
0.05 two- sided significance level. 
When 90 subjects have completed treatment a review of treatment compliance will be conducted. If more than 10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized 
to achieve a study population in which 90% are comp liant.

   4. INTRODUCTION 
4.1. Background  Information  
Dry eye disease is a common multifactorial ophthalmologic disorder of the tears and ocular 
surface. Dry eye affects approximately 4.9 million people  (3.2 million women and 1.7 million 
men) 50 years and older in in the United States (U S) (Schaumberg et al, 2003; Schaumberg et al, 
2009) . Inflammation is an integral component of this disease, as shown by increased expression 
of inflammatory mediators on the ocular surface  such as interleukin  1 (IL -1), tumor necrosis 
factor  alpha (TNF -α) and matrix metalloproteinase  3 and 9 (MMP -3, MMP -9) (Pflugfelder, 
2004) . This is supported by the observation that Restasis® (cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion, 
0.05%), a drug that targets the immune system, is approved for the indication of increased tear production in patients whose tear production is presumed to be suppressed due to ocular 
inflammation associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca  and effectively treats these symptoms  in 
some patients. The efficacy of Restasis is considered to be modest and ocular burning after 
instillation, the most common adverse reaction, sometimes limits patient compliance and leads to 
discontinuation of the drug . There is a clear medical need for more effective therapies.  
4.2. Rationale for the Development of OmegaD softgels  for the Treatment 
of Dry Eye  
Among alternative drug treatments for dry eye, oral treatment with omega -3 fatty acid 
supplements, in particular the marine omega -3s eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 
docos ahexaenoic acid (DHA) , appears to be promising. Essential fatty acids have been shown to 
diminish inflammatory responses in many human inflammatory diseases.  
EPA and DHA compete for the same enzymes as the omega -6 fatty acid,  arachidonic acid (AA ). 
As ome ga-3 levels increase relative to omega -6 levels , the competition for cyclooxygenase  and 
5-lipoxygenase suppresses AA synthesis of inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and 
leukotriene B 4 (LTB4) , and increases  EPA and DHA synthesis of  anti-inflamma tory (PGE 1) and 
weakly inflammatory (PGE3) mediators. This shifts the balance to a less inflammatory mixture  
of eicosanoids ( James et al, 2000 ). EPA and DHA supplementation also decrease s monocyte 
synthesis of cytokines TNF -α and IL -1β, with cytokine synthesis decreasing as cellular EPA 
concentrations increase ( Caughey et al, 1996) . More recently , EPA and DHA derivatives , 
resolvins  and protectins, have been shown to act to initiate the resolution of inflammation  by 
enhancing macrophage clearance of leukocyt es (Kohli and Levy, 2009 ).  
Because inflammation is a key component of dry eye disease and increasing the systemic levels of omega -3 fatty acids relative to omega -6 levels can mediate immune responses, it is important 
to evaluate whether omega -3 supplement ation  can improve dry eye disease signs, symptoms and 
associated measures of inflammation. In clinical studies conducted with patients with dry eye, 
oral supplementation with omega -3s has been found to produce significant improvement in dry 
eye symptoms, a nd improvement in various dry eye signs has been observed, most often 
increased tear break -up time ( TBUT ), with  increased Schirmer’s test scores and improved 
meibum characteristics reported by several investigators ( Bhargava et al, 2013 ; Kangari et al, 
2013; Kawakita et al, 2013 ; Macsai, 2008; Oleñik et al, 2013; Wojtowicz et al, 2011) .

18 
   On the basis of the clinical development conducted by Physician Recommended Nutriceuticals 
(PRN) with PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits®, OmegaD is now developing OmegaD softgels. A 
randomized, masked clinical trial was conducted with 105 subjects with dry eye who were randomized to 4 Dry Eye Omega Benefits or placebo (safflower oil) softgels daily and treated for 
3 months. Statistically significantly decreased tear osmolarity and d ry eye Ocular Surface 
Disease Index (OSDI) symptoms, and significantly increased TBUT were observed for subjects 
who received Dry Eye Omega Benefits versus placebo ( Donnenfeld et al, 2015). The safety 
profile appeared to be satisfactory; 4 subjects in each  treatment group reported adverse events 
(AEs) (Omega Benefits 7.5%, placebo 8.0%). A ll the AEs reported for the Omega Benefits 
group were mild, these included stomach upset (2 subjects), diarrhea, headache, upper 
respiratory infection, and flu. The stomac h upset reported for one subject and the diarrhea 
reported for another were considered possibly related to study drug. O megaD softgels is a  
formulation that is similar to Dry Eye Omega Benefits  with only slightly different amounts of 
EPA and DHA.  
Although numerous clinical studies have been conducted to study the efficacy of various doses 
and formulations of omega -3 fatty acids, the commercially available omega- 3 supplements used 
for dry eye disease are supported by g eneral health claims , and while subject to Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA ) regulation  as food supplements, the FDA may not have reviewed the 
clinical data to support activity in dry eye disease . OmegaD LLC plans to conduct a clinical 
program to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a controlled , pharmaceutical grade omega- 3 oral 
supplement for dry eye disease.  
4.3. Justification for Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period  
The omega -3 daily dose to be utilized in OmegaD -2016- 001, 1680 mg of EPA and 560 mg of 
DHA,  is the same dose utilized in the PRN study  in which significant separation was observed 
between OmegaD and placebo in OSDI symptoms, TBUT, and tear osmolarity  (Donnenfeld et 
al, 2015) , and it appeared to be well tolerated based on the low number of AEs reported  
(unpublished data) . The daily amount of omega -3 in OmegaD is less than that present in Lovaza® 
capsules (1860 mg of EPA and 1500 mg of DHA), the FDA -approved EPA/DHA product  
indicated for the reduction of triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, the safety of which was established in the clinical trials conducted in support of approval. The 
treatment period of 3 months is considered sufficient to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
OmegaD softgels and is a standar d study duration in trials of dry eye disease.  
4.4. Good Clinical Practices Statement  
This study  will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all 
statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with International Conferenc e of 
Harmonis ation  (ICH) guidelines, and all appl icable US  federal r egulations and local legal and 
regulatory requirements.  
4.5. Population to Be Studied  
Study subjects will be ≥ 18 years and ≤ 90 years  of age, with patient -reported dry eye symptoms 
and a clini cal diagnosis of dry eye disease supported by global clinical assessment. Each subject 
must have, in at least one eye, tear osmolarity of ≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This will be  a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo- controlled study. Subjects will 
be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for 84 days  (12 weeks ) as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before 
breakfast and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID (2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before 
breakfast and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner) for 84 days  
Comparisons of OmegaD softgels to placebo will be double -masked; OmegaD softgels and 
placebo will be identical -appearing softgels.  
At Screening (Day - 7 to Day - 1), sites will obtain signed informed consent, demographic 
information, medical/ocular and concomitant medication histories, perform a u rine pregnancy 
test (women of childbearing potential only) , conduct screening examinations (tear osmolarity 
testing, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT, Schirmer’s test), and  assess AEs.  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be reviewed.  
Subjects w ho meet eligibility criteria at Screening will return to the site at Baseline (Day 0) and 
the site will update concomitant medications and conduct baseline examinations beginning with the OSDI  questionnaire . Continuing eligibility for enrollment will require tear osmolarity 
≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction grade 1 or 2 on the meibomian orifice  size 
scale in at least one eye at both Screening and Baseline , TBUT ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes  at 
both Screening and Baseline , and the Schirmer’s test score from  Screening  must be  ≥ 5 mm in 
both eyes . The qualifying osmolarity level and meibomian orifice size  grade  must be present in 
the same eye at both Screening and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . The study eye will be the 
worse eye at Baseline as defined by lower TBUT score; if both eyes score equally on TBUT, the 
eye with the higher tear osmolarity score will be chosen, and if still equal, the right eye will be 
the study eye.  After inclusion/exclusion criteria are reviewed, the site will randomize eligible 
subjects.  The Omega -3 Index score will be assessed via fingerstick  blood sample  and site 
personnel will dispense study medication and a daily study medication diary  and assess AEs.  
Subjects will take 2 softgels twice daily 5 to 10 minutes befor e a meal ( ie, 2 softgels 
5 - 10 minutes before breakfast and 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner). Daily reminders to 
take the medication will be provided, and subjects will document their compliance in terms of number of softgels taken in the study medication d iary on a daily basis.  
Each subject will return to the site at Day 42 (± 7 days) along with all unused study medication and the study medication diary and site personnel will update concomitant medications, conduct 
a slit- lamp examination, dispense study m edication, assess AEs, and perform study medication 
accountability  and diary review .  
Subjects will re turn to the site at Day 84 (±  7 days) , along with all unused study medication and 
the study medication diary , for final safety and efficacy evaluations . Site personnel will update 
concomitant medications, perform a urine pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
22 
   only), conduct all specified ophthalmic assessments, assess the Omega- 3 Index score via 
fingerstick blood sample, assess AEs, and perform stu dy medication accountability  and diary 
review . 
Both eyes will be assessed at each visit. Adverse events and concomitant medications will be 
documented from signing of informed consent at Screening to Day 84  
6.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately  164 subjects  are planned to be enrolled; approximately 82 subjects in each 
treatment arm at up to 15 clinical sites ; however, when 90 subjects have completed treatment a 
review of treatment compliance will be conducted. If more than 10% of subjects have protocol 
deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in 
which 90% are compliant. 
6.3. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be terminated at any time by OmegaD LLC , following appropriate notification.

 25  
    8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1. Description of Study Drug  
8.1.1. Investigational Product  
The daily dose of OmegaD softgels, 4 softge ls, contains 1680 mg of EPA and 560 mg of DHA , 
with other naturally occurring omega -3 fatty acids, an antioxidant (alpha tocopherol), and a 
flavoring agent in a softgel shell composed of gelatin, glycerin, and colorant . The softgel is 
formulated with the o mega -3 fatty acids in the  triglyceride form . 
8.1.2. Reference Therapy  
The placebo softgels contain safflower oil  in a softgel shell composed of gelatin, glycerin, and 
colorant .  
8.2. Randomization and Masking  
Study medication will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (O megaD to placebo). A randomized block 
design will be used, and the randomization will be created by the biostatistician. 
If subjects meet eligibility criteria at Screening and at Baseline (see Section 7 for eligibility  
criteria), subjects will be randomly assigned to study medication at the Baseline visit. Clinical  
sites will assign the next subject kit, taken sequentially, from the lowest to the highest numbered 
kits from within each shipment of study medication. The drug kit randomization number will be 
recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
A supply of randomized study medication from the assigned kit sufficient to last until Day 42 
will be dispensed to the subject at the Baseline visit; and at the Day 42 visit a supply of 
randomized study medication from the assigned kit  sufficient to last until Day 84 will be 
dispensed. 
8.2.1. Unmasking During the Study Period 
Should it be necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the 
investigator may obtain the tr eatment code for a given randomized subject  from the 2 -part 
tear-off label from  the subject’s study medication kit. The randomization code is to be obtained 
only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the medication being taken will influence the m edical management of the subject. In the event of emergency or life -threatening condition, 
the investigator may need to unmask the subject. The following procedure should be followed:  
1. The Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor via phone immediatel y before 
unmasking a subject, unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject. 
2. The Investigator should document the serious adverse event ( SAE ) and justification for 
unmasking in the Study Summary and C omments pages of the eCRF.  
3. The Subject  may continue to participate in the study at the Investigator’s discretion. If the 
subject is to be discontinued from study participation, then ALL procedures described in 
the Early Discontinuation Visit (Section 10.5) should be completed.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 26  
    4. The Investigator should contact Oculos  Clinical Research, the clinical research 
organization, at OmegaD -safety @pointguardllc .com  within 24 hours with the 
randomization number, subject initials, details of the AE or SAE, any action taken, and 
whether the subject is continuing in the study.  
8.3. Concomitant Medications  
8.3.1. Permitted Medications and Treatments  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare that will not interfere with the evaluation 
of the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. If there is any question 
as to whether the medication may interfere, the Investigator should contact the Medic al Monitor 
or Sponsor. Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain 
constant throughout the study duration.  
Artificial tear use is permitted during the study period, but it should be continued at the same 
frequency and with no change in drop brand.  
8.3.2. Prohibited Medications  
The Medical Monitor should be notified before prohibited medication or therapy is administered unless the safety of the subject requires immediate action. The decision to administer a prohibited medication or  therapy should be done with the safety of the subject as the primary 
consideration. The Medical Monitor MUST be contacted to determine the permissibility of a specific medication or therapy and whether or not the subject should continue with study partici pation. 
For systemic medications known to affect tear production, any new medication or change in the dose of the medication within 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study period is prohibited as follows:  
• Immunomodulators  
• Antihistamines  
• Tricycl ic antidepressants  
• Diuretics  
• Corticosteroids  (intranasal, inhaled, topical dermatological, and perianal steroids are 
permitted).  
Chronic daily use (defined as > 7 consecutive days at the recommended dosing frequency) of 
oral NSAIDs  during  the study period is prohibited.  ANY use of oral NSAIDS during the study 
period must be discussed with the Medical Monitor . Aspirin is permitted.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 27  
    Prohibited ophthalmic medications and therapies  within 21 days prior to Screening and 
throughout the study period include the us e of any topical prescription ophthalmic medications 
as follows:  
• Cyclosporine (i.e., Restasis)  
• Steroids  
• NSAIDs  
• Antiglaucoma medications  
• Macrolides  
Additionally, oral nutraceuticals [fish, flax, black currant seed oils, etc.] are prohibited within 
21 days p rior to Screening and throughout the study period. 
Contact lens and ophthalmic drop use  (e.g., artificial tears) , while permitted during the study 
period, are prohibited within designated time periods prior to any study visit. Contact lens wear is prohibit ed within 12 hours prior to any study visit
 (subjects determined to have worn contact 
lenses within 12 hours must  be rescheduled) , and ophthalmic drop use is prohibited within 2 hours 
prior to any study visit.  
The following procedures are prohibited as sp ecified:  
• LASIK or PRK performed within one year prior to Screening and throughout the study period.  
• Punctal cauterization or punctal plug placement within 60 days prior to Screening  and 
throughout the study period. 
8.4. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment complianc e will be monitored by study medication accountability  and subjects’ daily 
study medication diaries . The amount of unused softgels returned at the Day 42 and Day 84 
visits  and the  information provided in the study medication diaries by subjects will be 
documented by study site personnel  in the electronic data capture (eDC) system.  
8.5. Discontinuation of Study Medication  
Subjects may be discontinued from study medication  for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject has a clinically significant or serious AE tha t would not be consistent 
with continuation in the study, as  determined by the Investigator  or Medical Monitor  
− It is possible for subjects to experience a skin rash or other allergic reaction related to the components of the softgels; if this occurs, the s ubject should 
discontinue the medication. 
• Pregnancy  
If a subject is discontinued from study medication or is generally non compliant with the 
protocol , every effort should be made to encourage the subject to continue to attend study visits 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264

Study medication will be packaged and labeled at a central packaging facility. Each subject kit will consist of a single box with 5 bottles of study medication. Upon randomization each eligible subject will receive 2  bottles of study medication. The study site will retain 3 bottles, 2  of which 
will be dispensed at the Day 42 visit, and 1 extra bottle in case of loss or damage .  
8.6.2. Storage  
Store at controlled room temperature: 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F). Do not freeze. Keep out of reach of children.  
8.6.3. Administr ation  
Following randomization, site personnel will dispense study medication and instruct the subject on administration procedures. The daily dose is 4 softgels daily, which is recommended to be taken as 2 softgels 5 – 10 minutes before breakfast and 2 sof tgels 5 – 10 minutes before dinner. 
Taking the softgels just before meals is important to minimize any digestive upset, such as belching and indigestion. If the subject can tolerate it, all 4 softgels may be taken 5 -  10 minutes 
before a single meal ; the timing of the dose is not as important as taking all 4 softgels.  
8.6.4. Dispensing  
At randomization, a  kit with 2 bottles of study medication (sufficient study medication to last 
until the Day 42 visit with a little overage) and a study medication diary will be di spensed to the 
subject with instructions to return the kit along with all unused study medication  and the 
completed study diary  at the Day 42 visit. A t the Day 42 visit, the unused study medication will 
be counted, and the site will dispense 2 bottles of s tudy medication (sufficient study medication 
to last until the Day 84 visit with a little overage)  and the study medication diary with 
instructions to return the kit  along with all unused study medication and the completed study 
diary  at the Day 84 visit.  
8.6.5. Study Medication Accountability  
The Investigator or designee (e.g., study coordinator or pharmacist) will maintain a full 
accountability record for the study medication and will be responsible for recording the receipt, 
dispensing, and return of all suppli es of the study medication using the inventories supplied by 
Oculos . Clinical site personnel will document all dispensed and returned study medications at 
Baseline (Day 0) , Day 42 , and Day 84 and study drug accountability will be conducted by the 
monitor a t each applicable monitoring visit.  
As described in Section 8.6.4, the subject will return all unused study medication  and the study 
medication diary  at Days 42 and 84. The monitor will review dispensing and drug  accountability 
records during site visits and at the completion of the study and note any discrepancies.

    9. STUDY ASSESSME NTS  
Prior to entry into the study or initiation of any study -related procedures, the subject must read, 
sign, and date the current Institutional Review Board (IRB) -approved version of the informed 
consent form. A full discussion of informed consent is pres ented in Section  13.3. 
9.1. Demographic and Background Characteristics  
9.1.1. Demographic Information  
Demographic information including date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, and date of informed 
consent will be recorded.  
9.1.2. Medical/Ocular History  
Clinically significant medical and ophthalmic history will be documented and will include any 
previously diagnosed ophthalmic abnormalities and ocular surgeries, including laser and 
non-laser procedures.  
9.1.3. Concomitant Medications Histor y 
All concomitant medications (prescription and OTC) taken at Screening  and for 3 months prior 
to Screening and throughout the course of the study will be recorded in the Concomitant Medications page of the eCRF . Information regarding the dates of first and last dose, site of 
dosing (e .g., right eye, left eye, both eyes, systemic), and the reason the concomitant medication 
is being taken must be recorded in the e CRF . When a concomitant medication has been taken at 
a stable dose for longer than 6 months, an estimation of the start date is adequate.  Standard 
procedural medications will not go into the e CRF  but are recorded on a standard procedural 
medication log provided by Oculos  Clinical Research . 
9.1.4. Urine Pregnan cy Test  
A urine pregnancy test will be performed at Screening  and repeated at the End of Treatment Visit 
(Day 84) or the Early Discontinuation Visit for women of childbearing potential only.  
9.2. Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.1. Signs  
9.2.1.1. Tear Osmolarity  
Tear osmolarity will b e tested via the Tear Lab Osmolarity Test.  The osmolarity testing must 
precede all other diagnostic examinations  (except the OSDI at Visits 2 and 4) , and the subject 
must refrain from administrating any tear supplements within two hour s prior to the tear 
osmolarity test.

Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 31  
    9.2.1.2. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Grading  
Using a slit- lamp at a magnification of 10 to 16X, the eyelids of each eye will be evaluated  
utilizing the following scale s: 
Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Grading Scale s 
A. Meibomian Orifice Size Scale 
GRADE  EYELID MARGIN MEIBOMIAN ORIFICE SIZE FINDINGS  
0 Orifice barely visible.  
1 Orifice  easily visible in at least 5 orifices.  
2 Orifice d ilated with meibum plug which may extend above the lid margin in at least 
5 orifices . 
3 Orifice keratinized over in at l east 5 orifices.  
A grade of 1 or 2 in meibomian orifice size in at least one eye is required for eligibility into the 
study. A grade of 0 or 3 in both eyes excludes the patient from study participation. The 
qualifying osmolarity level and meibomian orific e size  grade  must be present in the same eye  at 
both Screening and Baseline  if only one eye qualifies . 
B. Telangiectasia Scale  
GRADE  EYELID MARGIN TELANGIECTASIA FINDINGS  
0 No blood vessels present between meibomian glands.  
1 One (1) blood vessel present be tween 4 pairs of glands/orifices  
2 More than 1 vessel between 4 pairs of glands/orifices  
3 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of glands/orifices.  
4 More than 1 vessel with vasodilation between 4 pairs of glands/orifices with erythema of 
the tissue.  
A certain score on the telangiectasia scale is not required for study entry, nor is it an exclusion 
criterion . The telangiectasia and meibomian orifice size  scales will provide additional detailed 
information with which to track the progress /resolution of meibomian gland disease.  
9.2.1.3. Tear Break -Up Time  
A drop of Fluress® is added to the eye  and the patient may blink once to disperse it. Then while 
the subject avoids blinking , the tear film is observed under t he slit- lamp through a cobalt blue 
filter and timed until tiny dry spots develop. The procedure is conducted 3 times for each eye and 
the TBUT  for each is  measured in seconds and recorded in the e CRF.  The average for each eye 
will be calculated by the eDC system.  
9.2.1.4. Schirmer’s Test (Anesthetized)  
An anesthetized Schirmer’s test will be performed to insure that only basal tear secretion is being measured  and to prevent tearing due to the irritation from the filter paper  (the eye s will already 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 32  
    have been anesthetized  for the TBUT procedure). F ilter p aper strips will be placed in both eyes 
inside the lower eyelid (conjunctival sac) at the same time. The eyes are closed for 5 minutes. 
The paper is then removed and the amount of moisture on each strip in millimeters (mm) is 
measured and recorded in the e CRF.  
9.2.2. Symptoms  
The OSDI questionnaire (Appendix A ) will be provided to the study subject, who will be asked 
to circle the number that corresponds with the frequency of dry eye symptoms experienced over the past week. Site personnel will enter t he scores in the eCRF. The e DC system will 
automatically calculate the final score.  
9.3. Safety Assessments  
9.3.1. Slit-Lamp Examination  
A routine slit- lamp examination will be performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye, 
inclu ding lids, cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Abnormalities will be 
documented.  
9.4. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
9.4.1. Omega -3 Index Test  
The Omega -3 Index Test measures the concentration of two specific omega -3 fatty acid s, EPA  
and DHA, as a percent of total fatty acids in red blood cell membranes. This test is performed by 
using a contact -activated lancet to collect a drop or two of blood on a collection card. Each card 
is identified and packaged to be submitted to OmegaQuant (Sioux Falls, SD) for analysis.  
9.5. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.5.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
9.5.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a study medication (pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not  necessarily have a causal 
relationship to this medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication 
includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo 
that is given during any phase of the study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investig ational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occur rence of AEs should be sought by open -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Have 
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 33  
    you had any problems since your last visit?” AEs also may be detected when  they are 
volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through study assessments. 
9.5.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers t o an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding 
progress ion/outcome of the disease under study);  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or  
• Is medically significant; ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject o r may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not considered an SAE.  
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until sta bilization (i.e., no other change in the condition is expected) or resolution of the 
event.  
9.6. Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study medication should be assessed by the Investigator using the definitions below. 
Not suspected: The te mporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide 
a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.”  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 34  
    If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by the 
Sponsor  or designee to be “suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting  (see Section 9.8) . 
9.7. Recording Adverse Events  
Advers e events spontaneously reported by the subject and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation, regardless of severity or potential 
association with the study medication or study procedures, will be recorded in the e CRF . 
Clinically significant changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs ; 
however , Omega -3 treatment has been demonstrated to have beneficial effects on blood pressure 
and heart rate. Only clinically significant changes (increase o r decrease)  in heart rate should be 
reported as AEs . All AEs that occur after a subject has signed the informed consent form  until 
the final study visit, Visit 4 ( Day 84) , should be collected and recorded on the AE e CRF  page. 
AEs that occur after informed consent is provided but before the first dose of study medication 
will be summarized  separately from AEs that occur from the first dose of double -masked 
treatment on Day 0 to the Day 84 visit . Serious adverse events will be followed until the event is 
resolved or stabilized. 
Medical conditions/diseases occurring before the first dose of study medication during Visit 1 
(Day  1) should be collected on the medical/ocular history pages of the e CRF . 
The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology w hen possible. For each AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the following:  
• Onset (date and time);  
• Resolution (date and time);  
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);  
• Relationship to study medication (not suspected, suspected);  
• Action taken (none, study medication temporarily interrupted, study medication 
permanently discontinued; concomitant medication taken; hospitalization/prolonged 
hospitalization; other); 
• Serious outcome (yes/no). 
The severity grade should be determined by the Investigator usi ng the definitions below. 
• Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is impor tant to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 9.5.1.2 . 
An AE of severe intensity may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
OmegaD softgels    OmegaD LLC  
Protocol OmegaD -2016 -001  IND 130264  
 
 35  
    The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study.  
9.8. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from signing of informed consent  until the 
final study visit, Visit 3 ( Day 42), following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs 
“suspected” to be related to the investigational product and dis covered by the Investigator at any 
time after the study should be reported to Oculos .  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos  within 24 hours of its occ urrence or within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the 
initial SAE must be reported to Oculos  as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of 
the Investigator receiving the information. Information about all SAEs will be collected and 
recorded on the SAE form. All pertinent medical  records and information collected during the 
treatment and follow -up of the subject should be maintained at the s ite with a copy emailed to 
OmegaD -safety @pointguardllc.com . The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and 
complete the SAE form. Oculos  may request additional information. Follow -up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
OmegaD -safety @ pointguardllc.com . 
In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis as instructed by the Sponsor  or designee  following the Sponsor’s determination of causality.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appr opriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event.  
Oculos will report all SAEs to the US FDA  on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is 
drug related or not drug related, expected, unexpected (based on the available information in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. For 
any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study 
drug, the SAE resulti ng in the death must be reported to Oculos . A death occurring after 
completion of the study  at Visit 4 (Day 84 ) does not require completion of the SAE form.

    11. STATISTICS  
11.1. General Considerations  
This is a randomized, multicenter, double -masked, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of BID dosing of OmegaD softgels  for 84 days  (12 weeks ) in the treatment of 
subjects with dry eye disease.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 rat io as follows:  
• OmegaD softgels  (N = 82  subjects); 2 softgels BID  
• Placebo softgels (N = 82 subjects); 2 softgels BID  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor acc ording to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan. Any additional or supplemental data analysis performed independently 
by an Investigator shall be submitted to the Sponsor for review.  
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and on the per 
protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety analysis population. Definitions for all of the analysis populations can be found in Section 11.3. 
The study eye will be the worse of qualifying eyes at Baseline as defi ned by lower TBUT score; 
if both eyes score equally  on TBUT , the eye with the higher tear osmolarity  score will be chosen, 
and if still equal the right eye will be the study eye . 
11.2. Handling of Missing Data  
The planned statistical methods use all available data. To account for the presence of missing 
data, multiple imputation may be used for ITT anal yses on the primary endpoints. Multiple 
imputation will be carried out using the SAS procedures.  
11.3. Determination of Sample Size  
TBUT: A sample size of 82 in each gro up will have 95% power to detect a difference in means 
of 2.07 seconds assuming that the common standard deviation is 3.5 using a two- group t -test 
with a 0.05 two- sided significance level.  
OSDI: A sample size of 82 in each group will have approximately 95%  power to detect a 
difference in means of 11. 390 assuming that the common standard deviation is 20.0 using a 
two-group t test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level.  
When 90 subjects have completed treatment a review of treatment compliance will be condu cted. 
If more than 10% of subjects have protocol deviations for treatment compliance, the study will be resized to achieve a study population in which 90% are complian t.

    11.4. Analysis Populations  
11.4.1. Populations for Efficacy Analysis  
11.4.1.1. Intent -to-Treat Population  
The ITT population is defined as  all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
performed on the  ITT population. 
11.4.1.2. Per Protocol Population  
The PP population will include all ITT subjects who remain in the study through Visit 4 and who 
did not deviate from the protocol in any way likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study . Secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the PP population. 
11.4.2. Safety Analysis Population  
The safety population will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of the study 
medication . All safety analyses will utilize the safety population.  
11.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT analysis 
population; however, shoul d there be a reasonable difference in the size of the ITT and safety 
analysis populations, demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for both. The comparability of groups used in comparison analyses will be characterized in tables of demo graphic data. Summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
11.6. Efficacy Analysis  
Primary e fficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. A nalysis of TBUT , 
meibomian gland dysfunction, tear osmolarity, and Schirmer’s test s cores will utilize the 
designated study eye (worse eye at Baseline as defined by lower TBUT ; if both eyes score 
equally  on TBUT the eye with the higher tear osmolarity  score will be chosen , and if still equal 
the right eye  will be the study eye ) to assess the significance of the differences between OmegaD  
and placebo. The unit of analysis for OSDI symptoms will be the subject.  
Statistical significance for the comparison of means will utilize the t- test or analysis of 
covariance. Statistical significance fo r binary data will be assessed by a chi -square, Fisher's 
exact, or Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maxim um, and minimum) and 
categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessment time point. All summary 
tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.

    11.6.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary efficacy endpoints comprise a set of hyp otheses that will be tested in a hierarchical 
fashion. 
• TBUT in the study eye  
• OSDI score  
The differences between the 2 treatment groups will be tested with a significance level of 0.05. 
In order to control the Type I error rate these two endpoints will be t ested sequentially in the 
order described above. If the null hypothesis for the TBUT endpoint can be rejected at P   ≤ 0.05,

    13. ADMINISTRATIVE CONSI DERATIONS  
13.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
The IRB must review, approve, and provide continuing review of the clinical study protocol, 
protocol amendments, the informed consent documents, subject recruitment advertisements, and any other written information to be provided to the subjects. Initial IRB approval is an 
affirmative decision that the clinical study has been reviewe d and may be conducted at the study 
site within the constraints set forth by the IRB, the institution, GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements. A copy of the IRB approval letter for the protocol, the informed consent, the 
intended advertising, and any written material to be provided to the subject must be submitted to 
Oculos  prior to release of investigational supplies to the study site. Progress reports and 
notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB according to local regulations and guidelines. The IRB must be notified of completion or termination of the study. 
The study site must maintain an accurate and complete record of all reports, documents, and other submissions made to the IRB concerning this protocol. 
13.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol, including all statements regarding confidentiality, and in compliance with ICH guidelines, and all applicable US federal regulations and local legal and regulatory requirements. 
13.3. Written Informed Consent  
A sample informed consent form containing the required elements of informed consent will be 
provided by Oculos . Any ch anges made to th is sample must be approved by Oculos  prior to 
submission to the IRB. After approval by Oculos , the informed consent  form must be submitted 
to an d approved by the IRB. The informed consent must be written in a language in which the 
subject is fluent.  Regulations require that foreign language informed consent  forms be submitted 
to the IRB for approval. The foreign language translation is required to contain a statement of 
certification of the translation. The investigator must forward a copy of the consent form s, the 
certified foreign language translation, and an IRB approval letter to Oculos . 
It is the  responsibility of the Investigator to inform each subject of the purpose of this clinical 
trial, including possible risks and benefits, and to document the informed consent process. Prior 
to undergoing any study -related procedures, the subject must read, sign, and date the current 
IRB-approved version of the informed consent form. The original informed consent form is to be 
retained by the study site, and a copy is to be given to the subject. 
13.4. Subject Confidentiality and Confidentiality of Data  
Data generat ed for the study should be stored in a limited- access file area and be accessible only 
to representatives of the study site, Oculos /OmegaD LLC , the IRB, and FDA/relevant regulatory 
agencies. Medical information  resulting from a subject’s participation in this study may be given 
to the subject’s personal physician or to the appropriate medical personnel responsible for the 
subject’s welfare. No information that can be related to a specific individual subject will  be

 45  
    released or used in any fashion without the signed written consent of that subject. All reports and 
communications relating to study subjects will identify subjects only by initials and subject 
identification number. Complete subject identification will be kept by the Investigator for 
purposes of long -term follow -up, if needed. This information will be treated with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  
13.5. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by Oculos  on behalf of OmegaD LLC in accordance with current 
GCP to assure compliance with the study protocol and the quality of the data collected. Monitoring visits will occur as required and could include a study initiation visit, a moni toring 
visit, and a study close -out visit. Training will be provided for key investigative personnel in all 
aspects of study conduct. The Investigator will be responsible for making sure that clinical site personnel are provided adequate training on conduc ting their designated tasks.  
This study will utilize e DC to optimize the eCRF source verification process with limited 
separate source documentation. Monitors will review e -source data and overall study 
data/consistency remotely and query discrepancies bas ed upon eCRF entries (eCRF initial entry 
is the source). During this monitoring, data are reviewed as entered by the site, and the monitors will flag any abnormalities, trends, or safety signals for Medical Monitor review and monitor follow -up onsite, if necessary.  
During visits to the study site, the monitor may review the source documents including but not limited to signed informed consent forms , study medication diaries, study medication 
accountability and storage, and the reporting procedures for AEs a nd SAEs . All data generated 
during this study and the medical records/documents from which they originated are subject to inspection by Oculos , the s tudy Sponsor , the FDA, and other regulatory agencies. The 
investigator must notify Oculos  promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory authorities.  
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (closeout) to the site. The object ives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports are complete, 
verify that the study drug and other supplies have been accounted for, and ensure that the 
Investigators are aware of their responsibilities once the study ends.  
The Investigator is responsible for permitting Oculos  direct access to any study documents for 
monitoring and auditing purposes, for providing adequate space for monitoring, and for addressing any questions or issues that might be raised by the monitor or auditor on a timely 
basis.  
13.6. Case Report Forms and Study Records  
All data relating to study procedures will be entered by site personnel directly onto e CRF s 
provided by Oculos . The eCRF  is the first place the majority of the study data will be recorded; 
and therefore, considered to  be the source  document . In general, paper source documents will not 
be created, but when generated , source documents (e .g., discharge summaries, etc.) will be 
retained at the study site .

approval of the Medical Monitor at Oculos , with the exception of a medical eme rgency.  
A significant protocol violation must be reported to Oculos  upon discovery . Protocol deviations 
should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB guidelines.  
All changes to the protocol will be made by Oculos , or designee as an approved amendment to  
the protocol, submitted to the FDA,  and approved by  the IRB prior to implementation.   
13.8. Access to Source Documentation  
A trial- related mo nitoring audit, review by the IRB, and/or regulatory inspection may be 
conducted at any time during or after completion of a study  (Section 12) . The Investigator will 
be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit and must provide direct access to study 
documentation. The audit may include, but is not limited to, a review of all informed consent 
forms; a review of medical records; a review of regulatory documentation; an assessment of study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, 
storage, and administration. 
13.9. Data Generation and Analysis  
Management of data and the production of the clinical study report will be the responsibility of 
Oculos or its design ee. 
During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data items that are potentially erroneous and require appropriate clarification or correction. Such clarifications and corrections will be discussed with and approved by study site pers onnel and appropriately documented. Prior 
to database lock, data listings will be generated and anomalous values investigated.  
13.9.1. Retention of Data  
Investigators should retain study -related records at the site until informed by the Sponsor. The 
Investigator w ill not discard any records without notifying OmegaD, LLC. If the Principal 
Investigator moves from the current clinical site, OmegaD LLC should be notified of the name of the person who will assume responsibility for maintenance of the records at the clinical site or the new address at which the records will be stored. The Investigator will notify OmegaD, LLC  
as soon as possible in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study documentation. If it becomes necessary for Oculos Clinical Research, OmegaD LLC, or the FDA or relevant 
regulatory authorities to review any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator must 
permit access to such records.

Evaluating the OSDI©Score1
The OSDI©is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability.
The index demonstrates sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between normal subjects and
patients with dry eye disease. The OSDI©is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring dry eye 
disease severity (normal, mild to moderate, and severe) and effect on vision-related function.

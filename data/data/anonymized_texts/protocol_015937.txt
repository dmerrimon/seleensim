Study Title :  Glasses for Adolescent Delayed Sleep -Wake Phase Disorder (GLAD)  
  
IRB#:  18-003036  
Protocol version number  and date:  Version 1 8; August 12, 2021  IRB approved 8/24/2021  
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis 1 : Among adolescents with delayed sleep -wake phase disorder (DSWPD), those using e vening 
amber glasses and employing prescribed  stable wake times will show  an increase in total sleep time ( TST), and 
sleep onset times will advance (shift earlier) as compared to the control group.  
Hypothesis 2 : Dim light melatonin onset ( DLMO ) will advance (shift earlier) in the amber glasses + stable 
wake time group, but not in the control group. If  DLMO does not advance (as has been reported in other  
circadian rhythm sleep -wake  disorder  (CRSWD ) interventions with successful sleep -related  outcomes  
[reviewed i n 6]) this aim will still provide data on the clinical utility of the DLMO . 
 
Specific Aims: The aims of this study  will address at least two goals to a ddress gaps in the research domain of 
CRSWDs. We propose a 3 ‐week field  study that examines the efficacy, acceptance, and compliance of using 
evening amber glasses to block  evening light combined with a stable wake time in adolescents (14 ‐17 years) 
with DSWPD (International  Classification of Sleep Disorders [ ICSD‐3] criteria).3  After 1 week of baseline 
measurements, subjects  will be instructed to wear glasses (which allow 14% entry of ambient light exposure) 
starting 7 h before  individually calculated m idsleep time measured during the preceding week. This corresponds 
to the time  when adolescents are most sensitive to phase delaying light according to Co ‐I Crowley’s recently  
published phase response curve ( PRC ) to light in adolescents (Figure 1) .22  This “amber glasses + stable wake 
time” group will be  compared to a control group: adolescent DSWPD patients who will wear clear ‐lensed 
glasses (which  allow 100% of ambient light to reach the eyes, otherwise identical in appearance) in the evening 
at the  same times as the alternate group, but without scheduled wake times. Outcome measures will include  
TST and sleep onset time derived from wrist actigraphy, daytime subjective sleepiness, salivary DLMO,  and 
assessments of acceptance and compliance.  
 
Aim 1 : Examine actigraphic sleep outcomes in adolescents with DSWPD before and after a 2 ‐week intervention 
of evening amber glasses + stable wake times compared to evening clear glasses + no wake time instructions.

 Aim 2: Examine circadian phase DLMO in adolescents with DSWPD before and after a 2 ‐week intervention of 
evening amber glasses + stable wake times.  
 
Background:   
DSWPD is common among adolescent s3 and further increases their susceptibility to chronic sleep  restriction 
and associated deleterious outcomes .2,27,39,47  In a series investigating 22 adolescents with  DSWPD, 59% 
demonstrated poor scholastic performance, and 45% displayed a variety of b ehavioral  problems .47  In a 
prospective study involving 14 patients (5 adolescents) followed over a period of 5 years  in a clinical setting, all 
subjects reported severe disability as a re sult of failure of timely morning  awakenings. Accordingly, those with 
DSWPD demonstrate significantly worse quality of life scores  compared to age ‐ and gender ‐adjusted norms .39  
Despite its prevalence, the CRSWD  Practice Guideline s6 contain  only 4 DSWPD treatment studies that 
specifically address th e pediatric/adolescent population .30,43,49,50  The sole study that utilized post ‐awakening 
light therap y30 did n ot provide compliance data, which is  generally described as poor .10  Oral melatonin was 
utilized in the remaining reviewed studies .43,49,50  Adolescent patients are frequently reluctant recipients of this 
supplement, due to concerns related to  adverse effects on reproductive function and the regulation of growth 
hormone .17,33,35,45,48  Sleep/wake  scheduling instructions used in isolation also demonstrate limited success. 
While Iwamitsu and colleagues demonstrated uniform sleep‐related imp rovements utilizing such 
interventions among hospitalized DSWPD patients (a cost‐prohibitive option for most), only 57% showed 
persistent improvement subsequent to discharge .32  Alternative, cost ‐effective, home ‐based, readily 
implemented evidence ‐based outpatient treatments for young patients are clearly needed.  
 
Co‐Investigator (Co ‐I) Crowley recently published the first PRC to light for  healthy adolescents aged 14 to 17 
years22 and found that maximum phase delay shifts are produced  when light begins during the ~3 h before to ~3 
h after habitual bedtime (see yellow highlight in  Figure 1). Aoki and colleagues reported hypersensitivity to 
nocturnal light amon g select DSWPD patients  compared to unaffected counterparts, as assessed by the degree 
of melatonin suppression with 2000 lux -hours  of light exposur e,4 which may indicate that evening light around 
habitual bedtime results in even  larger shifts than what was observed in healthy adolescents. Published relevant 
“eyewea r” studies  dovetail on data from bench research that demonstrate particular circadian sensitivity to short  
wavelengths that look blue .11,46  In an open ‐label study, adult subjects with DSWPD wore amber glasses  that 
blocked wavelengths ≤ 530 nm for a minimum of 3 evening hours, and for a period of 2 weeks, in  conjunction 
with other behavioral directives. Outcomes were compared to a weeklong baseline period.

As determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep  Quality Index (P SQI),13 significant  improvements in TST, initial sleep 
latency, and sleep  quality were noted .26  A more recent  open‐label stud y25 of 9 DSWPD  patients (mean age 
18.11±3.18 years)  tested 3 weeks of similar evening  eyewear (21:00 to bedtime) and found  a non‐significant  
DLMO advance (>1 h) and an  actigraphic sleep onset time  advance  >2 h compared to a baselin e week.  These 
small studies provide some  preliminary evidence that amber  glasses may be beneficial for DSWPD  patients. 
However, the studies were  small (under ‐powered),  uncontrolled,  did not focus solely on adolescent patients, 
and did not assess compliance  and feasibility. Moreover, these  studies did not utilize the PRC to light for 
adolescents to time eyewear use in the evening (Figure 1).  
 
Abstract:  
Thus, a  more rigorously designed, appropriately ‐powered randomized placebo ‐controlled study is needed . 
Additional novel aspects of our protocol include use of eyewear that can fit over prescription glasses and  that 
minimally interfere with media viewing. Finally, we will use knowledge of the adolescent light PRC  
(Figure 1) to tim e eyewear use based on each individual’s habitual sleep pattern (further details below).  Data 
from the proposed protocol therefore have the potential to introduce a safe, non ‐pharmacological,  readily 
implemented economical treatment intervention, and may p rovide data for larger clinical trials to  further 
identify optimal interventions. The identification of a successful treatment for adolescent  DSWPD is an 
essential “first step” in establishing whether improvement of sleep complaints can  directly address 
associated adverse outcomes. Due to discussed deficiencies in the present  literature, results from the 
proposed trial will be informative regardless of outcome.  
 
Time Line  for the Conduct of the Study :  We will enroll up to a total of 70 adolescents to pa rticipate in a 3 ‐
week study over 3 years at 2 sites  (Mayo Clinic  and Rush University ). When possible, we will run participants 
in groups of 2.

 Year 1 (2018): the first ~3 months will be dedicated to buying study equipment, hiring and training staff,  and 
writing detailed instructions to be followed at both sites. Recruitment and screening will be ongoing.  In the 
remaining school months, a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 16 participants will be enrolled  (5-8 participants 
per site ). 
 
Year 2 (2019): A total of 20 participants (minimum of 16) will be enrolled during school months  (8-10 per site ). 
Interim  data analysis will occur during the summer months . 
 
Year 3 (2020): 18 total participants (minimum of 16) will be enrolled during school months  (8-9 per site) . Final 
data analysis and manuscript preparation will occur during the grant’s final months.  
 
Study Design and Methods  
 
Recruitment.  Study participants will be patients seen by the principal investigator and colleagues at Mayo 
Clinic Sleep Medicine.  Additional r ecruitment activities includes posting approved IRB fliers in schools, public 
locations, etc., with the approval  of the location.  Fliers will also be posted at Mayo Clinic in approved areas 
and in Mayo Classified ads.  
 
The PI may make arrangements with public schools to attend classrooms to give an oversight of the research 
and hand out IRB approved fliers.  
 
Study team members may send out the Mayo Clinic IRB approved advertisement/flier information through 
Peachjar which is a communication process used by many school districts, including those outside of the 
Rochester community.  
School officials may email IRB appr oved flier content from within school systems, targeting the subject 
population.  
 
 
3.1 Experimental Protocol .  Subjects will complete the 3 ‐week protocol pictured in Figure 2. Sleep will be  
measured with wrist actigraphy and sleep logs throughout the study  (see section 3. 2). For the first 7  days, 
subjects will sleep at home on their usual sleep schedule ("baseline"). Figure 2 shows an example  average sleep 
schedule  of 1‐7 a.m.  
 
   
  Version .1 8 
 
 
       Page 5 of 16 
  
 
Sleep  measured during this  baseline week will  dictate timing of  evening glasses use for  both groups and wakeup  
time in the  experimental group.  After this baseline  week, participants will  be randomized to one  of two groups. 
One group (amber glasses + fixed wake) will wear glasses with amber lenses (see section  3.3) begi nning 7 h 
before average baseline midsleep time (e.g., starting at 9 pm in the example in Figure 2  because average 
midsleep time is 4 am) until the time of intended sleep onset or until a duration of 7  hours of use is reached. 
Wearing glasses at this time will block phase delaying light according to the  adolescent PRC published by Co ‐I 
Crowle y22 (Figure 1), regardless of the time at which the adolescent  initiates sleep. Participants will also be 
required to wake up at the same time (±30 mins), including on  weekends. Fixed wake ‐up time will be base d on 
average school ‐morning wake time. An optional 0.5 h  nap zone will be timed 12 h after the midpoint of baseline 
sleep, as dark during this time should have  minimal effects on circadian phas e12 and sleep duration should be 
sufficiently short such that sleep onset  difficulties are not exacerbated. The second group (clear glasses + free  
wake) will wear identically  appearing  glasses with clear lenses (see section 3. 3) and with the same timing. This 
group will act as the  control group and will not be given any instructions with respect to sleep schedule. 
Reminder text  messages will encourage compliance. These will be sent every afternoon, via a free text 
messaging service (s uch as “Remind,” used within the Rochester Public School District).  Since we wish to 
gauge compliance in a “real world”  setting, we  will not drop any subjects after baseline, and will incorporate all 
into compliance assessments. The  DLMO (see section 3. 4) will be measured after the baseline week on day 8 
and after the 2 ‐week  intervention on day 23 to measure circadian phase shifts.    
 
3.2 Sleep and Ambient Light Monitoring.  Participants will wear an actigraph wrist monitor (AW ‐L or 
Actiwatch Spectrum , Philips Respironics) throughout the study to quantify sleep variables and, when 
applicable, monitor  compliance to  assigned sleep/wake times. Actigraphs have been extensively reviewed by 
various  American Academy of Sleep Medicine Tas k Forces and are endorsed for the longitudinal assessment of  
circadian rhythm sleep disorders .36,37  Participants will additionally complete daily sleep diaries which will 
include  document ation of  caffeine intake. They  will call a time ‐stamped voice mail at bed and wake times. Data 
will be  downloaded and daily sleep diaries entered into RedCap (paper diaries will be available as a back -up) 
will be  reviewed with the participant during weekly visits. Motivational  intervie wing techniques will be 

   
  Version .1 8 
 
 
       Page 6 of 16 
 employed during these visits if subjects express difficulties with respect  to eyewear use (both groups) or if they 
have difficulties awakening at prescribed times (amber + fixed  wake group).   Ambient light exposure to the eye 
will b e monitored by another actigraph with a light sensor (AW -L or Actiwatch Spectrum, Philips Respironics) 
(without the wrist band ) that has been  attached to a lanyard.  Participants will wear the lanyard with photosensor 
around their neck throughout the study like a necklace so that the light sensor is sitting on their chest.  
Participants will wear the light sensor necklace at all times throughout the study , except when trying to sleep.  
During sleep episodes, participants will be instructed to place the light  sensor face -up on a night stand (or 
something of similar height) next to their bed.  A light sensor at chest level will measure light get ting to the eyes 
more accurately than if the sensor is worn on the wrist.  Participants will be instructed to  wear the  light sensor 
necklace on the outer layer of their clothes (e.g., remove the light sensor  from sweaters and coats ).  Co-I 
Crowley has used this method with adolescents for many years.  Specific instances may preclude wearing the 
actigraph devices for circum scribed periods of time (e.g., during contact sports).  
 
3.3 Reducing Evening Light with Amber Glasses.   Participants in the “amber glasses + fixed wake” group  will 
use amber lenses (Cocoons®, Live Eyewear, San Luis Obispo, California) starting 7 h before baseline  midsleep 
time until self ‐selected bedtime or for a duration of 7 hours (Figures 1 ‐2). This eyewear  transmits only 14% of 
light and absorbs most short wavelength (blue) light waves. Indoor house light  levels are typically less than 100 
lux. Therefore, light transmission will be reduced by 86% and only ~14  lux will transmit to the eye. The frame 
is designed to block light from all angles. We chose these glasses  instead of those used in previous studies ,25,26 
as the latter only partially attenuate light ‐induced phase  shifts ,8 and distort colors, which may make electronic 
viewing more difficult (a particularly relevant  adolescent consideration). Moreover, the frames come in 7  
different sizes to fit well with or without  prescription glasses. Participants in the control group will wear the 
same frame with clear lenses made  by the same company. Compliance (defined as use >75% of the prescribed 
time for at least 10 days of the  2‐week intervention) will be monitored by parent and participant self ‐report, as 
well as with a small  temperature  monitor  (iButton , iButtonLink Technology,Whitewater WI ) affixed  to the 
inside of the temple of the glasses frame .  The iButton will make contact with the skin on the side of the 
participant’s  face near the temple when the glasses are on.  The change in temperature will allow us to 
determine when the glasses are on (higher temperature) and when they are off (lower tem perature).  Each 
participant will be fitted for glasses size and for location of iButton placement.  The ability to objectively 
monitor use is a major strength in comparison to previous studies .25,26  Our definition of compliance accounts 
for the fact that some participants may be engaged in activities during some of the prescribed wearing times that 
either pres ent potential safety concerns (e.g., driving, riding a bike) or are otherwise impractical (working, 
social activities).  Estimating an earliest “glasses on” time of 20:00, these considerations alone should not 
significantly hamper compliance.   
 
3.4 Dim Li ght Melatonin Onset (DLMO) Phase Assessments.   Saliva sampling for baseline circadian phase  
assessment (Day 8) will begin 6 h before and end 2 h after baseline bedtime to capture the rise of  endogenous 
melatonin. The final circadian phase assessment will begin 8 h before baseline bedtime to  capture the rise of 
melatonin after a phase advance shift and will end 2 h after baseline bedtime  (See Figure 2) . All sampling will 
take place in the inpatient Clinical Research Unit (SMH) , and participa nts may elect to stay overnight if desired 
or required due to transport or other logistical considerations.  The procedures for collecting salivary melatonin 
are routine. Participants are seated in dim light (<5 lux) and  remain awake watching  age‐appropriat e movies or 
the like. When necessary, participants walk to the  adjoining restroom (also <5 lux). Saliva samples are collected 
   
  Version .1 8 
 
 
       Page 7 of 16 
 every 30 mins using Salivettes. The  samples are immediately centrifuged and frozen, and later shipped on dry 
ice to SolidPhase, In c (Portland, ME), where they are analyzed for melatonin using direct radioimmunoassay. 
All samples from  an individual participant will be analyzed in the same assay. The reported sensitivity of the 
assay is 0.7  pg/mL. Intra ‐assay and inter ‐assay variations  are 12.1% and 13.2%. We will compute DLMO, the 
most  common and reliabl e9,34 circadian phase marker in humans, using these assayed values. Importantly,  prior 
studies performed by Co ‐I Crowley (and others) have demonstrated the feasibility of  procuring samples among 
young people in the setting proposed .18,19,28 
 
3.5 Subjective Sleepiness Measures.   Daytime sleepiness will be assessed before and after the 2 ‐week  
intervention using the Pediatric Daytime Sleepines s24 scale. Daytime  sleepiness will also be assessed daily 
using visual analogue scale s7 on daily sleep logs.  
 
3.6 Acceptability and Expectation Ratings.   A structured interview and a subjective questionnaire (Intervention 
Acceptability Questionnaire, developed by Co -I Crowley (unpublished))  will be used to  assess overall 
acceptability of wearing glasses in the evening (amber and clear lenses) and maintenance  of a stable wake time 
(in the amber glasses + fixed wake group onl y). Pre‐treatment expectation ratings  will be obtained immediately 
after participants receive the equipment using the Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)23 to account for 
differences in treatment expectations/placebo effects.

Subject Information  
 
3.7 Participants .  Adolescent subjects (14 ‐17 years, inclusive) will be enrolled (n= 45) at Mayo Clinic. We 
restrict the age  range to control for stage of puberty since light sensitivity differs between pre ‐ and post‐pubertal  
adolescents .20  This age ra nge also corresponds to the period when school start times are earliest and  adolescents 
need the most help shifting their sleep schedules. Finally, the optimal times to block out  ambient light in the 
evening are  known for this age group (Figure 1) .22 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Regular school a ttendance in the setting of a fixed  start time  
2. Adherence to ICSD ‐3 DSWPD diagnostic criteri a3 
3. Average spontaneous weekend wake  time ≥ 1 hour than school day wake time and  
4. Initiation of school ‐night sleep at 12 a.m. or later,  ≥50% of the time, during a 14 ‐day period (items 3 ‐4 
to be determined by sleep logs and actigraphy). As  there are no discrete clock times associated with the

       Page 8 of 16 
 ICSD‐3 DSWPD description, this cutoff is based on  data obtained from the 2006 Sleep in America 
Poll40 and experiences gleane d from prior recruitmen t.5 
 
After the initial contact, subjects will be scheduled for consent/assent and subsequent screening.  Eveningness 
tendencies will be further  verified with age ‐appropriate circadian preference  questionnaires .15,31,42  Subjects w ill 
complete a self ‐rated measure of puberty stage .14  Female participants will complete the For Girls Only 
questionnaire that provides information on menstrual cycle regularity, use of contraceptive hormones, and 
symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).  Female participants will also report when th eir 
menstrual cycle starts on the daily sleep logs.  Phase of the menstrual cycle does not impact circadian phase 
shifts to light, but can influence sleep and melatonin (two of our primary outcomes).  
 
If the screened participants are deemed eligible to participate in the study, they will sign the main research study 
consent/assent if they agree to be in the study.  
 
To eliminate the confounding effect of psychiatric disturbances, further screening will take place with the  Mood 
Disorder Questio nnaire‐Adolescent Version and the Children’s Depression Inventory .29,51 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. A positive urine drug abuse screen will disqualify the individual from further participation.   
2. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if the sleep log and  wrist monitor activity does not 
correspond with the sleep schedule identified with the pre -study sleep log.  
3.  
4. Alcohol and nicotine use will also be screen ed to qualify for the study .  We will also screen for alcohol 
immediately before  each DLMO assessment  because alcohol acutely suppresses melatonin .  
5. Patients receiving medications that might contribute to sleep disturbances and/or affect treatment 
responses will be considered ineligible (e.g., hypnotics, antidepressants, stimulants, non ‐steroidal anti ‐
inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) , beta blockers) .38,44 
6. All subjects will be asked  to refrain from caffeine use on the days of phase assessments, and to cease 
ingestion at least 6 hours prior to nightly bedtime.  
7. The Ishihara Color Blind ness Test will be done  and patients who are color blind/deficient will be 
disqualified from participating in the study.  
 
 
3.8 Depression Management Plan  
In the instance of an affirmative response to the study participants’ screening utilizing the Mood Disorder 
Questionnaire -Adolescent Version and the Children’s Depression Inventory questionnaires, an urgent 
discussion with the study psychiatrist will take place for evaluation, and appropriate referral for treatment will 
be made.  Study consent form includes participant’s consent for permission to interface with h is/her primary 
provider should clinical concerns arise.  If emergent concerns arise regarding risk of harm to self or others, the 
patient will be referred for emergency care.

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 
Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination 
of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording identifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study  allows you  to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is medical informati on that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifier s so that it c annot be 
linked back to the subject. De -identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.   
 
Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if applicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being record ed at the time of data  collect ion or abstraction.   Identifiers apply to any subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff , patients and their relatives and household members.

Data Analysis  
 
3.9 Sample Size .  A power analysis assumes a between ‐subjects design with an alpha level of .05 and  power of 
.80. Based on these assumptions and previous studies that assessed actigraphic and subjective  sleep changes 
after 226 or 3 week s25 of an amber glasses intervention for (predominantly adult) DSWPD  subjects, a minimum 
of 11 to 17 participants per group are needed to address Hypothesis 1. Both the  latter stud y25 and a separate 
relevant investigation [that tested advancement of darkness exposure (sleep  opportunity) among young adults 
with subclinical  DSWP D41] assessed DLMO changes in relation to the  respective interventions, with observed 
shifts >1 h. Computed effect sizes (d=0.92) predict that 10 ‐20 patients are needed per group to address 
Hypothe sis 2. Accounting for approximately 20% attrition, we  therefore aim to enroll up to 70  participants 
between Mayo Clinic and Rush  University . 
 
3.10 Data Analysis Plan .  DLMO:  We will use a DLMO threshold of 4 pg/mL, which is recommended for  
children and adolescents .16,21  Sample times and melatonin values above and below the threshold will be  used to 
compute the DLMO (in clock time) using linear interpolation. DLMO phase shifts will be defined  as baseline – 
final phase assessments. Sleep: Actigraphy data will be anal yzed using the Actiware ‐6 software (Philips 
Respironics) to estimate sleep/wake. Each nocturnal and nap sleep episode will be  inspected within a specific 
“scoring interval,” spanning from 15 ‐min before participants report trying to  initiate asleep to 15 ‐min after they 
report awakening on their daily sleep diaries. Within these scoring  intervals, sleep parameters will be computed 
according to the procedures outlined by Acebo and  colleagues .1 
 
3.11Statistical Approach.   Analyses will be run using SPSS (version 19). A two ‐tailed 0.05 alpha level will be  
used for all statistical tests. Data analysts will be blinded to group assignment. From previous research, we  
expect sleep, sleepiness, and DLMO phase shifts to have roughly normal distributions; however, skew and  
kurtosis will be assessed to determine statistical normality. Covariates  of sex, age, and self ‐assessed puberty  
stage will be considered in each analysis. Primary outcomes measures : TST, sleep onset time, subjective  
daytime sleepiness, and DLMO. For each outcome variable, a 2 (between subjects factor, GROUP: amber  
glasses + fixed wake vs. clear glasses + free wake) ‐by‐2 (within subjects factor, TIME: baseline week vs. final  
week of intervention) analysis of variance will examine whether wearing amber glass es in the evening in  
combination with a stable wake time changes each outcome as predicted compared to the control group.

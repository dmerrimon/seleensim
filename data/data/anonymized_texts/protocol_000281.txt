Study Title :    Immunogenicity of PPSV -23 after PCV -13 Vaccination in Adult Asthmatic Patients  
 
Protocol version number  and date:   Protocol version number 3. 06/07/2018    
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis : 
1)  Priming with PCV13 will result in increased immunogenicity of PPSV23 in asthmatic subjects  
2) Priming with PCV13 will result in dura ble immunogenicity of the PPSV23 in asthmatic subjects  
 
 
Aims, purpose , or objectives:  
Aim 1 will compare the safety and immunogenicity of PPSV23 and PCV13 vaccines in asthmatic subjects.  The 
vaccine response of randomized asthmatic patients to either PPS V 23 alone (Group A) or PCV13 with PPSV23 
given 8 weeks later (Group B) will be compared.  Immunogenic response will be assessed and compared 
between groups at 8 and 16 weeks after vaccination.  
 
Aim 2 will compare the changing of immunologic response in t he two arms over the subsequent 8 weeks’ time 
frame in both Group A and Group B.

Background  (Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
S pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia and invasive pneumo coccal disease and is a 
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with $16.2 billion dollars spent in healthcare -
related costs in 20131. The CDC currently recommends the polysaccharide PPSV23 vaccination (Pneumovax®)  
in all adults over the age of 65 as well as in individuals with chronic lung disease.  
 
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV13 (Prevnar  ®), initially developed for use in children, is currently 
recommended for immunocompromised adults and individuals with cerebrospinal fl uid leaks and cochlear 
implants.  There is some debate as to whether PPSV23 leads to a decrease in prevalence of disease caused by S. 
pneumoniae , indeed, a 2009 meta -analysis funded by the WHO found that the evidence supporting its use was 
poor.2 In 2014, vaccination guidelines changed to support  the use of PCV13 in patients over the age of 65 after 
it was found to be efficacious in preventing  community acquired pneumonia  and invasive pneumococcal 
disease in the elderly population.3  The PCV13 vaccine co ntains polysaccharide antigens conjugated with a 
protein carrier whereas the PPSV23 contains polysaccharide antigens alone.  It is proposed that the conjugate 
vaccine induces immunity via a T -cell dependent process.  Given that patients with asthma are 
disproportionately affected by pneumococcal disease, it is imperative that the vaccination strategy for 
pneumonia be as immunogenic and efficacious at eliciting a robust immune response as possible.  
 
To address this, we propose to compare the response to PPSV 23 with a novel schedule of PCV13 followed by 
PPSV23 given eight weeks later in adult patients with asthma.  We will assess the immune system at 8 weeks 
and 16 weeks post vaccination.  Given that the PCV13 vaccine elicits immunity via a T -cell dependent 
mechanism, we hypothesize that giving PCV13 in conjunction with PPSV23 will lead to an enhanced immune 
response in asthmatic patients.

Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :  Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol :   
Subjects: 50 adult  patients diagnosed with asthma will  be recruited from patients seen in the Division of 
Allergic Diseases  and from Primary Care; volunteers will also be solicited with flyers and electronic 
announcements .  The patients recruited will be between 19 and 64 y ears of age.  Exclusion criteria include

 research exemption requested, history of PCV -13 vaccination, age <19 or >64, history of cochlear implant, CSF 
leak, CHF, DM, CKD, HIV, CVID as well as patients who have received the PPSV23 vaccine in the last 5 
years .  Women who are pregnant will also be excluded from the study.  They will be contacted at the end of 
their visit to discuss enrollment in the study by the re search coordinator.   
  
Protocol: The patients will then be randomized into either Group A (standa rd of care) or Group B (experimental 
group).   At the week 0 time point, the patients will receive either PPSV23 vaccine (Group A) or PCV13 (Group 
B) and undergo a blood draw of 5mL for assessment of pre -vaccination serotype titers.  Group A will undergo a  
5mL draw for assessment of titers at week 8, 16, and 24 following vaccination.  Group B will undergo 
vaccination with PPSV23  at Week 8 with 5mL draw for pneumococcal serotype titers as well as a blood draw at 
Week 16 and Week 24.   Immunogenicity will be a nalyzed by assessing for serotype -specific IgG as well as total 
IgG binding.  Samples will be run at Mayo Rochester, and samples will additionally be shipped to a third party, 
The Binding Site, for further antipneumococcal binding assay s.  The samples will  be identified to The Binding 
Site only by their study -specific identification number (i.e. A01, B01 etc).  The Binding Site will not receive 
any patient identifying information.

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 
Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination 
of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording identifiers (including a cod e) during the conduct of the study  allows you  to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is medical informati on that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De -identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.   
 
Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if applicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being recorded at the time of data  collect ion or abstraction.   Identifiers apply to any subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff , patients and their relatives and household members.  
 
Internal  refers to the subject ’s identifier  that will be recorded at Mayo Clinic  by the study staff. 
External  refers to  the subject ’s identifier  that will be shared outside of Mayo Clinic.

Data Analysis  
 
Power analyses and study endpoints are not required  for minimal risk  research, pilot or feasibility studies .  
 
  No statistical information . If checked , please explain : 
 
Data Analysis:  
For each of the 23 serotypes, exact, unconditional, 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on the single 
proportions will be calculated using the F distribution. The 95% CIs for the difference in proportions ([PCV -
13+PPSV23] – [PPSV23]) will be  computed using the non -inferiority procedure of Chan and Zhang, using the 
standard ized test statistic and γ=0.000001. Non -inferiority is declared if the lower CI for the difference is > -
0.10. Similar procedures will be used for the evaluation of antibody concentrations after 12 months.  
For the secondary endpoints, the pneumococcal IgG s erotype antibody concentrations will be  logarithmically 
transformed for analysis. Within each treatment group and for each antibody concentration separately, 
geometric means of the antibody concentrations will be calculated for each vaccine group. Two (2) -sided 95% 
CIs will be constructed by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the logarithmically transformed assay 
results will be computed using the Student t distribution. To assess differences between the 2 vaccine groups, 
the 95% CIs for geomet ric mean ratio will be  computed using the Student t distribution for the mean difference 
of the measures on the log scale ([PCV -13+PPSV23] – [PPSV23]) Non -inferiority will be  declared if the lower 
limit of the CI for the ratio was greater than 0.5 (2 -fold criterion). In addition, the geometric mean fold rises 
from baseline to 12 month following PPSV23 in each arm, and corresponding 2 -sided 95% CIs, will be 
calculated for each of the serotype -specific pneumococcal IgG responses. For formulation decision an alyses, 
99.8% CIs will be calculated.

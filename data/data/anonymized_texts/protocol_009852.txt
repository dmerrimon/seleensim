STUDY DESIGN 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, active - and placebo -controlled, parallel- group, 
multicenter clinical trial with co -crystal E -58425 compared to tramadol, to celecoxib, and to placebo.  
Eligible subjects will complete all screening procedures within 28 days before the surgery. At 
Screening, subjects will provide written informed consent to participate in the study before any 
protocol specified procedures or assessments are conducted.  
Subjects will be admitted to the study center  on the morning of the scheduled surgery (Day -1), will 
remain at the study center  until post -operative Day 3 (a total of 3 nights at the study center ), and will 
return for the Follow -up Visit, which will occur 5 to 9 days after surgery.  
On Day -1, regional anesthesia will be established using a popliteal sciatic nerve block (PSB) after 
which subjects will undergo primary, unilateral, first metatarsal osteotomy with internal fixation with 
no additional collateral procedure. The regional an esthesia will be continued postoperatively via a 
continuous anesthetic infusion. Subjects may receive supplemental analgesia with ketorolac 30 mg intravenously during the continuous infusion period and up until 1:00 A.M to help control 
breakthrough pain if  the regional anesthetic infusion appears to be ineffective in the investigator’s 
opinion up until 1:00 A.M. If the regional anesthetic infusion and supplemental analgesia do not 
effectively control the subject’s postoperative pain prior to the 3 :00 A.M. a nesthetic infusion 
discontinuation time, the subject will not be eligible to be considered for the study.  
On Day 1, after  regional anesthetic infusion is  discontinued between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M, study staff 
will c ontact interactive response technology (IRT)  system to obtain the moderate and severe pain box  
numbers for the subject  and will retrieve the study medication boxes  from stock, 1 for moderate pain 
and 1 for severe pain.  The subject will be instructed to notify a member of the study staff and request 
treatment when he or she experiences a level of pain that requires medication. When the subject

 request s pain medication, they will be asked to rate their pain intensity (PI) using the Numerical Pain 
Rating Scale (NPRS)  assessment, a scale marked from zero  to 10 on which subjects circle  a single 
number  to indicate their current pain level, with zero  representing "No Pain" and 10 representing 
"Worst Possible Pain."  
Subjects with a score ≥5 and ≤ 9 on the 0 -10 NPRS  will be randomized into the study  and stratified by 
Baseline pain score ( moderate [NPRS 5 -6], severe [7 -9]) using IRT  and the appropriate pain level box 
will be used.  Subjects will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:2:2:1 to 1 of 4 treatment groups, 
respectively : 
 
Posology  TOTAL DAILY DOSE  
Tramadol  Celecoxib  
ARM -1 Co-crystal 
E-58425  200 mg bid  176 mg  224 mg  
ARM -2 Tramadol  50 mg qid 200 mg  0 
ARM -3 Celecoxib  100 mg bid  0 200 mg  
ARM -4 Placebo  0 mg qid 0 0 
bid = twice daily (every 12 hours) ; qid = four times daily (every 6 hours)  
Subjects with a NPRS score <5 will be asked if they can wait for treatment. If they cannot, they will 
be dropped from the study and treated according to the standard of care. If they agree to wait, they will 
be requested to notify a member of the study staff when their pain intensity has increased ; NPRS will 
be readministered at that time. I f the subject’s pain intensity ratings do not meet the minimum entry 
criteria within 8 hours of discontinuation of the regional anesthesia , or if they have a PI >9, subj ects 
will not be eligible for randomization  and will receive routine postoperative care at the investigator’s 
discretion.   
The NPRS  pain intensity assessments made just before randomization  will serve as the Baseline PI to 
which all subsequent PI assessments will be compared.  Time 0 will be defined as the time of the first 
dose of study medication.  Pain intensity ( NPRS ) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) 
assessments will be recorded  in the subject diary at scheduled times during the 48 -hour period after 
Time 0 ( 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 
28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 42, 46, and 48 hours ) and immediately before each  use of rescue medication . 
During the night, subject will be wakene d to administer the study medication. Pain assessments will 
be performed during the night only if the subject is awake.  Time to perceptible and meaningful pain 
relief will be evaluated usin g the 2 stopwatch method. Pain intensity and pain relief assessments will 
also be recorded before premature study termination. Subjects will complete a patient’s global 
evaluation of the study medication at the end of the Double -blind Treatment Period (Day  3) before 
discharge from the study center .  
Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen 1  g will be supplied to the subject by the study staff every 4 to 
6 hours as needed as rescue medication after treatment with the study medication has been initiated 
(ie, the doubl e-blind phase) up to a total of 4 g per 24 hours . If subjects are unable to tolerate IV 
acetaminophen or if there is insufficient pain relief, then oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg Immediate Release (IR)  tablets will be allowed every 4 to 6 hours if needed, up to a total of 30 mg/ 24 hours.  
After randomization, subjects will be encouraged to wait for at least 1 hour after the first dose of study medication before receiving rescue medication to allow time for the study medication to exert its 
pharmacologic effect . 
After randomization, subjects whose pain cannot be adequately managed by a combination of study 
medication and rescue medication, or who develop unacceptable side effects during the study will be discontinued from study medication or from further study p articipation. Their pain will be managed 
conventionally at the investigator’s discretion. All end -of-study assessments should be performed for 
subjects who discontinue from the study, if possible. Pain measurements affected by use of rescue 
medication will be replaced with pre- rescue pain measurements.

 Before discharge from the study center  on Day 3, study personnel will dispense a prescription for pain 
medication (if not already dispensed) and an outpatient subject diary  in which subjects will record 
concomitant medications taken and adverse events (AEs) experienced after discharge. Subjects will 
also be instructed to return the outpatient subject diary to study personnel at the Follow -up Visit.

 CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Efficacy endpoints:  
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
The primary efficacy variable will be the Pain Intensity (PI) measured by Numerical Pain Rating  
Scale ( NPRS ). The primary analysis endpoint will be the Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) 
from 0 -48 hours defined as follows.  
 
PIDt = Pain Intensity Differences = PIt -  PI0 where  
PI0 = Pain Intensity (PI) at time t = 0h on NPRS  
PIt = Pain Intensity on NPR S at specific time points  
 The NPRS  summed pain intensity difference (SPID) is calculated as a time -weighted sum of the pain 
intensity difference values at each follow -up time point (difference between the starting pain 
intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in 
hours) since the prior assessment.  
Negative values of PID will correspond to an amelioration of pain, while positive values will 
correspond to a recrudescence of pain . 
Secondary efficacy endp oints  
Secondary efficacy parameters will be the following:  
• SPID (0 -4 hours), SPID (0 -6 hours), SPID (0 -12 hours), and SPID (0 -24 hours) as defined in 
previous section  
• PIDt at each time point  
• Pain intensity at each time point  
• Pain Relief (PARt) = pain relief at each time point  
• Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) for time intervals (t=15 minutes – t=4 hours), (t=15 minutes 
– t=6 hours), (t=15 minutes –  t=12 hours), (t=15 minutes –  t=24 hours), and (t=15 minutes 
– t=48 hours)  
o TOTPAR is the time -weighted sum of th e Pain Relief ( PAR ) at each time point  
• Peak pain relief and time to peak pain relief  
• Stop watches: Time to onset of analgesia, time to perceptible pain relief and time to 
meaningful pain relief  
• Time to onset of pain intensity decrease 
• Overall assessment of  study medication  
• Rescue medication:  
o Proportion of subjects who take of at least 1 dose of rescue medication up to 4, up to 
6, up to 12, up to 24, and up to 48 hours after study medication administration; total 
amount of rescue medication for the same time intervals  
o Time to first use of rescue medication.  
o To avoid interference in efficacy measures (pain intensity assessments, PARt, PIDt, 
and SPID calculations) at scheduled time points because of use of rescue 
medication, additional pain assessments will be made just before each 
administration of rescue medication, asking subjects to report their pain intensity at 
the current time. These data will be carried over for the duration of effect of the 
rescue medication taken.

 • Proportions of Responder s, defined as follows:  
o Subject who reaches a 50% reduction in pain intensity from baseline sustained until 
the end of the 48 -hour observation period;  
o Subject who reaches a 30% reduction in pain intensity from baseline sustained until the end of the 48 -hour observation period;  
o Subject who reaches a pain intensity below 4 on NPRS  sustained until the end of the 
48-hour observation period;  
o Subject who reaches a 50% reduction in pain intensity as compared to baseline and a pain intensity below 4 on NPRS  sustained until the e nd of the 48- hour observation 
period;  
o Subject who reaches a 30% reduction in pain intensity as compared to baseline and a 
pain intensity below 4 on NPRS  sustained until the end of the 48 -hour observation 
period.  
• Time -to-response will also be analyzed as ti me-to-event data, using the first time at which 
each response criteri on was reached by each subject.  
Cumulative proportion of responders analysis plot . 
 Safety endpoints:  
• Clinical laboratory test results will be marked whether the result is below, within,  or above the 
respective reference range and whether it is clinically significant. The number of such values 
will be counted and tabulated.  
• For electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital signs parameters, the values that are below, within, or above a defined normal  range and the values that are clinically significant may be counted and 
tabulated by the number and percentage of subjects with such values.  
• Adverse events  will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) . 
• An overview of AEs will be prepared showing the number of AEs and the number of subjects 
with any AEs, treatment -emergent AEs, treatment -related AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), 
treatment -related SAEs, severity of AEs , AEs leadi ng to withdrawal , and AEs of special 
interest.  
• Various summary tables showing the number of subjects with at least 1 AE and event count by 
SOC (System Organ Class) and PT (Preferred Term) will be prepared.  
Additional safety data will be tabulated for each  treatment group.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Analysis Sets 
The primary statistical analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) , defined as all 
randomized subjects. The Per -Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) , defined as all subjects with no major 
protocol deviations, will be used for sensitivity analyses. Safety analyses will use the Safety Analysis 
Set (SAS) , defined as all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of study medication.  The Completers 
Analysis Set (CAS)  will be  a subset of the PP AS that includes all subjects who have pain assessments 
up to 48 hours after first dose of study medication . 
Subject Characteristics and Disposition  
Subject characteristics and disposition data will be presented using descriptive statistics only.  
Efficacy An alyses  
The primary efficacy analysis will compare treatment groups for the SPID from Time 0 to 48 hours. 
This will be tested using an analysis of covariance model adjusting for center and baseline pain 
intensity.  
To account for the use of rescue medicati on, any pain measurements taken during a period of time in 
which rescue medication is active will be replaced by the last pain measurement before rescue medication was taken.   
Additional sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of rescue use and missing data due to study 
discontinuation will be performed. Efficacy analyses will be also performed by subgroups defined by 
moderate or severe baseline pain.  Other subgroup analyses may also be done and will be specified in 
the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

 Primary efficacy analyses w ill be based on the FAS. The PPAS  and the CAS will be used for 
sensitivity analysis for some efficacy endpoints. Safety analyses will be based on the safety set.  
All subjects who signed informed consent will be considered study  participants . 
Secondary efficacy outcome measures will be analyzed using similar methods.  
All statistical methods will be described in full in the SAP  that will be prepared before the study is 
unblinded.  
Safety Analyses  
Data listings will be provided for prot ocol-specified safety data. The number and percentage of 
subjects with AEs will be displayed for each treatment group by SOC  and PT. Summaries of AEs by 
severity and relationship to study medication will also be provided. Serious adverse events, AEs 
resulting in discontinuation of study medication and AEs of special interest will be summarized 
separately in a similar manner. Comparisons between treatment groups for incidence of AEs, AEs of 
special interest , and significant AEs  may be performed. For  clinical laboratory,  ECG , and/or vital sign 
variables, the values that are below, within, or above a defined normal range and the values that are 
clinically significant will be counted and tabulated by the number and percentage of subjects with 
such values  may be performed if required. Any comparisons of safety analyses will be described in 
detail in the SAP . 
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  The primary outcome measure is SPID ( NPRS ) up to 48 hours post -dose (SPID -48h). The study is 
powered to detect differences between the co -crystal E -58425 and each of the 2  active control groups  
if they exist. Since co -crystal E -58425 must show superiority over both tramadol and celecoxib, the 
power is set at 9 0%, which will maintain an overall study power at 81%.  
To detect a d ifference of 48 with a Standard Deviation ( SD) of 124 at an alpha level of 0.05 and a 
power of 90 % requires 142 subjects per group ( 71 for the placebo group since a 2:2:2:1 randomization 
scheme is being used ). It is assum ed that the comparison versus placebo will be adequately powered 
since the difference versus placebo will be larger than that for the active comparators. Allowing for 
approximately a 20% rate of non -evaluable subjects  (ie, those not included in the PPAS) , a sample 
size of 180 subjects per g roup ( 90 for the placebo group) will be required to achieve 81% overall 
power and therefore a total of 630 subjects will be randomized . 
A blinded sample size calculation will be repeated during a blinded interim analysis conducted when 
approximately 50% of  subjects have completed the study using the actual SD of the SPID -48 hours 
calculated on pooled data. The sample size will not be reduced as a result of this re -estimation. Details 
will be presented in the SAP.  
STUDY AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION The overall st udy duration is expected to be 10  months (6 months of active enrollment and 4  months 
of data management, statistical analyses and reporting).  
The estimated duration of the study for each subject is approximately 6 weeks, which includes up to a 
4-week Scree ning Period, a 3 -day treatment period (72 hours of confinement with 48 hours of 
treatment), and a post -treatment follow -up visit approximately 1 week after surgery.  
The maximum study duration for each subject is approximately 40  days.  
The maximum treatment  duration for each subject is 2  days.

 6. OBJECTIVES  
6.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to establish the analgesic efficacy of co -crystal E -58425 compared to 
tramadol and to celecoxib for the management  of moderate to severe post -operative pain for 48 hours after 
bunionectomy by using assessments of pain int ensity . 
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
Secondary objective s are as follow:  
• To assess the analgesic efficacy of co -cryst al E-58425 compared to tramadol  and to celecoxib for the 
management  of moderate to severe post -operative pain at various time points after bunionec tomy by using 
assessments of pain intensity  
• To assess the analgesic efficacy of co -crystal E -58425 by means of responder rates, use of rescue 
medication, time to onset of analgesia, time to perceptible and meaningful pain relief, time to onset of 
pain intensity decrease, peak pain relief and time to peak pain relief, and the subjects’ overall assessment of the study medication  
• To assess the absolute analgesic efficacy of co -crystal E -58425 compared to placebo for the treatment of 
moderate to severe post -operative pain for 48 hours at various time points after bunionectomy by using 
assessments of pain intensity  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of the co -crystal E -58425  
7. STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This phase 3, randomized, double -blind, active - and placebo- controlled, parallel group, multi center  clinical trial 
will compare  co-crystal E -58425 to tramadol, to celecoxib, and to placebo . Approximately 630 male and female 
subjects will be randomized. Subjects must be at least 18 years of age and scheduled to undergo primary unilateral 
first metatarsal osteotomy with internal fixation with no additional collateral procedure . Efforts will be made to 
enroll subjects ≥65 years old. 
Eligible subjects will complete all screening procedures within 28  days before the surgery. At Screening, subjects 
will provide written informed consent to participate in the study before any protocol specified procedures or 
assessments are conducted.  
Subjects will be admitted to the study center  on the morning of the sc heduled surgery (Day -1), will remain at the 
study center  until postoperative Day 3 (a total of 3 nights at the study center ), and will return for the Follow up 
Visit, which occurs 5 to 9 days after surgery.  
On Day -1, regional anesthesia will be establish ed using a popliteal sciatic nerve block (PSB) after which subjects 
will undergo primary, unilateral, first metatarsal osteotomy with internal fixation with no additional collateral procedure. The regional anesthesia will be continued postoperatively via a  continuous anesthetic infusion. 
Subjects may receive supplemental analgesia with ketorolac 30 mg intravenously during the continuous infusion period and up until 1:00 A.M . to help control breakthrough pain if the regional anesthetic infusion appears to be  
ineffective in the investigator’s opinion up until 1:00 A.M. If the regional anesthetic infusion and supplemental 
analgesia do not effectively control the subject’s postoperative pain prior to the 3:00 A.M. anesthetic infusion 
discontinuation time, the subject will not be eligible to be considered for the study.

 On Day 1, after regional anesthetic infusion is discontinued between 3:00 and 4:00 A.M ., study staff will contact 
interactive response technology (IRT) system to obtain the moderate and severe pain box numbers for the subject 
and will retrieve the study medication boxes from stock, 1 for moderate pain and 1 for severe pain. The subject 
will be instructed to notify a member of the study staff and request treatment when he or she experiences a level of pain that requires medication. When the subject requests pain medication, they will be asked to rate their pain intensity (PI) using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) assessment, a scale marked from zero to 10 on which subjects circle a single number to indicate their current pain level, with zero  representing "No Pain" and 
10 representing  "Worst Possible Pain."  
Subjects with a score ≥ 5 and ≤ 9 on the 0- 10 NPRS  will be randomized into the study  and stratified by Baseline 
pain score (moderate [NPRS 5 -6], severe [7 -9] using interactive response technology  (IRT)  and the appropriate 
pain level box will be used . Subjects will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 2:2:2:1 to 1 of the 4 treatment groups, 
respectively : Co-crystal R -58425 200 mg twice daily (bid; every 12 hours), tramadol 50 mg 4 times daily (qid; 
every 6 hours), celecoxib 100 mg bid, or placebo qid, respectively  (see Table 1).  
Subjects with a NPRS score <5 will be asked if they can wait for treatment. If they cannot, they will be dropped from the study and treated according to the standard of care. If they agree to wait, they will be requested to notify a member of the study staff when their pa in intensity has increased ; NPRS  will be readministered at that time. If 
the subject’s pain intensity ratings do not meet the minimum entry criteria within 8 hours of discontinuation of the regional anesthesia, or if they have a PI >9, subjects will not be  eligible for randomization and will receive 
routine postoperative care at the investigator’s discretion.  
The NPRS pain intensity assessments  made just before randomization will serve as the Baseline PI to which all 
subsequent PI assessments will be compa red. Time 0 will be defined as the time of the first dose of study 
medication . Pain intensity ( NPRS ) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) assessments will be recorded in the 
subject diary at scheduled times during the 48 hour period after Time 0 ( 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 
2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 42, 46, and 48 hours ) and immediately 
before each use of rescue medication. During the  night, subject will be wakened  to administer the study 
medication . Pain assessments will be performed during the night only if the subject is awake. Time to perceptible 
and meaningful pain relief will be evaluated using the 2 stopwatch method starting at Time 0 . Pain intensity and 
pain relief assessm ents will also be recorded before premature study termination. Subjects will complete a 
patient’s global evaluation of the study medication at the end of the Double -blind Treatment Period (Day 3) before 
discharge from the study center .  
After randomization , subjects will be encouraged to wait for at least 1 hour after the first dose of study medication  
before receiving first rescue medication to allow time for the study medication  to exert its pharmacologic effect. 
Subjects may be given acetaminophen 1 g IV every 4 to 6 hours, up to 4 g/ 24 hours , for pain as rescue medication 
after the anesthetic infusion is discontinued and treatment with study medication  has been initiated. If su bjects 
are unabl e to tolerate IV acetaminophen or have insufficient pain relief with acetaminophen 1 g IV every 4 to 6 
hours, then oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg Immediate Release (IR) tablets can be administered every 4 to 6 hours 
as needed for pain, up to a total of 30 mg/ 24 hours .  
Subjects whose pain cannot be adequately managed by a combination of study medication  and rescue medication, 
or who develop unacceptable side effects during the study, will be discontinued from study medication or from further s tudy participation. Their pain will be managed conventionally at the investigator’s discretion.  All end -
of-study assessments should be performed for subjects who discontinue from the study, if possible. Side effects 
will be managed with pharmacologic and n on-pharmacologic methods at the investigator’s discretion.  
Before discharge from the study center  on Day 3, study personnel will dispense a prescription for pain medication 
(if not already dispensed) and an outpatient subject diary. Subjects will be instr ucted to record concomitant

 medications taken and adverse events (AEs) experienced after discharge in their outpatient subject diary. Subjects 
will also be instructed to return the outpatient subject diary to study personnel at the Follow -up Visit.  
7.2. Discus sion of Study Design  
The postsurgical bunionectomy pain model was selected for this study as the acute pain model based on its record of assay sensitivity and reproducibility in evaluating putative anal gesic agents.
2,3 Studies have demonstrated that 
subjects given nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) including cyclooxygenases (COX) -2 inhibitors 
for the treatment of pain have had clinically signific ant reductions in their pain scores and statistically significant 
differences from placebo.4,5 This study includes a placebo control group to evaluate whether active treatment is 
superior to placebo for the efficacy assessments. The pain intensity NPRS  to be used in this study is a widely 
accepted tool to measure a subject’s perception of pain.  
7.3. Study Center(s)  
The study will take place at approximately 5 to 6 center s in the United States.  Each center  is anticipated to screen 
a sufficient number of subj ects to be able to randomize approximately 630 subjects  in total. A study center  with 
a high recruitment rate may be allowed to recruit more subjects if other center s have slow enrollment. 
8. SUBJECT POPULATION  
8.1. Selection of Study Population  
A screening log of potential study candidates and an enrollment log of randomized  subjects must be maintained 
at each study center .

normal).  Labor atory tests may be repeated once at Screening to rule out laboratory error.  
18. Subject has any clinically significant laboratory or 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding at Screening 
that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicates study participat ion (eg, QTc >450 msec [male] or 
>470 msec [female]).  
19. Subject has a known history of allergic reaction or clinically significant intolerance to acetaminophen, aspirin, opioids, or any NSAIDs; history of NSAID induced bronchospasm (subjects with the triad of asthma, nasal polyps, and chronic rhinitis are at greater risk for bronchospasm and should be considered carefully) or to the ingredients of the study medication , or any other drugs used in the study, including 
anesthetics and antibiotics that may be req uired on the day of surgery.  
20. Subject has received anti -depressive medication with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs; milnaciprin, duloxetine, venlafaxine), diet pills (including fenfluramine and phentermine) or methylphenidate (Ritalin®) , or other similar medications for ADHD  within 4 weeks of study entry. 
Subjects receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be included provided they have been on a stable dose for 60 days prior to study participation and plan to remain on that dose throughout the study.  
21. Subject is, in the investigator’s judgment , at risk in terms of precautions, warnings, and 
contraindications in the package insert for Ultram
® (tramadol hydrochloride) or Celebrex® (celecoxib). 
Specifically, in situations where participation is contraindicated per the package insert the subject should 
be excluded. However, in situations where medications or medical conditions listed in the precautions 
and warnings are present the ph ysician should evaluate the subject’s history, physical exam ination 
results , laboratory analysis, and ECG carefully and use his/her discretion as to whether the subject is 
suitable for participation.  
22. Subject has a known coagulation disorder.  
23. Subject has h istory of or current medical, surgical, post -surgical, or psychiatric condition that would 
confound interpretation of safety, tolerability, or efficacy, (eg, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,

care).  
24. Subject received an experimental drug or used an experimental medical device within 30 days prior to 
Screening or has previously participated in this trial.  
25. Subject is unable to comply with the requirements of the study or, in the investigator’s opinion, should 
not participate in the study.  
26. Subject is undergoing concomitant surgical procedure(s) in addition to primary bunionectomy.  
8.3. Premature Subject Withdrawal  
All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any 
reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable attempt should be made by the investigator to keep subjects in 
the study; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if they withdraw consent to participate. 
Investigators must attempt to exclude the possibility of an AE being the cause of withdrawal. Should this be the cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and followed as described in Section 11.2. 
The sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol deviations  or other reasons.

 Page 25 of 62 
 The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for  lack of therapeutic effect 
that is intolerable or otherwise unacceptable to the subject, for intolerable or unacceptable AEs, intercurrent 
illness, noncompliance with study procedures, administrative reasons, or in the investigator’s opinion, to protect the subject’s best interest.  
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal and the date of discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate page of the electronic case report form ( eCRF). Whenever possible and 
reasonabl e, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion of the study should be performed at the 
time of premature discontinuation , unless the subject withdraws consent . Whenever possible and reasonable, 
when study medication is discontinued efforts will be made to collect all study assessments as scheduled up to the completion of the study, unless the subject withdraws consent. 
Subject Replacement Criteria  
Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. If a substantial number of subjects are withdrawn from  the study , the 
sponsor will evaluate the need for developing replacement criteria.  
Enrolled subjects withdrawn from the study may not reenter. The subject number for a withdrawn subject will 
not be reassigned to another subject.

 • Co-crystal: the total daily dose will be 400 mg (200 mg every 12 hours):  
400 mg of co- crystal corresponds to 176 mg of tramadol and 224 mg of  celecoxib.  
• Tramadol: the total daily dose will be 200 mg (50 mg every 6 hours)  
• Celecoxib: the total daily dose will be 200 mg (100 mg every 12 hours)  
9.4. Dispensing and Storage  
The study medication  supplied by ESTEVE is to be used exclusively in the clinical study according to the 
instructions of this protocol. The investigator is responsible for dispensing the study medication  according to the 
dosage scheme and for ensuring proper storage of the study medication . 
Until the study medication  is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 68°F -77°F (20°C -25°C). Store in 
accordance with controlled drug regulations , in a securely locked area that is not generally accessible.  The key to 
the storage area is to be kep t by the investigator or designee responsible for the IP. The store will be accessible 
only to those persons authorized by the investigator to dispense the study medication . 
9.5. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
In this parallel- group randomized study, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 
2:2:2:1 ratio to c o-crystal E -58425, tramadol , celecoxib , or placebo . The randomization schedule will be computer 
generated and will randomly allocate study medication  to randomi zation numbers.  
The randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through central IRT as subjects are entered into the 
study. The randomization schedule will be stratified by center  and baseline pain score ( moderate [NPRS 5- 6] or 
severe [ NPRS 7- 9]).1 
The randomization schedule will be prepared by Premier Research  before the start of the study. No one involved 
in the study performance will have access to the randomization schedule before official unblinding of treatment 
assignment. No subject will be randomized into this study more than once. 
9.6. Blinding and Unblindin g Treatment Assignment  
All subjects, investigators, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study, including data management, 
will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind t o minimize bias in the conduct of the 
study. Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment.  
Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical monitor if possible. For emergency unblinding, study personnel will use the IRT. If the investigator is not able to discuss treatmen t unblinding in advance, then he  or 
she must notify the medical monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment.   
The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for study discont inuation on the appropriate case 
report form (CRF ) for that subject. In all cases that are not emergencies, the investigator must discuss the event 
with the medical monitor prior to unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment.  
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of that subject’s 
treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a s ubject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, he/she may or 
may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.

 9.7. Selection of Doses in the Study  
The analgesic activity of the co -crystal E -58425 is expected to  be superior to the activity predicted by the sum of 
the individual components.1 This synergistic pharmacological activi ty of the co -crystal E -58425 would result 
from the recruitment of 4  relevant molecular mechanisms of action: μ -opioid receptor  agonism, inhibition of the 
neuronal reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, and COX -2 inhibition. In the  same way, the dissocia tion of 
the co -crystal E -58425 favors a concomitant action of tramadol and celecoxib, with potential implications for the 
onset, magnitude, duration and consistency of efficacy. On this  basis, low doses of the co- crystal E -58425 could 
achieve a similar eff icacy to that of the therapeutic doses of  tramadol (eg, 200 mg).  
The efficacy of the co -crystal E -58425 due to tramadol and celecoxib will be achieved with lower plasma levels 
of the  current use of each.  
9.8. Selection of Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
Subjects will receive assigned treatment of study medication  after reaching a minimum designated level of 
postoperative pain intensity. Study medication  will be administered in a qid regimen for 48 hours after the first 
dose, with a maximum of 4 doses (act ive and/or placebo) in a 24 -hour period. The timing of study medication  
dosing is based on the current dosage and administration recommendations for tramadol and for celecoxib.

9.9. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustment is not allowed in this study.  
The regional anesthesia will be continued postoperatively via a continuous anesthetic infusion. Subjects may 
receive supplemental analgesia with ketorolac 30 mg IV during the continuous infusion period until 1: 00 A.M to 
help control breakthrough pain if the regional anesthetic infusion appears , in the investigator’s opinion, to be 
ineffective. If the regional anesthetic infusion and supplemental analgesia do not effectively control the subject’s postoperative pain prior to the 3:00 A.M. anesthetic infusion discontinuation time, the subject will not be eligible to be considered for the study.  
9.10. Drug Accountability  
The investigator must maintain adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, return, or other disposition of the study medication  including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and identification of subjects (subject 
number) who received the study medication . The investigator will not supply the study medication  to any person

 except those named as subinvestigators on the FDA 1572, designated staff, and subjects in this study. The 
investigator will not dispense the study medication  from any center s other than those listed on the FDA 1572. 
Study medication s may not be relabeled or reassigned for use b y other subjects.  
Upon completion of the study, unused supplies of the study medication  will be returned to sponsor or destroyed 
as directed.  
9.11. Treatment Compliance  
All subjects will receive the study medication  at the study center  under the surveillance of appropriate study 
personnel. Study medication administration details will be recorded in the subject’s CRF.  
9.12. Concomitant  Therapies  
Treatment with the following medications and therapies before study entry (see Section 8.2) or during the study 
is not allowed:  
• All medications (except hormonal contraceptives and vitamins) will be prohibited within 5 half -lives 
of the prohibited medication (or, if half -life is unknown, within 48 hours) before dosing with study 
medication  until discharge from the study center  on Day 3. Exceptions include study -designated rescue 
medications, anesthetics, antibiotics, and concomitant medication for chronic stable i llness , which will 
be permitted according to the judgment of the investigator.  
• Analgesic medication other than short -acting pre- operative or intra -operative anesthetic agents before 
the popliteal sciatic block for bunionectomy is removed, ie, before taking  study medication , is 
prohibited. All analgesic medication taken immediately after the bunionectomy is  completed and 
before study medication  is administered is  excluded , with the exception of ketorolac 30 mg 
intravenously supplemental analgesia during the continuous infusion period and up until 1:00 A.M. 
• Chronic (defined as daily use for >2 weeks) opioid (oral codeine, dextromoramide, dihydrocodeine, 
oxycodone, or morphine -like anti- tussive) therapy , defined as >15 morphine equivalent  units per day 
for more  than 3 out of 7 days per week over a 1- month period withi n 12 months of surgery.  
• Long-acting NSAID within 4 days before initiation of study medication (except aspirin ≤325 mg/day 
for cardiovascular prophylaxis)  or short -acting NSAID within 1 day . 
• Regular  use of  opioid analgesic (buprenorphine, nalbuphine, or pentazocine) within 30 days before 
Screening.  
• Long-term use of  opioid agonist -antagonists . 
• Liver-inducing enzyme cytochrome P450: antiinfectives (eg, rifampicin, rifabutin, nevirapine, 
griseofulvin) or  anti-epileptics (phenobarbital, phenytoin) . 
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, or other drugs that reduce the 
seizure threshold within 4 weeks of study entry.  
• Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors  (milnaciprin, duloxitene, venlafaxine) , diet pills 
(including fenfluramine and phentermine) , or methylphenidate (Ritalin®), or similar ADHD 
medications  within 4 weeks of study entry . 
• Any investigational drug or device or investigational therapy will be prohibited within  30 days before 
Screening.  
All concomitant medications used (including over -the-counter medications and herbal supplements) will be 
recorded in the source document and on the appropriate CRF.

 9.13. Other Restrictions  
Other restrictions include the following:  
• Alcohol use is prohibited from 24 hours before surgery  until discharge from the study center  on Day  3. 
• No smoking upon admission to the study center until discharge from the study center on Day  3. 
• Nothing by mouth from midnight before surgery until 1 hour  after surgery.  
9.14. Rescue Medication  
After randomization, subjects will be encouraged to wait for at least 1 hour after the first dose of study 
medication  before receiving first rescue medication to allow time for the study medication  to exert its 
pharmacologic effect. Subjects may be given a cetaminophen 1 g IV every 4 to 6 hours, up to 4 g/ 24 hours , for 
pain as rescue medication after the anesthetic infusion is discontinued  and treatment with study medication  has 
been initiated . If su bjects  are unable to tolerate IV acetaminophen or  have insufficient pain relief with 
acetaminophen 1 g IV every 4 to 6 hours , oxycodone hydrochloride 5 mg Immediate Release (IR) tablets can be 
administered  every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain, up to a total of 30 mg/ 24 hours  
Acet aminophen has been  selected because its mechanism of action  differs from  tramadol and c elecoxib , while 
oxycodone  has been chosen as a secondary rescue medication because,  although it is contraindicated with other 
NSAIDs, it is e xpected that secondary rescue medication  will be required by few subjects and primarily for 
subjects randomized to the placebo group.  
Subjects whose pain cannot be adequately managed by  a combination of study medication  and rescue 
medication, or who develop unacceptable side effects during the study, will be discontinued from study 
medication or from further study participation . Their pain will be managed conventionally at the i nvestigator’s 
discretion. All end -of-study assessments should be performed for s ubjects who discontinue from the study, if 
possible. 
All concomitant medications used will be recorded in the source document and on the case report form. 
9.15. Treatment after End of Study  
After the end of the study, each subject will be treated according to st andard clinical practice.  
Subjects will be discharged home with a prescription for pain- relief medication and a subject diary in which to 
record AEs and concomitant medications .  
10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Subjects must  provide written informed consent before any study -related procedures are initiated, including the 
cessation of prohibited concomitant therapy.  
For the timing of assessments and procedures throughout the study, refer to the schedule of events (Section 17.1). 
Throughout the study, every reasonable effort should be made by study personnel to follow the timing of assessments and procedures in the schedule of events for each subject. If a subject misses a study visit for any reason, the visit should be rescheduled as soon as possible. 
10.1. Screening  
Subjects will sign an ICF before any screening -related procedures are performed. Screening assessments must 
be performed within 28 days bef ore the bunionectomy surgery (Day  -1). The following procedures will be 
performed at Screening:

 10.2.2 Surgery and Standardized Regional Anesthesia  
Subjects who continue to meet all study entry criteria will undergo standard first metatarsal bunionectomy 
procedure under  a standardized regimen of  regional anesthesia. The local anesthetic technique to be used for 
this surgery comprises a combination of a PSB to establish and maintain surgical field anesthesia and a continuous sciatic infusion to provide an effective method of controlling pain in the immediate postoperative period. 
The PSB will be administered using modifications of the Singelyn technique .
6 Subjects will receive midazolam 
and/or propofol for initial sedation at the anesthesiologist’s discretion. After adequate sedation is achieved, the 
anesthesiologist will inject approximately 5 mL lidocaine 1% (plain) (or suitable short acting local anesthetic 
without epinephrine) locally to anesthetize the skin, and will determine the location of the sciatic nerve for the 
PSB. Once the appropriate location is determined, the anesthesiologist w ill inject 40  mL of ropivacaine 0.5% to 
establish the PSB. Subsequently a catheter will be placed in the proximity of the popliteal sciatic nerve for 
delivery of postoperative anesthesia. If the PSB is not sufficient to provide adequate intraoperative anes thesia, a 
standard Mayo block may be established using lidocaine 2% (plain) not to exceed 25 mL . The time, date, dose, 
and route of all local anesthetics will be recorded in the CRF . (NOTE: While lidocaine 2% plain is the preferred 
local anesthetic to establish the Mayo block, an alternative plain short -acting local anesthetic or plain 
combination of 2 local anesthetics may be substituted if necessary. If mepivacaine is used for the Mayo block, the amount of mepivacaine should be added to the amount of mepi vacaine used postoperatively for the popliteal 
block in order not to exceed maximum allowed daily dose of 1000 mg).  
10.2.3 Postoperative R egional A nesthesia  
Postoperative pain will be managed using  a continuous anesthetic infusion through the catheter previously 
placed adjacent to the popliteal sciatic nerve in a manner adapted from the method described by Singelyn et  al 
(1997) and Zetlaoui and Bouaziz (1998) .
8,9 Mepivacaine 0.5% (plain) will be infused starting at 8  mL per hour 
and not to exceed 14 mL per hour. Alternatively, ropivacaine 0.2% (ropivacaine 0.5% diluted with saline to a 
final concentration of 0.2%)  may be substituted and infused starting at 1 -  8 mL per hour, not to exceed 8 mL 
per hour. Maintenance of the block may require additional procedure s such as periodic boluses of the anesthetic 
through the catheter or an increase in the rate of infusion of the anesthetic.   
Additionally, s ubjects may receive supplemental analgesia with ketorolac  30 mg IV during the continuous 
infusion period up until 1:00 A.M  to help control breakthrough pain if the regional anesthetic infusion is  
ineffective in the investigator ’s opinion.  
All subjects ’ conti nuous anesthetic infusion will be discontinued between 3:00 and 4:00 A .M. the morning after  
surgery. 
The time, date, dose, and route of all local anesthetics and systemic medications used in the postoperative 
period will be recorded in the e CRF.  
10.3. Day 1 (Pretreatment/Randomization)  
The following study procedures will occur on the day after surgery and before dosing on Day  1: 
1. Discontinue regional anesthetic infusion between 3:00 and 4:00 A .M. An IV  catheter should have been 
placed for delivery of postoperative analgesia or other required medication and will be maintained until 
discharge.  
2. Contact IR T to obtain the mode rate and severe pain box  numbers for the subject. Retrieve the study 
medication boxes  from stock, 1 for moderate pain and 1 for severe pain.

 3. Record vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and  oral body te mperature) after the subject 
has been in a resting  position for 5 minutes . 
4. Review the NPRS assessment training with the subject and instruct the subject to notify a member of the 
study staff and request treatment when he or she experiences a level of pain that they feel requires 
medicatio n.  
5. Prior to the first dose of study medication, perform clinical laboratory tests.  
6. Prior to the first dose of study medication, perform a 12- lead ECG.  
7. When the subject requests pain medication, administer the NPRS pain intensity assessment; subjects with a score ≥ 5 and ≤ 9 on the 0 -10 NPRS will be eligible for randomization into the study.  
8. Assign the corresponding study medication box; subjects with a score ≥5 and ≤9 on the 0- 10 NPRS will be 
randomized and stratified by Baseline pain level (moderate [NPRS 5- 6] or severe [7 -9]) using IRT, and 
assigned the appropriate pain level treatment box. The qualifying NPR pain assessment will serve as Baseline.  
9. Subjects with a NPRS score <5 will be asked if they can wait for treatment. If they cannot, they will be 
dropped from the study and treated according to the standard of care. If they agree to wait, they will be requested to notify a member of the study staff when their pain intensity has increased. If the subject’s pain intensity ratings do not meet the minimum e ntry criteria within 8 hours of discontinuation of the regional 
anesthesia, subjects will not be eligible for randomization and will receive routine postoperative care at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
10. Subjects with a NPRS score >9 will be dropped from the  study and treated according to the standard of care.  
11. Record and review concomitant medications.  
12. Record AEs.  
10.4. Treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 3)

 8. Collect blood and urine samples for routine laboratory tests.  
9. Perform 12- lead ECG.  
10.6. Study Duration  
The overall study duration is expected to be 10 months (6 months of active enrollment and 4 months of data 
management, statistical analyses and reporting).  
The estimated duration of the study for each subject is approximately 6 weeks, which includes up to a 4- week 
Screening Period, a 3 -day treatment period (72 hours of confinement with 48 hours of treatment), and a 
post-treatment follow -up visit approximately  1 week after surgery.  
The maximum study duration for each subject is approximately 40 days.  
10.7. Efficacy Assessments  
At assessment time points throughout the study, the pain intensity assessment will be completed first and the pain relief assessment will be c ompleted second. Subjects will not be permitted to compare their responses with their 
previous responses. Efforts should be made to perform the assessments at the scheduled times. The actual 
assessments time must always be recorded.  
10.7.1 Pain Intensity  
Subjects  will assess their current pain intensity using a 0 -10 NPRS . The NPRS  is a scale numbered zero to 10 
with “No Pain” as the left anchor (0) and “Worst Possible Pain” as the right anchor (10). Each subject will be instructed to circle a single number  on the line to indicate his or her current pain intensity. Pain intensity will be 
assessed before Time 0, at 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 
22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 42, 46, and 48 hours after T ime 0, and immediately before each use of rescue 
analgesia.  During the night, subject will be wakened  to administer the study medication. Pain assessments will 
be perform ed during the night only if the subject is awake.  
10.7.2 Pain Relief  
Subjects will assess the ir pain relief relative to Time  0 using a 5 -point categorical scale. Subjects will be asked 
“How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices of none  = 0, a little  = 1, 
some  = 2, a lot  = 3, and complete  = 4. Pain relief will be  assessed at 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 
2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 42, 46, and 48 hours after Time 0, and immediately before each use of rescue analgesia. During the night, subject will be wakened  to administer the 
study medication. Pain assessments will be perform ed during the night only if the subject is awake .

 10.7.3 Stopwatch Assessment  
Two stopwatches will be started immediately after the subject has swallowed the last  tablet  of the fi rst dose of 
study medication  with 8  ounces of water. Each subject will be instructed, “Stop the first stopwatch when you 
first feel any pain relief whatsoever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you might, but 
when you first feel any r elief in the pain you have now” (perceptible pain relief). The subject will also be 
instructed, “Stop the second stopwatch when you feel the pain relief is meaningful to you” (meaningful pain relief). If the subject does not press the stopwatches within 8 hours after Time  0, the subject will discontinue use 
of the stopwatches.  
10.7.4 Patient’s Global Evaluation of Study Medication  
For the patient’s global evaluation of study medication , the subject will be asked “How effective do you think 
the study medication  is as a treatment for pain?” with response choices of 0  = poor, 1 =  fair, 2  = good, 3 =  very 
good, or 4 = excellent. The subject will complete the patient’s global evaluation of study medication  at the end 
of the treatment period (Day  3) before discharge from  the study center . 
10.8. Safety Evaluations  
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of treatment- emergent AEs ( TEAEs ), physical examination findings, 
clinical laboratory test results, and changes in vital sign and ECG measurements.  
10.8.1 Physical Examination  
A compl ete physical examination (excluding the genitourinary exam) will be performed at Screening and before 
surgery on Day - 1. A targeted  physical examination, including an examination of the subject’s surgical center , 
will be performed before discharge from the study center  and at the Follow -up Visit . 
10.8.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature, will be measured after the subject has been in a resting position for 5 minutes. Vital signs will be meas ured at Screening and 
before surgery on Day - 1. From Day 1 through discharge from the study center , vital signs will be measured 
immediately before and 1 hour after each dose of study medication  each day. Vital signs will also be measured 
at the Follow -up Visit. 
10.8.3 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening, on Day 1 before the first dose of study medication , before 
discharge from the study center , and at the Follow -up Visit.

 10.8.4  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed at Screening , before the first dose of study medication 
on Day 1, before discharge from the study center , and at Follow -up. 
Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count (or estimate), red blood cell 
count, white blood cell cou nt (including differential)  
Serum Chemistry:  glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma -glutamyl transferase, sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, 
bicarbona te, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin  
Urinalysis  
(dipstick) : pH, specific gravity, blood, glucose, protein, ketones, nitrate , 
leukocytes  
The following laboratory tests will also be performed:  
• Alcohol breathalyzer test will be performed before surgery on Day  -1. 
• Urine drug screen samples will be collected at Screening and before surgery on Day  -1 to test for 
amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamines, opiates, phencyclidine , and 
tetrahydrocannabinol. 
• For female subjects of childbearing potential, a blood sample for the serum pregnancy test will be collected 
at Screening and at Follow -up; a urine pregnancy test sample will be collected before surgery on Day  -1.  
Blood and urine samples for hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis will be prepared using standard 
procedures and will be sent to a central laboratory for analyses.  
Dipstick determination of pH, specific gravity, blood, glucose, protein, ketones, and nitrate  will be tested locally 
at each center . If a dipstick test result is abnormal , a biochemistry urinalysis and a microbiology analysis will be 
performed, if needed.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of signing of the  ICF through to the completion of the clinical 
study (including the Follow -up V isit) or premature subject discontinuation from the clinical study.   
11.1. Definition s 
11.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether or  not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not  be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the frequency or 
severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition.  
An AE is defined as treatment emergent if the fi rst onset or worsening is after the first administration of study 
medication and not more than 7 days after the last administration of study medication .

Protocol ESTEV E-SUSA -301 Confidential   
 
20 Jul 2017  Final Version 4.0 (including Amendment 3)  
  
 Page 38 of 62 
 11.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly  or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other 
situations serious, such as important medical events  that may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but may jeopardiz e the subject or may require intervention to prevent another of the 
outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the study medication , or a hospital 
admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not  qual ify the condition or event as an SAE.  
A newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has received a study medication  is not  considered as an SAE 
unless it is suspected that the study medication (s) interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the 
pregna ncy. A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the study medication  during 
pregnancy  is an SAE.  
11.1.3 Significant Adverse Events  
All laboratory results will be reviewed by the investigator and any that are deemed clinically significan t will be 
recorded as AEs. Other significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities (other than those meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, including withdrawal of study medicatio n or significant additional concomitant therapy.   
11.1.4 Definition of Severity  
The clinical “severity” of an AE will be classified as:  
Mild : Causes no limitation of usual activities  
Moderate : Causes some limitation of usual activities  
Severe:  Prevents or severely limits usual activities  
 
11.1.5 Definition of Start Date, Stop Date, and Duration  
Start Date  and Time : The date at which the AE is first noted  
Stop Date  and Time : The date at which the AE  is known to be resolved. If it is  not known to 
have stopped, then indicate “ongoing. ” 
Duration:  A time in days, hours , or minutes .

 11.1.6 Action(s) Taken  
Action(s) taken with study medication as a result of an AE may consist of the following:  
• Dose not changed  
• Drug withdrawn  
11.1.7 Definition of Expe ctedness  
An AE is expected when its nature or severity is consistent with the known AE profile of the product. For a 
study medication , the known information is contained in the IB. For a marketed product, the known information 
is contained in the current package insert for the product. 
An AE is unexpected when its specificity or severity is not consistent with the current IB. For example, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already doc umented 
adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. Examples would be (a) acute renal failure as an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of fulminate hepatitis.  
11.1.8 Definition of Relationship to Study Medication(s)  
The categories for classifying the investigator’s opinion regarding the relationship of an AE to study medication (s) are listed below.  
Related  A reasonable possibility exists of a relationship between the AE  and the study 
medication . 
Not related  No reasonable possibility exists of a relationship between the AE and study medication . 
In situations where causality is unassessable , the AE will be considered related.  
11.1.9 Definition of Outcome at the Time of Last Obs ervation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as follows: 
• Resolved  
• Resolved with sequelae  
• Ongoing 
• Death  
• Unknown 
Death should only be selected as an outcome when the AE resulted in death. If more than 1 AE is possibly 
related to th e subject’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. Although “death” is 
usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death should be reported as SAEs .

 11.2. Management of Adverse Events  
11.2.1 Documentation of Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of a ny clinically relevant observations 
meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. T he subject will be allowed to spontaneously report any 
issues since the evaluation ; the n the investigator will then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using 
non-leading questions, such as “How are you feeling?” 
All AEs will be documented in the CRF with the following information, where appropriate: 
• AE name or term  
• When the AE first occ urred (start date)  
• When the AE stopped (stop date), or an indication of “ongoing” 
• How long the AE persisted (optional) 
• Severity of the AE  
• Seriousness 
• Actions taken  
• Outcome 
• Investigator opinion regarding the relationship of AE to the study medication (s) 
 
11.2.2  Follow- up of Subjects with an Adverse Event  
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution until it becomes stable or until it can be explained by 
another known cause(s) (ie, concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that fur ther 
evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject’s medical record.  
11.2.3  Treatment of Adverse Events  
Adverse events that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards of care. If 
pharmacologic treatment is given , it must be documented in the CRF. The decision about whether the subject may 
continue in the study will be made by the investigator  after consultation with the sponsor and/or medical monitor.  
If AEs occur in a subject that are not tolerable  despite conventional treatment, the investigator must decide 
whether to stop the subject’s involvement in the study.  
For double - or triple -blinded studies, it is not necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment assig nment in most

A SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will not be used in this study. 
13. STATISTICS  
This section pres ents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) that describes 
the details of the analyses to be conducted will be written prior to database lock; the SAP will include any 
specifications of subgroup analyses for selected  efficacy and safety variables .  
Each efficacy and safety endpoint will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. S ummary statistics will 
be provided for all demographic, efficacy, and safety parameters listed below. Unless otherwise indicated, all 
statistical tests will be 2 sided and differences will be considered statistically significant if P ≤ 0.05. 
To avoid interference i n efficacy measures (pain intensity assessments, pain relief at each time point [ PARt ], pain 
intensity differences [ PIDt ], and Sum of Pain Intensity Differences [ SPID ] calculations) at scheduled time points 
because of use of rescue medication, additional a ssessments will be made just before each administration of rescue 
medication, asking subjects to report their pain intensity /pain relief  at the current time. These data will be carried 
over for the duration of effect of the rescue medication taken (4 hours  for acetaminophen and 4 hours for 
oxycodone hydrochloride). 
13.1. Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy variable will be the pain intensity ( PI) measured by NPRS .  
The primary analysis endpoint will be the SPID  from 0 -48 hours defined as follows. 
• PIDt  = Pain Intensity Differences = PIt - PI0  where   
• PI0 = PI at time t = 0h on NPRS  
• PIt = Pain Intensity on NPRS  at specific time points  
 
The SPID is calculated as a time- weighted sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow -up time 
point (diffe rence between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied 
by the amount of time (in hours) since the last, non- missing  assessment.  
Negative values of PID will correspond to an amelioration of pain, while positive values will correspond to a 
recrudescence of pain.

point, and x is the nth time point;   x = 6, 12, 24, 48  
Where PR measured as 5 -point categorical scale: 0 = None;  1 = A l ittle; 2 = Some; 3 = A lot; 
4 = Complete.  
• Peak pain relief  and time to peak pain relief  
• Stop watches: t ime to onset of analgesia, time to perceptible pain relief , and time to meaningful pain relief  
• Time to onset of pain intensity decrease  
• Subject’s overall assessment of study medication  
• Rescue medication:  
- Proportion of subjects who take of at least 1 dose of rescue medication up to 4, up to 6, up to 12, up to 24, and up to 48 hours after first dose of study medication; number of doses  of rescue medication 
for the same time intervals  
- Time to first use of rescue  medication.  
• Proportion of Responder s, where Responders are:  
- Subject who reaches a 50% reduction in pain intensity from baseline sustained until the end of the 48-hour observation period;

below 4 on NPRS  sustained until the end of the 48 -hour observation period;  
- Subject who reaches a 30% reduction in pain intensity as compared to baseline and a pain intensity 
below 4 on NPRS  sustained until the end of the 48 -hour observation period.  
• Time -to-first-response will also be analyzed as time- to-event data, using the first time at which each 
response criteri on was reached by each subject.

 13.2. Sample Size Determination  
The pri mary outcome measure is SPID (NPRS) up to 48 hours post dose (SPID -48h). The study is powered to 
detect the superiority of co- crystal E -58425 to each of the 2 active control groups.  
A difference in pain intensity of 1 on a 0- 10 NPRS is considered to be the minimum detectable change for an 
individual time point. Since SPID is the time -weighted average of pain intensity over a 48 -hour period, the 
minimum detectable change of 10 mm from a single measurement must be multiplied by 48 hours. Therefore, the 
minimum detectable change in the primary outcome measure of SPID -48 hours is considered to be 48. 
Data from another bunionectomy study that used SPID -48 hours as a primary endpoint to compare two doses of 
tapentadol with placebo ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier N CT01516008) was used to estimate the expected SD in 
SPID -48 hours for the present study. In that study, the SD of the SPID -48 hours ranged from 107 to 124. 
Therefore, conservatively, the SD of SPID -48 hours for the present study is assumed to be 124.  
Since co-crystal E -58425 must show superiority over both tramadol and celecoxib, the power of each individual 
comparison is set at 9 0%, which will maintain an overall study power at 81%.  
To detect a difference of 48 with an SD of 124 at an alpha level of 0.05 w ith a power of 90% requires 142 subjects 
per group ( 71 for the placebo group since a 2:2:2:1 randomization scheme is being used). It is assumed that the 
comparison versus placebo will be adequately powered since the difference versus placebo is believed to be larger 
than that of the active comparators.  
Allowing for approximately a 20% rate of non- evaluable subjects  (ie, those not included in the PPAS) , a total of 
630 subjects, 180 subjects per active group and 90  subjects for the placebo group will be randomized . 
A blinded sample size re -estimation will be conducted when approximately 50% of subjects have completed the 
study and the actual pooled SD of the SPID -48 will be calculated on blinded/pooled data (see Section 13.4.6). 
The sample size will not be reduced  as a result of this re -estimation.  The exact time when this procedure will be 
made will be decided based on the observed actual accrual rate and it will be specified in the SAP.  
13.3. Analysis Set s 
The following 3 analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• Safety  Set: all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study medication. 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): all randomized subjects  
• Per-protocol An alysis Set  (PPAS): all subjects in the Full Analysis Set with no major protocol deviations  
• Completers Analysis Set (CAS):  A subset of the PP set that includes all subjects who have pain assessments 
up to 48 hours after first dose of study medication  
Inclusion in the analysis sets  will be determined prior to database lock  and prior to unblinding the treatment 
assignments . 
If a subject is randomized incorrectly or is administered the incorrect study medication , analyses of the Full 
Analysis Set  will be based on the assigned treatment whereas all other analyses will be based on the actual 
treatment.  
Primary e fficacy analyses will  be based on the FAS. The PP S et and the CAS will be used for sensitivity 
analysis for some efficacy endpoints. Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set.  
 All subjects who signed informed consent  will be considered study  participants .

 13.4. Statistical Analyses  
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.  
Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of  statistical significance will be two -sided, and a difference resulting in a 
P value of ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. To declare the study successful, co-crystal E -58425 
will need to show a statistically significant advantage over each comparator (tramadol and celecoxib). Moreover, 
a comparison with placebo will be performed to assess the co- crystal E -58425 absolute effica cy. Because all 
3 comparisons must be statistically significant to declare the study successful, no formal adjustme nt for multiple 
comparisons is needed.  
For analyses involving study center, if the number of subjects per center is small, centers may be pooled for analysis, or omitted from statistical models. The final determination will be made prior to database lock.   
For continuous variables, summary statistics will typically include the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, summary statistics will typically include the number and percentage of subjects in each category.  
13.4.1 Disposition  
The numbers of subjects randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for withdrawal, will be tabulated overall and by treatment group. The number of subjects in each analysis population will be reported. This analysis will be based on all st udy participants . 
13.4.1.1 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be collected ongoing through the study.  Protocol deviations excluding subjects from the PP analysis set will be agreed and signed off by the sponsor prior to database lock and unblinding.  
13.4.2 Subj ect Characteristics  
Demographic variables will include age,  gender , race, weight, height, and BMI. Baseline subject characteristics 
will include surgery duration and other surgery characteristics . 
Medical history and study medication  administration will be  summarized descriptively by treatment group and 
presented in listings.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group and by the number and percentage of subjects taking each medication, classified using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classes and preferred terms.  
The remaining subject characteristic variables will be summarized descriptively by treatment group and overall. No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
These analyses wi ll be conducted for the Safety Set . 
13.4.3 Efficacy  
13.4.3.1 Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will compare treatment groups for the SPID from time 0 to 48 hours. This will be tested using an analysis of covariance model adjusting for center and baseline pain  intensity. In addition, 95% 
confidence intervals for pairwise differences between treatments will be estimated.  
To account for the use of rescue medication, any pain measurements taken during a period of time in which rescue medication is active will be replaced by the last pain measurement before rescue medication was taken.

 Additional sensitivity analyses assessin g the impact of rescue use and missing data due to study discontinuation 
will be performed.  
The details of the sensitivity analyses and handling of missing data will be described in the SAP written prior to 
database lock.  
13.4.3.2 Secondary Analyses  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. 
Continuous secondary endpoints  will be analyzed similarly to the primary endpoint.   
For ordinal secondary endpoints such as pain relief score at each scheduled time point, peak pain relief  (ie, the 
lowest value of the PID) , and patient’s global evaluation of study medication , descriptive summaries include the 
number and percentage of subjects within each category for each treatment group. Nominal P values from 
ordinal logistic  regression, adjusting for baseline pain intensity and center, as appropriate comparing the 
placebo group with other treatment groups will be provided, but no formal statistical inferences will be drawn 
on the basis of these tests. 
For each time -to-event e ndpoint, the Kaplan- Meier method will be used to evaluate the treatment effect. Time 
to peak pain relief will be taken as the time to the lowest value of the NPRS after baseline, provided that the 
lowest value after baseline is lower than the baseline valu e. Time to onset of pain intensity decrease will be 
measured as the time at which the difference from baseline pain intensity (PID) is decreased ≥ 1 point in NPRS 
for the first time after the first study medication intake. T ime to perceptible pain relief co nfirmed by meaningful 
pain relief will be based on data collected using the 2 -stopwatch method following the first dose of study 
medication . In addition to the raw data from the stopwatches, a derived measure “time to onset of analgesia” 
will be defined as  the time to perceptible pain relief if subsequently confirmed by meaningful pain relief. The  4 
time-to-event variables will be right censored at 8 hours for subjects who reach the event during the 8- hour 
interval after Time  0, or those who require rescue medication before achieving the event.  The summary table 
will provide the number of subjects analyzed, the number of subjects censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals for the estimated median. P  values from log -rank tests will also be used to examine  
treatment effect . Cox proportional hazard models may  be used to  further explore such potential covariates as 
gender , baseline pain intensity , and center.  
For the proportion of subjects using rescue medication, a logistic regression m odel that adjusts for baseline pain 
intensity  and center  will be used to evaluate the treatment effect.  
Efficacy analyses will be also performed by subgroups defined by moderate or severe baseline pain.  
13.4.4 Exposure  
Investigational product administration will be summarized in terms of each subject’s mean, mode, and final dose, 
and in terms of duration of exposure. Descriptive statistics for these quantities, including the mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, and quartiles, will be provided by treatment group .  
13.4.5 Safety  Analyses  
The safety endpoints are the incidence of TEAEs , physical examination findings, and changes in ECG and vital 
sign measurements.   
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities ( Version 19.0 or higher)  will be used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and 
preferred term. The number and percentage of subjects with AEs will be displayed for each treatment group by

 SOC and PT. Summaries of AEs by severity and relationship to study medication  will also be provided. Serious 
adverse events , AEs resulting in discontinuation of study medication  and AEs of special interest  will be 
summarized separately in a similar manner. Subject listings of AEs, SAEs and AEs causin g discontinuation of 
study medication  will be produced. Comparisons between treatment groups for incidence of AEs, AEs of 
special interest may be performed. Any comparisons of safety analyses will be described in detail in the SAP.  
For vital sign measureme nts and ECG parameters , descriptive statistics will be provided at each scheduled time 
point for each treatment group. Changes from Baseline for vital signs and ECG  parameters will be calculated 
for each subject , and descriptive statistics will be provided  on changes in vital signs from Baseline for each 
treatment group at each scheduled time point after Baseline. No formal statistical tests will be performed.  For 
clinical laboratory, ECG , and vital sign variables , the values that are below, within, or above a defined normal 
range and the values that are clinically significant will be counted and tabulated by the number and percentage 
of subjects with such values  and will be tabulated showing change from baseline (shift tables) . 
Descriptive summaries (me an, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) of actual (absolute) values and changes 
from baseline values will be presented for clinical laboratory values for each treatment group at each time point.  
The number of subjects with clinical laboratory values categori zed as below, within, or above normal ranges, [or 
other specific ranges of interest] will be tabulated showing change from baseline (shift tables) for each clinical laboratory analyte by treatment group and by time . Pre- and post -treatment values will also  be presented with an 
analysis of mean changes from baseline.  
Laboratory values , vital sign measurements  and ECG measurements  that are outside the normal range will also 
be flagged in the data listings, along with corresponding normal ranges , if provided. Any out -of-range values that 
are identified by the investigator as being clinically significant will also be shown in a data listing.  For l aboratory 
values , vital sign measurements  and ECG parameters individual data and mean values by treatment groups wil l 
also be shown in graphical displays.  
The number and percentage of subjects with normal and abnormal findings in the complete physical 
examination will be displayed for each treatment group. 
The results of the safety analyses described in this section are to be taken as descriptive measures of differences 
among treatment groups, and not as formal statistical hypothesis tests or indicators of important clinical differences.  
Safety analyses will be conducted for the safety analysis population.  
13.4.6 Interim Analys is 
An interim analysis is planned . A blinded sample size re -estimation following the methodology described in 
Keiser and Friede
10 will be conducted when approximately 50% of subjects have completed the study and the 
actual pooled SD of the SPID -48 will be calculated on blinded/pooled data . If that SD is >124 , the sample size 
will be increased accordingly to maintain an overall study  power of at least 81 %, up to a maximum of 900 subjects. 
The sample size will not be reduced if the SD is smaller. The exact time when this procedure will be made will be decided based on the observed actual accrual rate and it will be specified in the SAP .

j Immediately after the block is discontinued, study staff will pull 2 random study medication kits, 1 for moderate pain and 1 for severe p ain. S ubjects will 
be instructed to request pain medication when they experience pain.  
k When a subject requests pain medication, the Pain intensity ( NPRS) assessment will be conducted and the qualifying pain score must be ≥ 5  and ≤ 9; 
subjects will be randomized in to the study  and stratified by Baseline pain score ( moderate [NPRS 5 -6], severe [7 -9], using i nteractive response technology  
and the appropriate pain level kit will be used.  
l Pain intensity ( NPRS ) assessments will be recor ded by the subject in the inpatient subject diary ; the qualifying pain score serves as the Baseline pain 
score  before the first dose of study medication  (Day  1/Time  0). Pain intensity ( NPRS ) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) assessments will be 
recorded at the following time points:  
• First dose : to 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, and 6 7, 8 hours after Time  0, and immediately before the use of rescue 
analgesia   
• Subsequent doses : 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 26, 28,  30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 42, 46, and 48 hours  after Time  0 and immediately before each  use of rescue 
analgesia.  
• Before premature study termination.  
m The first dose of study medication  will be administered within 8  hours after the anesthetic block has been dis continued when pain intensity is ≥ 5 and ≤ 9 
on the NPRS . Study medication  will be administered from Day  1 through Day 3 for a total of 48 hours.  
n Start stopwatches as soon as the first dose of study medication  is administered.  
o Subjects will complete a patient’s global evaluation of study medication  at the end of the treatment period (Day  3) before discharge from the study center.

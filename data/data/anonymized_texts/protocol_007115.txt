1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
1.1 Background  
In 1945, Dr. H.D. Kesling envisioned that one day modern technology would enable the use of a series of 
tooth positioners to produce the kinds of movements required for comprehensive orthodontic treatment. 
Techn ology has made this vision a reality. Using advanced computer technology, Align Technology Inc. 
generates Invisalign®, a series of customized clear appliances, called "aligners." Each aligner is worn 
sequentially by the patient to produce extensive tooth m ovements in both upper and lower arches.  
Class II malocclusions are often characterized by mandibular retrognathia and increased overjet. In 
patients with Class II malocclusions that are undergoing growth, appliances that reposition the mandible 
in a forw ard position can be used to correct class relationship. Such appliances include the Clark twin 
block, Bionator, Mandibular Anterior Repositioning Appliance (MARA), and Herbst (Figure 1).  
Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such  appliances in treating Class II 
malocclusions, as indicated by improved overjet, molar relationship, canine relationship, and/or 
orthopedic changes (Siara -Olds 2010, O’Brien 2004, Pangrazio -Kulbersh 2003).  The aim of these 
appliances is to maintain the lo wer jaw in a forward position for as long as the appliances are worn, such 
that orthopedic and/or postural changes can take place to correct the patient’s occlusion to a Class I by 
the end of the appliance treatment.  
Most existing Class II appliances repo sition the mandible in one step, such that the patient’s jaw is 
positioned at the desired final position (or an overcorrected position) throughout the course of treatment. 
An alternative to this method is incremental repositioning, in which the total amoun t of A -P correction is 
divided into multiple steps. This method has been shown to be effective with the Clark Twin Block 
therapy (Banks 2004),  and one advantage to this method is increased patient comfort especially at the 
start of therapy.  
  
2. DESCRIPTION AND INDICATIONS FOR USE  
2.1 Device Description  
The Invisalign® System consists of a series of clear plastic aligners that are intended to replace 
conventional wire and bracket technology for many orthodontic cases.  Each custom manufactured a ligner 
exerts gentle, continuous forces to move teeth incrementally from their original state to a final, treated 
state.  Each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then replaced by the next in the series until the final 
position is achieved.  For years, or thodontists and dentists have used removable appliances for orthodontic 
treatment. Today, with the application of computer technology and custom manufacturing, Invisalign 
treats a broader range of cases with greater precision.

ALIGN CONFIDENTIAL    07-02-2018   
  
The Invisalign System with buccal and occlusal  Mandibular Repositioning Feature (MRF) are 
removable devices that consist of an aligner with two ramps (blocks), upper and lower, which interlock 
on the occlusal or buccal planes (Figure 2).   The upper and lower ramps are designed to in terlock in such 
a manner that the mandible is held in a more protrusive position.  The repositioning of the mandible can 
be done sequentially in multiple increments (steps), in order to meet the doctor’s treatment goal.  The 
Invisalign System with MRF is m ade from the SmartTrack material , a clear thermoplastic and utilizes 
current Invisalign System manufacturing processes.

3. STUDY PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES   
3.1 Study Objectives  
To demonstrate that growing teenagers which present up to full cusp Class II malocclusions can be 
treated  using Invisalign with MRF. The primary objective of the study will be to demonstrate that 
Invisalign with MRF is not inferior to existing functional appliances to treat up to full cusp Class II 
malocclusions in growing teenagers. The objective will be met  if Invisalign aligners with MRF correct 
Class II malocclusions at a rate that is not inferior to previously reported repositioning rates.  This will 
be achieved if the median rate of correction using Invisalign with MRF at the end of mandible 
repositionin g is non -inferior to published rates of movement (e.g. 0.42 mm/mo. for Dynamax)  
(Thiruvenkatachari, Sandler et al.)   to a confidence level of 80%.  The rate of movement will be

measured by measuring overjet over time. (Initial overjet vs. overjet at the en d of mandible 
repositioning).   
Secondary objectives will include demonstration that Invisalign treatment with MRF can be completed 
predictably with both buccal and occlusal configurations.  The secondary endpoints will be measured by 
comparing length of tre atment to the predicted ClinCheck treatment plan . Additionally, validation of 
subjects dental and jaw positioning will be assessed via comparisons of subject’s photos and 
radiographs.  Both subject and doctor perception will be assessed.   
All statistical c omparisons will be conducted to an 80% confidence level.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overview of Study Design  
This study is a  prospective, non -randomized Investigational Device Exemption study.  It is designed to 
measure how safely and effectively Class II malocclusions are corrected in teenagers by repositioning 
the mandible.  It will also examine how efficiently the repositioning will occur.  There are  different 
mandibular repositioning  features with the Invisalign System.   The designs will be observed in the 
following two groups.    
• Subjects wearing buccal MRF (designated as B1)  o Subjects wearing buccal with 
rib feature MRF (designated as B2)  
• Subjects wearing occlusal MRF (designated  as O1)  
During the course of treatment, Investigators will monitor the use of the MRF in subjects and complete 
case report forms.  Monitoring of the cases and completion of the case report forms will continue 
throughout the treatment of the Class II to Cl ass I correction as well as through to the subject’s end of 
Invisalign treatment or withdrawal from the study.  Data from this correction will be analyzed and may 
be used for publication or regulatory purposes.  After the use of the Invisalign aligners wit h  MRF 
portion of treatment is completed, the subject will continue with their Invisalign treatment through to the 
end of treatment for the final study visit.  
Additional Prospective and Retrospective Follow -Up will be collected to provide additional data on the 
impact of breakage and deformation on the treatment outcome.   This data collection will coincide with 
the 3 and 6 month follow -up periods of the IDE clinical study.  The data collected will be similar to that 
obtained at follow up visits.    
All stud y subjects will be treated with Invisalign aligners that have been modified to meet the study 
requirements.  All sites will be monitored by the Sponsor in accordance to the monitoring plan.  All data 
collected will be analyzed by the Sponsor or a designate d statistician.  
This modified protocol provides continued access to the Study devices until FDA clearance is granted.   
All participating Investigators and designated office coordinators will be trained on the clinical study 
protocol and good clinical prac tices (GCP) by representatives of the Sponsor.   
4.1.1 Materials  
The cases will be submitted and fabricated at Align Technology, Inc. with the same material  as that is 
currently used on normal Invisalign patient cases (SmartTrack material).

4.1.3 End Study  
The End of Study occurs when a subject has completed all study related visits.  When all subjects have 
completed the study, a report will be written concluding the findings from the study.  
4.2 Number of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups  
This study  will enroll up to  165 patients.  It is recommended that each site enroll a minimum of 10 
subjects, to facilitate pooling of the data.  It is recommended that each site recruits a minimum of 1 
subject to have the occlusal feature set and a minimum of 1 subj ect to have the buccal feature set.    
4.3 Sites  
This study will be conducted at multiple sites in North America.

 4.4   Subject Withdrawal   
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator or 
Sponsor may wi thdraw the subject at any time for any reason.  If any subject withdraws or is withdrawn 
from the study, any non -study records that were taken while the subject was enrolled in the study will 
not be shared with the study Sponsor and there will be no requir ement to continue treatment according to 
this protocol.  Withdrawal from the study will not result in any penalties and will not preclude or 
interfere with the investigator’s treatment of the subject outside of the study. Additional subjects may be 
enrolle d to substitute for any withdrawn subject until the study target enrollment is reached.  
If MRF cannot be placed, the subject will be removed from the study, and be revaluated; and the 
Invisalign setup will be normal Invisalign treatment as prescribed by t he treating doctor.    
5. DATA COLLECTION PLAN   
The schedule of all study activities and procedures is provided in Table 1.  Bold  text indicates standard  
Invisalign System records and standard treatment for Class II correction, independent of appliance used.  
No additional invasive or other burdensome interventions in comparison to the standard care will be 
performed.  
6. DATA ANALYSIS  
Data will be analysed by the Sponsor’s statisticians or an identified consultant. The data will be analysed 
using standard univariate and bivariate techniques.  All continuous variables will be expressed as means, 
standard deviations and ranges, while discrete variables will be expressed as proportions and 
percentages. Medians will be expressed where appropriate.  Significance will be demonstrated to a 80% 
confidence level.   
6.1 Primary endpoint analysis:  
The primary objective of the study will be to demonstrate that Invisalign with MRF is not inferior to 
existing functional appliances to treat up to full cusp Cla ss II malocclusions in growing teenagers. The 
objective will be met if Invisalign aligners with MRF correct Class II malocclusions at a rate that is not 
inferior to previously reported repositioning rates.  This will be achieved if the median rate of corre ction 
using Invisalign with MRF at the end of the mandible repositioning is non -inferior to published rates of 
movement (0.42 mm/mo. Dynamax) (Thiruvenkatachari, Sandler et al.)   to a confidence level of 80%.  
The rate of movement will be measured by measu ring overjet over time. (Initial overjet vs. overjet at the 
end of mandible repositioning).   
Secondary objectives will include demonstration that Invisalign treatment with MRF can be completed 
predictably with both buccal and occlusal configurations.  The s econdary endpoints measured by 
comparing the length of treatment to the predicted ClinCheck treatment plan. Additionally, validation of

ALIGN CONFIDENTIAL    07-02-2018   
  
subjects dental and jaw positioning will be assessed via comparisons of subject’s photos and 
radiographs.  Both subject a nd doctor perception will be assessed.   
6.2 Sample Size Calculation  
The sample needed to demonstrate non -inferiority of the Invisalign with MRF to literature is found using 
a single sided proportion value, with the hypothesis that Ho P=Po and a 80% power is 63 patients.  
Additional patients will be recruited to the study, to compensate for patients who do not respond to 
treatment from insufficient wear of the appliance, and to compensate for lost to follow -up and 
uncompliant data.      
7. SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE   
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events   
An adverse event (AE) is any unwanted dental occurence which a subject experiences during a clinical 
investigation, whether or not the AE is suspected of having a causal relationship with study treatment.  
Pre-existing dental events, which increase in frequency or severity or c hange in nature during or as a 
consequence of use of an appliance clinical trials, will also be considered as adverse events.     
An adverse event will not include non -compliance, lost or abuse of aligners which includes soaking of 
aligners in any substance  or cutting of aligners without the permission of the treating orthodontist.  This 
also includes a subject eating or drinking while wearing their aligners.   
Examples of known adverse events are:  
Blisters/Lesions/Ulcerations  
Coughing/Sneezing/ Wheezing  
Diarrhea/Upset Stomach/Nausea  
Enamel Decalcification/White Spot Lesions  
Headaches/Migraines  
Localized Hives/Itching/Rash  
Necrosis/Nerve Damage Root 
Resorption  
Runny Nose/Nasal Congestion  
Soft Tissue Recession  
Sore lips, gums or tongue  
Sore throat  
Swollen throat/Sensation of throat closing  
Swelling of lymph nodes  
TMJ/Jaw pain

ALIGN CONFIDENTIAL    07-02-2018   
  
Vomiting   
7.1.1 Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs assessed by the investigator shall contact Align Clinical Research group and provide to Align 
information about the AE. This includes the date of onset and resolution, severity, causality (relationship 
to aligners), outcome and action taken with respect to study appliance.  In addition, the events will be 
assessed by Align Clincial Research to see if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE). A 
serious adverse event will be defined as:  
• Led to a death  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury  
o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function o Required 
in-subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization o Resulted in 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impartment to body structure or a 
body function  
7.1.2 Treatment and Follow -up of AEs   
Any AE will be followed until a satisfactory result is reached or until it becomes stable or until it is 
proven that it resulted from another cause (concurrent condition) and clinical judgment concludes that 
further evaluation is not indicated.  
7.2 Handli ng of Safety Parameters  
7.2.1 Reporting of Adverse Events   
Each investigator will report any AE (whether or not a relationship to aligners is suspected) with an 
onset date, after signing the informed consent form and follow this subject until the last al igners are 
worn, to the Align Clinical Research group at the following e -mail: clinicalresearch@aligntech.com .  
Investigators should report an incident using the AE CRF within 24 to 48 hours, 7 days a week.  
The Investigator will need to report observation s and findings potentially relevant to the final outcome of 
an AE in the subject’s medical record.  
The Sponsor may request return of the involved device or any potential device -related event, for 
investigation. A procedure for cleaning and returning of th e device will be provided by the Sponsor.   
The Sponsor will discuss all AEs and initiate and coordinate the appropriate actions. This includes in 
particular the notification of the competent authority in case of a device -related AE and - in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki – the notification of the responsible ethics committee for all SAEs.

7.3 Study Risks and Benefits  
The Invisalign System is indicated for the alignment of teeth during orthodontic treatment of 
malocclusion. The product labe ling that describes the use and any warnings and precautions in the use of 
this device will be provided to Investigators.  There is no additional risk involved with participating in 
this study beyond that associated with current orthodontic treatment pract ices. Procedures and treatments 
described in this protocol are in accordance with current orthodontic practices.  
8. POTENTIAL SUBJECT RISKS AND BENEFITS   
8.1.1 Potential Subject Risks  
The Invisalign System is a dental device for the alignment of teeth d uring orthodontic treatment of 
malocclusions. A risk analysis of the Invisalign System has been performed for the 510(k) clearance. All 
identified risks have been minimized or eliminated through appropriate risk control measures, which are 
largely based on  the compliance with harmonized standards. Hazards associated with use errors are 
reduced to an acceptable risk level by descriptions in the instructions for use. The product labeling that 
describes the use and any warnings and precautions in the use of th e device will be provided to 
Investigators. There is no risk or foreseeable discomfort involved with being in this study beyond that 
associated with current orthodontic treatment practices. Procedures and treatments described in this 
protocol are in accord ance with current orthodontic practices and identical to the ones a subject would 
undergo during clinical care of alignment of malocclusion. As such, subjects will not be subject to 
additional clinical burden while participating in the study.  
8.1.2 Potent ial Subject Benefits  
There are no known additional benefits to the subject as a result of participating in this study other than 
the benefits of the orthodontic treatment. As no orthodontic treatment is guaranteed to be effective, the 
use of the Invisalig n System may or may not improve the positioning of the subjects teeth or the 
positioning of the mandible. However, in contrast to conventional braces - requiring brackets and wires 
with the risk of irritating the mouth - the Invisalign System features clea r aligners with a smooth surface.  
The aligners may be removed for easy cleaning and eating, resulting in lower interference in life -style.

and after treatment.  The Investigator’s office may assist the Investigator (as directed by the 
Investigator) throughout the study.   
11. ETHICAL ASPECTS  
11.1 Local Re gulations/Declaration of Helsinki   
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is 
conducted, whiche ver affords the greater protection to the individual.  The study must fully adhere to the 
principles outlined in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice:  Consolidated Guideline or with local law if it 
affords greater protection to the subject. All investigators wil l additionally ensure that the basic principles 
of “Good Clinical Practice” as outlined in the current version of United States 21 CFR, Part 812 
"Investigational Device Exemptions", Part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects”, and Part 56, “Institutional 
Revie w Boards”, are adhered to.  
11.2 Informed Consent   
It is the responsibility of the Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator (if acceptable by local 
regulations), to obtain written informed consent from each individual participating in this  study after 
adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives and potential risks of the study. It must also be 
explained to the subjects that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it 
at any time for any reason with out any penalty. The Informed Consent will be reviewed and approved by 
the reviewing IRB.  
11.3 Institutional Review Board   
It is the understanding of the Sponsor that this protocol and any modifications as well as appropriate 
consent forms/procedures, wil l be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board. This board 
must operate in accordance with the current Federal, State, Local and institutional regulations and 
requirements. A letter or certificate of approval will be sent by the Investigator t o the Sponsor prior to 
initiation of the study and also whenever any subsequent modifications to the protocol are made.  
12. CONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL   
Protocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between an a ppropriate 
representative of the Sponsor and the Investigators in this multi -center trial.  Protocol modifications must 
be prepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by the Sponsor.

All protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Institutional Review Board for 
information and approval in accordance with local requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies, if required. 
Approval must be awaited before any changes can be implemented, excep t for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involve[s] only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial (e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]).  
13. CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY  
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Should this be necessary, both parties 
will arrange the procedures on an individual study basis after review and consultation.  In terminating the 
study, Align Techn ology, Inc., or its designee, and the Investigator will assure that adequate consideration 
is given to the protection of the subject’s interests.   
14. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, CRFS AND RECORD KEEPING  
14.1 Investigator's Files / Retention of Documents  
The Inv estigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be 
fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified 
into two separate categories [1] Investigator's Study File,  and [2] subject clinical source documents.  
The Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Case Report and Query Forms, 
Institutional Review Board and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, 
staff curriculu m vitae and authorization forms and other appropriate documents correspondence etc.   
Subject clinical source documents include subject records, Doctor's notes, appointment book, original 
laboratory reports, and special assessment reports, signed informed consent forms, consultant letters, and 
subject screening.  In general, study -related records must be kept for at least 3 years after completion of 
the clinical trial and at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or formal 
disconti nuation of clinical development. After that period of time the documents may be destroyed, subject 
to local regulations.    
Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the Sponsor or its design ee must be notified in advance.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigational site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor, or its 
designee, to st ore these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to 
the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care 
of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for s toring outside of the site.   
14.2 Source Documents and Background Data  
The Investigator shall supply the Sponsor, on request, with any required background data from the study 
documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when CRFs are il legible or when errors in 
  
Invisalign System with Buccal and Occlusal  Mandibular Repositioning 
Feature (MRF)

data transcription are suspected. In case of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for 
audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that subject 
confidentiality is protected.  
14.3 Audits and Inspections  
The Investigator should understand that source documents for this trial must be made available to 
appropriately qualified personnel from the Sponsor or its designees, or to health authority inspectors after 
appro priate notification. The verification of the CRF data must be by direct inspection of source 
documents.

15. MONITORING THE STUDY  
It is understood that the responsible monitor or designee will contact and visit the Investigator and will be 
allowed, on request, to inspect the various records of the trial including CRFs and other pertinent data, 
provided that subject confidentiality is  maintained, and in accord with local requirements.  
It will be the study monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study 
to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the d ata being 
entered on them. The study monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records 
needed to verify the entries on the CRF. The Investigator or his/her deputy agrees to cooperate with the 
study monitor to ensure that any p roblems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
Remote monitoring will be performed on a regular basis, and on site monitoring will be performed for 
cause, if compliance is compromised, or discrepancies in data are found.   
16. CONF IDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT RECORDS  
The Investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities are 
protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor, subjects 
should not be identified by their names, but by Patient Identification numbers (PID) code. The

ALIGN CONFIDENTIAL    07-02-2018   
  
Investigator should maintain documents not for submission to the Sponsor, e.g., subjects’ written 
consent forms, in strict confidence.   
17. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND  PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS  
The Sponsor must receive copies of any intended communication in advance of publication (at least 30 
days for an abstract or oral presentation, and 60 working days for a journal submission). The Sponsor will 
review the communi cations for accuracy (thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to health 
authorities), verify that confidential information is not being inadvertently divulged, as well as supply any 
supplementary information.  Authorship of communications ar ising from pooled data will include 
members of each of the contributing centers as well as the Sponsor’s personnel .

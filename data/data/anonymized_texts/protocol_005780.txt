1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives  of this research . 
Response:  
Our overarching goal is to develop novel portable technology, affordable 
for home use and capable of quantifying quality of movement with the 
purpose of providing to provide objective feedback on performance  
of upper limb motor tasks to individuals with residual deficits following chronic 
conditions such as stroke. We assert that smartphones combined with 3 
dimensional printed objects can be used to create rehabilitation and assessment 
to that may be used in home environments. This creates a home -rehabilitation 
system that will promote self- management of upper limb rehabilitation efforts 
across the lifespan in chronic conditions such as stroke. 
Aim 1: Develop and validate a novel in- home rehabilitat ion system using 
3D printing technologies, smart devices and machine learning algorithms. 
Aim 2: Examine performance changes in trained ADLs when augmenting 
3D printed objects with smart technology to provide quantitative feedback 
on performance.  
1.2 State the  hypotheses to be tested , if applicable.  
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study that corresponds with your above listed objectives.  
Response:  
Aim 1 hypothesis - Smartphone measurements provide a valid assessment 
of upper limb kinematics  
Aim 2 hypothesis: We hypothesize that characteristics of performance 
including time to complete the task and normalized jerk score 
(smoothness/quality of movement) will improve with this home based 
training

 Page 5 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  Response:  
Aim 1 - We will validate that data from a smartphone can be modeled to 
accurately identify human performance including task events, movement 
status detection, and performance -quality evaluation. 
Aim 2 - We will examine kinematics of movement as well as time to completion of 
defined acts of daily li ving.

of the research  based on the existing literature and how it will contribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include  
relevant pr eliminary find ings or prior research by the investigator.  
Response: Significance: Developing portable technology, affordable for 
home use, capable of quantifying quality of movement and providing user 
feedback on motor performance is significant as it advances the  pres ent 
standard of care in home -based rehabilitation for millions of individuals 
with motor deficits ( 1-4). The population in the US is aging, ( 5) and with 
increased age there is diminished motor control  (6-9) in addition to higher 
risk for neurological insul t such as stroke  (10). Over 700,000 new cases of 
stroke occur each year  (11,12).  This  number is projected to increase with 
the aging of the baby boomer generation. Rehabilitation services aimed at  
reducing limitation and improving functional mobility often focus on the 
early stages of recovery with specialized  inpatient rehabilitation units for 
stroke  (13). Despite evidence that improvements can still be made several 
years  post stroke  (14) rehabilitation options in chronic stages of stroke are 
not well esta blished. Only 10- 15% of stroke  survivors had a follow -up 
with a physical therapist one year after their stroke  (15) Written home 
exercise programs  are commonly prescribed at the end of formal therapies. 
However, as practice is a key component to improvement ( 16), 
participation is imperative for a home exercise program to lead to motor 
performance benefits  (17). Regaining as much upper limb function as 
possible is important, as even mild impairments are associated with  
limitations in daily function  and lower health -related quality of life  (18). 
Hence, developing approaches to better  support clients with their home 
program is important. The proposed portable measurement system will 
have the  potential to promote participation and refine practice by 
providing them with feedback.  
Creating automated systems that measure and give feedback on quality of 
movement will promote a more  proactive approach to maximizing 
function across the lifespan of individuals with chronic conditions. With a  
robust body of res earch underscoring the importance of practice,  (19-22) 
providing adequate practice in rehabilitation across the lifespan is central 
to efficacious interventions  (19,23).  Providing feedback can promote 
participation, refine  practice and give individuals a better understanding of 
their abilities to then set goals for themselves  (17,24,25)  As demonstrated 
by previous research, exercise programs that include feedback from a 
 Page 6 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  person through a home  visit, telephone call or clinic appointment have 
resulted in bette r outcomes compared to programs without  feedback  
(17,25)  This feedback informs the participant of their progress to more 
specifically direct their rehabilitation  efforts and potentially motivate them 
to continue. Feedback can encourage better self -management of ongoing 
rehabilitation. Herein it is proposed that coupling three -dimensional (3D) 
printing with smart technology provides a scalable option to provide 
feedback in long- term rehabilitation. Embedding smartphones in 3D  
printed objects tailored to the individual’s mobility needs harnesses the 
sensors and networking functions of  smartphones to quantify quality of 
movement and provide timely feedback to the user. This offers a vast  
improvement compared to the typical written home program issued at 
dischar ge. With a static written home  exercise program, patients have a 
limited capacity to evaluate their motor performance and no 
encouragement  to refine their movement. As individuals with motor 
deficits following neurological insult are able to make  improveme nts 
beyond the acute phase, (16,21,26)  it is necessary to provide better options 
for home rehabilitation.  
Preliminary Work and Pilot Data: Focus groups held with individuals with 
stroke and local clinicians substantiate the need for  better long- term 
options to promote home -based therapeutic practice. Individuals with 
stroke have positive comments when assessing this system: “I could see 
what I had to do to improve the  graphs… after a couple of times I could 
see what worked and what  didn’t… I would use this, I don’t know that I 
would call it fun, but it  makes it interesting to do rather than sitting with 
an inanimate object  like clay or an elastic strap”. Clinicians echo the need 
to engage  individuals in rehabilitation in chronic stages of stroke. While 
time measurements are commonly provided as feedback to participants in 
clinical settings, this metric does not provide the user  with information on 
quality of movement. With the portable devices, we can calculate a 
normalized jerk score, which is dimensionless,  allowing comparisons of 
movements that vary in duration and/or  amplitude  (27,28) In a small 
sample of young and older adults as well as  individuals with stroke we 
examined normalized cumulative jerk. In three separate tasks young adults 
show minimal variability in  performance compared to older adults and 
individuals with stroke. In addition, young adults demonstrate minimal 
variability  across repetitions while individuals with stroke demonstrate a 
greater  change across trials  (29).  Interestingly, when individuals with  
stroke are familiarized with the concept of smoothness, they are able  
to decrease their normalized jerk score. Recording  normalized jerk over 
time and across activities is a promising way to  assess change in 
impairment (30 -33) and has bee n used to demonstrate  change in motor 
performance pre/postinterventions. An extended record of this  assessment 
via a portable measuring device would provide information to the  
individual with stroke and healthcare  providers.

3.0 Study Design  
3.1 Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case -control, cross -sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational). 
Response:  
Aim 1: Develop and validate a novel in- home  rehabilitation system using 
3D printing technologies, smart devices  and machine learning algorithms. 
Part 1.1 Augment Smart Devices for  Rehabilitation Use Through 3D 
Printing:   
The instrumented physical devices offer  customization of on- demand 
functional  objects enhanced by 3D printing augmentation and smart 
devices properly located for sensing movement and 
providing feedback. 3D printed objects can be personalized and adaptive 
to individual  needs. Such design philosophy enables  users with specific 
conditions (e.g., hand size, diminished strength) to  experience fewer 
obstacles and achieve better outcomes. For example,  a 3D printed mug 
design is flexible in handle size, body design, weight, and inside design. 
As shown in Fig. 5a, multiple slots were designed inside the mug to 
arrange for different types of smartphones. The same  methodology is 
applied to augment smartphones into other functional  rehabilitation 
objects, such as bowls and keys. Our team has considerable experiences 
on 3D printing design and fabrication.  
Part 1.2 Deve lop a Smartphone App for Analyzing Sensors Data and 
Providing User Feedback  
Sensor Data Analysis: The kinematic computation engine is  implemented 
in the embedded smartphone, which primarily focuses on sensor data 
analysis and user feedback realization. In sensor data analysis, the 
collected acceleration and angular velocity data from a smartphone are 
used for task events counting (e.g. repetition, time), status detection 
(still/moving), and performance -quality evaluation  (kinematic features 
extraction). The  core part of the computation engine is a  robust algorithm 
to detect and classify the occurrence of task events. To this end, we  
propose an occurrence -detection method  to identify, index and classify the 
sensor  patterns of task events. First, we will  inves tigate a new presentation 
 Page 11 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  method to characterize cross -channel sensor data.  We can form a set of  
signal shape primitives to represent three  channel signals. Then we can 
build the  interval coincidence graph, representing the primitives in the 
motion sensor signal recordings. The thickness of edges shows higher 
coincidence between  the primitives. Primitives with high coincidence are 
clustered. Our team has preliminarily evaluated this approach  on human 
activity monitoring application. In addition, other exist ing machine 
learning methods  will be compared with proposed approach for exercise 
activity recognition.  
User Feedback Interface: The sensor data analysis results  serve as the 
source of user feedback. Our focus groups and pilot data demonstrate user 
feedback is important in rehabilitation it motivates participation and 
encourages  better self -management of the rehabilitation program. User  
feedback in our system has two categories including instant  user feedback 
and post -training feedback. Instant feedb ack is primarily acoustic and/or 
visual. For example, when a  user is pouring water from a cup, the sound of 
water flowing  will vary in different stages of pouring, providing an 
immersive experience for rehabilitation. Feedback such as  applause, 
fireworks s ound, or smiling faces are designed as  rewards for achieving 
preset goals or reaching milestones. Post -training feedback emphasizes 
quantitative  performance measurements at the end of the task training.  
Measurements include time to complete the task,  norma lized jerk score, 
total path length, and number of  repetitions. We have developed an App 
on a smartphone to visualize the statistical results, and users can see their 
rehab performance across multiple trials. We adopted a two -layer 
feedback report design i ncluding a basic report  and detailed report . Users 
are provided with a basic report with the performance trend graphed. If the 
user clicks on a specific trial, then the detailed report of performance 
metrics for that trial will appear.  
Validation: We will validate that data from a smartphone can be modeled 
to accurately identify task events  (repetition and time), movement status 
detection (moving or still), and performance -quality evaluation (kinematic  
measures. In a study (N=15 young adults) we will exami ne the ability of 
the smartphone to accurately identify the above listed components for the 
ADLs listed in Table 1. Each participant will be asked to perform five  
repetitions of each activity in three different testing sessions. We will 
qualify the perform ance of our activity recognition algorithms using 
accuracy and area under the receiver -operator characteristic (ROC) curve 
(AUC).  We will perform an evaluation with random hold out and cross -
validation as well as leave- one-person -out evaluation. Particular ly, we will 
compute sensitivity, specificity, and F -measure values. Then we will 
generate a learning curve that plots classification accuracy as a function of 
training set size and will add data collection time  until the curve plateaus. 
Our previous resear ch work has shown that it is critical to collect enough 
 Page 12 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  sensor  training data in building robust models. Similarly, we will consider 
recruiting new participants until the curve  plateaus. The data collection for 
this study will take place in the Rehabilitation Lab at the University at 
Buffalo.  The controlled environment will allow us to measure motion 
accuracy and thus calculate gold standard numbers  for jerk score, task 
completion, total path length, and other qualitative metrics (i.e., the 
number of repetit ions). 
Aim 2: Examine performance changes in trained ADLs when augmenting 
3D printed objects with smart  technology to provide quantitative feedback 
on performance.  Study Design: A single -subject experimental design with 
a multiple baseline, multiple probe testing setup is well suited to stroke 
rehabilitation research. With inherent variability between motor 
performance of individuals with stroke, there is an advantage to having 
participants serve as their own control. The level of stability of motor  
perform ance will be established during baseline by three different 
assessments (described in “Assessments”  below). Each participant will 
have a varying length of the baseline period to establish that the 
intervention, rather  than time, is the primary reason for a ny observed 
change in performance. For the intervention, all  participants will be asked 
to complete a six -week  in home  training program as described in 
“Training Intervention” below. A follow -up phase, using the same 
assessments as in the  baseline, will be repeated for the purpose of 
assessing  carry -over post intervention. Training Intervention: Training will 
focus on upper  extremity  ADLs and manipulating or transporting the 3D  
printed objects instrumented with  a smartphone , the smartphone will be 
supplied for the length of the training program  (Table 1  in attached grant 
proposal ). Participants will be cued to start their rehabilitation  program by 
setting an alarm on the smartphone. The  smartphone will be placed either 
in (e.g., the bowl) or  on (e.g., the key) the 3D printed device. During the 
initial assessment, rehabilitation professionals will work with   participants 
to determine which tasks can be completed safely. Task modifications will 
be made as necessary to  protect joint integrity an d balance. Similar to 
previous research in stroke, training will be tailored to the  participant’s 
ability. The majority of training ADLs give participants the opportunity to 
perform them in a seated  position. However, some participants may prefer 
to stand as this position is more functional for many of the ADLs. 
Participants will be asked to complete a minimum of 10 repetitions of each 
task they are training once a day/ five  days per week for six weeks. These 
common ADLs include general arm movement (horizontal transport), 
forearm pronation and supination (pouring) and fine motor (key). 
Participants will receive auditory feedback on  count or speed of movement 
in real time. Feedback will be given as described previously. The goal is to 
perform  tasks more smoothly and in less time than the previous session. If 
participants have increased pain with training, they will be asked to stop 
doing the training tasks and contact the PI.  
 Page 13 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  4.0 Local Number of Subjects  
4.1 Indicate the total number of subjects t hat will be enrolled  or records that 
will be reviewed  locally.  
Response:  
We expect about 45 people in this research study.  Fifteen young adults 
(18-30) who have not experienced a stroke  will be recruited. It is possible 
that we would need to recruit more than the anticipate d 15 participants. 
Possibly 10 more. Our previous research has shown that it is critical to 
collect enough sensor  training data in building robust models. Similarly, 
we will consider recruiting new participants until the curve  plateaus.  
Twenty  adults who have experienced a stroke are expected to participate 
in the study.   
4.2 If applicable, indicate how many subjects you expect to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).  
Response:  
It is possible that approximately 25% of individuals with stroke will not qualify 
for the study. We anticipate that advertisements for the study emphasizing study 
criteria will keep the screening failure rate low.                        
4.3 Justify the feasibility of recruiting the proposed number of eligible  subjects 
within the a nticipated  recruitment period. For example, how many potential 
subjects do you have access to? What percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? 
Response:  
The enroll ment at The University at Buffalo is over 29,000. It is likely that we can find 
15 adults between the ages of 18- 30 from the campus community to participate in the 
study  
Erie County has the highest rate of stroke in New York State  (BCBS statistics). It is 
likely that we can recruit 20 participants for the proposed study.

sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response:   
Exclusion Criteria: 1.) Presence of cognitive impairment that would affect ability 
to participate as determined by the Mattis Dementia Scale (minimum of 124/144). 
2) Acute or chronic pain that would interfere with participation in testing or  
training. 3) Severely limited range of motion or contractures of the arms or 
hands. 4) Absence or s everely impaired proprioception of upper limbs. 5) 
Musculoskeletal or circulatory conditions affecting the lower limb (vascular

Exclusion Criteria specifically for Aim 2 - Participants in Aim 2 will need to score 
greater than 42 on the Berg Balance Scale indicating they are not at a higher risk 
for falls.  
 
5.3 Indicate spe cifically whether you will include any  of the following special 
populations  in your study using the checkboxes below.   
 
NOTE:  Members of special populations may not be targeted for enrollment  in 
your study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response:   
☐ Adults unable to consent  
☐ Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
☐ Pregnant women  
☐ Prisoners  
 
5.4 Indicate whether you will include non- English speaking individuals  in your 
study .  Provide justification if you will exclude non -English speaking 
individuals .  
 Page 15 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection 
of subjects, non- English speaking individuals may not  be routinely excluded 
from research  as a matter of conv enience.  
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent  or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessarily require certain populations who may not speak English, the researcher is required to make efforts to recruit 
and include non- English speaking individuals.  However, there are studies 
in which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak 
English.  Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with 
validated instruments not available in other languages, studies with 
numerous questionnaires, and some non- therapeutic studies which offer  no 
direct benefit.  
Response:   
Participants with stroke involved in the intervention will need to be fluent in 
English to efficiently interact with the written/verbal feedback based on the 
Smartphone. Non- English speaking participants will be excluded in this initial 
study of the software guiding the gait rehabilitation program.

so that another investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  
For studies that have multiple or complex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.  
Approach: Our goal is to develop portable technology capable of cueing a home 
training program, collecting data on upper limb motor performance and 
providing user feedback on performance.  
Response: Aim 1:Participants will be asked to come to Kimball Tower three times 
within a two week time span to demonstrate consistency of motor performance . 
An infrared moti on monitor system will be used to track their movement and 
compare kinematics produced by the smartphone with kinematics produced from 
the infrared motion monitor system. Participants may be video taped during data 
collection to further assess mobility.  
Aim 2 
Wolf Motor Function Test  (WMFT): examines functional abilities. It is a 
valid and reliable outcome measure following stroke  
9-Hole Peg Test: a timed test of manual dexterity which involves 
lifting/placing/removing 9 pegs into/out of holes. It is both valid and 
reliable in measuring arm function after stroke. 
Grip assessment : Grip strength is measured with a hand dynamometer.  
Berg Balance Scale : A 14 -item scale designed to measure balance  
 
All clinical assessments are recommended Outcome Measures by the APTA for 
stroke (http://www.neuropt.org/professionalresources/neurology -section -
outcome -measures -recommendations/stroke)  

 Page 19 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  Use of smartphone and 3D printed objects will be  in home  over a 1 1- week span. 
Five of these weeks the participants will perform a limited number of task trials 
without feedback to act as a probe for performance quality. The other 6 weeks, 
participants will be asked to perform their exercise program 5/7 days and the in 
home  exercise program may take up to an hour to complete.  
User Feedback Measures: User Interaction Satisfaction: We will ask participants 
to rate the effectiveness of the information displays in supporting a set of key 
needs. The Questionnaire for User Interac tion Satisfaction (QUIS) is a validated 
usability assessment tool applied in numerous studies of interface design (80- 82, 
information on online assessment found at 
http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html ), including assessment of health 
information interfac es (83 -85). This licensed, online questionnaire will be 
supplemented with context specific questions related to the display. Comments 
and Debriefing: Participant will be interviewed to obtain additional feedback on 
their overall experience during the test.  A semi -structured interview will be used 
in which broad questions are formulated and the conversation progresses. 
Findings from these components will be used to make iterative improvements as 
necessary to the system to support future research and implementation  
Caregiver Feedback Measures : Caregivers of participants will be given the 
opportunity to provide their feedback on mRehab and the participant’s use of the 
mRehab system. A  semi -structured interview will be used  to gain feedback on 
how much assistance caregiver’s  provided for  1) setting up mRehab , 2) providing 
motivation to use mRehab, 3) assisting the participant in using mRehab  and 4) 
suggestions for improving mRehab. 
9.2 Describe what data will be collected.   
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data col lection points or long- term follow up, 
consider the addition of  a schedule or table in your response.

Aim 1:  
The controlled environment will allow us to measure motion accuracy and 
thus calculate gold standard numbers for jerk score, task completion, total 
path length, and other qualitative metrics (i.e., the number of repetitions). 
Video assessments will allow us to review motor behavior and further 
assess mobility.  
Aim 2:  
Clinical Assessments used to determine mobility of the more affecte d limb:  
Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT): examines functional abilities. It is a 
valid and reliable outcome measure following stroke  
9-Hole Peg Test: a timed test of manual dexterity which involves 
lifting/placing/removing 9 pegs into/out of holes. It is both valid and 
reliable in measuring arm function after stroke. 
 Page 20 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  Grip assessment: Grip strength is measured with a hand dynamometer.  
Modified Ashworth Scale: Assesses spasticity  
Probes: Perform the ADLs from the training program without feedback.  
 
Performanc e will be assessed by examining data collected from the 
smartphone:  
Participants will be asked to complete only two repetitions of the training 
tasks without receiving feedback on three separate days during each 
baseline week and each follow -up week to det ermine baseline 
performance and in follow -up retention of task learning. 
Performance Measures: We will examine the following measurements of 
movement and task performance for comparison between the baseline and 
training intervention periods:  
Task completion time: Measured from the start to the end of the task. 
Normalized jerk score (NJS)/smoothness: Using the acceleration readings 
from the inertial measurement unit embedded in the smartphone, the 
normalized jerk score can be computed.  
Usability: Pa rticipants will evaluate the usability of the system based on ease of 
use and interpretability of the feedback. Usage metrics will be recorded to track 
how often and for how long they use the system at home. Also, a post -survey study 
will be used to collec t quantitative participant feedback for UI improvement.  
User Feedback Measures: User Interaction Satisfaction: We will ask participants 
to rate the effectiveness of the information displays in supporting a set of key 
needs. The Questionnaire for User Inte raction Satisfaction (QUIS) is a validated 
usability assessment tool applied in numerous studies of interface design, 
including assessment of health information interface. This licensed, online 
questionnaire will be supplemented with context specific quest ions related to the 
display. Semistructured interviews will also be used. 
Caregiver Feedback Measures: Caregivers will be given the option of 
participating in a  semi -structured interview to assess their feedback on how much 
assistance the caregiver provid ed for 1) setting up mRehab, 2) providing 
motivation to use mRehab, 3) assisting the participant in using mRehab and 4) 
suggestions for improving mRehab.

personnel. Research personnel do not have access to medical or other 
records for the participant. 
 
 
16.0 Data Management  and Analysis 
16.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.  
Response:  
Aim 1: 
Validation of smartphone with motion monitor system. We will look at 
consistency of motor performance across time. 
Aim 2: 
A strength of the  proposed single -subject study design is the internal 
validity gained by using repeated measurement from the  same individuals 
and the ability to replicate the effect of the intervention across participants. 
As is typical with  single -subject designs, visual inspection will be used as 
the first stage of analysis to determine the general  stability of performance 
during the baseline phase and the trend of performance change during the 
training  intervention. Statistical analysis to corroborate the visual analysis 
will include time -series analysis to infer  changes in trend and level across 
phases.80 The serial dependency in the data for each participant will be  
accounted for using t he autoregressive integrated moving average 
(ARIMA).80 If a significant positive trend in overall performance during 
the training intervention is observed, the hypothesis will be accepted. To 
validate the  effect of the training program on the performance m easures, 
the effect on the standardized assessments will be tested. A repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess whether 
there is a difference within each participant for performance on the Wolf 
 Page 27 of 43  IRB Version: JAN2016  Motor and 9 hole peg test assessme nts at the start of  baseline, end of 
baseline, start of follow -up, and end of follow -up. Post hoc pairwise 
comparisons will be used to assess the differences ΔB = Bend -Bstart, 
ΔTraining ( ΔT) = Fstart -Bend, and Δ F = Fend -Fstart. It is hypothesized 
that Δ B and Δ F will be 0, indicating stable performance during the 
baseline and follow -up, and that Δ T > 0. If these results  are consistent 
with the findings from the functional tests, then the results will be 
considered valid. 
16.2 If applicable, provide a power analys is.   
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records 
reviews, survey studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit 
whether the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study 
objectives  and justify a conclusion.  
Response:  
Aim 1: In a study (N=15 young adults) we will examine the ability of the 
smartphone to accurately identify the above listed components for the 
ADLs listed in Table 1. Each participant will be asked to perform five  
repetitions of each activity in three different testing sessions. We will 
qualify the performance of our activity recognition algorithms using 
accuracy and area under the receiver -operator characteristic (ROC) curve 
(AUC).  We will perform an evaluation with random hold out and cross -
validation as well as leave- one-person -out evaluation. Particularly, we will 
compute sensitivity, specificity, and F -measure values. Then we will 
generate a learning curve that plots classification accuracy as a function of 
training set size and will add data collection time  until the curve plateaus. 
Our previous research work has shown that it is critical to collect enough 
sensor  training data in building robust models. Similarly, we will consider 
recruiting new participants unt il the curve  plateaus.  
 
Aim 2: Sample size estimation was based on the repeated measures  
ANOVA test of within subjects change in standardized assessment scores 
from baseline to follow -up. With α  = 0.05, power = 0.8, 4 measurements, 
and a desired effect siz e (f) = 0.25 to detect, a sample size of 15  
participants  is needed. This effect size is consistent with studies on 
functional activity performance and recovery following stroke.68 A total 
of 20 participants will be recruiting to account for a 25% attrition rate.  
 
16.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected 
data.

It is possible for the participant to experience:  
• fatigue   
• loss of balance, possibly resulting in a fall  
• a muscle strain or orthopedic injury 
• breach of confidentiality with your personnel information 
  
 
20.2 Describe procedure s performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety. 
Risks to participants are minimized by : 
 screening participants using the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 providing the participants with rests as they wish between 
assessments 
 tailoring the Upper Limb Training program to the abilities of each 
participant  
 reminding participants  that they can terminate their participation at 
any time, without penalty. 
 Coding data used in ana lyses  
 
20.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects that 
are currently unforeseeable.  
Response:  
The Upper Limb Training is a new approach to rehabilitation at home.  It is 
possible that participants may have difficulties with th is home exercise program. 
To reduce risks, participants who score at or below  42 on the Berg Balance Scale 
must complete all home exercises in a seated position . The Training program will 
also be tailored to each participant’s abilities.  
20.4 If applicable, indicate which research procedures may have risks to an embryo or fetus should the subject be or become pregnant. 
Response:

taking part in the research.  Include the probability, magnitude, and 
duration of the potential benefits.  Indicate if there is no direct benefit.    
NOTE:  Compensation cannot be stated as a benefit.  
Response: It is unlikely that participants in Aim 1 will experience a direct 
physical benefit for their participation in the study. It is possible that participants 
that complete aim 2 may experience some level of benefit in their ability to move 
their arm/hand. The results of the study may influence rehabi litation approaches 
in the future. All p articipants may derive satisfaction from the potential to help 
others. The risk to benefit ratio is excellent.  
 
22.0 Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
☐ N/A:   The research procedures for this study do not present risk of 
research related injury (e.g. survey studies, records review studies).  This section does not apply.   
22.1 If the research procedures carry a risk of research related injury,  
describe the availabl e compensation to subjects in the event that such injury 
should occur.   
Response:  
Safety precautions will be taken to limit the risks to participants in the 
study to “minimal risk”. The Upper Limb Training may involve activities 
in standing, making it pos sible that the participant may fall. By assessing 
individuals for fall risk, using a clinical assessment, prior to enrollment 
into aim 2 of the study, we will lower the risk to the participant.  
If a participant feels like they have b een injured because of  taking part in 
this study.  They should inform the PI and they will be encourage to 
consult with their physician. T reatment options  will be explained by your 
physician. Generally, this care will be billed to you, your insurance or 
other third party. T he U niversity at Buffalo  has no program to pay for 
medical care for research -related injury.

Consent (HRP -091).” If not  or if there are any e xceptions , describe whether 
and how consent of the subject will be  obtained including whether or not it 
will be documented in writing.   
NOTE:  If your research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects 
and involves no procedures for which wri tten documentation of consent is normally 
required outside of the research context, the IRB will generally waive the 
requirement to obtain written documentation of consent.  This is sometimes 
referred to as ‘verbal consent.’  Review “CHECKLIST: Waiver of W ritten 
Documentation of Consent (HRP -411)” to ensure that you have provided sufficient 
information.  
If you will document consent in writing, attach a consent document  with your 
submission .  You may use “TEMPLATE CONSENT DOCUMENT (HRP-
502)”.  If you will obtain consent, but not document consent in writing, attach the 
script of the information to be provided orally or in writing (i.e. consent script or 
Information Sheet).

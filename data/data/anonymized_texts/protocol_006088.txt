1. Modification
Summary of the Modification Request
serum ropivacaine levels will not be monitored.
Spanish consent form has been updated to remove serum level monitoring
Justification for the Modification
After consulting with Sinai Anesthesia Pain Service and the literature* it is clear that this was not needed. It is
 not standard to monitor these levels with infusion and previous studies were done to demonstrate that it wasn't
 necessary previously. Further, several studies have been done without monitoring the levels. The amount of
 Ropivacaine we are infusing is too low to reach systemic toxicity levels.

Lay Summary
Head and neck oncologic surgery often requires the use of free tissue transfer, or microvascular reconstruction, to
 reconstruct defects created by tumor resections. Although there are several techniques for the reconstruction of
 defects, resection of large tumors leave defects that require the transfer of vascularized tissue from one part of the
 body to repair the defect. For example, the removal of a segment of diseased mandible requires free tissue transfer
 containing the component parts - skin, muscle, and bone - to reconstruct the deficit created by the resection of the
 tumor. Over the years, microvascular surgeons have focused their attention on maximizing the success of these
 technically difficult surgeries. However, now, with free flap reconstruction rates in excess of 95%, surgeons are
 afforded the opportunity to turn their focus toward the morbidities associated with these surgeries. While much has
 been published about donor site wound healing, pain control in the post-operative period has largely been neglected
 in the head and neck reconstruction literature. Systemic analgesia with opioids is standard of care, which has
 been shown to lead to increased confusion, significantly increased length of stay and increased risk of pulmonary
 complications (Oderda et al., Pizzi et al.). In addition, it has been shown that early mobilization and optimal wound
 care can decrease donor site morbidity.
In this study we aim to better control donor site pain utilizing local, targeted analgesia to relieve pain at the donor
 site for osseocutaneous free-flaps. To reduce confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective
 randomized placebo controlled trial wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be
 randomized to receive continuous infusion of ropivacaine or normal saline (placebo) via intraosseous catheter, which
 will be placed intraoperatively at the time of donor site closure. Patients' pain will be monitored for the first 48hrs after
 surgery. Donor site and global pain at rest will be evaluated every 8 hours for the first two postoperative days using
 a standard pain assessment via a numeric pain scale (0-10). Median daily opiate use via PCA will also be tracked.
 Donor site-specific range of motion and strength will be assessed with a formal physical therapy evaluation on post-
operative day 2 or soonest non-holiday weekday. Information on patient satisfaction, time to ambulation, and length
 of stay will also be collected. Subgroup analysis will be performed.

4. Summary - Background
Objectives
Research Question: Can continuous infusion of ropivacaine improve donor site pain control at rest compared to
 placebo in the post-operative period?
Hypothesis 1: Continuous infusion of ropivacaine will improve donor site pain control at rest compared to placebo in
 the post-operative period
Hypothesis 2: Continuous infusion of ropivacaine will improve patients ability to achieve PT milestones compared to
 placebo in the post-operative period
Objectives:
1) Determine whether there is a significant difference in donor site pain at rest with continuous infusion of ropivacaine
 vs saline at the donor site. Pain will be assessed globally and specifically at the donor site.
- Pain will be assessed every 8 hours for the first 48 hours using a numeric pain scale (0-10) at rest.
- Time of extubation will be considered time zero. Then every 8 hours after that time, the patient will have their pain
 assessed. A total of 6 pain assessments will be performed in the 48 hour period.
- A numeric pain scale will be used to rate patient level of pain. 
- The patients subjective pain will be tested and recorded at rest, with no intervention. Patients will be asked their
 global, or overall, pain level. They will then be asked their pain at the donor site specifically. 
2) Patients will be given standard of care opiates via PCA.
Patients will be provided a dilaudid PCA, set for low dose, opioid naïve patients. 
- The amount of opiates required by patients with continuous infusion ropivacaine vs saline placebo will be recorded
3) Determine whether there is an association between continuous infusion of ropivacaine vs saline at the donor site
 and achievement of PT milestones
- At post-operative day 2 (or soonest non-holiday weekday if surgery is performed on Friday), patients will receive a
 physical therapy evaluation where patients will be compared on basic physical therapy milestones.
- Distance able to ambulate, range of motion, strength - standard measures already obtained during standard
 physical therapy consultation. Distance able to ambulate will be measured in feet. Range of motion is a descriptive
 variable (within normal limits, within functional limits, etc.). Strength is measured on the standard neurological
 strength scale out of 5. 
- Total length of stay will be compared between groups to look for a correlation between continuous infusion
 ropivacaine pain control and decreased length of stay
4) Determine whether there is an association between continuous infusion ropivacaine pain control vs saline placebo
 and patient satisfaction
- A standardized pain satisfaction survey (see attachments) will be distributed to patients prior to discharge rating
 their overall satisfaction with postoperative recovery from osseocutaneous free flap
Purpose:
The purpose of the study is to determine whether infusion of ropivacaine vs saline at the donor site will significantly
 decrease donor site pain and whether there is any correlation between pain control, achievement of PT milestones,
 length of stay, and patient satisfaction.
Background
Free flap reconstruction success rates have reached >95%, allowing surgeons to focus on minimizing morbidity
 associated with the surgery. There has been a great deal of literature focused on donor site wound healing including
 the use of negative pressure wound therapy, skin grafts, and local rotational and advancement flaps. However, there
 is scant high quality evidence about donor site morbidity in ossecutaneous free flaps. In particular the literature is
 lacking on donor site pain management outside of standard intravenous analgesia (PCA pump, IV push, etc.)
Donor site pain is a known complication of osseocutaneous free flaps (Klein et al, Harris et al). One study found that
 out of forty procedures with the highest pain scores (median numeric rating scale, 6–7) twenty-two were orthopedic/
trauma procedures on the extremities (Gerbershagen et al), which are the most frequent donor sites for head and
 neck free flap reconstruction. A specific example from orthopedics is the use of iliac crest bone grafts for spine
 arthrodesis procedures. These bone grafts are associated with immediate donor site postoperative pain and difficulty
 ambulating, persistent donor site pain at >3 months in 26% of patients, and functional impairment (Silber et al. 2003).
 Indeed, donor site pain may restrict mobility, preventing adequate rehabilitation and early ambulation resulting in co-
morbidities such as VTE, pneumonia and pressure ulcers (Oderda et al., Pizzi et al.). In addition, early rehabilitation
 may also prevent gait disturbance long term or site-specific functional deficits and allow for participation in physical
 therapy protocols.
The mainstay of postoperative pain management in patients receiving osseocutaneous free flaps is opioids. Opioids
 carry a variety of risks including decreased mobility leading to complications such as DVT and decreased respiratory
 drive leading to pneumonia. As such, alternative pain control methods are preferred for early ambulation and
 recovery. There is evidence in other surgical fields that the use of donor site catheter-based analgesia may alleviate
 pain at the donor site.  There have been several small trials in the orthopedic and craniofacial surgery literature
 that have evaluated the use of long acting anesthetic agents for pain control in iliac crest bone grafts (Singh 2005,
 Singh 2007, Brull 1992, Sbitany 2010, Meara 2011, Samartzis 2016). Although results vary with respect to patient
 reported pain score, patient satisfaction, and hospital stay, three out of four studies reported decreased opioid usage
 when receiving local anesthesia versus no pain control (Singh 2005, Singh 2007, Meara 2011, Brull 1992, Sbitany
 2010, Samartzis 2016). Further, prior studies have postulated that the use of local anesthesia may prevent the
 development of chronic post-operative pain by blocking nociceptive stimuli and suppressing the hyperexcitable state
 in the central nervous system (Tverskoy 1990). As a result, the benefits of donor site analgesia in the post-operative
 period may extend beyond the length of their use.
         
The research design utilized in this study is not unique, and in fact has been utilized in the fields of orthopedic and
 plastic surgery to study the use of donor site analgesia (Blumenthal et al., Heller et al.). We seek to replicate the
 double-blind placebo controlled trial design to evaluate the use of donor site catheter-based analgesia to minimize
 the morbidity associated with head and neck reconstructive surgery donor site pain.

9. Subjects - Participation
Duration of an Individual Subjects Participation in the Study
Participation in this research study is expected to last the duration of the patient's initial post-surgical hospital stay, or
 a total of approximately 1 week from the time of surgery. The infusion catheter will be removed on post-operative day
 2 (48 hours after surgery). A physical therapy evaluation will happen on post-operative day 2 (or soonest available
 non-holiday weekday, if surgery is performed on Friday), as is standard of care. Additionally, patients will be asked to
 complete a survey regarding their satisfaction with pain control prior to discharge. 
Duration Anticipated to Enroll All Study Subjects
24 months
Estimated Date for the Investigators
 to Complete This StudyWithin two years
Procedures for Subjects to Request Withdrawal
Enrolled subjects may decide to withdraw from the study at any time in the post-operative period, in which case the
 infusion catheter will be removed, and standard of care pain assessment and control methods continued.
The rate of patient withdrawal will be continuously reviewed during the study to analyze for any adjustment that might
 be required to our sample size and to perform the appropriate statistical analyses of the data collected.
Procedures for Investigator to Withdraw Subjects
Previously enrolled subjects who do not meet inclusion criteria due to an an intraoperative decision will be removed
 from the study. For instance, if an initially planned free tissue transfer reconstruction is forgone for a local-regional
 flap reconstruction the subject will no longer meet criteria for inclusion into the study. Once patients are withdrawn, a
 record of the signed consent form along with the reason for withdrawal will be stored and filed.
Enrolled patients who fail to have a successful placement of donor site catheter will be withdrawn from the study.

How Research Will Be Introduced to Participants
All patients presenting to the Tisch Cancer Institute or the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery
 will be screened for satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion criteria by the attending head and neck surgeon during
 routine history and physical examination during their regularly scheduled preoperative visit. Once identified, the
 patient will be approached by the attending physician to discuss the research and obtain consent. If amenable,
 the patient may be directed to further discuss the study and answer any additional questions or concerns with a
 member of the research team. If the patient wishes to have more time to think about his/her participation in the study,
 he/she will be given the consent form and asked to fill it out at a time of his/her own convenience. Should he/she
 choose to participate, the patient will be instructed to bring the completed consent form with him/her on the date of
 his/her surgery. Should a patient elect to have more time to decide on his/her participation (as outlined above), a
 member of the research team will call them within a week of the date of the scheduled surgery to remind them to
 bring the consent form, should he/she wish to participate, and answer any additional questions at that time. No new
 information or discussion of the study will be provided on the date of surgery. If a patient is identified for participation
 in the study during an inpatient hospitalization, the patient will be approached about the study by the attending
 physician or member of the research team at least two days prior to the date of the surgery. 
How Participants Will Be Screened
Participants will be identified based on the history and physical exam performed by the Otolaryngology attending or

10. Procedures - Narrative
Description of the Study Design
To reduce confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective randomized placebo controlled trial
 wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be randomized to receive continuous infusion of
 ropivacaine or normal saline (placebo) via intraosseous catheter, which will be placed intraoperatively at the time of
 donor site closure. 
Description of Procedures Being Performed
Intraoperatively, following procurement of the fibula or scapula bone graft and at the time of surgical wound closure,
 all patients will receive the placement of a continuous infusion catheter into the donor site wound bed. The infusion
 reservoir will be connected to a catheter-based On-Q pump, and the catheter will be placed in the donor site. A
 stab incision separate from the surgical wound will be used to bring the catheter through the skin. Patients will
 be randomized to receive 6 ml/hr of 0.2% Ropivacaine or 6 ml/hr of normal saline via the infusion reservoir. The
 catheter will be left in place with continuous infusion for first 48 hours of the post-operative period. The catheters will
 be removed by the housestaff on POD2. There is minimal risk to removing the OnQ catheter. Any opening in the skin
 will be covered with gauze to allow primary healing. Solutions of saline and ropivacaine will be prepared and made
 available for infusion by the Mount Sinai Pharmacy. Solutions will be blinded, and identical in appearance. Patients
 will be assigned to ropivacaine or saline intervention by the research pharmacy through coded envelopes. Patients,
 physicians, nurses, and research personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment. Every 8 hours for the first 48
 hours, patients will be asked to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for reporting their pain. The VAS will be
 performed six times over the course of the 48hrs. These will be performed during regular flap check monitoring, to
 ensure patients are not disrupted additional times throughout the day for this study.
Prior to discharge from the hospital, the study subjects will be asked to complete a brief survey (APS-POQ-R Pain
 Survey) regarding their experience, with regard to pain management. 
Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
The source records used will come from the electronic medical records of patients at the Mount Sinai Hospital.
 The electronic medical record system used at MSH is Epic. The information collected will be age, race, sex, BMI,
 comorbid conditions, tumor grade/stage, operative time, length of stay, ASA status, intra-operative analgesic use,
 post-operative opioid use, Ropivacaine levels, time to PCA removal, pain scores, time and distance of ambulation,
 strength, and the standard physical therapy evaluation.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
1) Donor site specific and global pain scores using the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be collected every 8 hours
 for the first 2 postoperative days. The VAS pain scale will be measured and recorded by a member of the research
 team.
2) Opioid usage will be collected by interrogating the PCA pumps during the first 2 postoperative days. 
3) Physical therapy milestones will be assessed on the second postoperative day (or soonest non-holiday weekday, if
 surgery is performed on Friday) by formal physical therapy evaluation.
4) A standardized pain satisfaction survey will be distributed and recorded prior to discharge

14. Consent - Obtaining Consent
Consent Process Adult Consent
Where and When Consent Will Be Obtained
Patients presenting to the Tisch Cancer Institute or the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery for a
 pre-operative evaluation whom meet inclusion criteria will be recruited at the time of their visit. During the risk and
 benefits discussion of surgical intervention led by one of our attending surgeons, a brief scripted description of the
 use of continuous local analgesia will be included and the patient given the option to consent for its use either during
 the same visit, at a follow up appointment, or the day of surgery. If a patient is missed during their clinic visit and is
 scheduled for a procedure that meets inclusion criteria he/she will be contacted prior to the surgery date to be made
 aware of the study. He/she will then be consented at the date of surgery prior to entering the operating room. The
 operating schedules of the entire Head and Neck Division are reviewed on a weekly basis. Patients pre-admitted
 prior to their surgery, who meet inclusion criteria, will be recruited at a private inpatient hospital setting at least one
 day prior to their surgery.
Waiting Period for Obtaining Consent
There will be no minimum waiting period between informing the subject and obtaining consent. However, all patients
 will be informed of the study at an appointment prior to the day of surgery or at least 2 days prior to the date of
 surgery should the patient be identified during an inpatient hospitalization.

 personal identifiable information will be removed from the database and labeled with a unique code. Consent forms
 for the study will be kept in a secure locked cabinet at our department. 
Data Analysis Plan Including Any Statistical Procedures
Intra- and inter-patient pain scores are expected to be highly variable and non-normally distributed, thus median
 pain score after 6 measurements will be reported for each enrolled subject. Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum
 test will be used to compare treatment groups. A sample size of 15 in each group will have 80% power to detect a
 probability of 0.800 that a pain score in the local anesthesia group is less than a pain score in the placebo group
 using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level. We will aim to recruit 20
 patients per treatment group to account for patient drop out.
Information on patient demographics, patient satisfaction, time to ambulation, and length of stay will also be collected.
 Subgroup analysis will be performed.

Specific Items That Will Be Monitored for Safety
Patient reported adverse events related to toxicity of Ropivacaine.  
Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of Ropivacaine toxicity including but not limited to metallic taste,
 tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. 
Frequency of Data Review
The DSMC will meet bi-annually and/or more often if required to review data safety.
Rules for Alteration of Study Design
In the event of toxicity, catheter system will be
immediately removed and the acute pain service will escalate care as indicated.
Selection Procedures to Minimize Toxicity
Patients with a history of allergic reaction to Ropivacaine or other local amide anesthetics will not be enrolled in the
 study., Additionally, patients with previous pain disorders or drug abuse requiring chronic narcotic use will not be
 enrolled in the study. 
Grading System to Evaluate Adverse Events
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
 (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. 
Procedures to Assure Data Accuracy
The selected principle monitor has established relationships with the subjects that will enable him to identify risks
 to the subjects. The PI or a delegate will inquire about adverse events at each follow-up visit. The PI will maintain
 records of all adverse events and will use the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for
 documentation. Additionally, a data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) will be established and consist of the
 principal investigator and co-investigators. Adverse events will be reviewed at least bi- annually, or, more often if
 needed. To help capture data for adverse events in the discharged postoperative period, the participant will be given
 the contact information of the research coordinator at the time of consent in order to report any adverse events. The
 research coordinator will document the unexpected adverse events, or expected adverse events with higher than
 expected severity, and their resolution on a detailed log for the regulatory binder, on PDMS, and to the PI. Serious
 adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRB.
Suspension Reported to
Adverse events occurring during the study will be reported to the Mount Sinai Program for the Protection of Human
 Subjects (PPHS). Any suspension of the study will be reported to the PI and PPHS. 
Anticipated Circumstances of Subject Withdrawal
Previously enrolled subjects who do not meet inclusion criteria due to an an intraoperative decision will be removed
 from the study. For instance, if an initially planned free tissue transfer reconstruction is forgone for a local-regional
 flap reconstruction the subject will no longer meet criteria for inclusion into the study. Once patients are withdrawn, a
 record of the signed consent form along with the reason for withdrawal will be stored and filed. Enrolled patients who
 fail to have a successful placement of donor site catheter will be withdrawn from the study.
Primary or Secondary Safety Endpoints
Median postoperative pain score on the visual analogue scale (VAS), recorded over the 48 hours. Secondary Study
 Endpoints: total opiate consumption, achievement of physical therapy milestones, patient satisfaction, and side
 effects of opiates (nausea/vomiting, pruritus) Primary Safety Endpoints: Infection at the site of local infusion catheter,
 donor site hematoma, seroma, wound dehiscence, compartment syndrome, and ropivacaine toxicity or allergy

Clinical Phase: Phase II, open -label trial  
Study Duration: Total duration of the trial will be about 18 months.  
Objectives:  
Primary: To estimate Progression Free Survival (PFS rates) at 6 months by RECIST1.1 in 
patients with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have achieved disease 
control in response to first line chemotherapy when subsequently maintained on a combination regimen of cabiralizumab (FPA008)+ nivolumab + gemcitabine.  
 
Secondary:  
1. To evaluate safety and tolerability of the combination of nivolumab + cabiralizumab 
(FPA008) + gemcitabine  
 
2. To evaluate  PFS over the course of the study, overall survival (OS) , and disease control 
rates at 6 months in patients administered the combination of nivolumab +cabiralizumab 
(FPA008) + gemcitabine. Disease control is defined as  being with stable disease (SD) or partial 
response (PR) for a period of at least 2 months .  
Exploratory:  
1. To evaluate difference s in disease progression outcomes according to iRECIST vs. RECIST 1.1 
criteria (Appendix 5).

tumor assessment will be evaluated by RECIST 1.1 at 6 months.  Without maintenance therapy, 96%8 of 
patients are expected to progress by 6 months.  A Simon’s two stage optimal design is applied. Accrual 
will be held for interim efficacy analysis when the first 8 patients are accrued.  This design will have an 
80% power to reject the null hypothesis that PFS6 is ≤4% and conclude that the true PFS rate at 6 
months is > 4%, if the observed PFS rate is 22%, at 10% significance level. Secondary safety and 
efficacy analyses will also be performed. Please refer to section 8 for more details.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
1.1 Overview  
Pancreatic cancer continues to be a very lethal disease. It is estimated that in 2018, 55,440 
Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), and 44,330 will die from the disease. This makes pancreatic cancer the third leading cause of death from cancer in the US.
1 
 
Furthermore it is projected that by 2030, PDA will be the second leading cause of death from cancer in the US. Worldwide, PDA is the twelfth most common cancer, accounting for an estimate of > 300,000 deaths a year. 
2 
 
Detection of pancreatic cancer has been notoriously very late in the disease and therefore the 5-year survival rate is only 8%. Right now, the only potential cure for pancreatic cancer 
is surgical resection (if the disease is caught early). However only about 20% of PDA patients are eligible for potentially curable resection and unfortunately most (> 80%) have reoccurrence of their cancer within 2 years of resection, and those recurrences are almost universally fatal. 
3,4 
 
But there is some hope. Recently there are regimens that actually improve survival for patients with advanced stage IV PDA. Conroy and colleagues developed the Folfirinox regimen, which in a large randomized trial improved survival over gemcitabine as a single agent.
5 Von Hoff and colleagues developed the nanoparticle albumin (nab) associated 
paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen which improved survival over single agent gemcitabine again in a single randomized trial.
6 Even more recently Jameson and colleagues have 
presented a combined regimen of nab- paclitaxel + gemcitabine + cisplatin in a small 24 
patient phase Ib/II trial that gave a response rate of 71% with 2 patients having complete 
response and a median survival of 16+  months.7 
 
With the greater chance of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer achieving disease control, there is a new challenge – maintaining that control. The challenges of maintaining 
control include:  
 
• Cumulative toxicities of the treatment regimens prevent continuance of the chemotherapeutic regimen.  
 
• Patients achieve a maximum amount of tumor shrinkage but that shrinkage often stops after a partial response (PR) is reached, so the patient may no longer benefit from that regimen or resistance may  develop.  
 
• Patients get tired of the treatment regimen and want a rest

 1.2 Rationale For Maintenance Regimens  
In patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer, 96% of those patients who achieve disease 
control with first line cytotoxic chemotherapy progress within 6 months. Chemotherapy can generally not be continued because of cumulative toxicities. Many clinicians however choose to continue treatment with gemcitabine or other agents such as capecitabine after disease control and withdraw other cytotoxic agents due to cumulative toxicities. The effect of this on progression free survival is unknown.  
 
The first randomized trial to address the role of maintenance therapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer was completed by Reni and colleagues (Reni M. et al. 2013).
8 In this phase II 
randomized maintenance trial, 56 patients who previously had positive optimal response to chemotherapeutic regimens (no progression after 6 months of chemotherapy) were 
randomized to either observation or treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib. The results were impressive: 96% of patients had progression after 6 months in the observation arm, while only 78% progressed on  sunitinib (p = 0.01), 2- year survival was 
23% in sunitinib arm versus 7% in the observation arm (p=0.18). This important trial demonstrates that a maintenance approach is promising and should be further explored in patients with advanced pancreatic  cancer . 
 
Tumor -associated macrophages, TAMs, play an important role not only in tumor progression 
and metastasis but also in resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (De Palma and Lewis, 2013; Qian and Pollard, 2010). 
9, 10 Pre-clinical models have elucidated the critical 
role of TAMs in cancer development, progression and metastasis (Denardo et al., 2011; Mantovani et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2013)
11,12, 13, 14 Signaling through the 
cellular receptor for CSF -1, CSF -1R, promotes the differentiation of myeloid progenitors into 
populations of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and osteoclasts. Several therapeutic applications to impair recruitment or to readjust their behavior are currently being evaluated (Cannarile et al., 2017; Mantovani et al., 2017). 
12, 15 
 
Pancreatic cancer is known to be associated with TAM infiltration and higher TAM infiltration is in turn associated with worse prognosis, suggesting that suppressed immune response contributes to tumor progression in this patient population. The preclinical studies detailed below, evaluated the impact of CSF -1R inhibition in primary KPC tumor cells.  
 
The addition of cabiralizumab as part of a maintenance regimen is based on our preclinical data that the stem cell population within pancreatic cancer that are preferentially tumorigenic and highly drug resistant to cytotoxic therapy, are in fact, directly dependent on CSF -1R, 
and that its inhibition in these cells leads to significant impairment of pancreatic cancer growth. An added benefit of this regimen is that cabiralizumab also targets CSF -1R-
dependent  TAMs.  
 
In this proposed trial we wish to evaluate the combination regimen of gemcitabine, CSF - 1R 
and PD -1 blockade on progression free survival in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer 
who achieved disease control following first line chemotherapy.

 1.3 Preclinical Support  
Cancer stem cells are capable of unlimited self -renewal, and generate the rest of the cancer 
cells with more limited proliferative capacity. Importantly, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDA) closely follows a stem cell paradigm, displaying a clear hierarchical organization, with stem cells preferentially driving tumor progression, metastasis and chemoresistance. Further, pharmacologic or genetic elimination of this population results in increased survival in mouse models, demonstrating the functional relevance of this population for pancreatic 
cancer growth in vivo . These data collectively indicate that stem cells within pancreatic 
cancer are critical  drivers of disease progression and drug resistance, and suggest that 
development of effective strategies to eradicate these cells could lead to more durable 
treatment responses. Thus, we have focused on defining the dependencies of pancreatic cancer stem cells in order to identify their vulnerabilities and identify new targets for  therapy.  
 
Mapping stem cell dependencies in pancreatic adenocarcinoma  
 
We have previously reported the development of a novel GFP-reporter “knock -in” mouse that visually identifies cells 
expressing the stem cell gene Msi2 (Msi2- GFP). Using this 
reporter strain, we demonstrated that Msi2 reporter+ cells possess cancer stem cell features and are responsible for tumor initiation, propagation and drug resistance in a genetically -engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer 
(Kras
LSL- G12D/+ ; p53f/f; Ptf1aCre/+, referred to here as “KPC”) 
(Figs. 1 and 2). This work is consistent with that of others. This indicated that the Msi2 reporter KPC mice would be a particularly unique and powerful tool for tracking and understanding of cells that preferentially harbor capacity for drug resistance and tumor re- growth.  
 
 
To define the epigenetic and molecular landscape that functionally maintains the aggressive and drug -resistant stem cell sta te, pancreatic cancer stem cells were isolated and analyzed 
from primary Msi reporter KPC tumors. This showed that KPC stem cells are distinct from non-stem cells at the global transcriptional level, and driven by the differential expression of 
over 1000 g enes.

capacity for tumor initiation. Bottom left panel:

 The landscape that defined the stem cell state was markedly biased towards developmental 
and stem cell signals, and preferentially dormant. Consistent with their ability to survive chemotherapy and drive tumor regrowth, the stem cells  also shared signatures with multiple 
relapsed cancers including cancer of the breast, liver, and colon. In context of immune evasion signature, it is important to note that the RNA Seq analysis also identified PDL1 expression in both stem and non- stem cel ls. The fact that the non - stem cell fraction had 10 
fold greater expression may suggest that PDL1 blockade could be particularly useful in targeting the bulk of the tumor. In the event that stem cells are  less responsive to PD1/PDL1 blockade, the work described below focused on identifying stem cell dependencies that could be exploited to reduce disease progression (Unpublished data,  confidential).  
 
To identify programs that are functionally critical for conferring the stem cell state, we complemented the  transcriptomic approaches above with a genome- wide CRISPR screen. 
Specifically, we established independent primary cell lines from Msi2- KPC mice, and 
performed CRISPR screens across these replicates with mulitplexed assays to identify genes essential for pancreatic cancer stem cell growth. This unbiased approach allowed us 
to effectively screen the entire mouse genome using the GeCKO V2 CRISPR library, which contains  6 sgRNA  for each gene  in the mouse  genome,  4 sgRNA  targeting  each of 
~4000 miRNA, and >2000 control non- targeting sgRNA for a total of 130,000 guides.  
 
An in depth integrated bioinformatics analysis on datasets from the RNA -Seq and CRISPR -
based functional genomics screens unexpectedly identified a network of cytokines and other immunoregula tory signals as controlling cancer stem cells. This included the cytokine 
receptor CSF -1R (ligands include CSF -1 and IL- 34), which has not previously been 
implicated as a direct regulator of cancer cell or cancer stem cell growth (Unpublished data, confide ntial. Given these findings, we tested whether blocking CSF -1R signaling would 
inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro . Tumor cells with shRNA against CSF -1R or IL- 34 led to a 
significant reduction in anchorage independent growth and sphere formation in vitro. Further, inhibition of CSF -1R in the tumor cells led to a marked slowing of tumor growth in 
in vivo flank transplants. These data suggest a direct impact of CSF -1R signaling on cancer 
stem cell maintenance specifically, and tumor growth more generally (Unpublished data,  
confidential).  
 
Finally, since signaling through CSF -1R also promotes the differentiation of myeloid 
progenitors, including tumor -associated macrophages (which play a critical role in cancer 
development, progression and metastasis), several therapeutic applications to impair recruitment or readjust their behavior are currently being evaluated. Work from other members of our team in GEM models indicates that macrophages play an important role in maintaining established PDAC, and inhibition of macrophage through CSF -1R blockade 
results in an enhanced T cell immune response. 
16 Thus collectively, our findings raise the 
possibility that targeting this pathway could have a compound effect on cancer stem cells to improve remissions and on reducing immunosuppression, leading to reduced tumor burden and improved survival in pancreatic cancer  patients.

 1.4 Cabiralizumab (BMS -986227,  FPA008)  
For more detailed information or background on cabiralizumab, please refer to the 
cabiralizumab IB ( BMS, 2018).17 
 
Cabiralizumab is a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mab) that binds to the human CSF -1R. Binding of cabiralizumab to CSFR1 
antagonizes binding of CSF1 and IL34, thereby preventing activation of CSF -1R. 
 
Cabiralizumab inhibits both CSF1 and IL34- induced CSF -1R phosphorylation in a cell line 
engineered to overexpress CSF -1R (CHO -CSF-1R), demonstrating that cabiralizumab 
blocks the activation of ligand- induced CSF -1R signaling pathways. Cabiralizumab also 
inhibits CSF1 and IL34 -induced proliferation and survival of peripheral blood monocytes in 
vitro, demonstrating that cabiralizumab inhibits not only the initiation of CSF1 and IL34 signaling pathways but also the subsequent physiologic responses of primary human 
monocytes to these ligands.  
 
CSF-1R is expressed on cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, and signaling through 
CSF-1R via its ligands, CSF1 and IL34, supports differentiation, maintenance, and function 
of monocytes, macrophages, and osteoclasts.  TAMs are among the most abundant immune 
cell types in the TME. Substantial evidence suggests that TAMs are polarized toward an anti- inflammatory phenotype (M2 TAMs) and through both cell surface inhibitors and soluble 
factors, such as immunosuppressive cytokines, playing a major role in inhibiting anti -tumor 
immune responses.
12 CSF1 is a major survival factor for TAMs, and targeting CSF -1R 
through cabiralizumab should reduce TAM -mediated immune suppression, resulting in 
strengthening the anti -tumor response to immunotherapy. Therefore, a drug that inhibits 
CSF-1R should limit the immunosuppressive influence of TAMs on the TME and could be 
complementary and augment current cancer  therapies.  
 
1.4.1 Cabiralizumab Clinical Summary  
 
The clinical summary of safe ty and efficacy is based on five clinical studies . Cabiralizumab 
was evaluated in 1 completed study (Study FPA008- 001) and is currently being  evaluated 
in 4 ongoing studies (Study FPA008- 002, Study FPA008- 003, Study CA025001, and Study 
CA025006).  A summary  of these studies is described below.  
 
Overall, the combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab appears to be well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of the individual components, and the frequency and types of  
immune- mediated AEs appear similar across multiple types of tumors. Alteration in liver enzymes  
(eg, AST, ALT, and CK) in the absence of changes in bilirubin and periorbital oedema have been  
observed across multiple trials as a consequence of the depletion of tissue- infiltrating macrophages  
mediated by cabiralizumab.  
 
 
The combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab with or without chemotherapy as evaluated in  
the preliminary safety cohort in Study CA025006 is well tolerated.  Across all studies, a total of 137 
subjects were treated with cabiralizumab monotherapy, and 302 subjects were treated with 
cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab, with or without  chemotherapy.

 Study FPA008 -001 evaluated the safety of cabiralizumab as single or double ascending 
doses in 48 healthy volunteers (36 received cabiralizumab and 12 received placebo). This 
study also evaluated the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab administered as two or three doses, 14 days apart, in 18 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects. This study has been completed. Thirty six healthy volunteers and 18 RA subjects received cabiralizumab with no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) reported and no unexpected treatment -related adverse events 
(AEs) reported from RA subjects treated with three doses up to 6 mg/kg.  
 
Study FPA008 -002 is evaluating the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab monotherapy for  
6 months in approximately 40 subjects with pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). Study FPA008 -002 is currently ongoing and is evaluating cabiralizumab as monotherapy in 
subjects with PVNS.  Details relating to safety are included in the latest version of the 
cabiralizumab IB ( BMS , 2018).
17 
Study FPA008- 003 is evaluating the safety and efficacy of cabiralizumab as monotherapy 
and in combination with nivolumab in approximately 295 subjects with advanced cancers.  
As of the data cutoff date of 02-Jul- 2018, a total of 312 subjects have been treated in Study 
FPA008 -003; 24 subjects have been treated in the Phase 1a dose- escalation monotherapy  
cohorts, 16 subjects have been treated in the Phase 1a dose -escalation combination 
cohorts, and 272 subjects have been treated in the Phases 1a and 1b dose- expansion 
combination cohorts. A  total of 265 subjects across the study were treated with the 
recommended dose of 4 mg/kg  cabiralizumab + 3 mg/kg nivolumab Q2W, and the overall 
safety of these subjects is reported independently.  
 
As of 02 -Jul-2018, AEs have been experienced by 264 of 265 (99.6%) subjects treated 
with 4 mg/kg cabiralizumab + 3 mg/kg nivolumab Q2W across multiple cohorts.  Treatment -
related AEs were experienced by 245 of 265 (92.5%) subjects. The most commonly reported (> 17% of subjects) treatment -related AEs included blood creatine phosphokinase 
increased (122 [46.0%] subjects), periorbital oedema (115 [43.4%] subjects), fatigue (102 [38.5%] subjects), AST increased (100 [37.7%] subjects), ALT increased and amylase increased (51 [19.2%] subjects each), rash (50 [18.9%] subjects), and pruritus (47 [17.7%] subjects).  Grade 5 treatment -related AEs were experienced by 3 (1.1%)  subjects and 
included acute respiratory failure (2 [0.8%] subjects) and respiratory distress (1 [0.4%] subject). Details relating to safety are included in the latest version of the cabiralizumab IB 
(BMS, 2018).  
 
Cabiralizumab- related ≥ Grade 3 AEs in Phase 1b were predominantly enzyme elevations 
of CK (14 Grade 3 and 14 Grade 4 events), LDH (one Grade 3 and one Grade 4 event), Alkaline phosphate ([ALP] two Grade 3 events), ALT (two Grade 3 events), and AST (10 
Grade 3 events). Other related AEs that were ≥ Grade 3 and reported in 2 or subjects ( ≥ 1%) 
included 13 events of amylase increased (12 Grade 3 and one Grade 4), 15 events of  
Grade 3 lipase increased (14 Grade 3 and one Grade 4), 11 events of Grade 3 Fatigue, and 
three events of Grade 3 hypertension.  
 
Twenty -six of 195 subjects (13%) experienced a cabiralizumab- related SAE in Phase 1b. 
The SAEs reported in two or more subjects ( ≥ 1%) included: CK increased (three subjects, 
3%), brain edema, pneumonitis, hyponatremia (two subjects each, 1%). Also SAEs included

 one event of Grade 4 CK increased (related to cabiralizumab and nivolumab), one event of 
Grade 3 autoimmune colitis (related  to nivolumab), and one event of Grade 3 hypopituitarism 
(related to cabiralizumab and nivolumab).  
 
Two Grade 5 SAEs prior to study treatment discontinuation have occurred in Phase 1a of Study FPA008- 003: one subject had a Grade 5 pulmonary embolus (not related) and a 
Grade 5 pneumonitis (related to both drugs; refer to Appendix 6 for management recommendations in cases of pneumonitis) and the other subject had a Grade 5 hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia (not related). Six Grade 5 SAEs prior to study treatment discontinuation were reported in Phase 1b of this study. These included 1 sudden cardiac death (unrelated), 1 death due to tumor thrombus blocking a major blood vessel (unrelated), 2 participants with respiratory failure (unrelated), 1 participant with acute 
respiratory distress (related), and 1 participant with acute respiratory failure  (related).  
 
At a presentation at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, Dr. Zev Wainberg presented more details on the activity of cabiralizumab plus nivoloumab. 
18 A confirmed objective 
response was observed in 4 of 31 (13%) patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, all heavily pretreated. The responses were ongoing (range 168 + to 275+ days). This study also evaluated peripheral and tumor biomarkers  in pre and post treatment paired biopsies. 
Of note, the four patients with confirmed responses in pancreatic cancer, were microsatellite stable (MSS) with low tumor mutation burden (TMB). The pharmacodynamics and genomic profiling of these patients treated with the combination of cabiralizumab plus nivolumab demonstrated cabira- mediated CSR -1R blockade in the periphery and tumor 
microenvironment, this data was presented at ASCO 2018, Abstract 3020.

1.5 Nivolumab (BMS -936558))  
Cancer immunotherapy rests on the premise that tumors can be recognized as foreign rather than as self and can be effectively attacked by an activated immune system. An effective immune response in this setting is thought to rely on immune surveillance of tumor antigens expressed on cancer cells that ultimately results in an adaptive immune response and cancer cell death. Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition of traits that allow cancer cells to evade immuno- surveillance and escape effective innate and adaptive 
immune responses.
20,21,22 Current immunotherapy efforts attempt to break the apparent

 tolerance of the immune system to tumor cells and antigens by either introducing cancer 
antigens by therapeutic vaccination or by modulating regulatory checkpoints of the immune 
system. T -cell stimulation is a complex process involving the integration of numerous 
positive as well as negative co- stimulatory signals in addition to antigen recognition by the 
T-cell receptor (TCR).23 Collectively, these signals govern the balance between T -cell 
activation and tolerance.  
 
PD-1 is a member of the CD28 family of T -cell co -stimulatory receptors that also includes 
CD28, CTLA 4,  ICOS, and BTLA.24 PD-1 signaling has been shown to inhibit CD28 - 
mediated upregulation of IL- 2, IL-10, IL -13, interferon- γ (IFN -γ) and Bcl -xL. PD -1 expression 
has also been noted to inhibit T -cell activation and expansion of previously activated cells. 
Evidence for a negative regulatory role of PD -1 comes from studies of PD - 
1 deficient mice, which develop a variety of autoimmune phenotypes.25 These results 
suggest that PD -1 blockade has the potential to activate anti -self T -cell responses, but these 
responses are variable and dependent upon various host genetic factors. Thus, PD - 
1 deficiency or inhibition is not accompanied by a universal loss of tolerance to self - antigens.  
 
PD-1 is a 55 kD type I transmembrane protein primarily expressed on activated T cells, B 
cells, myeloid cells, and antigen- presenting cells (APCs).25 Binding of PD -1 to PD -L1 and 
PD-L2 has been shown to down- regulate T -cell activation in both murine and human 
systems.24, 27,28,29 PD1/PD -L1 interactions may also indirectly modulate the response to 
tumor antigens through T -cell/APC interactions. Therefore, PD -1 engagement may 
represent one means by which tumors evade immuno- surveillance and clearance.30 
Blockade of the PD -1 pathway by nivolumab has been studied in a variety of preclinical in 
vitro assays, and anti -tumor activity using a murine analog of nivolumab has been shown in 
a number of immunocompetent mouse cancer models. Nivolumab has been approved for 
the treatment of patients with unresectable melanoma, unresectable advanced or recurrent 
NSCLC, and RCC in Japan. In the US, nivolumab has been approved for the treatment of melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, HCC, and classical Hodgkin  lymphoma. Nivolumab is currently 
being evaluated extensively across a wide range of solid tumors and hematologi cal 
malignancies. These findings provided the rationale for expanding the evaluation PD -1 
pathway blockade in combination with novel immunotherapy agents in clinical  studies. 
Nivolumab is a fully human, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) [kappa] isotype monoclonal antibody 
that binds to PD -1 with nanomolar affinity (dissociation constant [Kd], 3.06 nM) with a high 
degree of specificity. In vitro, nivolumab binds to PD -1 with high affinity (EC50 0.39- 2.62 
nM), and inhibits the binding of PD -1 to its ligands PD -L1 and PD-L2 (IC501±  nM). 
Nivolumab binds specifically to PD -1 and not to related members of the CD28 family such as 
CD28, ICOS, CTLA -4, and BTLA. Blockade of the PD -1 pathway by nivolumab results in a 
reproducible enhancement of both proliferation and IFN -γ release in the mixed lymphocyte 
reaction (MLR). Using a cytomegalovirus (CMV) re- stimulation assay with human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the effect of nivolumab on antigen specific recall response indicates that nivolumab augmented IFN -γ secretion from CMV specific memory T cells in a 
dose- dependent manner versus isotype- matched control. In vivo blockade of PD -1 by a 
murine analog of nivolumab enhances the anti -tumor immune response and results in tumor 
rejection in several immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N, and PAN02).

CONFIDENTIAL   
 other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 17,700 participants. Nivolumab 
monotherapy is approved in multiple countries, including the US, European Union (EU), and Japan. Nivolumab has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of patients with unresectable/metastatic melanoma (as a single agent and in combination with ipilimumab), metastatic NSCLC after disease progression on or after platinum -based chemotherapy, 
advanced RCC previously treated with anti -angiogenic therapy, recurrent or metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) with disease progression on or after a platinum -based therapy, refractory hepatocellular carcinoma previously treated with 
sofarenib, classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or progressed, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer after disease progression on or after platinum -based 
chemotherapy, and other  cancers. 
 
For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety profile is similar across tumor types. The onl y 
exception is pulmonary inflammation AEs, which may be numerically greater  in participants with NSCLC. In NSCLC patients, it can be difficult to distinguish between nivolumab- related 
and nivolumab- unrelated causes of pulmonary symptoms and radiographic changes. Most 
AEs were low -grade (Grades 1 to 2) with relatively few related high- grade (Grades 3 to 4) 
AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs with respect to nivolumab dose level. These AEs have included pulmonary toxicity, renal toxicity (including acute renal failure), endocrine abnormalities, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, dermatologic toxicity (including rash), and hepatotoxicity. A pattern of immune- related AEs (irAEs) has 
been defined, for which management algorithms have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 6. Most high- grade events were manageable with the use of corticosteroids or 
hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies) as instructed in these algorithms. There is no relationship between the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs and the nivolumab dose level.  
 
Nivolumab, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is currently being tested for the treatment of advanced/metastatic PDAC. Preliminary results from Study CA209032 show that nivolumab, administered as monotherapy was well tolerated in participants with advanced/metastatic PDAC. Despite the lack of objective responses in the 14 participants  
treated in this cohort, 1 participant experienced a prolonged stable disease (48 weeks) (Bristol -Myers Squibb) [BMS] internal data). In addition, the combination of nivolumab and 
gemcitabine/abraxane is currently being tested as first line treatment for participants with advanced/metastatic PDAC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The combination appears to be well tolerated  
with a safety profile similar to the individual components. As of February 2017, 20 participants are evaluable for efficacy. The preliminary ORR is 25% (5 out of 20 participants experience PR). In addition, 12 participants experienced prolonged, stable disease (BMS internal  data).  
 
Taken together, these data suggest that while nivolumab in monotherapy may not be sufficient to improve the anti -tumor activity in advanced pancreatic cancer, the combination 
of nivolumab with the appropriate immunotherapy/chemotherapy may indeed improve anti - 
tumor activity in this setting.

1.5.1 Nivolumab + Cabiralizumab  
 
The combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab as demonstrated in Study FPA008- 003 
has a manageable safety profile that is minimally overlapping with that of the 
chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine) being evaluated in this study.  The preliminary data 
suggest that the combination of cabiralizumab and nivolumab mediates  favorable 
antitumor effects in subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer. Details relating to efficacy 
are included in the latest version of the cabiralizumab IB (BMS, 2018).  Preclinical evidence 
support the potential advantages of combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy, but 
overall, the potential benefit of the proposed combination over standard- of-care 
chemotherapy is not yet known. Nevertheless, the dismal prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have a poor prognosis and the lack of curative options support the need of novel combinatorial  approaches.
 
 
1.6 Justification for Cabiral izumab Dose  
A cabiralizumab dose of 4 mg/kg has been tested in combination with nivolumab in 195 subjects across a number of tumors in Part 1b of Study FPA008- 003. The safety profile of 
this dose is described in Section 1.4.1. The cabiralizumab dose of 4 m g/kg Q2W was 
selected in this trial based on the observed reduction of circulating CD16- positive peripheral 
blood monocytes (CD16+ monocytes) and a tolerable safety profile.  
 
Consistent with healthy subjects, rheumatoid arthritis and PVNS trials, a dose- dependent 
reduction in CD16+ monocytes after cabiralizumab administration was observed in subjects  
with cancer  in Study  FPA008 -003. Across trials,  cabiralizumab  concentrations  of 
≥ 10 µg/mL in serum maximize the reduction of non- classical CD16+ monocytes in a majority 
of subjects. In Study FPA008- 003, the 4 mg/kg Q2W dose was associated with a Ctrough 
of ≥ 10 µg/mL and consistent suppression of circulating CD16+ monocytes after dosing. 
17 
1.7 Justification for Nivolumab Dose  
The nivolumab dose of 480 mg Q4W was selected for this study based on clinical data and modeling and simulation approaches using population PK (PPK) and exposure- response 
(ER) analyses examining relationships between nivolumab exposures and efficacy (eg, OS,  
OR) and safety responses,  using  data from studies  in multiple  tumor  types  (melanoma, 
NSCLC, and RCC) with body weight -normalized dosing (mg/kg). The PPK analyses have 
shown that exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally over the dose range of 0.1 
to 10 mg/kg administered Q2W, and no clinically meaningful differences in PK across ethnicities and tumor types were observed. Nivolumab clearance and volume of distribution were found to increase as body weight increases but less than proportionally with increasing weight, indicating that milligram -per-kilogram dosing represents an over - adjustment for the 
effect of body weight on nivolumab PK.  
 
Using the PPK and ER models, nivolumab exposures and probabilities of  efficacy responses 
and risks of AEs were predicted following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and compared to those following nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W. The overall distributions of average nivolumab steady -
state exposures (Cssavg) are comparable following administration with either nivolumab 3

CONFIDENTIAL   
 mg/kg Q2W or nivolumab 480 mg Q4W. While nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is predicted to result 
in approximately 43% greater steady -state peak concentrations (Cmaxss) compared to 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W, these exposures are predicted to be lower than the exposure ranges observed at doses up to nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W used in the nivolumab clinical program; the predicted Cmaxss following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W is well below the median Cmaxss achieved following administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W, a safe and tolerable dose level.  
 
Exposure- safety analysis demonstrated that the exposure margins for safety are maintained 
following nivolumab 480 mg Q4W. Safety analyses using available data following nivolumab 3 mg/kg Q2W and 10 mg/kg Q2W administrat ion indicated that there were no differences in 
A E profiles across body weight groups.  
 
1.8 Justification for Infusion Times for Nivolumab and Cabiralizumab  
Administration of nivolumab using a 30- minute infusion time has been evaluated in subjects 
with cancer. Previous clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy for the treatment of cancer have used a 60- minute infusion duration wherein nivolumab has been safely administered 
up to 10 mg/kg over long treatment periods. Infusion reactions including high- grade 
hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon across the nivolumab clinical program. In Study CA209010, a dose association was observed for infusion site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (1.7% at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7% at 2 mg/kg, and 18.5% at 10 mg/kg). All 
the events were Grades 1 to 2 and were manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg nivolumab (30% of the dose provided at 10 mg/kg) is not expected to present any safety concerns compared to the prior experience at 10 mg/kg nivolumab dose infused over a 60- minute duration. The safety of nivolumab 3 mg/kg administered as a 30- min infusion 
was assessed in Study CA209153 in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC (see Nivolumab IB Section 5.5.1.2)
32. Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences in 
the frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion- related reactions (of any cause or treatment -
related) in cancer patients administered nivolumab over a 30- minute infusion compared with 
that reported for patients treated with the 60- minute infusion. Thus, it was shown that 
nivolumab can be safely infused over 30 minutes in subjects with cancer. 
 
Cabiralizumab has been administered safely  as  a  30- minute  intravenous  infusion  at  up  
to 10 mg/kg in a single  dose.  Overa ll, infusion  reactions  including  high-grade 
hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon across nivolumab and cabiralizumab clinical studies. Furthermore, a 30 minute break after the first infusion for the combination will ensure appropriate safety monitoring before the start of the second infusion. When administering nivolumab in combination with cabiralizumab, the nivolumab infusion should be administered first.

Gemcitabine will be then administered as 1000 mg/m2 over 30 to 40 minutes.  
 
 
4.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification  
 
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Sections 1.6- 1.8. 
 
Details on preparation and administration of trial treatments are provided in the Investigator 
Brochure (cabrilizumab) and Package Inserts (nivolumab and gemcitabine).  
 
4.2.2 Dosing of Cabiralizumab and  Nivolumab  
 
For the combination regimen, nivolumab should always be administered first as a 30- minute 
IV infusion followed by a 30- minute IV infusion of cabiralizumab. The time in between infusions 
is expected to be approximately 30 minutes but can be more or less depending on the 
situation. Cabiralizumab will be administered every 2 weeks ( ± 2days) and nivolumab will be 
administered every 4 weeks ( ± 2 days). Participants may be dosed with cabiralizumab no less 
than 12 days from the previous dose and with nivolumab no less than 24 days from the 
previous dose.  
 
Dosing calculations should be based on the body weight assessed at Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to the first dose of cabiralizumab. If the participant’s weight on the day of dosing differs by > 10% from the weight used to calculate the prior dose, the dose must be recalculated.  All doses 
should be rounded to the nearest milligram and chemotherapy should be rounded as per SOC (usually 10 mg).  
 
Doses of study drugs may be interrupted, delayed, or discontinued depending on how the 
participant tolerates the treatment.  
 
4.2.3 Dose Delay for Cabiralizumab and Nivolumab  
 
Administration of cabiralizumab and/or nivolumab in combination therapy should be delayed 
for the following:  
 
• Any Grade 3 fatigue which does not resolve to Grade 1 or baseline before the next 
treatment  visit; 
 
• Any drug-related laboratory abnormalities would not require a dose delay unless 
clinically indicated or specified in the protocol or abnormal laboratory management table 
(Appendix 7). Please discuss with the Sponsor or designee as  needed;  
 
• For dose delays or modifications for all other AEs, please refer to the AE 
management table in Appendix  6. 
 
Participants who require a dose delay of cabiralizumab or nivolumab should be re- evaluated 
weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated and resume study drug dosing when re- 
treatment criteria are met. If a participant experiences an infusion reaction to cabiralizumab or

CONFIDENTIAL   
 nivolumab, or both study drugs, the infusion reaction should be treated following the infusion 
reaction treatment guidelines in Appendix  6. 
 
4.2.4 Guidelines for Subject Monitoring After  Infusions  
 
Obtain baseline vitals, then every 30 minutes during the infusion and continue to monitor the pt for at least 30 minutes after completion.  
 
Notify PI for infusion -related events; blood pressure < 90/60 or > 170/110 mmHg; heart rate  
> 100, or < 60 beats per minute or irregular; shortness of breath.  
 
4.2.5 Management Algorithms for Immuno- oncology  Agents  
 
Immuno -oncology (I -O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
from AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Nivolumab and cabiralizumab are considered 
I-O agents in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with I -O 
agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed from extensive experience with nivolumab to assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs:  
 
• GI 
 
• Renal  
 
• Pulmonary  
 
• Hepatic  
 
• Endocrinopathies  
 
• Skin 
 
• Neurological  
Specific algorithms for the management of irAEs are provided in Appendix 6 and are applicable to immune- related AEs for all immuno- oncology study treatment combinations.  
 
4.2.6 Dose Reductions for Cabiralizumab and  Nivolumab  
 
Dose reduction for cabiralizumab and nivolumab are not permitted.  
 
4.2.7 Dose Discontinuation Criteria for Cabiralizumab and  Nivolumab  
 
For comprehensive discontinuation rules, refer to Appendix 6 (AE management) and Appendix 7 (Laboratory Abnormalities Management Table).  
 
Treatment of cabiralizumab in combination with nivolumab should be discontinued in the following cases unless otherwise specified:

the second re- treatment period or that requires systemic  treatment.  
 
• Any Grade 3 or higher infusion- related reactions and hypersensitivity requiring 
discontinuation. Any re- initiation of therapy in this circumstance would require 
consultation with the Sponsor or designee.  
 
• Any Grade 3 non- skin, drug -related AE lasting > 7 days, or recurrences including drug - 
related uveitis, pneumonitis, hypoxia, bronchospasm, and endocrinopathies with the following  exceptions:  
 
o Grade 3 drug -related diarrhea, colitis, neurologic toxicity, uveitis, pneumonitis, 
bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration 
requires  discontinuation.  
 
o Grade 3 drug -related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal 
insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone 
replacement.  
 
o Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment 
discontinuation except:  
 
 Grade 3 drug -related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with 
Grade ≥ 2 bleeding requires  disco ntinuation.

• Any event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose 
requires discontinuation, with the following  exceptions:  
 
o Dosing delays to manage drug -related AEs are allowed. Prior to re- initiating 
treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks from the previous 
dose, the Sponsor or designee must be consulted. Tumor assessments should 
continue as per -protocol even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess 
safety and laboratory studies should also continue per protocol, or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays or per the 
Investigator’s  discr etion.  
 
o Dosing delays lasting > 6 weeks from the previous dose that occur for non- drug-
related reasons may be allowed if approved by the Sponsor or designee. Prior 
to re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks, 
the Sponsor must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue per - 
protocol every 8 weeks (± 7 days) even if dosing is delayed. Periodic  study  visits 
to assess safety and laboratory studies should also continue per -protocol or 
more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays or per the investigator’s discretion.  
 
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the 
investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued cabiralizumab and/or nivolumab dosing  
 
• Any drug -related Grade 3 or higher neurological  toxicity

 • Any Grade 4 skin toxicity  
 
• Any Grade 4 renal  toxicity  
 
• Any drug -related Grade 3 or higher pulmonary  toxicity  
 
 
If the causality of the AE requiring discontinuation is confirmed to be due to 1 of the study drugs in 
the combination therapy, the other drug(s) may be continued per -protocol schedule under the 
following scenarios:  
· Timely resolution of the AE based on the treatment modification table  
· Clinical benefit is shown by the participant based on investigator assessment.  
 
 
4.2.8 Criteria to Resume Treatment with Cabiralizumab and Nivolumab  
 
Participants may resume treatment with cabiralizumab and/or nivolumab when the drug - 
related AE resolves as noted in the AE management tables in  Appendix 6 or the abnormal 
laboratory management table in Appendix 7. The Sponsor or designee can be contacted at any time if further clarification is needed.  
 
4.2.9 Dose Modification for  Gemcitabine  
 
Since gemcitabine is standard therapy for pancreatic cancers, sites use the suggested dosing. Any laboratory -only abnormalities without clinical manifestations or electrolyte abnormalities 
that may be managed with supplementation also do not automatically need dose modification.  
 
Suggested dose modification will be performed according to the Gemcitabine package insert 
(Refer to Table 3).

4.2.12 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed &  prohibited)  
 
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial treatment or vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this  with 
the Investigator Sponsor. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the patient's primary  physician.  
 
4.2.13 Acceptable Concomitant  Medications  
 
All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case rep ort form (CRF) including all 
prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), multivitamins, nutritional and/or herbal supplements, 
and IV medications and fluids. If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF.  
 
All concomitant medications received within 30 days before the first dose of trial treatment and 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be recorded. Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment should be reported for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 6.2.  
 
4.2.14 Prohibited Concomitant  Medications  
 
Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the Screening and Treatment Phase of this trial. For specific therapies there is a washout window prior to cycle1/day1, indicated below and per eligibility criteria in Section 4.1.

 • Premenarchal  
 
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
 
o Documented hysterectomy  
 
o Documented bilateral  salpingectomy  
 
o Documented bilateral  oophorectomy  
 
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 
• Postmenopausal  female  
 
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical  cause.  
 
 A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with 
two FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is  required.  
 
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non- hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish 
to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT 
to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.  
4.3.4.2  Contraception  Requirements  
 
Male Participants:  
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to one of the following during the protocol - defined timeframe in section 5.0:  
 
• Be abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent  
 
• Use a male  condom  plus partner  use of a contraceptive method with a failure  rate of 
<1% per year as described in Table 4 when having penile- vaginal intercourse with a 
woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant.  
 
o Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain 
abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each 
episode of penile penetration.  
 
Female Participants:

CONFIDENTIAL   
 Female part icipants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception that has a low user dependency consistently and 
correctly as described in Table 4 during the protocol -defined time frame in Secti on 5.0.  
 
Table 4. Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependency  
 
Highly Effective Methods That Have Low User Dependency  
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  
• Progestogen - only contraceptive implant a, b 
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS) b 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Bilateral tubal  occlusion 
• Vasectomized  partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP  and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
• Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual interc ourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
Notes:  
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies.  
 
a) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) 
guidelines,  acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those which inhibit ovulation.  
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study 
treatment, condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment period and for at least 6 months   after the last dose of study treatment.

4.3.5 Pregnancy  Testing  
 
WOCBP should only be included after a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum 
sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24- hours before the first dose of  trial 
treatment.  
 
Following initiation of treatment additional pregnancy testing will be performed prior to day 1 of each cycle during the treatment period, at the end of treatment (EOT) and at 30 days  after the last dose of study treatment and as requir ed locally.  
 
Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
 
4.3.6 Use in  Pregnancy  
 
If a patient inadvertently becomes pregnant while on trial treatment, the patient will immediately be removed from the trial. The site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours. The Sponsor will report to BMS within 24 hours (working days) if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life- threatening complication 
to the mother or newborn).  
 
The trial investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male patient impregnates his female partner, the trial personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will report to BMS and follow the pregnancy as described above and in Section 6.2.  
 
4.3.7 Use in Nursing  Women  
 
It is unknown whether the trial treatments (nivolumab, cabiralizumab, and gemci tabine) are 
excreted in human milk. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, patients who are breast -feeding 
are not eligible for enrollment.  
 
4.4 Patient Withdrawal/Disconti nuation  Criteria  
 
Patients may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a patient may be withdrawn by the investigator or the Sponsor if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the  
trial plan is violated,  or for administrative  and/or  other  safety  reasons.  Specific  details

CONFIDENTIAL   
 regarding assessments to be done at an End of Treatment (EOT) visit at time of 
discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 6.1.5.3.  
 
A patient must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
 
• The patient or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent  
 
• Confirmed disease progression 
 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences  
 
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of  treatment  
 
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the patient  
 
• The patient has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy  test 
 
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
 
• The patient is lost to  follow- up 
 
• Administrative reasons  
 
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 5 (Trial Schedule) 
and Section 6.1.5 (Visit Requirements). After the end of treatment, each patient will be followed 
for at least 90 days for adverse event monitoring (serious adverse events will be collected for 100 days after the end of treatment as described in Section 6.2.3.1). Patients who discontinue for reasons other than progressive disease will have post -treatment follow - up every 100 days 
for disease status until disease progression, initiating a non- study cancer treatment, 
withdrawing consent or becoming lost to follow -up, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs 
first. 
 
4.5 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination by the Sponsor 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified  below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or  incomplete  
 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory  requirements  
 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients  
 
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the trial  treatment

 4.6 Safety Stopping  Rule 
 
For the purposes of the safety stopping rule, a safety event of interest will be defined as 
any drug discontinuation which arises from the adverse event/ laboratory abnormalities 
management algorithms in section 4.2.7 and Appendices 6 and  7, or,  as any gr ade 3 or 
higher adverse event which is not covered by these management algorithms and which is 
related to GI, pulmonary, hepatic, or neurological toxicity, and is at least possibly related 
to study drug . 
 For other toxicity and dose modifications please see attached schema/table.  
 
If a subject experiences a safety event of interest, no additional doses of the investigational product  will be given to that subject. The subject will be counted in the ITT population for 
the efficacy analysis.  
 As reported in the most recent IB, 43 of 265 (16.2%) subjects experienced discontinuation due to a treatment related AE after treatment with cabiralizumab +nivolumab.  Based on 
this experience, we reasonably expect to see an event rate of 16% in this trial.  The safety stopping rule will be designed to continue with probability approximately 80% in case the event rate is 16% or less:  
 If at any time 4 subjects experience a safety event of interest,  further accrual will be held 
pending safety review, and the study will be restarted only with Principal Investigator approval. The safety review will take the form of review of a formal Safety Report, prepared following the SOP’s for a DSMC report, by a Safety Review Team which includes the Investigators who enrolled subjects in the study, the Principal Investigator, and the UCSD 
DSMC.      
 This rule has probability 21% of being invoked if the event rate is 16%, and thus 80% probability to continue through 15 subjects in this case.  Alternatively, if the event rate is as high as 30%, the safety rule has 70% chance of stopping the study for review.  
 
If one or more grade 4 or 5 AE’s are observed  (with the exception of a grade 4 AE’s 
covered by the management algorithms of Appendices 6 and 7, which does not lead to 
drug discontinuati on) which are at least possibly attributable to study drug, further accrual 
will be held pending safety review as described above, and the study will be restarted only with Principal Investigator approval.  
 FDA will be notified if one of the thresholds to hold a safety review is met.  
 
5.0 Trial Schedule  
The trial will consist of the following three periods:  
 
Screening (SCN) Period: The screening period will take place only after informed consent is 
obtained and within the 30 days prior to C1/D1. The screening visit may be counted as  the baseline visit if completed within 7 days of initial dosing on C1/D1.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 Treatment Period: Patients  will be treated at 28 ± 2 day intervals. Patient must begin cycle 1 
within 30 days of signing the IRB approved informed consent document and after the screening 
assessments have been performed and reports have been reviewed to confirm eligibility. The patient will continue on maintenance therapy until there is evidence of clear - cut tumor 
progression, has treatment ending toxicities, or withdraws from treatment. Table 5 below summarizes the Screen- Treatment Period Schedule of  Assessments. 
 
Post Treatment P eriod : All participants should complete the 3 clinical safety follow -up visits 
( at 30, 60, and 100 days from EOT) regardless of whether new anti -cancer therapy is started, 
except those participants who will withdraw consent for study participation or are unable to 
come to clinic due to disease progression”. Table 6 below summarizes the Post - Treatment 
Period Schedule of Assessments.  (6.1.5.4).

 6.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
6.1 Trial Procedures  
Individual trial procedures (Administrative, Clinical, and Laboratory) are described in detail 
below. The specific visit requirements are detailed in Section 6.1.5. It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by the investigator.  
 
Furthermore, additional evaluations/ testing may be deemed necessary by the Sponsor for reasons related to patient safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local  regulations may require that 
additional informed consent be obtained from the patient. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
 
6.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
 
6.1.1.1  Informed Consent  
The Investigator or qualified designee must obtain documented consent from each potential 
patient prior to participating in a clinical trial.  
 
Consent must be documented by the patient’s dated signature. A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the patient before participation in the trial.  
 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form and any written information provided to the patient must receive the IRB/ERC’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. The patient or his/her legally acceptable representative should be 
informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the patient’s dated signature or by the patient’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
 
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations and Sponsor requirements.  
 
6.1.1.2  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed and documented by the investigator or qualified designee to ensure that the patient qualifies for the trial.  
 
6.1.1.3  Medical  History  
A medical history will be obtained by the investigator or qualified designee. Medical history will include all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within the prior 10 years that are considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator. Details regarding the disease for which the patient has enrolled in this trial will be recorded separately and not listed as medical  
history.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 6.1.1.4  Prior and Concomitant Medications  Review 
6.1.1.4.1  Prior Medications  
The investigator or qualified designee will review prior medication use, including any protocol -
specified washout requirement, and record prior medication taken by the patient within the 30 
days before starting the trial. Treatment for the disease for which the pat ient has enrolled in 
this trial will be recorded separately and not listed as a prior  medication.  
 
6.1.1.4.2  Concomitant Medications  
The investigator or qualified designee will record medications including prescription, over - the-
counter (OTC), multivitamins, nutritional and/or herbal supplements, IV medications and fluids, if any, taken by the patient during the trial. All medications related to reportable SAEs and Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs) should be recorded as defined in Section 6.2.  
 
6.1.1.5  Disease Details and Treatments  
6.1.1.5.1  Disease  Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will obtain prior and current details regarding disease status. 
 
6.1.1.5.2  Prior Treatment  Details  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all prior cancer treatments including systemic treatments, radiation and surgeries. The investigator will assess and provide as part of the 
baseline eCRF data, the Best Response on the last treatment prior to enrollment in this trial. Patients must have been off their prior cytotoxic regimen a minimum of two weeks but no more than five weeks from initiating trial treatment on C1/D1.  
 
6.1.1.5.3  Subsequent Anti -Cancer Therapy  Status  
The investigator or qualified designee will review all new anti -neoplastic therapy initiated after 
the last dose of trial treatment. If a patient initiates a new anti -cancer therapy within 30 days 
after the last dose of trial treatment, the EOT visit must occur before the first dose of the new  
therapy.  
 
 
 
6.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
 
6.1.2.1  Adverse Event (AE)  Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each patient to evaluate for potential new or worsening  AEs as specified in the Trial Schedule Section  5.0 (during  the trial treatment  
period, for 100 ( ( ±7 days) following last dose of trial treatment, or date of discontinuation. 
This will be contingent on patients clinical status. Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the trial and during the 30 day follow -up period according to NCI 
CTCAE Version 5.0 Toxicities will be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, 
causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial  treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 Please refer to section 6.2 for detailed information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs. 
 
6.1.2.2  Full Physical Exam 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the screening period. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history.  
 
6.1.2.3  Directed Physical  Exam  
For cycles that do not  require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator or 
qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment administration on day 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. 
 
6.1.2.4  Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the 
administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Schedule (Section 5.0). Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure. Weight will be measured at the start of each treatment cycle. Height will be measured at screening  only.  
 
6.1.2.5  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (Appendix 4) at screening, prior to the administration of trial treatment on day 1 of each cycle and at discontinuation of trial treatment as specified in the Trial Schedule.  
 
6.1.2.6  Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease (Refer to Appendix 5)  
The patient’s pancreatic cancer will be evaluated by the investigator based on tumor 
assessments using RECIST 1.1 criteria. In additional, iRECIST criteria will be assessed.  
 
Tumor assessments for evaluation of response will be conducted using CT or MRI, wit h IV 
contrast if not medically contraindicated, approximately every 8 ± 1 weeks until trial discontinuation or disease progression, whichever is later. All sites of disease must be followed using the same baseline assessment method.  
 
All target lesions will be measured by consistent imaging techniques for each patient throughout the trial. Suitable imaging techniques include CT -scan, or MRI. The same  
technique should be used for each evaluation in an individual patient. Copies of the scans must be available for review.  
 
In the event that PD by RECIST 1.1 or iUPD is determined for a patient, a repeat scan must 
be performed within 4 - 6 weeks to confirm PD. Trial treatment may be continued during this 
time (past the initial PD assessment) but only if patient is clinically stable as defined by:  
 
• No worsening of performance status

 • No clinically relevant increase in disease related symptoms  
 
• No requirement for intensified management of disease related symptoms (analgesics, 
radiation, palliative  care)  
 
CA19 -9 assessments (or CEA or CA -125 for not expressers of CA19- 9) will be taken at 
baseline and approximately every 28 days during the trial treatment period. All CA19- 9 
assessments must be assayed by the same laboratory for each patient. Disease  progression will not be determined by CA19- 9, however increases in CA19- 9 may warrant the investigator 
to obtain radiographic  assessments. 
 
Note: In order to more precisely determine time to progression, the investigator is encouraged 
to obtain radiological assessments and CA19 -9 values earlier if there is a strong clinical 
suspicion of disease progression. In order to either confirm or refute the clinical impression.  
 Note: Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complication s of disease progression (eg, CNS metastases)  
 
6.1.2.7  Blood Collection  
Each patient will have 30 ml of blood collected at the following timepoints: Pre- treatment (0- 
14 days prior to cycle1/day1), and during the trial prior to treatment on days 1 of cycles 1, 2, 4, 6, and every 2 cycles thereafter.  
 
For those patient consenting to the optional tumor biopsy, an additional 30 ml blood sample will also be collected at the time of biopsy refer to section 6.1.2.8.  
 
Blood samples will be sent and analyzed by Dr. Reya’s Laboratory at University of California San Diego.  
 
Specific details for blood sample collection and processing will be provided to the investigative sites in the Trial Laboratory Manual.  
 
6.1.2.8  Tumor Tissue Collection 
All patients will be required to provide an archival tissue block from either primary or metastatic 
site. 
 
Patients with cytology only that do not have adequate archived tumor specimen available, will require a baseline biopsy.  
 
For patients consenting to the optional tumor biopsy, a baseline tumor biopsy will be taken 
from each patient and used for profiling (collected within the 4 weeks prior to cycle 1/day1).  If possible (patient condition permitting) this will be repeated on Week 7, C2 Day 15 ( -3 days,  
+ 10 days) or at the time of clear disease progression. If the biopsy cannot be collected within this timeframe this is to be discussed with the sponsor. Tissue samples will be sent and analyzed by Dr. Reya’s Laboratory at University of California San Diego.

6.1.5.4  Follow -up Period  
Three Safety Follow -up visits should be conducted approximately 30, 60, and 100 ( ±7 days) 
after the last dose of trial treatment, or date of discontinuation. All participants should complete 
the three clinical safety follow -up visits regardless of whether new anti -cancer therapy is 
started, except those participants who will withdraw consent for study participation or are unable to come to clinic due to disease progression. The following assessments will be  
performed:  
 
• Serum β -HCG pregnancy test (for  WOCBP)  
 
• AEs using the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 (see Appendix  3) 
 
• Review contraception use as required by protocol Section 4.3.4 (where applicable)  
 
• Confirm contact information for patient and a designated family member and remind patient of FU telephone contact that will be conducted every 100 days for survival 
status. 
 
All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded. Patients with an AE 
of Grade > 1 will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0- 1 or until the beginning 
of a new anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs  first. 
 
SAEs that occur within 100 days of discontinuation of dosing must be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety, whether related or not related to study drug.  
 
6.1.5.5  Survival Follow -up Phase  
Following the 100 days safety follow up, the patients are to be contacted via telephone every 100 days for survival information until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs first.  
 
6.2 Adverse Events  
6.2.1 Adverse Event  Definition  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of 
a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study drug and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational  product.  
Progression of the cancer under study or events which are unequivocally due to disease 
progression should not be reported as an AE during the study (unless it is considered to be drug related by the investigator).  
UCSD Moores Cancer Center          HRPP# 181395  
Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date: 
12/11/2018  64 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 A non- serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.  
 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• results in  death  
 
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more  severe)  
 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(see NOTE below)  
 
• results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity  
 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
• is an important medical  event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.)  
 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug is an  SAE.  
 
 
Although pregnancy and potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI), are not always serious by 
regulatory definition, however, these events must be reported within the SAEs timeline.  
 
Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported as an SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported).  
 
NOTE : The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:  
 
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life- threatening  event)  
 
• Elective surgery, planned prior to signing  consent  
 
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure

Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date: 
12/11/2018  65 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 • Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
 
• Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these  cases. 
 
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  
 
• Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other  SAEs.  
 
6.2.2 Adverse Event Monit oring  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial. Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  
 
As far as possible, each adverse event should be  evaluated to determine:  
• duration (start and end  dates)  
• severity  (grade)  
• seriousness  
• relationship to study  agent  
• action taken (i.e., none, study agent modification, medical  intervention)  
• outcome (i.e., resolved without sequelae, resolved with sequelae,  ongoing)  
 
Adverse events monitoring begins after initiation of study treatment and ends 3 days following the last administration of study treatment or start of new anti -cancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier.  
 
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug [or at least possibly related to the drug], will be monitored until:  
• the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the  adverse 
event return to baseline;  
• any clinically significant abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline;  
• there is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes observed;  or 
• death.  
 
6.23 Laboratory Test  Abnormalities  
 
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following 
institutional procedures. Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported to BMS as such.

Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date: 
12/11/2018  66 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
 
• Any laboratory test result that  is clinically significant or meets the definition of an  SAE 
 
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the participant to have study drug 
discontinued or  interrupted  
 
• Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy.  
 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
 
6.24 Reporting Requirements of Adverse Events  
 
6.24.1.1 Expedited  Reporting  
 
The Study Chair and multi -sites: University of Kansas Cancer Center and University of

the Principal Investigator was unanticipated, involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the research procedures.  
Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB -approved protocol that alters the 
level of risk.  
Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research subject.  
Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated sponsor safety 
report), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit 
ratio for the research.  
Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.  
Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that cannot be resolved by the Principal Investigator.  
 
Multi -sites: The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of each site must be notified by the site 
principal investigator according to their local policies.  
The FDA must be notified according to the following timelines:  
        within 7 calendar days of any unexpected fatal or life- threatening adverse event  with 
possible relationship to study drug,  and 
        within 15 calendar days of any event that is considered: 1) serious, 2)  unexpected, 
and 3) at least possibly related to study  participation.  
6.24.1.2 Routine R eporting Requirements  
The UCSD HRPP must be notified of any adverse events that are not unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others (non- UPRs) at the time of the annual Continuing 
Review.  
The IRB of each site must be notified by the site principal investigator according to their local policies.  
The FDA must be notified of all non- serious adverse events annually at the time of the 
annual report.  
6.24.1.3 Serious Adverse  Events  
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through 100 days of discontinuation of dosing must be reported to BMS Worldwide Safety, whether related or not related to study drug. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later protocol -specif ied procedure (e.g., a follow -up skin biopsy).  
 
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -
specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these aforementioned time periods, which is believed to be related to study drug or protocol - 
specified procedure.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its 
seriousness;  
 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.  
 
An appropriate SAE form (e.g. ex -US = CIOMS form or USA = Medwatch form) should be 
used to report SAEs to BMS. If you prefer to use your own Institutional form, it must be reviewed by BMS prior to study initiation. Note:  Please include the BMS Protocol number  on 
the SAE form or on the cover sheet with the SAE form  transmission.  
 
• The CIOMS form is available at:  http://www.ci oms.ch/index.php/cioms -form-i
 
 
• The MedWatch form is available at:  MedWatch 3500 Form  
 
The Sponsor will reconcile the clinical database AE cases ( case level only ) transmitted to 
BMS Global Pharmacovigilance ( Worldwide.Safety@bms.com ). 
 
• The Investigator will request from BMS GPV&E, aepbusinessprocess@bms.com the 
SAE reco nciliation report and include the BMS protocol number every 3 months and 
prior to data base lock or final data  summary  
 
• GPV&E will send the investigator the report to verify and confirm all SAEs have been transmitted to BMS  GPV&E.  
 
• The data elements listed on the GPV&E reconciliation report will be used for case 
identification purposes. If the Investigator determines a case was not transmitted to 
BMS GPV&E, the case should be sent immediately to BMS 
(Worldwide.Safety@bms.com
). 
 
In addition to the Sponsor Investigator’s responsibility to report events to their local HA, 
suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) shall be reported by BMS to the relevant competent health authorities in all concerned countries according to local regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
 
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify sponsor investigators of all reported SAEs that are suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the IB). An event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR). Sponsor investigator notification of these events will be in the form of either a SUSAR Report or a Semi -Annual SUSAR Report.  
 
• Other important findings which may be reported by BMS  as an Expedited Safety Report 
(ESR) include: increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant safety finding from a nonclinical (e.g., animal) study, important  safety

 recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or Sponsor Investigator, 
or BMS decision to end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety  reasons.  
 
• Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with the IB. Where required by local regulations or when there is a central IRB/IEC for the study, the Sponsor Investigator will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC  procedures for reporting any other 
safety  information.  
 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS within 24 hours \ 1 Business Day of becoming aware of the event. SAEs must be recorded on 
either CIOMS, MedWatch, or approved site SAE form.  
 
Pregnancies must be reported and submitted to BMS. BMS will perform due diligence follow -

If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours \ 1 Business Day 
to BMS using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report . 
 
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 
Non-Serious Adverse Event  
 
Non-serious Adverse Events (AE) are to be provided to BMS in aggregate via interim or final 
study reports as specified in the agreement or, if a regulatory requirement [eg, IND US trial] as part of an annual reporting requirement.  
 
Non-serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead- in 
period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.  
 
Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting 
 
The collection of non- serious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All non -
serious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected 
continuously during the treatment period and for a minimum of (100) da ys following the last 
dose of study treatment.  
 Adverse Events that are routinely collected according to GCP shall be submitted to BMS every three (3) months by the last working day of the third month.

The Adverse Event information required to be sent t o BMS is noted in the ‘Bristol -Myers 
Squibb Early Asset Investigator Sponsored Research (ISR) Import Plan’ which describes 
the method of collection and submission to BMS via the mailbox:  
MG-RD-GPVE-PHARMACOVIGILANCE@bms.com  
 
When the file is submitted to BMS, it must be noted the file contains All Non Serious 
Adverse Events (only adverse events not previously submitted to BMS within the 3 months) should be  reported.
 
Non-serious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious. Follow -up is also required for non- serious AEs that cause interruption or 
discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as appropriate.  
 
6.24.1.4 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI)  
Selected non- serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest 
(ECI) and must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor Investigator and the Sponsor Investigator will report within 24 hours (working days) to BMS Worldwide Safety.  
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial include:  
 
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must 
be reported as an SAE.  
 
Potential drug -induced liver injury  (DILI)  is defined as:  
 
ALT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
 
AND  
 
Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase)  
 
AND  
 
No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre- existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug (s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
 Whenever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs  meeting 
the defined criteria above must  be reported as serious adverse events (SAEs). See Section 
6.24.1.3  and Appendix 3 for reporting details.   
 
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study participant is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product

 exposure, including during at least 5 half -lives after product admi nistration, the investigational 
product will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for  participant).  
 
The investigator must immediately notify Worldwide.Safety@b ms.com of this event via either 
the CIOMS, MedWatch or appropriate Pregnancy Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed on 
the participant.  
*Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the CIOMS, MedWatch, BMS Pregnancy Surveillance Form, or approved site SAE form. A BMS 
Pregnancy  Surveillance Form may be provided upon request.  
 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. 
In order for Sponsor Investigator or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information 
from the female partner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.  
 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed unt il treatment 
allocation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that occurs to any patient must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor Investigator and the Sponsor Investigator will report within 24 hours (working days) to BMS Global Safety if it causes the patient to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to 
washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
 
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization through 100 days following 
cessation of treatment, or 30 days following cessation of treatment if the patient initiates new 
anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related  
to study drug, must be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Global Safety.  
 
6.25 Evaluating Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)  
 
AE Severity Grade  
 
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE Version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick  
_Reference_8.5x11.pdf  
 
Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have

 each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets.  
 
When specific adverse events are not listed in the CTCAE they will be graded by the 
investigator according to the following grades and definitions, consistent with the CTCAE Version 5.0.  
 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not  indicated.  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age - 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money,  etc. 
 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately l ife-threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL. Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not  bedridden  
 
• Grade 4: Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
 
Duration 
 
The investigator will record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than1 day, this will be indicated in the appropriate length of time in units.  
 
Action Taken  
 
Did the adverse event cause the trial treatment to be discontinued? 
Relationship  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for causal relationship 
to trial treatment/ trial  interventions.  
 
The determination of the likelihood that trial treatment caused the adverse event will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame.  
 
The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelih ood of a relationship between the trial treatment and the adverse event based upon 
the available information.  
 
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between trial treatment and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in 
UCSD Moores Cancer Center          HRPP# 181395  
Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date:

 number and/or intensity), the more likely the trial treatment caused the adverse event (AE):  
 
Exposure: Is there evidence that the patient was actually exposed to trial treatment such as: 
reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of trial treatment? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect?  
 
Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying 
disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors?  
 
Dechallenge: Was trial treatment discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? If yes, this is a positive dechallenge.  
If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
 
Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent dis ability;  
(2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the trial treatment; or (3) the trial is a 
single -dose drug trial); or (4) trial treatment is/are only used one time.  
 
Rechallenge: Was the patient re- exposed to trial treatment in this trial? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. 
If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
Note: If a rechallenge is planned for an adverse event which was serious and which may have 
been caused by either of the trial treatments, or if re-exposure to trial treatment poses 
additional potential significant risk to the patient, then the rechallenge must be approved in advance by the Sponsor Investigator as per dose modification guidelines in the protocol.  
 
Consistency with Trial Treatment Profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding trial treatment or drug class pharmacology or toxicology?

7.3 Returns and Reconciliation  
Upon completion or termination of the trial, all unused and/or partially used Investigational Product will be destroyed at the site per institutional policy. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable federal, state, local and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.  
 
8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 Trial Design  
This is an open label  single arm  clinical trial compared against historical response rates .   
 A Simon’s optimal two -stage design will be used for this study. Up to  15 subjects will be 
accrued and treated with Nivolumab + cabiralizumab + gemcitabine. The primary endpoint is the proportion who are progression free at 6 months (PFS6) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
 
33 Based on no maintenance after best response to prior chemotherapy 8, historical controls 
treated with gemcitabine alone had only 4% of patients with no progression at 6 months. If the PFS6 rate in this study is ≤4%, we will consider the treatment as not m eeting the threshold of 
further  consideration. We will test the null hypothesis H
0: p≤ 4% against  the alternative 
hypothesis H 1: p>22%, where p is the progression free response rate after six months of study 
treatment. The two -stage design proposed below will have 80% power to reject  the null 
hypothesis at 10% significance level and conclude that the true PFS rate at 6 months is above 
4%, if the observed PFS6 rate is ≥22%. The study design is described in detail is as follows:  
 
Stage 1:  8 subjects will be treated; if needed, accrual will be held until the progression results 
for these subjects are known for the first six months. The trial will be terminated at Stage 1 if  
none of the 8 subjects are progression free at 6 months ; otherwise it will continue to S tage 2.

Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date: 
12/11/2018  76 
CONFIDENTIAL   
 Stage 2: 7 more patients will be accrued. We will reject the therapy if, among all the 15 (8+7) 
subjects, the number of patients who have a PFS6 response is ≤1; if ≥2 patients are 
progression free at 6 months  by RECIST 1.1, the treatment will be claimed to be successful. 
We will conclude that the study treatment is associated with a progression free response in 
more than 4% of patients at 6 months.   
 Note that if a patient is not evaluable at 6 months (e.g., if there is an early dropout), as specif ied 
in section 8.2.5, it will be treated as disease progression for the primary efficacy outcome .   
 Early stopping probability: Under this design, if the null hypothesis is true, the probability of 
stopping the trial early will be 72.1%. The sample size calculation was done using PASS version 14.0.3 (released September 22, 2015). Sample size calculation did not incorporate the safety endpoint. Statistics for safety outcomes will be presented descriptively.   
 We expect to accrue 1- 2 patients every month. All patients will be accrued within  14-21 
months . Patients will be followed for 6 months. The total duration of this study will be about 
20-27 months . 
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis  Plan 
 
8.2.1 Analysis of primary endpoint  
 
Primary efficacy analysis includes interim efficacy analysis and final efficacy analysis  for the primary 
endpoint .  
  
The interim efficacy analysis will be conducted at the end of Stage 1. The study enrollment  will be put on 
hold for interim analysis  until tumor response results for Stage 1 patients are known. 
 The final efficacy analysis will calculate the UMVUE estimate  of PFS at 6 months , p-value and 95% CI 
for progression free response rates.
39, 40 The calculation will be performed using R clinfun  package 
(www.r -project.org ).  
 
 
8.2.2 Analysis of the Conduct of the  Trial 
 
Enrollment, major protocol violations, and discontinuations for the trial will be summarized 
using a CONSORT diagram.  
 
8.2.3 Analysis of Patient  Characteristics  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, race, BSA, duration of pancreatic cancer, site(s) of metastatic disease, prior cancer treatment, and baseline ECOG performance status will be summarized using medians (range) for continuous variables and proportions for 
categorical variables.  
 
8.2.4 Analysis of Study Treatment Administration  
 
Study treatments dose administration will be listed and dose modifications will be flagged.

8.2.5 Definition of study population for primary efficacy analysis  
 
All subjects who undergo at least one dose of the study treatment will be included in the 
analysis. For the primary endpoint,  “Intention- to-treat” analyses will be performed for an 
endpoint. To be specific, if the endpoints for a subject cannot be assessed (for example, a 
subject drops out early prior to the 6 months assessments due to any reason), it will be considered to be an event that does not favou r the study therapy (e.g., disease progression 
for the primary outcome).   
 
 
8.2.6 Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
 
 
8.2.6.1  Safety  Analys es 
 
This study can also be stopped early due to safety reasons, please refer to section 4.6 for more details.  
 
Safety analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study 
treatment. The proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events, 
and treatment delays will be summarized. Tolerability will be assessed based on dosage 
delays and discontinuation due to adverse events.   
 
All AEs will be listed, documenting the course, outcome, severity, and relationship to the study 
treatment. Incidence rates of AEs and the proportion of subjects prematurely withdrawn from 
the study due to AEs will be shown.   
 
8.2.6.2   Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy analysis will be performed for outcomes including progression free survival 
over the course of the study, duration of response, disease control rate and overall survival. 
For survival outcomes  including overall survival , median survival times together with their 95% 
confidence intervals will be estimated with the Kaplan- Meier method, and report number of 
events. For proportions, a 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the exact method.  
 
 
8.2.7 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
8.2.7.1 Comparison of RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST  criteria  
Given that both nivolumab and cabiralizumab are immunotherapy agents, disease progression will be defined by RECIST and iRE CIST criteria (Appendix 5). Proportion of progression- free 
patients at 6 months using iRECIST will be performed using the same method as for the 
primary endpoint of RECIST 1.1. Cross tables of response categories from the two criteria will 
be presented. Number and proportion of patients who are considered to be PFS based on 
RECIST but a non- response based on iRECIST  (and vice versa) will be described.  
 Tumour and blood samples will be collected pre- treatment and during treatment. These 
biomarker assessments will potentially aid in understanding treatment efficacy. All samples will be linked anonymised and only identified by the trial ID and unique sample number

 allocated by the trial coordinating team. The results of any exploratory analysis will not be 
included in the clinical study report and may be reported separately from the main study results. Association between a biomarker and a response outcome will be assessed using 
Cox models. The stage (1 vs 2) variable will be included as a covariate.

that the investigation is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
 
The monitor will complete a written monitoring report and provide to the Sponsor Investigator. The report will include a summary of what the site monitor reviewed and the site monitor’s 
statements concerning the significant findings/facts, deviations and deficiencies, conclusions, actions taken or to be taken, and/or actions recommended to ensure compliance. The site Principal Investigator will be expected to submit any Corrective Action Plans, in writing, to the Sponsor Investigator. A copy of the monitoring forms, final monitoring reports, and Corrective Action Plan will be kept in the site monitor’s trial file follow up at the next monitoring  session. 
 
9.9.2 Data Safety  Monitoring  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring/Auditing  
 
Data and Safety reporting will be supported by the study statisticians according to the monitoring plan. Briefly, comprehensive safety and data monitoring reports will be generated

 every six months  for review by the study team before being sent to the UCSD DSMC, 
described below. The study will used the VELOS electronic data capture system at UCSD.  
 
In addition to adverse event monitoring and clinical oversight by the principal investigator 
and co- investigators, this study will also use the UCSD Moores Cancer Center Data Safety 
and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) to provide oversight in the event that this treatment approach leads to unforeseen toxicities. Data from this study will be reported semi -annual ly 
and will include:  
1) the protocol title, IRB protocol number, and the activation date of the  study.  
2) the number of patients enrolled to date 
3) the dates of patient  enrollment  
4) demographic summary of  patients  
5) a summary of safety including all death, and adverse events regardless of grade and 
attribution  
6) a response evaluation for evaluable patients when available  
7) a summary of any recent literature that may affect the ethics of the study.  
 
9.10 Data  Management  
9.10.1 Case Report Forms  
 
All the clinical data will be captured by the site on electronic case report forms (eCRFs).   The eCRFs will be used for all consented patients. The investigator and trained trial personnel will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure ide ntification and password 
requirement. A complete electronic audit trial will be maintained. The investigator will be required to provide approval of all data to confirm accuracy.  Copies of the eCRFs  will be provided to the investigator at the conclusion of the  trial. 
 
9.10.2 Source  Documents  
 
Source documents serve as the evidence of the existence of the patient and the data collected 
for this trial. Source documents will be the responsibility of the Investigator and will be filed at 
the site and available as needed by the Sponsor Investigator or assigned clinical monitor.  
 
Data captured on the eCRF is to be transcribed from source document and must be consistent with any discrepancies explained and documented.

 Appendix 5 – Protocol Criteria for Measurement of Trial Endpoint RECIST 
1.1 and iRECIST 
 
1. Definitions  
 
1.1. Evaluable for adverse events . All patients will be evaluable for adverse event evaluation 
from the time of their first  treatment.  
 
1.2. Evaluable for response . All patients who have received at least one cycle of therapy and 
have their disease re- evaluated will  be considered evaluable for response (exceptions 
will be those who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 who 
will also be considered evaluable). Patients on therapy for at least this period and who meet the other listed criteria will have their response classified according to the definitions set out  below.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised international criteria (1.1) proposed by the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours ) 
committee as well as the modified iRECIST guidelines. Investigators should note the different requirements for confirmatory scans as well as follow up for the two criteria.  
 
See section 6.1.2.6 for criteria for continuing treatment past RECIST 1.1 diseas e 
progression.  
 
2. RECIST 1.1 Response and Evaluation Endpoints  
 
2.1. Measurable Disease. Measurable tumour lesions (nodal, subcutaneous, lung 
parenchyma, solid organ metastases) are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm with chest x -ray and as ≥10 mm with CT scan or clinical examination. Bone lesions are 
considered measurable only if assessed by CT scan and have an identifiable soft tissue 
component that meets these requirements (soft  tissue component ≥10 mm by CT scan). 
Malignant lymph nodes must be ≥15 mm in the short axis to be considered measurable; only the short axis will be measured and followed. All tumour measurements must be recorded in millimetres (or decimal fractions of centimetres). Previously irradiated lesions are not considered measurable unless progression has been documented in the lesion.  
 
2.2. Non-measurable Disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
are considered non- measurable disease. Bone lesions without a measurable soft tissue 
component, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of lung or skin and abdominal masses followed by clinical examination are all non- measurable. Lesions 
in previously irradiated areas are non- measurable, unless progression has been  
demonstrated.  
 
2.3. Target Lesions . When more than one measurable tumour lesion is present at baseline 
all lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved  organs  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and will be

Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date:

CONFIDENTIAL   
 recorded  and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurement s. Note that pathological nodes must meet the criterion of a short axis of  
≥15 mm by CT scan and only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but <15 mm) should be consid ered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-
pathological and should not be recorded or followed (see 8.2.4). At baseline, the sum of the target lesions (longest diameter of tumour lesions plus short axis of lymph nodes: overall maximum of 5) is to be recorded.  
 
After baseline, a value should be provided on the CRF for all identified target lesions for each assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint lesions cannot be accurately measured but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too small to measure and indeed are believed to be absent, a default value of 0 mm may be used.  
 
2.4. Non-target Lesions . All non -measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measurable 
lesion s over and above those listed as target lesions are considered non- target lesions. 
Measurements are not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as “present” or  “absent”.  
 
2.5. Response. 
 
All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE from the start of study treatment until the 
end of treatment classified as outlined below:  
 
Complete Response  (CR): disappearance of target and non- target lesions and 
normalization of tumour markers. Pathological lymph nodes must have short axis measures <10 mm (Note: continue to record the measurement even if <10 mm and 
considered CR). Residual lesions (other than nodes <10 mm) thought to be non- malignant should be further investigated (by cytology specialized imaging or other 
techniques as appropriate for individual cases4 before CR can be accepted. Confirmation 
of response is only required in non- randomised studies.  
 
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of measures (longest diameter 
for tumour lesions and short axis measure for nodes) of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum of diameters. Non target lesions must be non- PD. Confirmation of 
response is only required in non- randomised studies.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured 
lesions taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded on study (including baseline) AND an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. Appearance of new lesions will also constitute progressive disease (including lesions in previously unassessed areas). In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression of  non-

 target disease may be accepted as evidence of disease progression, where the overall 
tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of treatment or where the tumour burden appears to have increased by at least 73% in volume. Modest increases in the size of one or more non- target lesions are NOT considered unequivocal 
progression. If the evidence of PD is equivocal (target or non- target), treatment may 
continue until the next assessment, but if confirmed, the earlier date must be  used.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”. This is a reason for stopping therapy, but is NOT objective PD. 
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
*Investigators should record all new lesions; if the new  lesion is felt to be equivocal, treatment may 
be continued pending further assessments – see table S2.  
 
3. iRECIST Response  Assessment 
 
Overall response will also be assessed using iRECIST. Immunotherapeutics may result 
in infiltration of immune cells leading to transient increase in the size in malignant lesions, or undetectable lesions becoming detectable. The criteria are identical to those of RECIST 1.1 in many respects but have been adapted to account for instances where an increase in tumour burden, or  the appearance of new lesions, does not reflect true

 tumour progression.  
 
Key differences are described below. All responses defined using iRECIST criteria are 
designated with a prefix. iRECIST  time-point and best overall responses will be recorded  
separately.  
 
3.1. Confirming  Progression 
 
Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses the terms iUPD (unconfirmed progression) and iCPD (confirmed progression). Confirmator y scans 
should be performed at least 4 weeks, but no longer than 8 weeks after iUPD.  
 
iCPD is confirmed if further increase in tumour burden, compared to the last assessment, is seen as evidenced by one or more of the following:  
 
• Continued increase in tumour burden (from iUPD) where RECIST 1.1 definitions of progression had been met (from nadir) in target, non- target disease or new  lesions  
 
o Progression in target disease worsens with an increase of at least 5 mm in the 
absolute value of the sum 
 
o Continued unequivocal progression in non- target disease with an increase in 
tumour  burden  
 
o Increase in size of previously identified new lesion (s) (an increase of at least 5 
mm in the absolute value of the sum of those considered to be target new lesions) or additional new  lesions.  
 
• RECIST 1.1 criteria are met in lesions types (target  or  non- target  or  new lesions) 
where progression was not previously identified, including  the appearance of 
additional new  lesions.  
 
If iUPD is not confirmed at the next assessment, then the appropriate response will be 
assigned (iUPD if the criteria are still met, but no worsening, or iSD, iPR or iCR if those criteria are met compared to baseline). As can be seen in table 2, the prior documentation of iUPD does not preclude assigni ng iCR, iPR, or iSD in subsequent time -point 
assessments or as best overall response (BOR) providing that iCPD is not documented at the next assessment after iUPD.  
 
3.2. New lesions  
 
New lesions should be assessed and measured as they appear using RECIST 1.1 cr iteria 
(maximum of 5 lesions, no more than 2 per site, at least 10 mm in long axis (or 15 mm in short axis for nodal lesions), and recorded as New Lesions -Target (NLT) and New 
Lesion- Non-Target (NLNT) to allow clear differentiation from baseline target and non-
target lesions.

CONFIDENTIAL   
 New lesions may either meet the criteria of NLT or NLNT to drive iUPD (or iCPD). 
However, the measurements of target lesions should NOT be included in the sum of measures of original target lesions identified at baseline. Rather, these measurements will be collected on a separate table in the case record form.  
 
PD is confirmed in the New Lesion category if the next imaging assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but not more than 8 weeks) after iUPD confirms further progression from iUPD with either an increase of at least 5 mm in the absolute value of the sum of NLT OR an increase (but not necessarily unequivocal increase) in the size of NLNT lesions OR the appearance of additional new lesions.

5. Response and Stable Disease Duration (RECIST 1.1 and  iRECIST)  
 
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR or 
iCR/iPR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as  reference the smallest 
measurements recorded on study (including baseline).  
 
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including  
baseline).  
 
6. Methods of  Measurement  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Assessments should 
be identified on a calendar schedule and should not be affected  by delays in therapy. While on study, all lesions recorded at baseline should have their actual  measurements  
recorded  at each  subsequent  evaluation,  even when very small

Protocol Version: 4.2 Protocol Date:

CONFIDENTIAL   
 (e.g. 2 mm). If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned. For lesions which fragment/split add together the longest diameters of the fragmented portions; for lesions which coalesce, measure the maximal longest  diameter for the “merged  lesion”.  
 
6.1. Clinical Lesions.  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and ≥10 mm as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by colour photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended. If feasible, imaging is  preferred.  
 
6.2. Chest X -ray. Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions ≥20 mm on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
 
6.3. CT, MRI.  CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). Other specialized imaging or other techniques may also be appropriate for 
individual case.4 For example, while PET scans are not considered adequate to measure 
lesions, PET -CT scans may be used providing that the measures are obtained from the 
CT s can and the CT scan is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and 
oral contrast). PET scans per PI  discretion.  
 
6.4. Ultrasound.  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. If new  lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of 
the study, confirmation by CT is  advised.  
 
6.5. Endoscopy, Laparoscopy.  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumour 
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pa thological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
6.6. Tumour Markers . Tumour markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumour 
response. If  markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  
 
6.7. Cytology, Histology.  These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR 
in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic  
origin  of any effusion  that appears  or worsens  during  treatment  when  the

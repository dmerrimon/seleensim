LY29517423.Revision History
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP)Versi on 1 was approved on 18 December 2014. 
Statistical Analysis PlanVersion 2 was approved prior to fi rst pati ent visi tand any unblinding.  
The overall changes and rationale for the changes incorporated in Versio n 2 are as fo llows:
The electroni c pat ient reported outcome ( ePRO) diary  will now collect the average 
durati on and average pain for the time period rather than fo r each attack.  Thus the 
derivat ion for mean severi tyand m ean durat ionofcluster headache attack were updated.
The approach for missing data was updated for each weekly interval .
o1) If there are l ess than or equal to 3 day s with nonmissing answer to cl uster 
headache attack frequency in the weekly interval; or 2) the primary efficacy  
compliance rate is l ess than or equal  to 50%, then the weekly interval will be 
considered missing; 
oOtherwi se, 1) if there are greater than or equal to 4 day s with nonmissing answer 
to cluster headache attack frequency in the weekly interval; and 2) the primary  
efficacy  com pliance rate i s greater than 50%, then the average number of cluster 
headache attacks across the nonmissing days will be used to impute the mi ssing 
days.
The al gorithm for pooling of si tes was updated.
The primary  endpoint point estimate was updated to use the unadjusted estimate, and the 
median unbiased est imate will be used for sensit ivity.
ePRO di ary com pliance was updated to calculate both e PRO diary primary efficacy 
compliance rate and overall ePRO diary  com pliance rate.
Addit ion of a nalysis for change fro m baseline in total weekly  dose of sumatri ptan Sc, 
sumatri ptan nasal spray ,and zo lmitriptan nasal spray separately as well as co mbined.
Statistical Analysis Plan Versio n 3 was approved prior to IA1.  The changes incorporated in 
Versi on 3 are as follows:
Posttreatm ent follow-up phase safet y analyses will have only 1 baseline.
A sect ion on protocol vio lations to be ident ified was added.
Sensit ivity analyses were updated, to be consistent with other Phase 3 studies of 
LY2951742.
Infections sect ion will only  deal  with upper respi ratory  tract infect ions; analyses were 
modified to be consistent with other Phase 3 studies of LY2951742 .
For Columbia -Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C-SSRS ), 1 bullet was split into 2 to 
enhance readabilit y, and baseline definit ion for improvem ent from baseline analysis was 
clarified.
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 7
LY2951742Criteria for sustained elevat ion in diastolic blood pressure was changed to be con sistent 
with the single timepoint analysis .
An addit ional criteria threshol d for QTc increase was added.
Analyses of elevat ions in hepat ic laboratory  tests were cl arified, and an addit ional subset 
was added.
Immunogenicit y analyses were updated to be cons istent wi th other Phase 3 studies of 
LY2951742.
An addit ional subgroup analysis category , for age, was added.
Some minor corrections and clarificat ions were made.
Statistical Analysis Plan Versio n 4 was approved after the last patient was randomized and pr ior 
to interim analysis ( the first and final assessment of primary  efficacy  endpoint after all pat ients 
completed doubl e-blind phase, which is the first unblinding to study  team ).  Enrollment in the 
trial was terminated (due to enrollment infeasibilit y) pr ior to reaching the sample size target for 
the originally  planned interim  analysis.  Therefore, t he  planned interim analysis for sam ple size 
re-estimat ion didnot occur. 
In the SAP V ersion 4, the updates were made mainly for incorporating the recent learnings fro m 
migraine data or for consistency across the galcanezumab program .  The changes incorporated in 
Versi on 4 of the SAP are summarized as fo llows:
LY2951742 was replaced by galcanezumab in the body  of the SAP.
Consistent with the primary  endpoint and analysis methodology  for the pivotal  migraine 
studi es, the primary  endpoint was updated to be the overall treatment effect over the 
Weeks 1 to 3 duri ng the double -blind treatment phase, rather than the treatment effect at 
the single time po int, Week 3. 
In Section 5.4.1.2 , the exploratory  endpoints for severit y and durati on of  cluster hea dache 
attack pain and for the abortive medicat ionswere updated to clarify  the research 
questions and the derivations were modified correspondingly. 
In Section
 5.5.1.1 and 5.5.8.3 , it was clarified that, for other secondary  and exploratory  
efficacy  measures that are not derived from cluster headache frequency , the baseline 
average daily  cluster headache attack frequenc y category  variable is included in the 
statist ical analysis models. 
The list of analyses for other secondary  and expl oratory  efficacy variables were updated 
in Table CGAL. 5.3.  L ast observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF) analysis for some 
exploratory  variables was rem oved.
Since no partially co mpleted di ary can be submi tted, the ePRO diary  primary  efficacy 
compliance and overall ePRO diary  com pliance are combined into 1 diary compliance 
calculat ion in Section
 5.5.6 .
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 8
LY2951742In Section 5.5.1 and Table CGA L.5.2, safety  populati on and m odal treatm ent descri ption 
for SP III were added for safet y analyses since it is more appropriate to present safety  
resul ts by the actual treatments patients received
.
Termino logies and ident ificat ion criteria were updated for adverse event of special 
interest ( AESIs )for the consistency across the galcanezumab program.
In Section 5.5.9.1.3 , detailed baseline and postbaseline definit ion for vital signs and 
weight were added .  The patient populat ions for analysis that do not satisfy treatment-
emergent definit ion were removed fro m Table CGA L
.5.4.  
In Section
 5.5.9.1.4 , the parameter of large clinical trial populati on based QT correcti on 
(QTcLCTPB) was removed for electrocardi ogram  (ECG )analysis.  The detailed baseline 
and postbaseline definit ionsfor ECG were added.
In Section 5.5.9.2 , for continuous safet y measures, Box -whisker plots with summary 
tables for SP III replaced LOCF and repeated measures analysis.
Secti on5.5.9.1.6 of Imm unogenici tywas updated to clarify defini tions and m odify  
analyses to focus on evaluat ion of the incidence o f baseline anti
-drug ant ibodies ( ADA )
and treatment -emergent ADA .
Subgroup analysis for safet y endpo ints were removed due to the small size of the study .  
A few subgroup variables for the efficacy  endpoint were removed due to the small size in 
subgroups.
Secti on 5.6,Interim Analysis is updated to explain the changes in the interim analysis 
plan.
Since the originally  planned interim analysis for sample size re -estimation will not be 
conducted due to enrollment infeasibilit y, all languages and m ethodol ogy descripti ons 
related to sam ple size increase are removed.
In Section
 5.8, reports to be gene rated were updated to reflect that analyses fro m all SPs
specified in this SAP will be performed at the interim analysis instead of only performing 
analyses for SP III .  However, the analyses conducted for SP III will be deemed final 
since all pat ients wil l complete SP III at the interim analysis .  The analyses using data 
from SP IV will be rerun and updated when the completed data are available at the final 
database lock.
An appendix o f important protocol deviations was added.
Other minor corrections, modi fications,and clarifications were made.
Statistical Analysis Plan Versio n 5 has been approved prior to theinterim analysis (the first and 
final assessment of primary efficacy  endpoint after all pat ients com pleted doubl e-blind phase, 
which is the first un blinding to study  team ).  There i s no m odificati on to the primary analysis 
methodol ogies for the primary , key  secondary , and other secondary  efficacy  endpoints.  The 
changes incorporated in Version 5 are summarized as fo llows:
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 9
LY2951742In Section 5.4.1.2 , the exploratory endpo int for cluster headache attack duration was 
modified fro m “average weekly cluster headache attack minutes per attack for the 
remaining cluster headache days” to “weekly  total  cluster headache attack duration .”An 
exploratory  responder endpoint for the weekly total cluster headache attack durati on that 
is defined as 30% or greater reduction is also added.
In Section 5.5.9.1.2 , removed the requirement of needing at least 4 events occurred in at 
least one treatment to display p -value.
In
 Table CGA L.5.4, added addit ional pat ient populations for analysis o f treatm ent-
emergent , potenti ally clinically significant changes and sustained elevat ionin 
vital signs.   
In Section 5.5.10 ,additional subgroup variables were added for subgroup analysis.
In the tabl e of Descript ion of Im portant Protocol  Deviat ionsin Appendix 1 , updated the 
data source of the Important Protocol  Deviat ions (IPDs )to only  display  the final data 
source for the IPD analysis. Two new IPDs were added.

LY29517425.A Priori Statistical Methods
5.1. Study Design
Study  CGAL is a Phase 3 m ulti-center, outpati ent, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controll ed 
study  of LY2951742 300 m g  in the prevent ionof episodic cl uster headache .  The study  has 4
study  phases (SP): SP I (screening/washout), SP II ( pre-randomization diary ), SP III
(randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled treatment ), and SP IV (post -treatm ent follow-up). 
Patients who discont inue the study during the double -blind treatment phase shoul d enter the 
post-treatm ent follow-up phase .
5.2. Determination of Sample Size
The study  is planned to have a minimum of approximately  162 pati ents randomized 1:1 to 
placebo or galcanezumab 300 mgwith the opportunit y to increase the final sample size at an 
interim analysis if indicated in order to maintain a well -powered study . To preserve blinding, 
details o f the sam ple size and power calculations are omitted from this SAPand are provided in a 
separate document to the Ethical Review Board (ERB).
5.3. Randomization and Treatment Assignment
At Visit 3, eligible pat ients will be rando mize d in a 1:1 ratio to double -blind placebo or 
galcanezumab 300 m g(GMB 300mg) ,respectively.  To achieve marginal balance o f treatm ent 
assignments for the factors of gender, average daily attack frequency ( ≤4 attacks per day , >4 
attacks per day ) and invest igative site, rando mizat ion will be conducted with a dynamic 
allocat ion (minimizat ion) method (Pocock and Simo n 1975) with target probabilit y of 0.8. 
Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer -generated random sequence 
using an interacti ve web- response system (IWRS ). 
5.4. Endpoints
5.4.1. Efficacy Endpoint
5.4.1.1. Cluster Headache Attack Primary Endpoint
Patient-Rated Daily Electronic Patient-Reported Outcom e (ePRO) Diary: Patients will beasked 
to record the number of cluster headache attacks in their daily  ePRO di ary during SP II and SP 
III, whi ch is used to derive the primary efficacy  endpoint . Inform ation regarding abortive 
medicat ion use, cluster headache attack duration on average , and cluster headache attack pain 
severit y on average will also b e recorded.   Pain severit y will be rated using a 5 -point pain scale, 
where 0=no pain , 1=mild pain, 2=m oderate pain, 3=severe pain, and 4=very severe pain (The 
Sumatriptan Cluster Headache Study  Group 1991 ).  Pati ents shoul d record all cluster attacks 
regardl ess of attack duration.
5.4.1.2. Derived Variables for Cluster Headache Attacks
In Study  CGAL ,for primary  measure of cluster headache attacks , the daily  data for each pat ient 
(including last 7 day s in the eligibilit y report [prerando mizat ion diary  phase ], 8weeks of daily 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 13
LY2951742data during treatment ) will be converted into 9 roughly 7-calendar day intervals : the baseline 7-
dayinterval ,
Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7,and 8 .  Each day , the pati ent m ay report zero, 1,or multiple 
cluster headache attacks .  Any ePRO diary data reported bey ond the protocol  defined co llection 
period will not be used for statist ical analysis .
The approach to split the postbaseline data into weekly interval sis done as fo llows:
Firstly, postbaseline daily data will be split into Weeks 1to 4 versus Weeks 5to 8 using 
1stand 2 ndinject ion date. All data ≥ 1stinject ion date and <2 ndinject ion date will be 
considered as Weeks
1to 4; all data ≥2nd inject ion date and < treatment phase 
disposi tion date will be considered as 
Weeks 5to 8. If 2ndinject ion date is missing, then 
all the data before treatment phase disposit ion date will be put into Weeks 1to 4.
Secondly, data within Weeks1, 2, and 3 will be determ ined using calendar day s. In other 
words, the 1stinjection date will be considered as Day 1, then Days1 to 7 will be 
Week1; Days8 to 14 will be Week 2; Days15 to 21 will be Week 3. Week 4 will 
include all the data fro m Day 22 to the date before the 2ndinject ion (or before the 
treatm ent phase disposit ion date if second inject ion date is missing).
Thirdly, if the 2ndinject ion date is not missing, the data within Weeks5, 6, 7, and 8 will 
be determined using calendar day s.In other words, the 2 ndinjection date will be 
considered as Day 1, then Days1 to 7 will be Week 5; Days8 to 14 will be Week 6; 
Days15 to 21 will be Week 7. Week 8 will include all the data fro m Day 22 to the date 
before the treatment phase disposit ion date.
For each weekly inte rval, the f ollowing missing data imputation method will be used:
1) if there are less than or equal to 3 days with nonmissing answer to cluster headache 
attack frequency in the weekly  interval; or 2) the diary compliance rate i s less than or 
equal  to 50%, then the weekly interval will be considered missing; 
Otherwi se, 1) if there are greater than or equal to 4 day swith nonmissing answer to 
cluster headache attack frequency in the weekly  interval; and 2) the diarycompliance 
rate is greater than 50%, then the average number of cluster headache attacks across the 
nonmissing days will be used to impute the missing day s.  
Furtherm ore, the total  cluster 
headache attack frequency during the weekly  interval will be calcu lated as the average 
number of cluster headache attacks across nonmissing days times the actual number of 
calendar day s within each weekly  interval .
The same missing data imputation approach will also be applied to secondary and exploratory  
efficacy  measur es that are derived from ePRO data.
Then to estimate a weekly  outcom e of the total frequency for an efficacy measure fro m ePRO 
diary, the data wi thin each week will be adjusted to a 7 -day interval by  multiplying .
 , where “x” 
is the actual number of calen dar days wi thin each weekly interval.  Last ly, the change fro m

Gated secondary , other secondary ,and exploratory efficacy measures will be derived for each 
patient for each 7 -day interval as follows:
A 30 %, 50%, 75% ,and 100% responder is defined as any patient who has a ≥30%, 
≥50%, ≥75% ,and =100% reduction in the number of cluster headache attacks in a 7 -
day interval relat ive to baseline interval.  For 30%, 50%, 75% ,and 100% responder 
definit ion, percentage reduction from baseline will be calculated as follows:
100×(−1)X(weeklyofclusterheadache attacksatweekX−
weeklyofclusterheadache attacksatbaseline Interval)
weekly#ofclusterheadache attacksatbaselineinterval
Change from baseline for the re maining cluster headache attack days :
oChange from baseline in the cluster headache attack average weekly  pain severi ty 
for the rem aining cluster headache attack day s will be derived at each weekly  
interval  through Week 8 .  For the cal culat ion of mean severit yof cluster headache
attack s, severi tyhas 5categori es: 0=no pain , 1=mild pain, 2=m oderate pain, 
3=severe pain, and 4=very severe pain.  The mean severit y for the rem aining 
cluster headache attack days for each interval will be calculated as follows: 
Sumofaverageclusterheadache severityperdayduringtheinterval

I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 15
LY2951742If there is zero cluster headache attack within the weekly interval, then the mean 
severit y of cluster headache attack for that interval will be considered not applicable 
hence missing at the interval for analyses purpose.
Change from baseline in weekly  total  cluster headache attack duration will becalculated
for each weekly interval . Average duration of cluster headache attacks during a 24 -hour 
period was aske d in the ePRO diary . Patients were instructed to round up to the next 
durati on select ion with following choi ces: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 
hours, >3 hours. If the duration is >3 hours, then 4 hours will be imputed for the 
calculat ion of the total  cluster headache attack duration. The total cluster headache attack
durati on for each interval will be calculated as the summat ion of the average duration of 
cluster headache attack multiplied by the number of cluster headache attacks in the day
during the interval.  If the total duration is more than 24 hours for a day , it will be set to 
24hours.
The proporti on of  patients wi th a 30% or greater reduction fro m baseline in the weekly

5.4.1.3. Patient Global Impression of Improvement Endpoint
The PGI-Irequests patients to mark the box that best describes theircluster headache condit ion 
since theystarted taki ng this medicine.   The opti ons in the displayed boxes are represented on a 
7-point scale ,with 1=very  much better and 7=very much worse (Guy 1976).
The patient -reported PGI-I information will be captured at office visits. If the PGI -I collect ion 
date i s greater than 10 days from the visit date, the record will not be used for analysis.
5.4.2. Safety Endpoints

5.5. Statistical Anal yses
The protocol for this study  was approved on 18 Dec ember 2014.  P rotocol amendment (a) for 
this study  was approved on 12February 2015. P rotocol amendment (b) for this study  was 
approved on 22December 2015.  P rotocol amendment ( c) for this study  was approved on
10February 2017.   The SAP Versio n 4 supersedes the statist ical plans described in the protocol
and previous versio ns of the SAP .  
5.5.1. Genera l Considerations
General aspects of statist ical analyses are described below.
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy  analyses during SP III will be conducted on an intent -to-
treat (ITT) population ,which include all patients who are randomized and receive at least 1
dose of study  drug. Patients in the ITTpopulat ion will be analyzed according to the treatment 
group that they  were randomized to. Safet y analyses during SP III will be conducted on the 
safety population ,which also includes all patients who are randomized and receive at least 1 
dose of study  drug.  However, patients will be analyzed by  actual  study  treatm ent received m ost 
often (modal treatm ent) during the double -blind treatment phase.   Mo dal treatm ent will be the 
same as rando mized treatment except in so me cases of incorrect treatment administration .  When 
mean change fro m baseline is assessed, the patient will be included in the analysis only if he or 
she has a baseline and a postbaseline measurement.
Unless otherwise specified, for analyses of posttreatm ent phase, the posttreatment population
will be used.  Posttreatment population will be defined as all pat ients who entered the post -
treatm ent phase ( SPIV) as indicated by entering any posttreatment visit .
Statistical analysis will be carried out for the 8-week treatment phase ( SPIII), the 16-week post
treatm entphase ( SPIV) as well as the 8-week treatment and 16-week post treatment phase s
combined ( SPIII/IV) as listed in
 Table CGA L.5.2 .
Safety analyses (Section 5.5.9 )in SP III and SP IV and analyses for exposure will be conducted
based on the modal treatment group patients have received (p lacebo orGMB 300 m g).  For 
determining modal treatm ent, if there a re 2 m odes, then the modal treatm ent group will be 
GMB 300mg.
Unless otherwise specified, f or the analyses in SP IV al one, no stati stical co mpar isons between 
any treatment groups will be conducted.
CCI
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 18
LY2951742Since cluster headache attack informat ion collected throug h ePRO swill only be collected for 
SPIII,analyses o f ePRO data will be conducted at SPIII only.
Treatment effects will be evaluated based on a 2 -sided significance level o f 0.05 for all the other 
efficacy  and safety  analyses. The 95% confidence intervals for the difference in least -square 
means (LSMeans) between treatment groups will be presented. Adjustments for multiple 
comparisons for the analyses corresponding to the primary  and gated secondary  objectives are 
described in the sect ions on the primary and secondary  efficacy analyses below. T here will be 
no adj ustments for mult iplicit y for analyses of other data .  
A repeated measures analysis refers to a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based, mixed -
effects repeated measures (MMRM) analysi s using all the longitudinal observat ions at each 
postbaseline visit /week .
Categorical co mpar isons between treatment groups for safet y measures will be performed using 
Fisher ’s exact tests, where appropriate.
Any change to the data analysis methods describ ed in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data an alysis 
methods described in the protocol , and the j ustification for making the changes, will be described 
in the SAPand/or in the clinical study report (CSR) . 
Addit ional exploratory  analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate .
Statistical analysis o f this study  will be the responsibilit y of Eli Lilly and Com pany  (Lilly) or 
designee. SAS®software will be used to perform most or all statist ical analyses.
5.5.1.1. Adjustments for Covariates
The repeated measures models will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, gender,
pooled invest igative site, visit /week , and treatm ent-by-visit/week interacti on, as well as the 
continuous, fixed covariates of baseline value .  Rules for pooling of invest igative sites are 
described in Section 5.5.1.3 . Note, in repeated measures analysis, visit will be used for measures 
collected at visit interval, while week will be used for all the ePRO data .
When an ANOVA model is used to analyze a continuous efficacy variable, the m odel will 
contain the main effects of treatment , gender and pooled invest igative site, and appropriate 
baseline value included as a covariate. 
The categorical, pseudo -likelihood -based repeated measures models for the visit wise /week wise
binary  outcom es of  response will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, gender, 
visit/week , and treatm ent-by-visit/week interacti on, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of 
baseline value .  Pooled invest igative site was not included in the model in order to increase the 
likelihoo d of convergence .
With the exception o f efficacy  analyses on cluster headache attack frequency or categori cal 
analysis of response rate (such as 50% response rate) derived fro m cluster headache attack
frequency where the conti nuous value of baseline weekly cluster headache frequency will be 
used as covariate, all other efficacy analyses will include baseline average daily  cluster headache 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 19
LY2951742attack frequency category  (≤4vs.>4) as a covariate in the MMRM ,GLIMMIX ,and ANOVA
model.
5.5.1.2. Handling of Dropouts or Miss ing Data
Repeated measures analyses will be used as the statist ical approach for handling missing data .  
The model parameters are simultaneously  estimated using restri cted likelihood estimation 
incorporating all o f the observed data.  Estimates have been s hown to be unbiased when the 
missing data are missing at random and when there is ignorable non -rando m missing data
(Mallinckrodt 2008) .  Missing at random (MAR) assumpt ionwill be evaluated using sensit ivity 
analyses as defined in Section 5.5.11 .
Approaches forHandling Missing Data for Derivation of Cluster Headache Attacks 
Derived from ePRO per 7-Day I nterval
In Study  CGAL , to derive the number of cluster headache attacks per 7 -day interval, the daily 
data for each patient (including thelast 7 days in the eligibilit y report [pre-randomization diary 
phase ]and the 8 weeks of daily data during treatment) will be converted into 9 roughly 7-
calendar day  intervals:  the baseline 7 -day period, Weeks1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ,
7,and 8.  Each day , the 
patient may  have zero, 1, or multiple cl uster headache attacks.  For each weekly interval, the 
following missing data imputation method will b e used:
1) if there are less than or equal to 3 days with nonmissing answer to cluster headache 
attack frequency  in the weekly  interval; or 2) the diary compliance rate i s less than or 
equal  to 50%, then the weekly interval will be considered missing;
Othe rwise, 1) if there are greater than or equal to 4 days with nonmissing answer to 
cluster headache attack frequency in the weekly  interval; and 2) the diarycompliance 
rate is greater than 50%, then the average number of cluster headache attacks across the 
non
-missing days will be used to impute the missing days.
For detailed example about missing data imputation, please see Section 5.4.1.2 .
Then the c hange fro m baseline to Weeks1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,and 8 will be derived.
The same approach will also be applied to secondary  and exploratory  efficacy  measures that 
derived fro m ePRO data.
5.5.1.3. Multicenter Studies
The following investigative site pooling method will be used:
All invest igative sites wit h fewer than 2 rando mized patients per each treatment group with non -
missing cluster headache attacks during baseline interval and at least 1 postbaseline value will be 
pooled together wi thin each country  and consid ered a single site for analyses.  If this results in a 
pooled site still having fewer than 2 randomized patients per each treatment group, the pooled 
site will  also be pool ed wi th the next smallest si te in that country , determined to be the site with 
the smallest number of rando mized pat ients, or if more than 1 site meets that cri terion, the 
smallest si te wi th the l owest invest igator number .  If this results in a pooled site still having 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 20
LY2951742fewer than 2 patients rando mized to each treatment arm, these sites wi ll be pool ed together wi th 
the next smallest site in the geographic regio n. Two geographic regions are defined ,including 
US and Canada co mbined, as well as Europe. If this st ill results in a site having fewer than 
2patients randomized to each treatment , then these sites will be pooled together with the next 
smallest si te in the who le study .  
All analyses will use pooled invest igative sites. The actual invest igative site numbers will be 
included in the list ings. 
5.5.1.4. Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be the overall treatment effect of GMB 300mg every  30 days
versus placebo over Weeks 1 to 3 using a MMRM analysis, which is equivalent to the average of 
the MMRM -estimate d weekly treatm ent effect over the 3 -week period for change in weekly 
cluster headache attack frequency from baseline .The Ty pe I error rate will be controlled at a 1-
sided 0.025 level for the primary  efficacy  analysis . 
A fixed sequential gatekeeper method will be utilized for testing secondary  hypothe ses to be 
eligible for inclusio n in the proposed label . Specific details of the testing of thesecondary  
gatekeeper object ives are provided in Section
 5.5.8.2 .
5.5.1.5. Analysis Populations
Three analysis populations ,including the ITT populat ion,the safet y popul ation,and the 
posttreatment population ,are defined in Sect ion 5.5.1 .
5.5.1.6. Baseline and Postbaseline Definition
Table CGA L
.5.2describes the rules for determining the patient population and baseline and 
postbaseline observat ions for each study
 phase and ty pe of  analysis.  When “last of Visit x -x” is 
used in the table, the last nonmissing observat ion obtained in the visit interval will be used.

Com parisons between treatment groups will be performed using Fisher ’s exact tests for
categori cal data and analysis of variance ( ANOVA )with treatment and pooled investigative site 
as independent variables in the model for continuous data. 
Medical history andpre-exist ing condit ionswill be summarized by descending frequency of 
preferred term (PT) within system  organ cl ass(SOC) , and by descending frequency o f PT 
respectively , and com parison between treatm ent grou ps will be performed using Fisher’s exact 
test. Medical history is defined as illness(es) that ended prior to the signing of informed consent.  
Pre-exist ing condit ions are medical events ongoing at the time of informed consent.
5.5.5. Exposure to Investigational Product
Patients will  receive the invest igational product (IP) at the fo llowing planned time points: 
Week 0 ( Visit 3 )
Week 4 ( Visit 5)
The fo llowing inform ation will be recorded on the electroni c case report form ( eCRF )for each 
dose: 
confirmation that the patient received the IP
date and time of administration
5.5.5.1. Duration of Exposure
From the informati on recorded on the eCRF , the following will be derived : 
Durati on of  exposure in days calculated as Treatm ent End Date (disposit ion date i n 
SPIII) –First date IP administered + 1
Number and percentage of patients with 1 full dose or 2 full doses administered
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 26
LY2951742Com parisons between treatments using safet y popul ation for durati on of  exposure will be 
perform ed using an ANOVA with treatment and p ooled invest igative site in the model.  
The number of full doses will also be summarized. 
5.5.5.2. Treatment Compliance
Treatment compliance will be calculated as fo llows
(number of full doses received)/(Number of intended full doses)*100
Note, full dose means th at pati ents have to receive all 3 inject ions.  For pati ents that are early  
discontinued, number of intended full doses will only  include scheduled doses prior to 
discontinuat ion.  Com parisons between treatments inthe ITT popul ation fortreatm ent
compliance will be perform ed using an ANOVA wit h treatment and pooled invest igativesite in 
the model. 
5.5.6. Electronic Patient -Reported Outcome Diary Compliance
Electronic patient-reported outcome diary com pliance at each weekly  interval (including 
baseline, Weeks1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,and 8 ) will be calculated. Diary compliance at each interval is 
calculated as follows:
Actualnumberofdiaryentrydaysintheinterval∗100
Expected numberofdiaryentrydaysintheinterval
The di ary entry can only be saved and submitted after all the required ePRO quest ions are 
answered, so the actual  number of diary  entry  days represents the total number of days with non -
missing answer to all the requi red cluster headache attack ePRO questi ons.
Theexpected number of d iary entry days is c alculated as the (last calendar date -the first 
calendar date i neach interval + 1).
Com parisons between diary com pliance for each interval separately will be performed using an 
ANOVA wit h treatment and poo led invest igativesite in the model. 
Com pliance will  also be listed by  weekly  interval for each patient. 
5.5.7. Concomitant Therapy
The proporti on of  patients who received conco mitant medicat ioncollected from eCRF will be 
summarized by PTseparately for all ITT pati ents for both SPIIIand SPIV.Abortive 
medicat ions for cl uster headache attack collected through ePRO diary  will be summarized 
separately  by PTfor all ITT patients for SP III .  If there are different PTsfor salt forms of a n
abortive medication , these PTswill be co mbined for the medicat ion in the summary.   
Concomitant therapies for SP III are th ose that 
stopped during SP III or continued in SP III.  If 
medicat ion started and stopped on the same day  of first inject ion, it will  still be considere d as 
concomitant medicat ion for SP III.  If a medicat ion started before the first day  of inject ion but 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 27
LY2951742stopped on the same day  of inject ion, then it will not be counted as concomitant medicat ion for 
SP III.  Concomitant therapies for SP IV are those that eitherstarted, stopped ,or continued in 
SPIV.
Treatment group comparisons will be done using Fisher’s exact test for SPIIIwith the ITT 
popul ation.  Descript ive statist ics on ly will be presented for the treatment groups in SPIVwith 
posttreatment popul ation.
5.5.8. Efficacy Analyses
5.5.8.1. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  analysis will be conducted by  a REML -based, MMRM analysis using all the 
longitudinal observations from Weeks1 to 3 .  The analysis of the primary outcome will be the 
main effect of treatm entbetween GMB 300 m g and placebo across Weeks 1 to 3of the treatment 
phase fro m a repeated measures analysis on mean change from baseline in the weekly attack 
frequency . This provides the average treatment effect over the 3 -week period. Baseline is 
defined as the last 7 day s in the eligibilit y report (prerando mizat ion diary phase) .  In addit ion to 
the primary  endpoint resul ts, the m ean profiles for GMB300mg and placebo over the 3 -week 
period will also be reported from the MMRM.  
The MMRM m odel for the primary analysis only uses the first 3 weeks of doubl e-blind treatment 
phase data to avo id impact of the data from later weeks when patients m ay start to get into the 
remission period . 
The m odel for the primary  analysis will include the fixed, categori cal effects of treatm ent, 
gender, pooled invest igative site, week, and treatment -by-week interacti on, as well as the 
continuous, fixed covariates of baseline value.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used 
to model the wi thin-patient errors.  The Kenward -Roger (Kenward and Roger 1997) 
approximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees of freedo m.  If the m odel does not 
converge wit h both the Hessian and the G matrix being posit ive definite under the default fitt ing 
algorithm used by PROC M IXED, the Fishers’ scoring al gorithm will be implemented by  
specifying the SCORING option in SAS .  If the model st ill fails to converge, the model will be 
fit using covariance matrices of the following order specified by a decreasing number of 
covari ance parameters unt il convergence is met: 
heterogeneous Toeplitz
heterogeneous first-order autoregressive 
Toeplitz
first-order autoregressive
If necessary, both the default and the scoring fitting algorithms will be used in the prespecified
order before proceeding to the next covariance structure in the sequence.  For models where the 
unstructured covariance matrix is not utilized, the sandwich est imator (Diggle et al. 1994) will be 
used to estimate the standard errors of the fixed effects p arameters.  The sandwich est imator is 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 28
LY2951742implemented by  specifying the EMPIRICAL option in SAS .  When the sandwich est imator is 
utilized, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for deno minator degrees of freedo m cannot be used.  
Instead, the deno minator degrees of freedo m will be partit ioned into between -subject and within -
subject portions by the DDFM=BETWITHIN option in SAS .  SAS PROC MIXED will be 
used to perform the analysis.  
5.5.8.2. Gated Secondary
The gated secondary  outcom e, 50% response, is the proportion of pati ents m eeting the response 
criteria at Week 3 .A nonresponder imputation for missing values will be used .  Specifically , all 
patients who discont inue study  treatm ent at any  time pri or to Week 3, for any  reason, will be 
considered a nonresponder.
Treatment differences in the proportions of pat ients meeting 50% response definit ion at Week3
will be determined using Koch’s Nonparametric Randomizat ion-Based Analysis o f Covari ance 
method (Koch et al. 1998). This m ethod will adjust for pooled invest igative site by including it 
as astratification variable and will also adjust for the cont inuous baseline value and gender .  A 
SAS/IML macro (NParCov3) (Zink and Koch 2012) will be used for the calculat ion. The 
options wi th this SAS/IML macro are specified in the exa mple SAS code below. 
%NPARCOV3( outcomes =[ response ]
covars = [baseline] [gender ]
trtgrps = [treatment ]
strata = [PINVID]
hypoth = NULL
transform = NONE
combine = FIRST
c = 1
dsnin = [input]
dsnout = [output])
In thi s method, the option of “hypoth=NULL” i ndicates that the variance covariance structure
will be calculated under the assumpt ion that the means and covariance matrices of the treatment
groups are equal and therefore computes a single covariance matrix for each stratum. The option
of “combine=FIR ST” indicates that the covariate adjust ment will be performed after a weighted
average o f treatm ent group differences across pooled invest igative sites to account for the
possibilit y of small numbers of pat ients at som e sites. The option of “c=1” indicates the use of
Mantel -Haenszel weights for each pooled invest igative site. The opti on of  “transform =NONE”
indicates that there is not a transformation of the data.
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 29
LY2951742The analysis resul t of the secondary  gatekeeper objective will be evaluated if the pl acebo versus 
GMB300mg comparison i s significant for the primary  efficacy analysis at a one sided α=0.025 
significance l evel.  
5.5.8.3. Additional Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses
Table CGAL. 5.3summarize sall the planned additional secondary  efficacy  analyses for SPIII
and SPIV.
For the conti n
uous additional secondary  and expl oratory  efficacy  measures, the change fro m
baseline to each postbaseline period 
will be est imated for each treatment fro m repeated m easures 
analyses as described in Section 5.5.8.2 .  The treatment comparison at each week and overall 
across 8 weeks will be provided. As di scussed in Section 5.5.1.1 , for the efficacy measures that 
are not derived from cluster head ache frequency, thebaseline average daily  cluster headache 
attack frequency category  (≤4vs.>4) will be added as a covariate in the MMRM model.
For the categorical additional secondary  and expl oratory  efficacy  measures including 30%, 50% , 
75% response , and 100% response, t he percentage of patients meet ing response criteria at each 
period will be est imated for each treatment fro m a categori cal, pseudo -likelihood -based repeated 
measures analysis o f visit wise binary  outcom es indi cating whether pati ents m eetresponse
criteria. The treatment comparison at each week and overall across 8 weeks will be provided. 
This analysis will be implemented using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS to compare treatments 
and include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, gend er,visit/week , and treatm ent-by-
visit/week interact ion, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline value .  An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors (denoted by  
TYPE=CHOL in the RANDOM statement). The Newton- Raphson method with ridging will be 
used for nonlinear optimizat ion (denoted by  including NLOPTIONS TECH=NRRIDG) .The 
Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate deno minator degrees of freedo m.  If the 
model does not converge, the Fisher s scoring algorit hm will be utilized by  the SCORING opti on 
in SAS.  If the model st ill fails to converge, the model will be fit using covariance matrices in the 
following order specified by  a decreasing number of covariance parameters unt il convergence is 
met:  heterogeneous Toeplitz, heterogeneous autoregressive, Toeplitz, and autoregressive. If 
necessary , both fi tting algorithms will be used in the prespecified order before proceeding to the 
next covariance structure in the sequence.  For models where th e unstructured covariance matrix 
is not utilized, the sandwich estimator (Diggle et al. 1994) will be used to estimate the standard 
errors of the fixed effects parameters.  The sandwich est imator is utilized by the EMPIRICAL 
option in SAS. When the sandwi ch est imator is utilized, the Kenward -Roger approximat ion for 
deno minator degrees of freedo m cannot be used. Instead, the denominator degrees of freedo m 
will be part itioned into between -subject and within -subject portions by the 
DDFM=BETWITHIN option in S AS.  As discussed in Section 5.5.1.1 , for the efficacy measures 
that are not derived fro m cluster headache frequency ,thebaseline average daily  cluster headache 
attack frequency category  (≤4vs.>4) will be added as a covariate in the GLIMMIX model.

5.5.9. Safety Analyses
The safet y analyses will be conducted for SPIIIin safet y popul ationandSPIVin posttreatment 
popul ation.
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 32
LY2951742The safet y and tol erabilit y of treatm ent will be assessed by  summarizing the following:
adverse events
otreatm ent-emergent adverse events
by PT
by PT nested wi thin SOC
by maximum severit y
otreatm ent-emergent adverse events by PT nested wit hin SOC
oadverse events leading to discont inuat ionby PT nested within SOC
oadverse events of special interest
suicide-
related thoughts and behavi orsby CSSRS
vital signs and wei ght
laboratory  measurements
electrocardi ogram s
antibodies (ADA and N
ab)
The baseline and postbaseline for all safety  measures are described in Table CGA L.5.2 unless
specified otherwise.  For SAEs, only  events wi th a start date during the postbaseline phase will 
be accounted for the corresponding study  phase analysis.
5.5.9.1. Categorical Safety Variables
Unless specified otherwise, t hecategori cal safety  analyses will include both schedule dand 
unscheduled visits andbe conducted for SPIII and SPIV separately.
Com parisons between treatment groups for all categorical safet y measures will be made using
Fisher ’s exact test for SPIII with the safet y populati on. Descript ive statist ics on ly will be 
presented for the treatment groups in SPIV with post -treatment populat ion
.
5.5.9.1.1. Adverse Events
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as the reported AEs that first occurred or worsened during 
the postbaseline phase co mpared with baseline phase .  For events occurring on the day  of first 
administration of study  drug, the CRF -collected flag will be used to determine whether the event 
was pretreatment versus posttreatment .  For each TEAE, the severit y level o f the event (mild, 
moderate, or severe) will be determined by pat ient or physician opinio n. The Medi cal Dict ionary 
for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA )Lowest Level Term (LLT) will be used in the treatment -
emergent com putati on. For each LLT, the maximum  severit y at baseline will be used as the 
baseline severit y.  If the m aximum severit y during postbaseline is greater than the maximum 
baseline severit y, the event i s considered to be treatment emergent for the specific postbaseline 
period. For events with a missing severit y during the baseline period, it will be treated as “mild”
in severit y; for events wi th a missing s everi ty during the postbaseline period, it will be treated as 
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 33
LY2951742“severe ”for TEAE com putati on.  For each patient and TEAE, the maximum severit y for the 
MedDRA level being displayed ( PT, High Level Term , or SOC ) is the maximum postbaseline 
severit y observed f rom all associ ated LLTs m apping to that MedDRA level .  
For events that are gender specific, the deno minator and computation of the percentage will be 
gender adjusted .
5.5.9.1.1.1. Potential Hypersensitivity Events
Potenti al hypersensi tivity events will be defined using the following terms (standard MedDRA 
query  [SMQ]) :
Broad and narrow terms in the Anaphylact ic react ion SMQ (20000021)
Broad and narrow terms in the Angioedema SMQ (20000024)
Broad and narrow terms in the Hypersensit ivity SMQ (20000214)
A listing of patients having an event ident ified from these analyses will be medically reviewed to 
determine if the terms identified represent events likely hypersensit ivity in nature .  Listings 
shoul d include informat ion on timing of event relative to l atest dose of study  drug 
administration, the event term from this query , other AEs for the patient and timing, any 
abnorm al laboratory  findings, concomitant medication, medical history , and pre -exist ing 
condi tions.  
Only those that are judged medically to beevents likely hypersensit ivity in nature 
will be included in the final tables.
The number and percentage of patients with potential  and/or likely TEAEs will be summarized 
by treatm ent groups using MedDRA PTnested within the SMQ.  Events will be ordered by 
decreasing frequency within the SMQ.   The number and percentage of patients with likely
hypersensit ivity SAEs and AEs result ing in study  drug di scontinuati on will  be presented by  
treatm ent groups using MedDRA PT and ordered by  decreasing frequency  by P T.
The number and percentage of patients withlikely hypersensit ivity TEAEs by maximum severit y
will be summarized by  treatm ent groups using MedDRA PT.
The number and percentage of patients with likely hypersensit ivity TEAEs by timing will be
summarized using MedDRA PT.  Events will be ordered by decreasing frequency of PT.  Note 
the timing of the likely hypersensit ivity events is collected through eCRF and categorized into 
the following 4 categori es:
1.Immediate :occurs within minutes (<60 min utes) from  study  drug administrati on
2.Acute React ion:  occurs fro m 1 up to 6 hours from study  drug administrati on
3.Delayed React ion:  occurs from >6 hours through 14 day s from study  drug 
administration, which will be split into 2 categories :  on the sam e day of injecti on 
and after the day  of inject ion
4.React ion >14 days
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 34
LY29517425.5.9.1.1.2. Adverse Events Related to Injection Site s
Adverse events related to i nject ion siteswill be defined using term s from the MedDRA High 
Level Term inject ion site reacti ons.
The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs rel ated to inject ion site s, SAEs related to 
inject ion site s, and AEs related to injection site sresul ting in study  drug di scont inuat ion will be 
summarized using MedDRA PT.  Events will be ordered by decreasi ng frequency of PT term .
The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs rel ated to inject ion site sby maximum 
severit y will be summarized by  treatm ent groups using MedDRA P T.  For each patient and 
inject ion site related event, the maximum severit y for the MedDRA level being displayed (P T) is 
the maximum postbaseline severit y observed from  all associ ated LLTs m apping to that MedDRA 
level .
The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs related to inject ion site sby timing will be
summarized using MedDRA PTsordered by  decreasing frequency .  Note the timing of AEs 
related to inject ion site sis co llected through eCRF and categorized into the same categories as 
for hypersensit ivity event s.
5.5.9.1.1.3. Upper Respiratory Tract Infections
Upper respi ratory  tract i nfections will be defined using all the PTs from the 2 High Level Term s 
of “upper respi ratory  tract infect ions” and “upper respiratory  tract infections NEC” as defined in 
MedDRA.   The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs of upper respiratory  tract 
infect ionswill be summarized by treatment group using MedDRA PTs.  Events will be ordered 
by decreasing frequency  in the galcanezumab 300mg group. 
The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs of upper respi ratory  tract infections by 
maximum severit y will be summarized by  treatm ent group using MedDRA PTs. For each 
patient and upper respi ratory  tract infect ion event, the maximum severit y for the MedDRA level 
being displayed (P T) is the m aximum  postbaseline severi ty observed from  all associated LLTs 
mapping to that MedDRA level .
By-subject list ings of treatment -emergent upper respiratory  tract i nfect ionsand upper respi ratory  
tract i nfect ionsleading to study  drug di scont inuat ion will be provided.   
5.5.9.1.2. Suicide -Related Thoughts and Behaviors
Postbaseline suicidal  ideati on, suicidal  behavi or, and self -injuri ous behavi or wi thout sui cidal  
intent occurring during SP III , based on the C -SSRS, will be summarized by  treatm ent.  In 
particular, for each of the fo llowing events, the number and percent of pat ients with the event 
will be enumerated by  treatm ent:  com pleted sui cide, nonfatal  suicide attem pt, interrupted 
attem pt, aborted attempt, preparatory  acts or behavior, active suicidal ideation wit h specific plan 
and intent, active suicidal ideation wit h some intentto act wi thout specific plan, active suicidal 
ideat ion with any methods (no pl an) wi thout intent to act, nonspecific act ive suicidal thoughts, 
wish to be dead, and self -injuri ous behavi or wi thout sui cidal  intent.  These measures will also be 
summarized fo r SP IV.
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 35
LY2951742In addit ion, the number and percent of patients who experienced at least 1 of various com posite 
measures during SPIII and SPIV separately will be presented and compared.  These include 
suicidal behavi or (com pleted sui cide, nonfatal  suicidal atte mpts, interrupted attempts, aborted 
attem pts, and preparatory  acts or behavi or), sui cidal  ideati on (active suicidal ideat ion with 
specific plan and intent, active suicidal ideat ion with some intent to act without specific plan, 
active suicidal ideat ion with any  methods [no plan ]without intent to act, nonspecific act ive 
suicidal thoughts, and wi sh to be dead ), and suicidal ideat ion or behavior.  
The number and percent of patients who experienced at least 1 of various comparat ivemeasures 
during treatment will be presented and compared for SPIII and SPIV.  These include t reatment -
emergent suicidal  ideati on compared to recent history , treatment -emergent serious sui cidal 
ideat ion compared to recent history , emergence o f serious suicidal  ideation compared to recent 
history , improvement in suicidal ideation at endpoint compared to baseline , and emergence of
suicidal behavi orcompared to all pri or history . 
Specifically , the f ollowing outcom es are C -SSRS categories and have binary responses (y es/no).  
The catego ries have been re -ordered from the actual scale to facilitate the definit ions of the 
composite and com parat ive endpo ints, and to enable clarit y in the presentation of the results.  
Category  1 –Wish to be Dead
Category  2 –Nonspecific Act ive Suicidal Thoughts
Category  3 –Active Suicidal Ideat ion with Any  Methods (Not Pl an) wi thout Intent to Act
Category  4 –Active Suicidal Ideat ion with Som e Intent to Act, wi thout Specific Plan
Category  5 –Active Suicidal Ideat ion with Specific Plan and Intent 
Category  6 –Preparatory  Acts or Behavior 
Category  7 –Aborted Attempt
Category  8 –Interrupted Attempt
Category  9 –Actual  Attempt (Non-Fatal)
Category  10 –Com pleted Sui cide
Self-injuri ous behavi or wi thout suicidal intent is also a C -SSRS outcome (although not s uicide
related) and has a binary  response (y es/no).  
Com posite endpo intsbased on the above categories are defined below.
Suicidal  ideati on:  A “yes” answer at any  time during treatm ent to any  1 of the 5 suicidal 
ideat ion quest ions (Categories 1 to 5) on the C-SSRS.
Suicidal  behavi or:  A “yes” answer at any  time during treatm ent to any  1 of the 5 suicidal  
behavior quest ions (Categories 6 to 10) on the C -SSRS.
Suicidal  ideati on or behavior:  A “yes” answer at any  time during treatment to any  1 of 
the 10 suicidal ideat ion and behavior questions (Categories 1 to 10) on the C -SSRS.

Patients who discont inued fro m the study  with no postbaseline C-SSRS value will be considered 
unevaluable for analyses of suicide -related events.  Only evaluable pat ients will be considered in 
the analyses.  Fisher’s exact test will be used for treatment comparisons in SP III .    
5.5.9.1.3. Vital Signs and Weight
Vital signs collected during the study  include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) , 
pulse, and tem perature. Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be taken when the patient 
is in a sitt ing posit ion. Three measurements of sitting blood pressure and pu lsewill be co llected 
at approximately 30-to 60-second intervals at every  visit and the 3sitting bl ood pressure 
measurements and 3pulse value swill be averaged and used as the value for that visit. 
Table CGA L
.5.4display sthe criteria used to define treatment emergent , potenti ally clinically 
significant changes and sustained elevation in 
vital signsand weight .  The last column of the 
table displays the pat ient populat ions for each analysis based on baseline categories .The 
number and percent of pat ients meeting these criteria will be summarized.  Treatment group 
comparisons will be performed using Fisher’s exact test for SP III .
The cri teria to identify pat ients with treatm ent-emergent abnormal changes generally consist of 
2parts : an abso lute threshold and a change from baseline amount. 
The abso lute thresho ld in the criteria is based on 1) minimum postbaseline when 
the direct ion is lowand2) maximum  postbaseline when the direct ion is high.
The change from baseline amount in the criteria is 1) decrease fro m baseline 
(defined below and in Table CGA L.5.2) to minimum postbaseline when the 
direction is low; 2) increase fro m baseline (defined below and in 
Table CGA L
.5.2) to m aximum postbas eline when the di rection is high.
The baseline for SBP, DBP, and pulse is defined as the last nonmissing value during the baseline 
period (See Table CGA L.5.2).  To be exact,
The baseline for SBP, DBP, and pulse is defined as the last nonmissing value 
before rando mizat ion.  The rationale for using the last available value in the 
baseline period is to minimize the potential confound of discont inuing or dose 
stabilization of medicat ions that m odulate BP and pul se during the screening 
phase (which is early in the baseline period).
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 38
LY2951742This baseline definit ion for SBP, DBP, and pulse applies to all analyses (both continuous and 
categori cal).
The baseline and postbaseline values for temperature and weight are defined below (al so in 
Table CGA L
.5.2):
For con tinuous analyses of temperature and weight, last nonmissing baseline 
during the baseline period will be used as the baseline value.
For the analyses of categorical changes of interest in temperature and weight :
oThe baseline is defined as the minimum value during baseline period when the 
direction is low.
oThe baseline is defined as the maximum value during the baseline period 
when the direct ion is high.

5.5.9.1.4. Electrocardiogram Intervals and Heart Rate
Analyses of corrected QT (QTc) interval andQTcF (m sec) will be calculated with Fridericia’s 
formula as QT/RR⅓. For the QTc calculat ions, the unit for QT is milliseconds and the unit for 
RR is seconds .  For pati ents with QRS ≥120 milliseconds at any  time during the study , the QT 
and QTc interval will be excluded from the analyses .  A listing of ECG data for patients with 
QRS ≥120 milliseconds at any t ime during the study will be provided. 
The baseline for ECG is defined as the l ast nonmissing baseline value during the baseline period .  
To be exact,
The baseline for ECG is defined as the last nonmissing value before randomizat ion.  
The rati onale for using the last available value in the baseline period is to minimi ze 
the potenti al confound of discont inuing or dose stabilizat ion of medicat ions that 
modulate ECG during the screening phase (which is early  in the baseline period).
This baseline definit ion for ECG applies to all analyses (both continuous and categorical,

5.5.9.1.5. Laboratory Tests
The incidence rates of patients with treatment -emergent abnorm
al, high, or l ow laboratory  values 
for each la boratory  test based onCovance reference ranges at any t ime postbaseline will be 
summarized.  The baseline and postbaseline definit ions are summarized in Table CGA L.5.2.   
The treatment comparisons will be assessed using Fisher’s exact tests for SP III .
Patients will  be defined as having a treatment -emergent l ow value if they  have all  normal or high 
values at baseline, fo llowed by  a value bel ow the lower reference limit at any postbaseline visit.  
Patients wi th all norm al or hi gh values at baseline (no low values) will be included in the 
analysis of treatment -emergent low laboratory  values. Patients will be defined as having a 
treatm ent-emergent high val ue if they have all normal or low values at baseline, fo llowed by  a 
value above the upper reference limit at any  postbaseline visit.  Pati ents wi th all normal or low 
values at baseline (no high values) will be included in the analysis o f treatm ent-emergent hi gh 
laboratory  values.
For analytes simply classified as normal or abnormal, patients will be defined as having a 
treatm ent-emergent abnormal value if they have all normal values at baseline, fo llowed by an 
abnorm al value at any  postbaseline visit.  Patients with all normal values at baseline will be 
included in the analysis o f treatm ent-emergent abnorm al laboratory  values.

with a postbaseline value.
The analysis of elevat ion in ALT, AST , ALP, and TBILwill contain 3 subsets :  
patients whose nonmissing maximum baseline value is less than or equal to 1 ULN for 
ALT, AST, ALP, and TBIL.
patients whose nonmissing maximum baseline value is greater than 1 ULN for ALT, 
AST, ALP, and TBIL, and at the same time less than or equal  to 2ULN for ALT and 
AST , 1.5ULN for ALP and TBIL.

5.5.9.1.6. Immunogenicity
In the immunogenicit y assay process, each sample is potentially  examined mul tiple times, 
according to a hierarchical procedure, to produce a sample ADA assay result and potentially a 
sample NAb assay result.  The cut points used, the drug tolerance of an a ssay, and the possible 
values of titers are operating characterist ics of the assay.
It can be the case that the presence of high concentrations of galcanezumab will affect the 
measurements of the presence of ADA or NAb, and conversely high levels o f ADA or NAb may 
affect the measurement of galcanezumab concentration.  Thus ,a GMB drug concentration, 
assessed fro m a sample drawn at the same time as the ADA sample, plays a key  role in clinical 
interpretati on of  a sample when the l aboratory  result is Not Detec ted.

Abbreviation:  ADA = anti -drug antibody .
Table CGA L.5.7. Sample Clinical ADA  Interpretation Results
Sample Laboratory Result Explanation
ADA Present ADA assay result detected.
ADA Not Present ADA assay result is Not Detected and simultaneous drug concentration is at a level 
that has been demonstrated to not interfere in the ADA detection method (i .e., drug 
concentration is below the assay's drug tolerance level). 
For patients recei ving placebo, drug concentration is not assessed and is assumed to 
be below the assay's drug tolerance level.
ADA Inconclusive ADA assay result is Not Detected but drug concentration in the sample is at a level 
that can cause interference in the ADA detection method.
ADA Not Detected with Drug 
Concentration Not AvailableIf drug concentration analysis was planned but result is not available for a 
treatment -period sample, a Not Detected sample will be declared ADA Not 
Detected with Drug Concentration Not Available.
In the computation of Patient ADA status (see below, Section 5.5.9.1.6.2 ), these 
samples will be considered ADA Not Present, on the ba sis of prior knowledge that 
the drug tolerance level of the ADA assay is high relative to the expect ed drug 
concentration levels.
ADA Missing ADA sample not drawn, QNS, not tested, etc., causing there to be no laboratory 
result reported or the result is reported as “no test”.

operating characterist ics.
5.5.9.1.6.2. Definitions of Patient Anti-drug Antibody Status
Patient evaluable for TE ADA:  A patient is evaluable for TE ADA if the patient has a 
nonmissing baseline AD A result and at least 1 nonmissing postbaseline.
TE ADA positive (TE ADA+) patient:  A patient who is evaluable for TE ADA is TE ADA+ if 
either of the f ollowing ho lds:
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 44
LY2951742Treatment -induced :  The patient has baseline status of ADA Not Present and 
at least one postbaseline status of ADA Present with titer ≥20 (ie, 2*MRD 
where for this ADA assay the MRD, the minimum required dilut ion of the 
ADA assay, is 10).  
Treatment -boosted :  The patient has baseline and postbaseline status of 
ADA Present, with the postbase line titer being 2 dilut ions (4 -fold) greater than 
the baseline t iter.  That is, the patient has baseline status of ADA Present, with 
titer 1:B, and at least 1 postbaseline status of ADA Present, with titer 1:P, with 
P/B ≥4.  
TE ADA Inconclusive patient: A patient who is evaluable for TE ADA is TE ADA 
Inconclusive if ≥20% of the patient’s postbaseline samples, drawn predose, are ADA 
Inconclusive and the pati ent is not otherwi se TE ADA+ .
TE ADA negative (TE ADA -) patient:   A patient who is evaluable for TE ADA is TE ADA -
when the patient is not TE ADA+ and the patient is not TE ADA Inconclusive. 
5.5.9.1.6.3. Analyses to Be Performed
To evaluate the changes in immunogenicit y data (Ant i-galcanezumab [ADA and NAb]) after 
treatm ent,the number and proportion of patients who are TE ADA+ will be tabulated where 
proporti ons are rel ative to the number of patients who are TE ADA evaluable as defined in 
Section 5.5.9.1.6.2 ).  The baseline and postbaseline definit ions for each analysis period is shown 
in Table CGA L.

5.5.9.2. Continuous Safety Measures
Analyses of cont inuous safet y data will be conducted on patients who have a baseline and at least 
1postbaseline observation for SP III.
For all the cont inuous safet y measures (including planned laboratory  measures ,vital signs and 
weight, ECG i ntervals and heart rate ), box-whisker plots with summary statist ic tables for 
absolute value and change fro m baseline at scheduled visit and at endpoi nt (defined as the final 
postbaseline value) will be provided fo rSP III. The change fro m baseline results will be 
compared between treatment arms using the analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )model with 
treatm ent, pool ed invest igative site and baseline valu e in the m odel.
5.5.10. Subgroup Analyses
Subgroup analyses will be performed for primary efficacy  measure (change fro m baseline on 
weekly number of cluster headache attack )only for the ITT patients in the SPIII. 
Table CGAL. 5.8provides definit ions for each subgroup variable.   Subgroup variables are 
usually selected if they  are potentially prognostic or predict ive.  A subgroup variable is 
prognosti c if values of the subgroup variable predict the change in efficacy  measures regardl ess 
of the treatm ent group assignment.  A subgroup variable is predict ive if values of the subgroup 
variable predict heterogeneous treatment effect.  Demographic subgroup v ariables (sex, racial 
origin, ethnicit y,age, and region) mayneither be prognosti c nor predictive, but they  are standard 
subgroup variables needed for regulatory  submission.  Baseline average daily  number of cluster 
headache attack category and sex were i ncluded in the dynamic allocat ion rando mizat ion 
algorithm and are considered possibly  prognosti c.   
The purpose of the analyses for these subgroup variables is to assess the consistency o f treatm ent 
effects across the different values of each subgroup variable .

LY2951742 5.5.11. Sensitivity Analysis 
For all sensitivity analyses for the primary effi cacy endpoint, the diary data up to Week 3 will be 
used. 
Dynamic Allocation (Minimization) Assumption 
A permutation test will be performed as a sensitivity analysis of the pr imary MMRM analysis to 
confirm the results of the asymptotic  inference.  The key features of the permutation test that will 
be employed are as follows:   
 The patients’ baseline covari ates, responses, and enrollment  order will be considered 
fixed. 
 The sharp null hypothesis will be assumed, i.e., responses to galcanezumab and 
placebo will be assumed exactly equal. 
 The exact minimization algorithm and exact site pooling algorithm will be used to generate the null distribution of the primar y test statistic from the MMRM analysis. 
 The p-value based on the generated null dist ribution (i.e., permutation test p-value) 
will be obtained by comparing the observed test statistic value to the percentiles of 
the generated null distribution. 
Explicitly, the p-value is derived fr om the permuted distribution of te st statistics as follows.  If 
the total number of  permutations is ݉ , and ܾ  of these permutations have  a test statistic greater 
than or equal to the observed test statistic, ݖ ,then the permutation p-value, ݌
௣ is, 
݌௣ൌܾ൅1
݉൅1 
where ݉ equals 100 000.  As discussed in Phipson and Smith (2010), this is an upper bound on 
the estimated p-value.  This method is used to generate the approximate null distribution.  Note 
that the described permutation p-value calculation should be conducted such that a positive value 
for the test statistic should indicate a favorable  treatment effect galcanezumab 300 mg relative to 
placebo. 
Missing Data Assumption 
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to asse ss the robustness of the primary analysis 
conclusions to deviations from MAR assumption.  Th e approach for these analyses is to vary the 
assumptions of missing data for the primary analys is in a systematic way.  Basically, the method 
will be to predict the missing outcomes and then add a value (denoted as ΔA) to the predictions in 
the active treatment group and another value (denoted as ΔP) to the predicti ons in the placebo 
treatment group, consistent with the sensitivity approach suggested in Permutt (2015).  This 
procedure will be repeated multiple times for different values of ( ΔA, ΔP) using the following 
steps:   
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 48
LY29517421.Predi ct the missing outcomes for each treatment via mult iple imputati onbased 
on observed primary  endpoint and baseline values.  Such imputation will be 
carried out using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with a Jeffreys prior
via SAS®PROC MI .  Thi rty (30) such imputati ons will be created. 
2.Add Δ Ato the impu ted values for pati ents taking active treatment and ΔPto 
the imputed values for patients taking placebo. 
3.Conduct the primary analysis separately for each of the 30 imputations.
4.Combine the results of these analyses using Rubin’s combining rules, as 
imple mented in SAS® PROC MI ANALYZE.
The above steps will be repeated mult iple times for different values o f (ΔA, ΔP) with 
ΔPranging fro m (0, twi ce the abso lute value o f the mean value seen for placebo in the primary  
analysis) and ΔAranging fro m (ΔP, ΔP+ absolute val ue of the mean treatment difference seen 
within the primary analysis).  For example, if the mean change from baseline for placebo is -3.6 
and the corresponding treatment difference is -1.5, then ΔPwoul d range fro m (0,7.2) and ΔA
woul d range fr om (ΔP, ΔP+ 1.5).
Normality Assumption
To assess the robustness o f the MMRM results to deviat ions from norm ality assumpti on, a 
sensit ivity analysis for raw number of cluster headache attacks ( total number of cluster headache 
attacks for each interval without im puting missing value and without normalization to 7-day 
period)will be conducted with a repeated measures negat ive binomial regressi on m odel fitted 
with SAS PROC GLIMMIX.  The model will include treatment, gender, pooled investigat ive 
site, 
week ly time period ( Week 1 , Week 2, Week 3) , and treatm ent-by-time-periodinteraction, as 
well as the continuous fixed covariate sofbaseline value, and log (number of compliant day s 
within each weekly  time period divided by 7) as the offset in the model.  In case of 
nonconvergence, pooled investigative site may be excluded fro mthe model.  
Directional 
consistency of treatment effects fro m this m odel and the primary  analysis MMRM m odel as 
specified in Secti on 5.5.8.1 will be examined.
In addit ion, as another form of sensit ivity analysis, resi duals fro m the primary analysis MMRM 
model will be examined and outliers ident ified.  Consistency of results befor e and after removing 
patients wi th outlier residuals will be examined.

LY29517425.6. Interim Analyses
Up to 2interim analyses were pl anned for Study  CGAL .Interim a nalysis 1 during SP III may  be 
conducted that may result in increasing the sample size or stopping the trial for futilit y.  Details 
were docum ented in the Statisti cal Analysis Center SAP , ERB supplement ,and DMC Charter .  
However, this interim analysis for sample size re -estimat ion will not happen due to enrollment 
infeasibilit y.  The DMC will still independent ly moni tor pati ent safet y during this tri al.
Theother interim analysis that was planned will be conducted after all pat ients have had the 
opportunit y to complete 8 weeks of treatment (SP III )and, thus, will be the final analysis of 
the primary  efficacy endpo int.  The interim analysis will  be conducted using internal 
unblinded study  team  members who do not have direct interaction wit h sites.
5.7. Unblinding Plan
Interim analysis will be conducted by  unblinded study  team  members who do not have direct

5.8. Reports to Be Generated at Each Interim and Final Database 
Lock
5.8.1.1. Report sto Be Generated at Interim Database Lock
For the interim analysis , the database will be locked after all rando mized patients have had the 
chance to complete 8weeks of treatment in SP III.  However, some pat ients will st ill be ongoing 
in SP IV at the time of the database lock .  
Data up to the data cutoff date in the locked database 
from all study  phases will  be used , andanalyses specified in this SAP will be performed.  
However, only analyses conducted for SP III at interim analysis will be considered as the final 
CCI
I5Q-MC-CGAL Statistical Analysis Plan Version 5 Page 50
LY2951742analyses .  The analyses including data f rom SP IV will  be rerun and updated when the completed 
data are available at the final database lock.
5.8.1.2. Report sto Be Generated at Final Database Lo ck
For final database lock, allanalyses including tables, figures and list ings that use data from SP 
IV will be generated. 
5.9. Clinical Trial Registry Analyses
Addit ional analyses will be performed for the purpose of fulfilling the Clinical Trial Registry  
(CTR )requirements.   These analyses will be the responsibilit y of the Sponsor.  
Analyses provided for the CTR requirements include the fo llowing:
A summary  of AEs will be provi ded as a dataset that will be converted to an XML file .  Both 
Serious Adverse Events and “Other ”Adverse Events are summarized by treatment group andby 
MedDRA PT.
An AEis considered “Serious”whether or not i t is a TEAE.
An AEis considered in the “Other ”category  if it is both a TEAE and is not serious.  For 
each “Serious”AE and “Other ”AE, for each term and treatment group, the fo llowing are 
provi ded:
othe number of participants at risk of an event
othe number of participants who experienced each event term
othe number of events experienced
Consistent with www.ClinicalTrials.gov requirements, “Other ”AEs that occur in fewer 
than 5% of patients in every  treatm ent group may not be included if a 5% thresho ld is 
chosen.
AE reporti ng is consistent with other document disclosures; for example, the CSR, 
manuscripts, and so forth.

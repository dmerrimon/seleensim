1.0 OBJECTIVE  
 
The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the 8-hour moisturiza tion efficacy of a n 
over-the-counter ( OTC ) sunscreen lip balm  after a single treatment application . 
 
2.0 CLINICAL  STUDY PRODUCT  
 
A single sunscreen lip balm will be evaluated - ChapStick Lip Moisturizer Original (
  
 
The test material will be supplied labelled with the GSK CH study number (218004)  and 
product identifier . 
 
Prior to study start, and for the duration of the study, the test material will be stored securely 
at ambi ent conditions . Unused test material will be returned to the Sponsor.  
 
The Sponsor assumes responsibility for the purity, stability, characterization and adequate 
preservation of the test products. The Sponsor assumes responsibility for determining the 
test material is safe for use in humans as described in this protocol.  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN /RANDOMIZATION  
 
This is a randomized, controlled , open label clinical study in healthy adult volunteers 
designed to  evaluate the 8 -hour moisturization efficacy of the test material using 
corneometry.  
  
Skin hydration  (‘moistur e’) will be assessed before and after a single treatment with test 
material  (2, 4, 6 , and 8 hrs post -treatment), compared to ‘no treatment’  as control. A 1-
week (7 days ± 2 days) skin conditioning phase will precede  the test day (Visit 2) , during 
which study participants will use only the soap provided for personal washing.  No other 
products will be applied to the skin of the test sites for the duration of the study.  
 
Each  participant will have 2 test sites delineated on the skin of their volar forearm (one per 
arm). Eligible participants will be assigned to treatment based  on the randomization 
schedule at the start of the test day (Visit 2) . Assignment of study treatments shall follow 
the randomization schedule generated by  in accordance with SOP .  The test 
material and untreated control sites will be randomized between the right and left volar 
forearms in accordance with the computer -generated randomization table. The 
randomization table will be generated prior to the study start date using analysis software 
SAS Version 9.4 or higher. The statistician responsible  for data analysis will not have 
access to the randomization code until after the database has been locked.

The Clinical Research Coordinator  (CRC ) will record corneometer  readings  on paper score 
sheets. The raw data will  be transcribed  into an Excel spreadsheet ; Transcription review / 
database release for statistical analysis will be performed in accordance with SOP  
 
Given t he likely visual /textural  differences between the treated and untreated test sites  (test 
material is a waxy solid) , the corneometer  operator c annot be blinded . To help minimi ze 
bias, the corneometer  operator will not participate in treatment  application  and the 
technician(s) responsible for treatment application will not be present for , or influence , the 
corneometer  assessme nts. In addition,  the randomization table and the seed will be kept in 
a secure location ; the statistician  responsible for data an alysis will remain blinded to  the 
treatment allocation until after  the database  has been  locked. After the database  lock, the 
statistician will unblind the study by assigning the treatment codes for the analysis.   
 
Study duration is expected to be 5-10 days.  
 
4.0 STUDY POPULATION  
 
Approximately 3 8 participants will be enrolled in this study  with the goal to  complete with 
at least 30 subjects . Potential study participants will be recruited from  Volunteer

• Dependable, willing and able to keep all study appointments, and follow study 
instructions.  
• Willing to not begin another clinical study while participating in current study.  
• Willing to wear loose -fitting clothing to facilitate access to the forearms during study 
visits.  
• Willing to continue with use of their current personal care products and avoid use of 
any new personal care products (e.g ., makeup, cleanser).  
• Willing to cease use of any personal care products (e.g. , moisturizers, lotions,

• Willing to avoid prolonged or excessive UV exposure  (e.g., sun-bathing, tanning b eds).   
• Willing to inform study staff about any side effects, changes in their 
health/medications, pregnancy and study -related problems.   
 
Contraception:  
 
All male participants able to father children and female participants who are of child -
bearing potential, sexually active and at risk of pregnancy must agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception, consistently and correctly, for the duration of the study 
and for 14 days after their last assigned treatment  (recommendation/discretion of th e 
volunteer) . This requirement does not apply to females of child -bearing potential with same 
sex partners or to participants who are, and will continue to be, abstinent from penile -
vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent basis, when this is thei r preferred and 
usual lifestyle.  
 
The PI, or CRC , will discuss the need to use highly effective contraception, consistently 
and correctly, with the participant; the conversation will be documented. In addition, the 
PI, or CRC , will instruct the participan t to call the site immediately if their contraception 
method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known, or suspected, in either the participant or 
the participant’s partner.

The following is an all -inclusive list of female contraceptive methods that meet  the GSK 
definition of highly effective for avoiding pregnancy (i.e., have a failure rate of less than 1 
% per year when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with 
the product label). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovula tion, sympto -thermal, post -
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
 
• Contraceptive subdermal implant  
• Intrauterine device or intrauterine system  
• Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive  
• Injectable progest ogen  
• Contraceptive vaginal ring  
• Percutaneous contraceptive patches  
• Male partner sterilization with documentation of azoospermia prior to the female 
participant's entry into the trial, and this male is the sole partner of the female 
participant. The docu mentation on male sterility can come from site personnel 
review of medical records, medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical 
history interview provided by her or her partner.  
 
Male participants with female partners of child -bearing potential must comply with the 
following contraception requirements for the duration of the study and for 14 days after 
their last assigned test treatment.  
  
• Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia. The documentation on male 
sterility can come from site personne l: review of the participant’s medical records, 
medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview.  
• Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive options below that meets 
the effectiveness criteria including a less than 1% r ate of failure per year, as stated 
in the product label:  
- Contraceptive subdermal implant  
- IUD or intrauterine system  
- Combined estrogen and progestogen oral contraceptive  
- Injectable progestogen  
- Contraceptive vaginal ring  
- Percutaneous contraceptive patch es  
 
These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, 
correctly and in accordance with the product label. The PI, or CRC , will confirm the 
participant has had instruction in how to properly use their method of contraception  from 
an appropriately trained health care professional and will document this conversation.  218004 | Protocol FINAL 218004  8Hr Corneometry Study 28 Sep 2021 | TMF-215726 | 2.0 PPD

4.4. PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION  AND WITHDRAWAL  
 
A participant may be discontinued or withdraw from study participation at any time if the 
participant or the PI (or CRC ) feels it is not in their best interest to continue. The following 
is a list of possible reasons for study discontinuation.  
 
• Participant develops a condition listed in the exclusion criteria or  hypersensitivity  or 
takes a contra -indicated medication/treatment.  
• Non-compliance with the requirements of the protocol.  
• Failure to follow site staff instructions.  
• Failure to attend scheduled study visits.  
• Adverse event (AE) that, in the opinion of the PI, means it would be in the participant’s 
best interest to discontinue study participation.  
• Protocol violation requiring documentation of deviation.  
• Sponsor request for early termination of study.  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from study participation at any time, for any  reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. Reasonable attempts will be made by the 
PI, or CRC , to ascertain the reason for withdrawal. This will be recorded in source 
documentation and included in the final report.  
 
4.5. DISPOSITION OF WITHDRAWN PARTICIPANTS  
 
The date a participant is withdrawn from the study and the reason for discontinuation will 
be recorded in source documentation. If a participant fails to return for scheduled study 
visits, the PI, or CRC , will make every reasonable effort to contact the participant and 
determine why they failed to attend. This information will be recorded in source 
documentation. When a participant is withdrawn (regardless of reason), the PI, or CRC , 
will encourage the pa rticipant to return to site to complete all evaluations which may be 
necessary to assure that the participant is free of untoward effects, and to seek appropriate 
follow -up for any unresolved AEs.  
 
4.6. PARTICIPANT REPLACEMENT  
 
Discontinued  participants will n ot be replaced . Any valid data collected for a participant 
up to the point of discontinuation may be used  in the statistical analysis (see Section 7).

5.0 STUDY EVALUATIONS  
 
5.1. CORNEOMETER  
 
Corneometry is a well -established instrumental technique designed to measure changes in 
the capacitance of the skin resulting from changes in the degree of hydration ; it is 
particularly sensitive to low hydration levels. Corneometry uses a capacitance sensor to 
measure the dielectric constant of the outer layers of the skin  (stratum corneum). The 
dielectric constant is directly proportional to the water content of the skin (skin hydration.  
The capacitance of the skin surface is expressed in arbitrary units of skin hydration ; the 
higher the corneometer  reading, the more hydra ted (‘moist’) the skin . The corneometer 
model being used for this study is a Derma Unit SSC 3 Courage + Khazaka (Cologne, 
Germany).  The corneometer will be calibrated at the beginning of each test day in 
accordance with  SOP . 
 
5.2. TEMPERATURE /HUMIDITY  MONITORED  TEST ROOM (VISIT 2) 
 
The temperature/humidity  monitored  test room  will be maintained at a temperature of 
21+2°C and 50 +10% RH. Temperature and humidity will be recorded/documented on an 
hourly basis  throughout the test day , starting at least an hour before the first subject start s 
to acclimate and until the last subject exits the facility.  
 
Study participants will acclimate in the temperature/humidity  monitored  test room  for at 
least 30 mins before their pre -treatment ( baseline) corneome ter measurement and remain  
sequestered  in the test room  for the duration of the test day (Visit 2), approximately 9.5 
hours. Participants will take their meals in the test room  (hot or very cold food/beverages 
are not permitted  as this can affect corneo metry readings ). Restroom breaks can be taken 
as needed . However, subjects must return to the test room  at least 30 minutes prior to their 
next scheduled corneometer measurements. No other breaks outside of the 
temperature/humidity -controlled test room  will be permitted, unless deemed an 
emergency.  The corneometer  will be housed in the test room . 
 
5.3. DIGITAL CAMERA  
 
Photographs may be taken of test sites using a Canon  DS126621  (or similar system) to 
document unexpected results/AEs  if requested by the PI, CRC , or the Sponsor . Photographs 
will not reveal participant identity.

6.1. DAY 1: SCREENING /ENROL LMENT  
 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each potential participant prior to entering 
the study (Informed Consent of Human Subjects, 21 CFR Part 50). The CRC  will ensure 
the informed consent process is conducted in accordance with applicable local, state, and 
federal laws and regulations.  
 
Prospective participants will report to the study site and be provided with a copy of the 
Informed Consent Form (ICF)  and a Photo Release Form . Site staff will answer any 
questions they may have about the study. If they cho ose to participate, site staff will obtain 
the applicable signatures on the enrollment documentation, starting with the ICF. Each 
participant will sign two  copies of the ICF, one will be retained in the Investigator Trial 
Master File , the other will be given to the study participant . 
 
Site staff will then record  the participant’s relevant  Medical History , any concomitant 
medications/treatments  and responses to inclusion/exclusion questions  in source 
documentation . Participant date of birth will not be recorded in study documentation. The 
skin of the participant’s volar forearms will be examined and suitability to participate 
reviewed against the relevant inclusion/ exclusion criteria ; findings will be recorded in 
source documentation . As  required, site staff will consult the PI and/or SI (study 
physician/dermatologist ) regarding participant  responses and the findings of the skin 
examination to confirm quali fication.  
  
Qualified participants will be enrolled and scheduled for study procedures; ineligible 
participants will be disqualified.  
 
Each qualifying participant will be assigned a unique identifying screening  number  
(different from the randomization /subject number)  in order of enrollment  and provided 
with non -moisturizing soap and a diary ; provision of soap and diary will be recorded in 
source documentation . Participants will be instructed to use the soap provided for all body 
washing during  the conditioning phase  (between Visits 1 and 2)  and record  each soap usage 
in the diary . Participants  will be instructed to refrain from use of moisturization products 
for the duration of the study.  
 
Enrollment procedures will be completed in a private s etting. If the participant has 
questions about their rights, they may contact the IRB  at any time during or after trial 
participation.  
 
Randomization  number assignment  will take place prior to study start  at Visit 2 .

6.2. DAY 2: TEST DAY 
 
Participants will report to the clinical site with clean  volar forearms  and, as instructed,  free 
from lotions and any other topicall y-applied products . Each will be questioned non -
directively to assess compliance with the requirements of the protocol and to identify 
changes in health/concomitant medications. Any changes/AEs will be recorded in source 
documentation. Conditioning phase diaries will be colle cted and reviewed for study 
compliance . Randomization/subject number will be assigned.  
  
Participants will enter the temperature/humidity monitored test room  and acclimate for at 
least 30 minutes prior to their baseline corn eometry measurements ; they  will remain in the 
test room  until completion of the ‘8 hour’ corneometer  measur ements .  
 
Using a skin marker and template, a study technician  will identify two test sites  (one per 
arm) for each participant and delineate  a 6.3 cm x 6. 3 cm square  (approximately 40 cm2 in 
area) on the skin of each volar forearm.  Three corneometer  measurements will be taken  per 
test site  at each assessment time point  (i.e., pre-treatment ( baseline) and 2 -, 4-, 6- and 8 -
hours post -treatmen t). Each measurement will be taken with the corneometer probe tip in 
contact with the skin; for each test site, the three readings will be taken at different, but 
nearby locations within the designated test area  (see example below) . Corneometer  
readings will be recorded in source docu mentation.   
 
 
 
6.2.1.  Study Treatment Application  
 
The study technician will apply 80 ± 2 mg (2.0mg/cm2 ± 0.05 mg/cm2) of the test material  
to its’ assigned test site  using a fingercot. A double -weighing procedure will be used 
(weighing boat + test material  + fingercot, prior to and after application) to ensure the 
required quantity of product is delivered. Using the fingercot and light pressure, the test 
material  will be evenly spread over the test site.  
 
No treatment will be applied  to the test site on the  opposing volar forearm  (control site).

7.0 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed by  with oversight from GSK CH,  using  
analysis softwar e SAS Version 9.4 or higher . Since all methodologies for the summary and 
statistical analyses  of the data collected in this study are specified in the protocol, a separate 
Reporting Analysis Plan (RAP) will not be created. Any major modification of the analysis 
plan will be documented as a protocol amendment.  
 
7.1. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
 
Sufficient  participants will be screened to enroll approximately 3 8 healthy adult 
participants and with the goal of  30 participants to complete all study procedures. The 
sample size calculat ion is  based on  medium to large effect size ( standardized effect size  = 
0.75 or above) for this type of treatment and power  = 0.90 at a 0.05 level  when comparing 
difference between treated and untreated groups on primary end point ( mean changes from 
baseline in corneometer  measurements).  
 
7.2. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
The primary analysis  population will include all eligible participants (qualified based on 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria) who were  randomized, receive d study treatment and 
provide d at least one post -treatment efficacy assessment . 
 
The safety population is defined as all randomized participants who received study 
treatment.   
 
7.3. DATA EXCLUSIONS  
 
Deviat ions from the protocol will be identified by review of individual participant data ; 
affected data will  be excluded  from the efficacy analys is prior to database lock , with the 
agreement of  the biostatistician and the CRC . Data exclusions and the re asons for exclusion  
from the primary  analysis population will be provided in the clinical study report  (CSR) . 
 
7.4. PARTICIPANT DISPOSITION , DEMOGRAPHICS  AND  BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
 
The safety population will be used  for p articipant disposition , demographic characteristics  
(age, sex)  and other baseline characteristics. Descriptive statistics (number of subjects, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum , and maximum for continuous variabl es, and 
frequency and percenta ges for categorical v ariables ) will be tabulated and presented .

7.5. EFFICACY ANALYSIS  (CORNEOMETER ) 
 
The primary analysis population will be used for the efficacy analysis.  The primary 
endpoint is mean changes in corneometry measurements at each timepoint after the 
baseline.   
 
The mean of the 3 corneometer  measurements obtained for each test site at each designated 
time point (pre-treatment  (baseline)  and 2 -, 4-, 6- and 8 -hours post -treatment) will be 
calculated  for each indiv idual participant . An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
will be used with treatment, timepoint and subject  (random effect) as terms in the model , 
and baseline value as covariate . The adjusted means of the two treatments, the treatment 
differences together with the 95% confidence interval (CI) and p -values will be provided.  
  
Change from baseline and percent of participants improved will also be calculated at each 
post-treatment time point . Change from baseline will be calculated as  post-baseline 
assessment value minus the baseline assessment value. Percent of participants improved 
will be calculated as number of participants who exhibited an improvement (positive 
change indicates improvement) divided by the total number of participan ts included in the 
statistical analysis.  Pairwise comparisons will be applied using the AN COVA model to 
determine the differences in corneometer measurements between treated and untreated 
sites at Baseline and the differences in change from Baseline betwee n treated and untreated 
sites at each post -treatment interval . A plot of mean corneometer measurements over time 
will be presented by treatment and assessment time point s. 
The null hypothesis tested is there is no difference in mean corneometer  value s betw een 
the treatment and no treatment.  
• H0: µ1 = µ 2  
The alternative hypothesis is there is difference in mean corneometer  value  between the 
treatment and no treatment . 
• H0: µ1 ≠ µ 2 
 
Statistically significant treatment differences will be declared if the probability of random 
occurrence between the two treatment groups (p) is ≤ 0.05. All tests will be 2 -sided.  
 
Individual participant results will be tabulated along with summary statistics, including 
number of non -missing observations (n), mean corneometer  value s, standard deviation 
(SD), median, minimum (Min) and maximum (Max).  
 
Calculations and statistical analyses will be reviewed by  Quality Assurance.

7.6. HANDLING OF DROPOUTS AND MISSING DATA 
Participants who withdraw from the study or are discontinued will be included in the 
efficacy  analysis up to the point of discontinuation. No data will be imputed in the case of 
dropouts or missing data.  
 
7.7. SAFETY ANALYSIS  
 
A summary of safety data (AEs/SAEs), or confirmation there were no AEs, will be 
provided in the CSR ; no coding or analysis of safety data will be performed.  
 
8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The PI, or designated CRC (s), is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an adverse event ( AE) or a serious  advers e event ( SAE ). 
Adverse events will be reported for the safety population.  
 
The PI, or designated CRC (s), is responsible for following up SAEs; AEs considered to be 
test product (or study procedure) related; and AEs that caused the participant to discontinue 
or be withdrawn from the study.  
 
8.1. DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT (AE)  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of a test material , whether or not considered related to the test  
material . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a test material .  
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition:  
• Unexpecte d or unusual reactions which occur within a test site will be recorded as AEs.  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), 
inclu ding those that worsen after test material administration, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the PI or medically qualified 
designee (i.e., not related to progression of an underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a ch ronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition after test material administration.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after test material administration, even though it 
may have b een present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  218004 | Protocol FINAL 218004  8Hr Corneometry Study 28 Sep 2021 | TMF-215726 | 2.0 PPD
PPD PPD
Clinical Study Protocol

Protocol Number: 218004 /  
Page 18 of 31 
 
 
 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either test material 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless 
it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such 
overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• ‘Lack of efficacy’ per se will not be reported as an AE. Such instances will be captured 
in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE if they fulfil the definition of an 
AE.  
 
Events NOT meeting the AE definition:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings (if applicable) or other 
abnormal safety assessments which are associated with an underlying disease, unless 
judged by the PI, or medically qualified designee  , to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.  
• A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy) is not an AE. The 
condition that leads to the procedure is the AE (e.g., gastritis, appendicitis).  
• Situations where an untowar d medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations in a pre -existing disease/condition present or 
detected at the start of the study that did not worsen.  
 
8.2. DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)   
 
An SAE is a particular category of AE where the adverse outcome is serious. If an event is 
not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met 
(e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of a diseas e under study, death due to progression 
of disease).    
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
- The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not 
refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused  death, if it were more 
severe.

PPD PPD
Clinical Study Protocol  
Sponsor: GSK Consumer Healthcare  
Protocol Number: 218004 /  
Page 19 of 31 
 
 
 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
- In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward 
for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician's office or out patient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills 
any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
‘hospitalization’ occurred, or was necessary, the  AE should be considered 
serious.  
- Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from Visit 1  is not considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person's ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
- This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance such as an uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting,  
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Other situations:  
- Medical or scienti fic judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events 
that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the participant o r may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
- Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an  emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note:  Classification of an AE as 'serious' is based on the outcome of the event an d is a 
factor in determining reporting requirements.  
 
8.3. EXPECTED EVENTS  
 
There is always the possibility of irritation or reaction to any  skin product  applied to the 
skin.  Examples of possible skin product reactions are:  218004 | Protocol FINAL 218004  8Hr Corneometry Study 28 Sep 2021 | TMF-215726 | 2.0 PPD

• Redness  
• Dryness/tightness  
• Peeling  
• Itching  
• Burning/stinging  
• Allergic reaction  
Any skin reaction associated with the application of the test material  to the test site will be 
considered an AE and documented as such.  
 
8.4. TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR COLLECTING AE AND SAE  INFORMATION  
 
All AEs,  and therefore all SAEs, will be collected immediately after a participant provides 
consent to participate in the study  by the completion (signing) of the ICF and until 14 days 
following last administration of test material  (or last study procedure). Medic al occurrences 
that began before obtaining informed consent will be recorded in the source documentation 
as Medical History/Current Medical Conditions, not as AEs.  
 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor, or designee , immediately and under 
no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours. The PI, or CRC , will submit any updated 
SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
 
The PI is not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study  
participation. However, if the PI learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a 
participant has been discharged from the study, and they consider the event to be 
reasonably related to the test material  or study participation, the PI must promp tly notify 
the Sponsor.  
 
8.5. REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , is responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting all events that meet the definition of an AE and remains responsible for following 
up on AEs that are serious o r considered to be related to a test material , participation in the 
study or a study procedure, or that caused the participant to discontinue a test material or 
the study.  
 
Each participant will be questioned about AEs. Spontaneously reported AEs and thos e 
elicited by asking non -directive questions (such as "How do you feel?") will be assessed, 
recorded in AE -specific source documentation and reported appropriately. The PI, or 
medically qualified  designee , is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs  
spontaneously reported by a participant.  218004 | Protocol FINAL 218004  8Hr Corneometry Study 28 Sep 2021 | TMF-215726 | 2.0 PPD
PPD PPD
Clinical Study Protocol  
Sponsor: GSK Consumer Healthcare  
Protocol Number: 218004 /  
Page 21 of 31 
 
 
 
Each AE should be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for a SAE. If an SAE 
occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.  
When an AE occurs, it is the respo nsibility of the PI, or medically qualified  designee , to 
review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event. The PI, or CRC , will record all relevant information regarding an AE 
in AE -specific source documentation and all details relating to an SAE on the paper SAE 
form provided.  
 
It is not acceptable for the PI, or medically qualified  designee , to send photocopies of a 
participant’s medical records to GSK CH in lieu of completion of AE -specific source 
documentation or the SAE form. There may be instances when copies of medical records 
are requested by GSK CH. In this instance, all participant i dentifiers, except for the 
participant number, will be redacted prior to sharing with GSK CH.  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event 
based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The dia gnosis should be the 
documented as the AE/SAE, where known, and not the individual signs/symptoms (e.q., 
upper respiratory tract infection, seasonal allergy etc., not cough, runny nose).  
 
AEs elicited by the PI, or medically qualified  designee , during stu dy visits should be 
recorded in AE -specific source documentation and/or using the SAE form, as appropriate. 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when questioning a participant about changes in 
their health. Open -ended and non -directive verbal questioni ng should be used.  
 
8.5.1.  Reporting an Adverse Event:  
 
AEs will be reported using AE -specific source documentation by the PI or site staff and 
the AE form, when appropriate, using concise medical terminology. Where the same data 
are collected, AE -specific sourc e documentation and the SAE form must be completed in 
a consistent manner; the same AE terms should be used on both.  
 
8.5.2.  Reporting  a Serious Adverse Event:  
 
In addition to recording the details in AE -specific source documentation, a  SAE form 
should be completed, as fully as possible. Hard copies of the paper SAE form will be 
provided by the Sponsor for the Investigator Site Master File. Original SAE forms should 
be retained in the Investigator Trial Master File.

It is essential to enter the following information:  
• Protocol and participant identifiers  
• Participant demography  
• Description of event(s), with diagnosis if available  
• PI opinion of relationship to test material (or study procedure, if appropriate)  
• Criterion for seriousness  
 
The following  are desirable and are of particular relevance for PI and GSK CH assessment 
of the SAE report:  
• Date of onset of event  
• Date event stopped, if relevant  
• Test material start date  
• Test material end date, if relevant  
• Action taken in relation to the test material  
• Outcome if known  
 
The SAE form, completed as fully as possible, must be scanned and e -mailed to the GSK 
CH Clinical Operations Safety Reporting email box with the GSK CH study number and 
participant number in the title field of the ema il immediately and under no circumstance 
should this exceed 24 hours  after study site personnel learn of the event. The PI will 
submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor immediately and under no circumstance 
should this exceed 24 hours  of it being availab le. The GSK CH Study Manager should 
also be notified of the situation by telephone or email.  
 
Email Serious Adverse Events to:  
 
 
The GSK CH Study Manager, or CRC , will be resp onsible for forwarding the SAE form 
to the Case Management Group, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance mailbox 
 The initial report will be followed up with more information as 
relevant, or as requested by the GSK CH Study Manager.

8.6. EVALUATING ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.6.1.  Assessment of Intensity  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , will assess intensity for each AE reported during 
the study and will assign one of the following categories.  
• Mild:  An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate:  An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• Severe:  An event that preve nts normal everyday activities.  
 
NOTE:  An AE classified as ‘severe’ should not be confused with an SAE.  
‘Severe’ is a category utilized to classify the intensity of an event; both non -serious AEs 
and SAEs can be classified as ‘severe’. For example, a head ache may be ‘severe’ (interferes 
significantly with the participant's usual function) but would not be classified as ‘serious’ 
unless it met one of the criteria for an SAE, as described above (Section 1.2.2.). An event 
is defined as 'serious' when it meets  at least 1 of the pre -defined outcomes as described in 
Section 1.2.2., not when it is classified as ‘severe’.  
 
8.6.2.  Assessment of Causality  
 
Causality is one of the criteria used to determine regulatory reporting requirements. For 
each AE (serious and non -serious), the PI, or medically qualified  designee , must provide 
an assessment of causality in the AE -specific source documentation and, for SAEs, on the 
SAE form.  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , will use clinical judgment to determine causality, 
having also consulted the Safety Statement provided by the Sponsor for this study. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, other risk factors 
and the temporal relationship of the event to test material  use will also be taken i nto 
consideration and investigated.  
 
There may be situations where an SAE has occurred and the PI has minimal information 
to include in the initial report to GSK CH. The PI is required to make an assessment of 
causality prior to the initial transmission of the SAE form to GSK CH; they may cha nge 
their opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up 
report with the updated causality assessment.

8.6.3.  Relationship to Test Material  
 
The relationship or association of the AE to test material  will be characterized as ‘unlikely’, 
‘possible’ or ‘probable’ (Table 10).  
 
A ‘reasonable possibility’ of relationship conveys there are facts, evidence and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
The facts, evidence and/or arguments which suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided in the AE report.

Response to withdrawal unclear or  lacking  
Unlikely Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to test material  use 
that makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible) 
Condition (or disease) or other products provide plausible explanations  
 
For safety analyses, AEs classified as a ‘possible’ or ‘probable’ association to test material  
shall be considered test material -related AEs.  
 
Follow -up of an AE, after discontinuation of exposure to test material  is required if the AE 
or its sequelae per sist. Follow -up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the PI and to the Medical Monitor.

8.7. FOLLOW -UP OF AES AND SAE S  
 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the PI, or medically qualified  designee , is required  to 
proactively follow up with each participant and provide further information on the 
participant's condition. All AEs (serious and non -serious) will be followed until resolution, 
until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained or u ntil the participant 
is lost to follow -up.  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct 
of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by 
GSK CH to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of an AE. This may 
include additional laborator y tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or 
consultation with other health care professionals. New or updated information will be 
recorded on the AE CRF page and, for SAEs, on the SAE form. The PI, or CRC , will 
submit updated SAE data to GSK CH within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
 
The PI is not obliged to actively seek AEs in former study participants. However, if the PI 
learns of a SAE, including death, at any time after a participant has been  discharged from 
the trial, and considers the event reasonably related to the test material or study 
participation, they will promptly notify GSK CH by emailing the information to the GSK 
CH Clinical Operations Safety Reporting email box .  
The GSK CH Study Manager, or CRC , will be responsible for forwarding the information 
to the Case Management Group, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance group 
mailbox at GSK .  
 
The PI, or medically qualified  designee , will submit any updated SAE data to GSK CH 
within the designated reporting time frames.  
 
8.8. WITHDRAWAL DUE TO AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
Withdrawal due to an AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to oth er causes, 
according to the definition of an AE noted earlier, and recorded in the appropriate AE -
specific source document. When a participant withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must 
be reported as already described.  
 
8.9. REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS F OR SAE S  
 
GSK CH has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory authorities about the safety of a test  material under clinical 
investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the PI to GSK CH is esse ntial so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of study participants are met.

GSK CH will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority and IRB, and other i nvestigators if applicable.  
 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators, as required.  
 
An investigat or who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE from the sponsor) will review 
it, file it with the Safety Statement in the Investigator Trial Master File and then notify t he 
IRB, if appropriate, according to local requirements.  
 
8.10. PREGNANCY  
 
8.10.1.  Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
 
Pregnancy information will be collected on all pregnancies reported while a female 
participant is taking part in the study, from the signing of informed consent until 14 days 
after last administration of test material .  
 
8.10.2.  Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occ urs  
 
The PI, or CRC , will record pregnancy information on the pregnancy form supplied by the 
Sponsor  if reported by a subject during the study . The completed form should be scanned 
and e -mailed to the GSK CH Clinical Operations Safety Reporting email box 
 within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The GSK CH Study 
Manager, or CRC , will be responsible for forwarding the pregnancy form to the Case 
Management Group, Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance mailbox 
. Original pregnancy information forms should be retained in the 
Investigator Trial Master File.  
 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital a nomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are, 
and should be recorded as an SAE. Any female participant who becomes pregnant during 
the study will be withdrawn. If a female participant later discovers they were pregnant 
during the study, i.e., after their participation  completed, their data will be considered valid 
for statistical analysis purposes.

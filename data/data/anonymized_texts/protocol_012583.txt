1. Background and Study Rationale:  
Two years after FDA approval of the first left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device 
for the prevention of embolic stroke in patients with non -valvular  atrial fibrillation, over 
13,000 Watchman (Boston Scientific, Inc., Natick, MA) devices have been successfully 
implanted in the US. Post -approval prospective registry data in 3,822 consecutive cases 
demonstrated implantation was successful in 3,653 (95.6%), with a median procedure time 
of 50 min with the majority of operators new to the procedure (71%). Complications 
included 39 pericardial tamponades (1.02%), 3 procedure- related strokes (0.078%); 9 
device embolizations (0.24%), and 3 procedure -related deaths (0.078%) [1]. The early 
phase PROTECT -AF complications topped 10%, but clearly as expertise in trans- septal 
access, and improvements in the delivery system and technique have evolved, total 
complications post implant have dropped to <3% in the EWOLUTION registry [2].  
With proper patient selection, routine use of ultrasound to guide venous access, and 
a continued trend to implant without bridging  anti -coagulation, expert centers may  be able 
to reduce  total acute complications below 1%. As a stroke prevention strategy, this could 
position LAA closure as a cost -effective consideration, potentially as first line therapy for 
many patients.  Several landmark clinical trials are ongoing in the LAA occlusion space and will provide prospective randomized trial data on over 5000 patients closed with a variety 
of methods. The Amulet (Abbott Medical, Inc.) versus Watchman IDE clinical trial (clinical 
trials.gov # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has rapidly enrolled since opening in 2017 with a target 
enrollment of 1400 subjects and 300 roll -in cases. Subjects eligible for a Watchman LAA 
closure device are randomized 1:1 to Amulet or Watchman and followed for a minimum of 18 months for the endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism. Additionally,  the surgical 
LAAOS -III trial is studying over 4000 patients undergoing open heart surgery with a history 
of AF, and randomized 1:1 to LAA excision, or no intervention on the LAA.  
Anti -coagulation regimen and anti -platelet therapy post Watchman implant in the 
Amulet IDE is according to the FDA labeling for Watchman subjects, with a more variable 
strategy in the Amulet arm, including even DAPT alone (ASA 81mg plus Plavix 75mg 
minimum of 6 months, followed by ASA 81mg alone). Traditional or standard of care 
anticoagulation management following Watchman LAA closure device implantation 
includes oral dose adjusted warfarin INR 2 -3 for 45 days after implant (unclear if this 
requires initiation of warfarin pre -procedure in patients who were intolerant to OAC).  In 
addition, ASA 81mg is to be taken to 45 days when a follow up TEE is performed to assess leaks, device position or thrombus formation.  Typically (in PROTECT and PREVAIL over 
92% of subjects stopped OAC at 45 days), the FDA labeling is to initiate ASA 325mg daily 
with clopidogrel 75mg daily for up to 180 days post implant, then indefinite ASA 325mg 
daily is recommended.  
 Referrals for LAA closure for anti -coagulation failure (formation of thrombus in the 
LAA despite medical therapy, or recurrent embolic events or stroke while on OAC) are not 
4 
 clearly outlined in any LAA closure clinical trial inclusion criteria. In our experience, these 
may actually be the patients who stand to benefit the most from removing or occluding the 
LAA. Two separate studies have shown over a 93% LAA closure efficacy rate, including a 
2017 LAA closure study with long term CTA assessment on Atriclip (Atricure Inc. , West 
Chester OH, USA) placed by thoracoscopic approach [4,5]. Prior formal studies of surgical methods have reached 60 -70% closure rates at best, and incomplete surgical closure is 
associated with a higher rate of stroke [6].  Management immediately following LAA closure 
by an epicardial approach with Atriclip or surgical closure does not appear to require  
systemic anti- coagulation, though no prospective randomized data exists to support this 
claim.  
Several retrospective studies were published in 2017 supporting the use of NOAC 
(novel oral anti -coagulant) or DOAC (direct oral anti -coagulant) for anti -coagulation post 
LAA device implant to reduce DAT. EWOLUTION reported a 1 year device associated 
thrombus rate of 3.7% with Watchman, independent of the post implant regimen, in which 
73% of anti -coagulation ‘contra -indicated’ subjects were on anti -platelet regimens alone 
[2]. A separate study showed a 3.2% DAT rate with the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (previous 
generation of the Amulet device under IDE trial in the US) [7]. While certainly not what the 
implanting physician hopes to see at the 45 days  or 1 year follow up TEE, whether a DAT 
leads to clinical ischemic strokes as a whole has been difficult to determine. Standard 
practice has been to initiate short -term oral anti -coagulation and repeat the TEE in 6 weeks 
to ensure resolution, of a DAT, then return to anti -platelet therapy alone.  
The process of complete endothelia lization of a Watchman LAA closure device is 
poorly understood. Animal models suggest complete endothelialization may be complete 
within 6 weeks . Human autopsy examples show variable endothelialization at up to 9 
months . A study in 2017 using CT angiography demonstrated contrast flow across 66% of 
LAA devices at 6 weeks, questioning if TEE at 6 weeks is really a suitable metric for ‘closure’ 
[8]. Likely this represents a slow leak through the fabric cap and not around the device, if 
the TEE shows no Doppler  flow. We have seen several cases where follow up TEE missed a 
leak and an obvious gap with contrast filling a trabeculated LAA lobe was seen with CTA. 
Anti -coagulation was discontinued, but long -term studies are needed to evaluate the impact 
of this finding.  
Event rates for bleeding after Watchman versus warfarin show superiority after 6 
months when clopidogrel is discontinued.  This is where the net clinical benefit of LAAC is 
seen, leading to improved long term outcomes and ultimately the rationale for FDA 
approval of the Watchman device. The role of dual anti -platelet therapy , or the use of 
325mg ASA versus 81 mg ASA long term is not supported by any specific literature, and was 
carried over from previous trials with use of coronary stents, and PFO and ASD occluder 
devices. Once the LAA device has complete occlusion with no flow into the LAA and surface 
endothe lialization , it is plausible that ASA 81mg is a sufficient recommendation l ong term. 
This has recently been established in European  AF guidelines on LAA closure for patients 
contra -indicated to OAC, supporting single or dual anti -platelet therapy after implant. 
5 
 However, this potentially sets up an increased risk of device associated thrombus (DAT). If 
an alternative post procedure regimen using 90 days of dabigatran plus 81mg ASA alone is 
employed, eliminating the use of clopidogrel, we may reduce both major bleeding events, 
and reduce device associated thrombus rates at 1 year follow up. It would not be expected 
to impact ischemic stroke rate, but this could be implied if fewer DAT are observed.  
 In conclusion, LAA closure is becoming a reasonable strategy for patients at high 
risk for stroke (CHADS 2 Vasc score 3 -9) and high risk for bleeding on long term OAC (HAS 
BLED score 2 -6). The FDA labeled strategy for medical management after Watchman 
implant is loosely supported scientifically, and still exposes patients to increased bleed risk 
up to 6 months after implant due to the use of DAPT. A shorter and simplified use of 
dabigatran BID for 90 days post LAAC with ASA 81mg, followed by ASA 81mg daily long 
term may reduce bleeding events, and have a beneficial impact on lowering the rate of DAT. 
Praxbind is a specific monoclonal anti -body available for dabigatran reversal. All study 
centers will have Praxbind  available for use in the event of a major bleed, (i.e., subdural or 
intracranial bleed, or major bleed requiring transfusion), or in case of unexpected or emergent surgery.  
2. Study design:  
Single arm, prospective unblinded study on  post Watchman LAA closure device 
implant anti -coagulation management at a primary center (Vanderbilt Medical Center) and 
up to 5 additional high volume LAA implant centers. This trial will be designed to evaluate 
the use of dabigatran for  90 days post implantation of an  LAA closure device  (Watch man 
LAA Closure Device, Boston Scientific Inc. ).  The drug will be initiated on the morning 
following device implantation, taken BID per package insert dosing and until follow -up 90-
day post implant TEE.  Aspirin monotherapy will be utilized in conjunction at 81 mg for up 
to 12 months , after which the patients will be exited from the study  and further treatment 
decisions will be made by the following physician  (see Schedule of Study Procedures at end 
of protocol).  The objective of this trial is to evalu ate safety and efficacy of a 90 -day period of 
dabigatran etexilate following LAA closure to prevent device associated thrombus , while 
minimizing adverse bleeding by eliminating the need for clopidogrel. This is a single arm 
pilot study with the option (pending collaboration with additional funding source) to 
expand to a full single arm non- inferiority trial design with 80% power to detect a 1 .4% 
difference with the non -inferiority margin 1% in absolute rate of DAT (control rate 3.9%).  
Prospective, non -randomized single arm study. Comparison  will be made  to 
historical controls based on published one year DAT rate s from PROTECT -AF, PREVAIL 
clinical trials, and EWOLUTION, and ACP/Amulet registries.  
Echocardiography (TEE) will be performed at 90 days (3 months, +/ - 2-week  
window), and again at 1- year  post implant (+/-  4 weeks). Selected images will be 
interpreted by echo lab at coordinating center in an anonymous fashion (patient data de-identified). Ideal imaging will incorporate 0, 45, 90 and 135 degree angled views on the 
device at follow up.  
6 
 Drug will be dispensed as part of the clinical trial supplied from the sponsor and 
each patient will receive a complete 90 days’  supply up front. They will have a drug visit on 
the day of TEE with the research coordinator to hand back any remaining dabigatran, with 
clear instruction to stop the drug and only take ASA following confirmation of closure on 
TEE (no  peri -device  leak on Doppler of  >5mm). A decision to continue anti -coagulation post 
closure 90day TEE will be made by the physician discretion based on TEE findings. If 
thrombus is found at the 90 days TEE, anti -coagulation may be extended another 6 weeks 
with repeat TEE imaging to confirm clot resolution  at the discretion of the investigator.  In 
the unlikely event of embolization  or Doppler leak >5mm, decision on extending anti -
coagulation, or re -implanting a device will be made by the following physician.  
Additional baseline data collection: Patient demographics, medical history, age, sex, 
and prior use of anti -coagulants or anti -platelet medications will be collected. CHADS 2 
Vasc, and HAS -BLED score calculated. Main indication for LAA closure must be documented. 
Baseline CBC and BMP required on day of implant or up to 1 week pre -procedure (typical 
standard of care labs at time of implant). This will include a recent calculation of Creat inine  
Clearance (using Cockroft Gault and using patients actual body weight) and dosing of study 
drug will be made in accordance (see below). Repeat PCV or hematocrit on the morning 
after Watchman LAAC implantation  will be per hospital standard. PCV or hematocrit value  
pre-implant and at the post 90 -day visit will be analyzed .  
 
Calculation for dabigatran dosing:  
CCr={ (l 40–age) x weight  in kg )/(72  x SCr)  } x 0.85 (if female)  
 
Implant procedure variables to collect include access site, sheath  used for 
deployment (WAS), device size at implant and number of implant attempts.  LA pressure 
mean if available. Presence of angiography contrast or Doppler Echo leak, thrombus, or 
pericardial effusion  post imp lant will be recorded. At 90 days, TEE report findings and 
image review (standard of care)  with drug dosing visit with research coordinator and 
return of any remaining study drug . 1 year TEE (standard of care) with a research exit visit 
with MD, physician extender, or research coordinator, with documentation of ASA 
tolerance, dosing, and any late bleeding episodes or hospitalizations (typically should be 
reported as AE/SAE when first knowledge of event is determined). TEE images will be sent 
to the primary study site (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) and core TEE lab will 
review to confirm presence or absence of DAT. In cases of CTA utilized for follow up, 
similarly images will be reviewed by chest radiology team at Vanderbilt.  
Medication administration with 90 days of dabigatran to be dispensed by pharmacy 
ideally one time (180 capsules).

Dosing regimen of dabigatran will be by FDA and pharmacokinetic labeling for 
dabigatran 150mg BID dosi ng if Creatinine clearance >30mL /min , and 75mg BID dosing if 
15-30mL /min .  This will be based on calculated CC by baseline labs performed on day of 
implant.  Additional dosing adjustments per package insert for patients taking dronedarone 
400mg BID, or ketoconazole will be made consistent with drug label. The majority of 
subjects will be expected to be on 150 mg BID for 90 days.  Subjects on 75 mg twice dai ly 
dosing may be enrolled if renal function is stable  in the range of 15 -30mL/min .  Aspirin 81 
mg a day will be taken along with oral anticoagulation for 90 days followed by longer -term 
aspirin 81 mg da ily aspirin dose.  At the 90 days TEE follow up (3 months) a PCV or CBC will 
be drawn and compared to baseline PCV pre -LAA closure implant as an ass essment of 
9 
 indolent blood loss (there is expected intra -procedural blood loss from back bleed on access 
sheaths estimated 25 -125mL).  
Drug required for study: Initially start with 100 subject pilot study on therapy for 90 
days, with option to expand to full non -inferiority study  if collaborative funding is secured 
(IF study expands beyond pilot, e stimate 262  subjects , 90 days on therapy ). Estimate 80% 
or more sub jects on 150mg BID dosing, and up to 2 0% s ubjects on 75mg BID dosing.  W ith 
either the 100 -subject  pilot study, or optional expanded single arm study ( 262  patients ) the 
objective is to  establish a device associated thrombus (DA T) rate at 3 months and 1 year 
within 1 .5% or less  deviation  from published DAT rates at 3.9% (Saw, J., et al).  Comparison 
will be made to published data on W atchm an LAA closure utilizing the 45 -day warfarin 
after implant followed by six -month dual antiplatelet regimen , or registry data from 
European experience on Watchman and Amulet/ACP LAA closure systems . 
Patients can  be consented for the trial on the day of implantation or up to one 
month prior in clinic during consultation fo r LAA closure.  This is an unbli nded, single arm 
prospective study.  Study exit visit will be coordinated with final twelve -month follow -up 
imaging after LAA closure implantation.   
Endpoints:  
Primary endpoint : Device associated thrombus (DAT) at 1-year follow -up imaging 
by either transesophageal echocardiogram or CT angiography depending on the patient 
tolerance for TEE (TEE preferred).   
Secondary endpoints :  Includes ischemic stroke, perip heral thrombo -embolic events, 
major bleeding requiring intervention (blood transfusion, or surgical or non -operative 
intervention, i.e., pericardial effusion, vascular access repair etc.) . 
Statistical Methods/Calculations:  
Stati stical sample size calculation to establish comparable DAT rate wi th the prescribed 
regimen:  
Available data for background on DAT;  
Overall incidence of DAT was 3.9% (82 DAT for 2118 implanted devices ) 
Lempereur et al. Meta- Analysis  [ref 19] : 30 studies describing DAT events were 
included in the analysis. The overall incidence of DAT was 3.9% (82 DAT for 2118 
implanted devices). The median time from procedure to diagnosis of DAT was 1.5 months 
(IQR: 0 -2.9). Most cases were diagnosed with transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). The 
treatment consisted of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in 45.5% of cases, and oral 
anticoagulation (OAC) or other treatment modalities in 54.5%. Complete thrombus 
resolution w as achieved in 95.0% of cases (100% with LMWH and 89.5% with OAC). 
Treatment duration varied greatly with a median treatment duration of 45 days (IQR: 14 -
10 
 135). Clinical events related to DAT consisted of neurologic events namely two transient 
ischemic attacks (2.4%) and four ischemic strokes (4.9%).  
Saw et al [ref 7] .  339 analyzable TEE in follow up . Patients' mean age was 74.4 ± 7.5 
years, and 67.3% were men. The mean CHADS2 score was 2.7 ± 1.3, the mean CHA2DS2 -
VASc score was 4.3 ± 1.5, and the mean HAS -BLED score was 3.0 ± 1.2 . Peri -procedural  
major adverse events occurred in 2.4%. Median clinical follow -up duration was 355 days 
(range 179 to 622 days). Follow -up transesophageal echocardiography was performed after 
a median of 134 days (range 88 to 227 days). Device -associated thrombus was observed in 
3.2% Independent predictors of device- associated thrombus were smoking (odds ratio: 
5.79; p = 0.017) and female sex (odds ratio: 4.22; p = 0.027).  
Kaneko et al. [ref 20] 78 patients (50 males, 72  ± 8 years, average CHA2DS2 -VASc 
score of 4.3  + 1.8) who had undergone WATCHMAN implantation. WATCHMAN was 
successfully implanted in all patients and four (5%) developed DRT. Patients with DRT 
were more often female (75 vs. 34%, p  = 0.094). CHA2DS2 -VASc score was higher for 
patients with DRT (6.3  ± 2.5 vs. 4.2  ± 1.7, p = 0.022). Chronic kidney disease (100% vs. 43%, 
p = 0.024) and deep implantation of the device, which was defined as implant position 
below the LAA ostial plane (75 vs. 24%, p  = 0.026), were more common in patients with 
DRT. HAS -BLED score (4.5  ± 1.0 vs. 3.5  ± 1.1, p = 0.074) was higher and oral anticoagulants 
(50 vs. 84%, p  = 0.086) were less commonly prescribed for patients with DRT. Multivariable 
logistic regression analysis showed that higher CHA2DS2 -VASc score (p  = 0.022, OR 2.8) 
and deep implantation (p  = 0.032, OR 24.7) were associated with DRT. These results suggest 
the possible role of CHA2S2 -VASc scores and implantation depth in the development of DRT 
after percutaneous LAA closure using the WATCHMAN devic e. 
With a single arm non -inferiority trial design  to show the absolute rate of DAT is 
less than the control rate of 3.9% by a  non- inferiority margin of 1% having a power 80% to 
detect a 1.4% difference at 0.05 level of significance , we would need 262 total subjects 
enrolled and reaching imaging endpoint evaluation. The initial study will begin wit h pilot to 
100 subjects (with  46% power) with an option to expand if additional funding source is 
obtained.  
 
Data Management:  
Data will be stored in a HIPPA -compliant manner in a REDCap database accessible 
to only the PI and key study personnel  at each participating center, and site coordinating 
center monitoring team (Vanderbilt University Medical Center).  Uploaded files and patient 
data will be identifiable  in raw form but de -identified chart and subject ID in REDCap with 
access restricted to implant sites and coordinating center.

Safety Reporting:  
Adverse events (AE) related to the drug or the procedure  during the course of the 
study will be reported in the patient’s record, and the investigator will give his or her 
opinion as to the relationship of the adverse event to study drug treatment .(i.e., the 
relationship will be reported as “related” or “unrelated” to the study  drug administration). . 
If the adverse event is serious, it will be reported to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. (BI), and IRB  by the coordinating center and trial PI . All serious adverse events will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization. Results of the follow -up will be reported to BI and 
the IRB.  
Definitions of Adverse Events:  
 “An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal  
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal  
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product”  
 An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be 
considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize 
the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Acute minor or major complications following the implant procedure  will be 
reported . Intra -operative major bleeding or device related (embolization, stroke, 
hemorrhage, etc.), will be reported as a procedural complication which is not study drug related. After the AM dosing of dabigatran post -operative day #1, and up to 90 days post 
procedure, AE’s potentially related to study drug will need to be reported. Adverse events 
include events such as those described above that occur at any time from informed consent 
until 90 days post implant of the LAA closure Watchman device.  
Recording of Adverse Events:  
12 
 All AEs will be documented. A description of the event, including its date of onset 
and resolution, whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) or not, any action taken 
(e.g., changes to administration), and outcome, will be provided, along with the 
investigator’s assessment of causality (i.e., the relationship to the study treatment[s]) and 
determination of severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe). For an AE to be a suspected 
treatment -related event, there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the protocol treatment and the AE.  
 
Bleeding events  
Patients will be carefully assessed for signs and symptoms of bleeding at each visit. 
Bleeding will be classified as major or minor using the following guidelines. Major bleeds 
will be further sub classified as either life -threatening or other major bleeds.  
Major Bleeds : 
Bleeding associated with a transfusion of at least 2 units of blood or packed cells .  
Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ  requiring surgical or non -operative 
intervention: Intraocular, intracranial,  intraspinal or intramuscular with compartment 
syndrome, retroperitoneal bleeding, intra -articular bleeding or pericardial bleeding . 
Minor Bleeds : 
Minor bleeds are clinical bleeds that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeds. 
Minor bleeds are classified as associated with study medication discontinuation (temporary or permanent) or not.  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting to BI Pharmacovigilance  
Adverse events classified by the treating investigator as serious require expeditious 
handling and reporting. Serious adverse events may occur at any time from informed consent until 30 days post cessation of dabigatran etexilate administration. BI must be 
notified of all SAEs containing at least one (1) fatal or immediately life- threatening event 
within five calendar days of the first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research personnel. BI must be notified of all other SAEs within ten calendar days of the first knowledge of the event by the treating physician or research personnel. The SAE 
reports shall include all SAEs and non -serious AEs occurring in the same time and/or which 
are medically related and, in particular, the following information:  
(i) the listedness of the reported events based on BI Investigator’s Brochure for the 
dabigatran etexilate,  
13 
 (ii) PI  causal assessment as to whether the event(s) is/are related to the use of the 
dabigatran etexilate, and  
(iii) the seriousness of each AE.  
Causality should be assessed for each event as either “yes” or “no”. No other 
variation should be reported. In case, according to the physician’s causal assessment the 
association between an event and the patient’s exposure to the dabigatran etexilate is 
classified as “unknown”, the event will be considered “related” to the Study Drug for 
regulatory reporting purposes. If the SAE report forwarded to the BI was also submitted to 
a regulatory authority, this shall be indicated in the cover letter.  
Supporting documentation for each of the reported SAEs, if requested by BI, will be 
provided to BI. Supporting documentation shall include, but is not limited to, lab reports, 
autopsy reports etc. SAEs, during and after pregnancy, will be reported to BI . To report an 
SAE, a BI SAE Reporting Form  will be completed with the necessary information  as 
available , and faxed using the following contact information:  
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   900 Ridgebury Road .  Ridgefield, CT . 
Fax: 1-203 -837 -4329.  
Follow -up information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become 
serious will also be reported to BI as soon as it is available; these reports will be submitted 
using the BI SAE Reporting Form. Serious adverse events occurring more than 30 days after 
study drug administration need only be reported if a relations hip to the dabigatran etexilate 
administration is suspected.  
The investigator does not need to actively monitor participants for adverse events 
once the clinical trial has ended However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) 
that occurred after the participant has completed the clinical trial (including any protocol 
specified follow -up period), it should be reported to BI if the investigator considers it as 
relevant to the use of the BI study drug dabigatran.  
SAE Reporting to Regulatory Bodies : Regardless of causality, all SAEs will be documented 
and reported to regulatory bodies, including the IRB as required by the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Follow -up 
information for SAEs and information for non -serious AEs that become serious will also be 
reported in the same manner.  SAE’s will be reported to the Vanderbilt Human Research 
Protection Program according to their policies and procedures.  
 
Study duration and timelines:  
 From completion of the protocol, appr oval of contract and site initi ation at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, study duration would be as follows: Estimated rate of 
enrollment is 2- 3 subjects per site per month. Estimated time to complete enrollment of 100 
14 
 subjects is 12 months once all sites are open, followed by 1 year of follow up to reach 1 year 
post implant imaging. Estimate completion of study in 24 months.

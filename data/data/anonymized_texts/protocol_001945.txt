adequate supply of study-provided drug (i.e., up to a 3-month provision) until a participant isable to come to the clinic for a study visit. If a participant is not able to return to the clinic for
any reason and needs a  refill of study-provided drug, sites mus t contact t heir protocol team
pharmacist (via the Clinical Management Co mmittee (CMC) at actg.cmcA5354@fstrf.org ) to
establish the procedures for shipping study-provided drug to the participant.
5. Section 6.3.3, Post-Entry Evaluations
a.Included t he notation as follows.
Letter of Amendment #1           Page 5 of 6 05Aug2020 
ACTG A5354 Protocol Version 2.0 Step 2 Evaluations 
The Step 2 Registration evaluation may be combined with the Step 1 Week 72 visit. If the 
Step 2 Registration visit is not combined, then all Step 2 eval uations must be performed 
within 2 weeks after the final Step 1 visit. Those participants  re-enrolling into the study after 
going off study at week 72 under protocol Version 1.0 will comp lete all evaluations listed in 
the Step 2 Registration column. 
NOTES: If a participant is unable to come to the clinic for the  Step 2 registration visit 
for any of the reasons outlined in the subsection paragraphs, R emote Data Collection, 
of section 6.3.3, sites are encouraged to perform an alternativ e consenting process 
(e.g., telephone, telehealth). Sites should inform their IRB about this alternate consent 
method for Step 2.    
All visits following Step 2 registration will have a ± 60-day visit window.  
b. Included the clarifications from A5354v2 CM#1 (dated 04/14/2 0) as follows. Newly added
text are in bold. The subsection ent itled, Remote 
Data Collecti on, will be incorporated at the 
end of section 6.3.3, Post-Entry Evaluations.  
Remote Data Collection 
It is preferable for study visits, as outlined in sections 6.1 and 6.2 Schedule of 
Evaluations (SOE), to be conducted in person. Study visits may be conducted remotely 
(e.g., telephone, telehealth) in the following situations:  
 A participant is unable to attend a visit because of personal illness, illness among
others in his or her home, or local conditions or guidelines re stricting travel to the clinic. 
 The site is temporarily unable to conduct non-essential visits in the clinic; the site must
inform the CMC when it has to stop non-essential visits. 
Regardless of the situation, sites should document which visits  were conducted remotely, 
attempt to obtain as much of the visit-specific required inform ation, based on the SOE, as 
possible, and record it on the relevant eCRF. The impacted visits and rationale must be 
reported and documented, following instructions provided by the  team or network 
leadership. 
Implementation of remote data collection is expected to be time -limited in relation to the 
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consultation with ACTG Network leadersh ip and the study 
sponsor, the protocol team will determine when remote data coll ection is no longer 
permitted. When such a determination is made, study sites will be formally notified and 
instructed to inform their IRBs/ECs as needed.

 FROM:  A5354 Protocol Team   SUBJECT: Clarification Memo #1 for A5354 Protocol Version 2.0 (SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic)  
  
This clarification memo (CM) does not result in a change in the  protocol informed 
consent document. The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) has determined that these protocol 
changes and clarifications should be implemented immediately in response to the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic, which poses a safety risk to participants and s ite staff. Sites do not 
need institutional review board (IRB) approval prior to impleme nting this CM. 
 
DAIDS does not require sites to forward this CM to their IRB; h owever, sites must follow 
their IRB's policies and procedures. If IRB review of CMs is re quired at a site, the site 
must submit this document for review. 
 
Each site should file a copy of this CM with the protocol for reference. 
 
The team is implementing this CM to provide guidance to sites about the final study visit completion under Final Version 1.0, the Step 2 registration und er Final Version 2.0, alternate 
methods to conducting the study visits, including data collection and documentation, and continuation of ART regimen for the entire duration of the stud y.

Persistence and on HIV-1-Specific Immune Responses.” These clar ifications will be included in 
the next version of the A5354 protocol if it is amended at a fu ture date. 
 
1. Only participants who are currently in follow-up and have co mpleted the final study visit 
(week 72) under Final Version 1.0 AND who provide consent on their willingness to 
participate in Final Version 2.0 will be permitted to register to Step 2 of the study. NOTE: 
Participants who have already been discontinued from the study are not permitted to re-
enroll at this time.  
 
If a participant is unable to come to the clinic for the Step 2 registration visit, sites are 
encouraged to perform an alternative consenting process (e.g., telephone, telehealth) 
provided sites inform their IRB about this alternate consent method.    
 
2. Section 5.1, Regimens, Administration, and Duration, was updated to include the following 
clarifications: 
 
Study treatment is defined as STR elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtri citabine/tenofovir alafenamide 
(EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafe namide (BIC/FTC/TAF), 
which will be provided through the study.  
 
NOTES: Switching of ARV regimen is allowed (i.e., from EVG/COBI/FTC/ TAF to 
BIC/FTC/TAF, or vice versa, or to an alternate non-study-provid ed ART) without consulting 
the CMC. Sites should ensure that participants who are enrolled into Ste p 2 have an 
adequate supply of study-provided drug (i.e., up to a 3-month p rovision) until a 
participant is able to come to the clinic for a study visit. If a participant is not able to 
return to the clinic for any reason and needs a refill of study-provided drug, sites 
must contact their protocol team pharmacist (via the Clinical M anagement Committee 
(CMC) at actg.cmcA5354@fstrf.org ) to establish the procedures for shipping study-
provided drug to the participant.  
   
3. Section 6.3.3, Post-Entry Evaluations, was updated to includ e the following clarifications at 
the end of the section:  
Remote Data Collection 
Study visits may be conducted remotely (e.g., telephone, telehe alth) in the following 
situations:  
 A participant is unable to attend a visit because of personal i llness, illness 
among others in his or her home, or local conditions or guideli nes restricting 
travel to the clinic.  
 The site is temporarily unable to conduct non-essential visits in the clinic; the 
site must inform the CMC when it has to stop non-essential visi ts. 
 
Regardless of the situation, sites should document which visits  were conducted 
remotely, attempt to obtain as much of the visit-specific required information, based 
on the SOE, as possible, and record it on the relevant eCRF. Th e impacted visits and 
rationale must be reported and documented, following instructio ns provided by the

Effect of Antiretroviral Treatment Initiated During Acute HIV -1 Infection on Measures of  HIV-1 
Persistence and on HIV -1-Specific Immune Responses  
 
 
DESIGN  This is a  phase II,  prospective, open- label two-step study to measure the 
effects of early antiretroviral therapy ( ART) on the establishment of HIV -1 
reservoir and HIV -1-specific immunity. Treatment -naïve participants with 
acute HIV -1 infection ( AHI) will have an  enrollment visit that  will include 
the immediate initiation of  ART. The primary endpoint is cell-associated 
HIV-1 DNA  (CAHD) in 5 million blood -derived CD4+ T- cells assayed by 
quantitative PCR (qPCR)  at week 48  on Step 1 .  
 
A subset of participants  who have completed week 48 on Step 1 will 
be consented for the optional  cerebrospinal fluid collection via lumbar 
puncture  (LP) and gut biopsy  via flexible sigmoidoscopy . A target of  25 
participants are estimated to have each of the above mentioned 
optional procedure. Participants may consent  to one or both  of these 
optional procedures,  which  will be performed at any time on Step 1 from 
week 60 to week 72 in willing participants.   Willing p articipants who have completed Step 1 follow-up without 
meeting the criteria for stud y discontinuation ( refer to section 9.2
) 
will be encouraged to continue on Step 2 and complete study 
evaluations through 144 weeks of Step 2 follow -up. Participants who 
had previously completed the study at week 72 under protocol Version 1.0 will be allowed to re- enroll in protocol V ersion 2.0 if , in 
the interim , these participants meet Step 2 eligibility criteria. The 
“re-enrolled” participants will be placed in the Fiebig group  in which  
they were initially enrolled in protocol V ersion 1.0.  
 
The Fiebig stage -classification system will be used to characterize the 
progression from HIV -1 exposure to HIV -1 seroconversion at the time of 
ART initiation. Plasma and serum samples will be collected at the time of 
ART initiation and the results of the Fiebig stage at ART initiation will be 
available to sites within 12 weeks. In this study, the Fiebig I -V stages of 
interest will be simplified into three study groups (based on HIV -1 
antibody diagnostic profile at the time of ART initiation) as described below.

  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Group 1:  Fiebig I/ II (non- reactive HIV -1 antibody ) 
Group 2: Fiebig III/IV (reactive HIV -1 antibody  and negative or 
indeterminate results on the Western blot or Geenius HIV -
1/HIV -2) (This study group is closed to enrollment  under 
protocol Version 1.0.)  
Group 3:  Fiebig V (reactive HIV -1 antibody  and positive Western blot or 
Geenius HIV -1/HIV -2 without p31 band)  (This study group is 
closed to enrollment  under protocol V ersion 1.0.)  
 
Participants who meet criteria for enrollment and are found to be in 
Group 2 or 3 based upon Fiebig staging at time of ART initiation will 
be followed in those groups per protocol. It is possible that a small 
number of participants will be determined to be in Fiebig VI (positive 
Western blot  or Geenius HIV -1/HIV -2 with p31 band) based on analys is of 
the entry samples even though these participants are not specifically 
targeted for enrollment in this study. Participants who are determined to 
be in Fiebig VI will be followed on the study for no more than 24 weeks 
on Step 1 , allowing ample time for them to pursue alternative sources for 
ART. Confirmed Fiebig VI and HIV negative participants will be 
replaced.   
 The Clinical Management Committee of the A5354 protocol team will 
review the Fiebig staging . 
 
DURATION U p to 216 weeks  (72 weeks on Step 1  and 144 weeks on Step 2) . 
 
SAMPLE SIZE  A total of 196 participants. Each study group had a target enrollment of 50 
participants under protocol Version 1.0. From these study groups, up to 
25 eligible participants will be asked to consent to each optional procedure.  
 
POPULATION  Men and women 18 years and older with AHI .  
 NOTE: Pregnant and breastfeeding women may enroll in the study.  
 
REGIMEN  The antiretroviral  (ARV)  regimen provided through the study  is the single 
tablet regimen elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 
(EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF)  or bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir 
alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF) . Other non- study -provided ARV regimens  
will be allowed for participants  who are pregnant, breastfeeding,  or 
unable/ unwilling to take EVG/COBI/FTC /TAF  or BIC/FTC/TAF , or for 
participants whose local health care/primary care provider prefers starting 
a different initial ARV regimen.

2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Persistent cellular reservoirs of HIV -1 are established very early in AHI [1]. Most proviral 
DNA is in CD4+ T -cells, particularly ce ntral and transitional memory T- cells that persist 
through homeostatic, antigen- driven, or other mechanisms of proliferation [2]. Very early 
ART may limit the seeding of cellular reservoirs of HIV -1 [3-5, 6]. Theoretic ally, ART 
initiated in the earliest Fiebig stages could limit the size and genetic diversity of the HIV -
1 reservoirs, thereby improving the chance of an HIV -1 cure. Paradoxically, however, 
post-treatment controllers in the VISCONTI cohort were mainly those  treated in later 
Fiebig stages, i .e., IV-V [7]. There are limited data assessing the impact of the timing of 
ART initiation during AHI on sensitive meas ures of reservoir size and on virologic and 
immunologic marke rs of immune control of HIV -1. Several large studies of early ART in 
acute and recent HIV -1 infection such as SPARTAC were designed to evaluate clinical 
outcome and CD4 + T-cells and HIV -1 RNA set  point after ART interruption [8]. The 
RV254 Thai study has enrolled mainly Fiebig I to III AHI part icipants, which limits its 
relevance to later Fiebig stages that are more commonly diagnosed in routine patient 
care. One of the largest studies evaluating residual viremia, proviral DNA and infectious virus afte r early ART had only 27 participants  [4]. Although CHAVI has provided detailed 
descriptions of the natural history of immunologic events in acute and early HIV -1 
infection, their studies did not focus on persons treated with modern ART. A thorough 
study is thus needed to define the impact of early ART on virologic and immunologic outcomes that are relevant to achieving HIV -1 cure [9]. Current Fiebig staging utilizes 
HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, 3rd generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA, IgM -sensitive), 2nd 
generation E IA (IgG- sensitive) and Western blot (WB) to categorize AHI into five stages 
[10].  
 The duration of these stages varies across individuals and is dependent on the rapidity of the HIV -1-specific a ntibody response. The protocol team hypothesizes that timing of 
ART initiation  during different stages of AHI will be predictive of the magnitude and 
characteristics of HIV -1 reservoirs  and the quantity and quality of HI V-1-specific immune 
responses. Longitudinal analysis i s needed to evaluate the ability of this staging system 
to discern the effects of ART instituted in each study group on HIV-1- specific immune 
responses and HIV reservoirs.  
 
Virologic  Outcomes of Interest a fter E arly ART  
As noted above, the impact of early  ART on the persistence of HIV -1-infected cells has 
been limited by the number of individuals studied and the detection limits of the assays 
used to detect persistent HIV -1. Assay detection limits can be improved by sampling 
larger numbers of cells for HIV -1 nucleic acid. Accordingly, large numbers of CD4+  T-
cells (5  million) will be assayed for HIV -1 DNA as the primary study endpoint [11]. 
Having no HIV -1 DNA in CD4+  T-cells detected by sensitive methods following ART is 
likely an indication of a limited HIV -1 reservoir that may improve the  chance of continued 
virologic  control after ART withdrawal. The timing of ART initiation could affect the 
number and location of HIV -1 integration sites, which in turn could affect clonal 
expansion, proviral expression, and responsiveness to anti- latency treatments [12-14]. 
 20 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
The impact of ART timing on HIV -1 integration sites could be evaluated  utilizing samples 
collected during this study . 
 
Immunologic Outcomes of Interest after ART  
The earliest HIV -1-specific T -cell responses are predominantly oligofunctional with 
multifunctional response increasing with time after infection. The epitopes recognized by 
T-cells during AHI may be narrow in range and non- immunodominant. Escape mutations 
can occur early after infection in some individuals and may im pact virologic control [15]. 
Early ART, depending on the time of its initiation, may prevent the generation of multifunctional T- cell responses [16], but may also preserve HIV -1-specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cell responses [17-22]. These observations were mainly derived from small 
studies of patients whose stage of AHI was not well characterized. In addition, the 
impact of the timing of ART initiation on the frequency of viral immune escape variants is 
undefined, particularly for minor escape variants that can only be detected by single 
genome sequencing or next generation sequencing methods. Immune escape variants 
pose a significant obstacle to immune control of HIV -1; thus identifying the optimal timing 
of ART initiation to prevent  their emergence is an exploratory  objective  of this study . 
 
To achieve sustained virologic control of HIV -1 (ART -free HIV -1 remission)  and to clear 
virus expressing cells , it is likely that immune -based therapies will be needed in addition 
to latency -reversing agents, and responses to such therapies  may differ depending on 
the pre- existing immune responses to HIV -1. Thus, the optimal strategy for manipulating 
the immune system may be different in infected individuals  who initiate ART at different 
Fiebig stages. Defining if and how immune responses persist or evolve over time in infected individuals  treated during AHI, and how they relate to reservoir size and viral 
diversity , will increase our  understanding of critical host -viral interactions and inform the 
development of immune- based therapies for HIV- 1 cure.  
 
Tissue HIV -1 Reservoirs  
HIV-1 preferentially persists in the gut mucosa, therefore,  larger reservoir sizes in gut 
tissue compared with the peripheral blood are observed even after successful ART [23, 
24]. While early ART is more beneficial than later ART in reducing HIV- 1 DNA in gut , 
there are limited data on ART effects on the types of latently infected cells [2 5-28]. In the 
central nervous system (CNS), CNS inflammation and CSF viremia are reported within 
days following HIV-1 exposure [29]. Latently infected cells and inflammation persist in 
the brain after suppressive ART, but it is not well understood how early ART impacts infected cells, low level virus, inflammation, and neuronal injury in the CSF. Failure to 
mount an adequate immune response to control viral replication and eliminate HIV -1-
infected cells in these compartments could directly jeopardize HIV -1 cure.   
 
The Contribution of A5354 to the Understanding of the Effects of Early ART on HIV -1 
Persistence and Immune Responses  
The i nvestigators of this study have engaged investigators of other NIH -funded early 
treatment cohort studies and received enthusiastic response for further cross -study 
collaborations. All groups  aim to  identify acutely infected individuals  and characterize 
their HIV -1 reservoir size after treatment. There are important differences between the 
studies as detailed in Table 2.1-1 . Notably, A5354 is unique in its broad inclusion of 
 21 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
individuals across continents who display different genetic profiles and HIV -1 clades, its 
primary endpoints, and its plans for extended follow -up to facilitate enrollment in 
interventional trials.  
 
The primary endpoint for A5354 is  novel. It is the only study that will extensively 
interrogate the HIV-1 reservoir after ART by performing tests to identify CAHD in large 
numbers of CD4+  T-cells. It will secondarily evaluate cell- associated HIV -1 RNA and 
extensively evaluate the HIV -1-specific immune responses to all HIV proteins, providing 
important information that will inform strategies for future immune- based therapies. The 
step- wise approach to performing invasive procedures is innovative and cost -effective.  
Herein, this study  will further investigate persistence of HIV-1 in tissues in those 
participants whose peripheral blood yields no detectable HIV -1 DNA. 
 
The RV254 Thai cohort establishes and characterizes an AHI cohort in a high risk 
population. This Division of AIDS (DAIDS)/Department of Defense -funded study  
commenced in 2009 and as of December  2015  has over 300 participants  enrolled. The 
study is continuing as an open enrolling cohort with an unlimited sample size. The study 
is conducted at one site in Bangkok with all enrollees being Thai. It has shown so far that 
HIV-1 reservoir size is small when ART is initiated early. The cohort primarily consists of 
Fiebig III followed by Fiebig I individuals, limiting the evaluation of outcomes across all 
Fiebig stages.  
 
The South African cohort, “A Prospective Study of the Virology and Immunology of HIV -1 
Infection in South African Blood D onors: Implementation of ART in Very E arly HIV -1 
Infection and Evolution of Elite Controllers” is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
funded protocol that is being developed as a collaboration between the University of 
California at San Francisco and the South African National Blood Service (SANBS). The 
acutely infected individuals  will be identified within the SANBS catchment areas and 
referred for trea tment at study sites.

Acute HIV -1 Infection I dentification  
Best effort must be taken to identify and treat persons with AHI. Several strategies may 
be employed with the goal of being able to enroll participants across the  study  groups 
(Fiebig I/II, III/IV, or V ) which include the following: 1) Frequent routine HIV -1 testing of 
high risk patients; 2) Outreach to testing sites and clinic/providers administering pre -
exposure and post -exposure prophylaxis; 3) Perform ance  of HIV-1 testing within one 
week of possible HIV -1 exposure and immediately with any acute retroviral syndrome -
like symptoms; 4) Engagement  of sites that have implemented 4th generation enzyme 
immunoassay ( EIA) or nucleic acid testing as part of HIV -1 testing as well as outreach to 
testing sites that conduct such t ests.  
 
Strategy for Rapid Diagnosis of AHI and Fiebig Staging  
Where practical , we recommend  deploy ing routine screening with 4th generation Ag /Ab 
combo assays (Abbott ARCHITECT  HIV-1/2 Combo or Bio -Rad HIV-1/2 Combo or 
Siemens AVIDA Centaur HIV -1/2 Combo ) with preference for the Abbott ARCHITECT  
chemiluminescence immunoassay (CMIA) because of the  rapid test  turn-around- time of 
approximately 30 minutes versus 2  hours for the Bio-R ad; in addition,  the broad dynamic 
CMIA range has the potential to use the S/CO  to establish HIV -1 infection recency  [30]. 
Using an algorithm of a 4th  generation Ag/Ab assay in combination with emerging 
technologies for rapid confirmatory and  discriminatory HIV -1/2 antibody screening (HIV 
IgG Multispot or the Geenius assay , once available) [31] followed by rapid HIV- 1 RNA 
testing using either the laboratory -in-a-tube  (IQuum/Ro che) 30 -minute quantitative HIV -
1 RNA test or the 60-minute Alere Diagnostics HIV -1/2 RNA assay, it is possible to 
ident ify participants in Fiebig I/II on the same day as  enrollment.  
 
There are cu rrently four Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved 4th generation 
HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab  screening assay platforms that allow for the diagnosis of acute or 
established HIV-1 infection. All four platforms are able to detect HIV -1 antigen and HIV -
1/2 antibodies in blood serum or plasma. One of these plat forms is an EIA  (Bio-Rad HIV -
1/2 Combo Ag/Ab EIA); two are a magnetic microparticle- based  CMIA  (Abbott 
ARCHITECT  HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo and Siemens ADVIA Centaur HIV -1/2 Ag/Ab 
Combo assay); and one is a luminex flow -based assay that differentiates HIV -1 antibody  
from HIV -1 p24 antigen and HIV -1 from HIV -2 antibodies (Bio-Rad BioPlex 2200 HIV Ag-
Ab assay). In addition, the recent FDA approval of the confirmatory Bio- Rad Geenius 
HIV-1/2 lateral flow antibody assay offers an opportunity to replace both the rapid 
Multispot HIV -1/2 and the WB with a discriminatory rapid (<30 minutes) antibody 
confirmation of a reactive 4th generation screening test and, in addition, estimates the 
Fiebig stage based on the detection of HIV -1 gag (p24), pol (p31) , and env (gp160, 
gp41) antibodies and for HIV -2, two env -speci fic peptides (gp36 and gp140). The 
available FDA -approved HIV-1 antibody screening and orthogonal confirmatory assays 
are listed in  the A5354 Manual of Procedures (MOPS) . 
 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) 4th generation screening 
algorithm may  be used to identify acute, early , and established HIV- 1 infection (see 
A5354 MOPS ). Where available the Geenius assay will be done immediately on site to 
detect or confirm HIV-1 antibody and to allow a preliminary Fiebig staging . Where 
 25 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
appropriate (e .g., reactive screen and negative antibody assay (e .g., Multispot  or 
Geenius) , an HIV -1 RNA will be performed at the site.  
 
An analysis of 39,721 specimens tested from a combined research and clinical testing 
service showed that the ARCHITECT  S/CO clearly distinguished the false positive 
(0.2%) from  AHI (0.1%) and established infection (1.33%) ( Figure 2.1-1). Interestingly, 
0.7% of the specimens had a S/CO of between 0.50 and 0.99. Three (10%) of the 30 
AHI had a S/CO of between 0.50 and 0.99, which suggests that in a high- seroincidence 
population, a S/CO less than 1.0 may identify additional AHI [30, 31]. 
 
We posit that the strength of the S/CO will equate with the likelihood of a particular 
infection stage in this high seroincidence study population. 
 
Figure2.1-1. Distribution of ARCHITECT  S/CO values:  A, B: non- reactive; C: 
intermediately reactive; D: false -positive; E: acute HIV -1 infection; F: established 
infection [ 32] 
 
We have shown that the 4th generation ARCHITECT  HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo assay in 
comparison to the 4th generation Bio- Rad Combo provides a greater dynamic S/CO  
range for determining recent infection (Figure 2.1 -2). The ARCHITECT  S/CO was also 
shown to be useful for differentiating acute from recent and established HIV -1 infections

WB and no anti -p31) versus VI (confirmed WB and anti- p31).

ARCHITECT  assay. However, a S/CO of between 0.5 and 10 that corresponds to HIV- 1 
p24 antigen positive AHI represents between 4 -5.5 log 10 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL [ 30]. 
Therefore, HIV -1 p24 antigen detection at a S/CO of 0.5 may correspond to 
approximately 6,000 HIV- 1 RNA copies/mL ( Figure 2.1-4 below), which is well above the 
lower limit of assay detection for commercial assays.  Participants with a previous 
ARCHITECT  S/CO ratio of <0.5 who now have a value ≥ 1.0 are eligible to enroll in the 
study pending the HIV-1 RNA determination. Potential partic ipants with S/CO >0.5 but 
<10 will require a positive HIV -1 RNA results prior to enrollment  (this criterion will 
decrease the incidence of false- positive HIV -1 infection) .

Challenges  
The majority  (19/23 , 83% ) of the ACTG international laboratories have an Abbott m2000 
system available, 10/23 (43%) also have the Roche COBAS TM , and most of the 
laboratories conduct HIV -1 RNA testing on -site. However, the turn- around- times (TAT) 
for results is highly variable from <24 hours up to 14 days even for on- site testing. The 
average TAT is 4.6 days and the median is 3 days. These times are independent of 
instrument; i .e., if it ta kes 2 days for results at one laboratory  on the Roche COBAS TM , 
it also takes 2 days for results at the same laboratory  using the Abbott m2000 system.  
Inclusion criteria for this study are designed to identify individuals during AHI while 
accommodating differences in testing at various study sites. Fiebig staging will be 
performed using standardized processes at reference laboratories on samples collected on the day of study entry.

PCR Assay for Detection of CAHD and Cell-associated RNA in CD4+  T-cells  
A qPCR assay with single -copy  sensitivity targeting a highly conserved region of 
integrase in the HIV -1 pol gene [33] will be used to detect HIV -1 DNA or RNA in 5  million 
total CD4 + T-cells.  
 
Antiretroviral Regimen  
The study will provide the open- label EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF  to all 
enrolled participants . The availability of these single -tablet regimen  (STR) integrase 
strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) -based regimens will facilitate the rapid initiation of 
therapy and reduction in viral load for those identified with AHI. Single -tablet  regimens 
may demonstrate improved adherence and participant satisfacti on over multi -pill 
regimens , and INSTI -containing regimens have repeatedly been shown to result in more 
rapid reduction in viral load when compared with non-INSTI -based therapy [34, 35].  
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF and BIC/FTC/TAF have been approved by the US FDA and both 
include the TAF formulation of tenofovir , which appears to have distinct safety 
advantages  over TDF .  
 
TAF is a second generation oral prodrug  of tenofovir, a nucleotide analog that when 
phosphorylated inhibi ts HIV -1 reverse transcriptase. TAF is metabolized to tenofovir 
intracellularly and can be used at a fraction of the dose of TDF with lower blood levels 
and higher intracellular levels . [36] There have been many clinical trials that have 
included TAF as wel l as EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF, including a p hase II  study (GS -US-292-
0102) that  included 58 participants  treated with the regimen with 88.4% having HIV -1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at 48 weeks by snapshot analysis compared with  87.9% in those 
given EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF. Results from the pharmacokinetic study showed that 10 mg 
TAF resulted in lower  blood plasm a levels of tenofovir than TD F at 300 mg with 
approximately five -fold higher levels of tenofovir diphosphate in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells ( PBMC) than with TDF .  
 
Two phase III  registrational trials (GS 104 and GS 111) have been completed and 
published comparing EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF with EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF in a combined 
study of more than 1700 ART- naïve individuals [ 37]. It is noteworthy that although the 
median CrCl of enrolled participants  exceeded 100 mL/minute, the studies did allow for 
enrollment of participants  with CrCl ≥ 50 mL/minute. The proportion with plasma HIV- 1 
RNA <50 copies/mL through 48 weeks by snapshot analysis was 90% in the TDF- versus 92% in the TAF- containing regimens with adjusted difference of 2.0%, 95% CI -
0.7 to 4.7, meeting pre- speci fied non- inferiority criteria. Furthermore, there was no 
difference in response in either group based upon baseline plasma HIV -1 RNA (less 
than or equal to or greater than 100,000 copies/ mL) or CD4 + T-cell count (less than or 
greater than or equal to 200 cells/µ L). Protocol -specified virologic failure (VF) was similar 
and low in both groups as was emergent drug resistance, and the pattern of such 
resistance was similar between study groups . The mean increase  in CD4 + T-cell count 
was significantly greater at 48 weeks in the TAF versus TDF group at 230 versus  211 
cells/ µL, respectively  (p=0.024) . The frequency of any AE  was 90% in both groups with 
only 1% in each group having drug- related Grade 3 or 4 AEs. Common AEs occurring at 
least in 5% of individuals were also similar between groups with most frequent being 
diarrhea, nausea, and headache. Special attention was given to the difference in effect 
 30 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0

on renal function and bone density in these studies since these are recognized AEs 
associated with TDF use. The TAF group had significantly smaller mean serum 
creatinine increases than those given a TDF-based regimen (0.08 versus  0.12 mg/dL, 
p<0.001), less proteinuria (median percent change -3.0 versus 20; p<0.001), and 
significantly smaller decrease in bone mineral density at spine (mean % change -1.3 
versus  -2.86; p<0.001) and hip (mean % change - 0.66 versus - 2.95; p<0.001). There  
was a significantly greater increase in total, LDL and HDL cholesterol as well as triglycerides in those receiving a TAF- rather than a TDF-containing regimen, although 
no difference was seen  in total cholesterol:HDL ratio.  The package insert for 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF allows for treatment of participants  with CrCl ≥ 30 mL/minute

study if they are able to access appropriate alternate regimens according to local guidelines.   
 
BIC is an HIV -1 INSTI. It has shown synergistic effects when combined with other 
ARVs including TAF and FTC. It has a median half -life of 15.9 to 20.9 hours [ 38, 
39], and is cleared equally through UGT1A1 glucuronidation and CYP3A4 
oxidation. BIC has a superior resistance profile compared to some of the other 
currently approved drugs in the same class. It is potent against a panel of patient -
derived HIV -1 isolates wit h high-level INSTI resistance. A 10 -day dose ranging 
study of BIC monotherapy showed anti -viral effects in both ARV -naïve and ARV -
experienced (INSTI -naïve) people [40] . A randomized, double -blind, placebo 
controlled Phase II study compared BIC 75mg/FTC 200mg/TAF 25 mg (n=65) 
versus DTG 50mg/FTC 200mg/TAF 25mg (n=33) in ARV -naïve adults. At week 24, 
63 of 65 (96.9%) in BIC group versus  31 of 33 (93.9%) in DTG group had HIV RNA < 
50 copies/ml. Adverse events were reported in 85% in the BIC group versus 67% 
in the DTG group. Most common AEs were diarrhea and nausea.  One participant 
in the BIC group discontinued due to urticari al reaction . No SAEs or deaths 
occurred [ 41]. A Phase III randomized, controlled, clinical trial of BIC/FTC/TAF 
versus DTG/FTC/TAF in ARV- naïve adults showed the former was non- inferior to 
the latter  for virological suppression . There was no treatment -emergent 
resistance. BIC/FTC/TAF was  safe and showed less reduction  in eGFR compared 
to DTG/FTC/TAF. There were no discontinuations due to renal side effects, and 
changes in lipid parameters were similar between arms ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). An 
ongoing Phase III study comparing the STR of BIC/FTC/TAF (n=314) with 
DTG/ABC/3TC (n=315) in treatment -naïve adults showed similar viral suppression 
< 50 copies/ mL at week 48: 92.4% with BIC/FTC/TAF versus 93% with 
DTG/ABC/3TC. The discontinuation rates were similar between arms: 6% versus 
5%, respectively. Most common side effects in the BIC versus DTG arms were 
diarrhea (12.7% versus 13%), headache (11.5% versus 13.7%) and nausea (10.2 
versus 22.9%) ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). There are four ongoing P hase III switch studies, 
with three evaluating safety and effectiveness of the switch to BIC/FTC/TAF from 
any suppressive ARV regimen ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
The fourth study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  will perform similar evaluations but with a switch 
to BIC/FTC/TAF from  regimens with  DTG and either FTC/TDF  or FTC/TAF.

Urgency of ART Initiation  
Results of the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study highlight the 
clinical benefits of initiating ART soon after HIV-1 diagnosis, regardless of CD4+ T -cell 
count [42]. Randomization into early and deferred treatment arms was halted in May 
2015, after a scheduled interim review of study data by the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board. Over an averag e follow -up of 3 years, the risk of AIDS, other serious illn esses or 
death was reduced by 57%  among those in the early treatment group compared with  
those in the deferred treatment group. The study authors reported 42 instances of AIDS, 
serious non -AIDS illness , or death among those  enrolled in the study’s early treatment 
group compared with 96 such events in the deferred treatment group. Similar results 
were seen in the TEMPRANO study; immediate ART initiation reduced the incidence of 
death or severe HIV -related illness by 44% as compared with delayed initiation of ART 
after CD4 + T-cell count dropped below 500 cells/mm3 [43]. These results have impacted 
treatment guidelines to favor universal treatment of HIV infection as soon as it is diagnosed.  
 There is a particular  urgency to initiate ART during the first few weeks of infection, as 
this may limit the establishment of HIV latency [3-6]. Seeding of the latent HIV reservoir 
begins very early in AHI and the reservoir increases in size as individuals progress through the Fiebig stages [2, 5]. Fiebig I -IV stages are each projected to last an average 
of only about 3- 5 days and some individuals may progress even more rapidly [10]. 
Investigator s anticipate that individuals who have a high- risk for incident HIV -1 infection 
will be referred for possible enrollment in this protocol upon receipt of laboratory results suggesting recent HIV -1 infection. It is critical that these potential participants  be 
screened for study entry and enrolled into the protocol before they advance in their 
Fiebig staging. Urgent enrollment and immediate initiation of ART is necessary in order 
to limit establishment of the latent HIV-1 reservoir and, in this study, to ensure that 
enrollment includes participants who initiated ART during the very earliest Fiebig stages.  
 
For these reasons, consenting individuals who satisfy criteria for enrollment into this 
study will begin ART on the day of study entry. HIV-1 RNA testing will also be performed  
at the time of study entry. ART initiation will not be delayed while awaiting results of HIV -
1 tests in participants with high likelihood of having AHI  based on inclusion criteria. 
Results of entry HIV-1 testing will generally be made available within 72 hours.  
There is a theoretical possibility that participants will be enrolled but  are later  discovered 
not to be infected with HIV -1. Enrollment criteria defined by signal-to-cutoff ratio 
(S/CO) of 4th generation EIA do not all include confirmatory HIV -1 testing, but have 
been shown to have a positive predictive value of nearly 100% [Bob Coombs, personal 
communication]. In rare cases  in which individuals are started on ART and later found 
not to be infected with HIV -1, these individuals will typically receive three or fewer  doses 
of ART while awaiting the results of HIV-1 RNA testing, which will generally be made 
available within 72 h ours of study entry. ART will be stopped as soon as the negative 
HIV-1 test result is reported. The safety of ART has been well -documented in HIV-1-
uninfected individuals who receive ART for both pre- exposure and post -exposure 
prophylaxis [ 44-49]. The brief ART exposure that is a potential, but unlikely, outcome of 
ART initiation upon study entry is expected to be safe and well -tolerated.

Feasibility of A5354 Enrollment  
The ACTG site survey (conducted in late 2014) has illustrated marked enthusiasm and 
feasibility for enrolling thi s study within DAIDS n etworks. Of 43 sites that completed the 
survey, 63% actively screen for AHI, 78% of sites routinely perform 4th generation EIA 
for HIV diagnostics, and 60% perform NAT on antibody negative s amples. In addition, 
84% of sites confirmed the capability to identify and initiate ART in acutely infected 
participants . Capabilities for performing invasive procedures were high with percentages 
of sites able to perform each procedure as follows: 75% for  leukapheresis, 92% for gut 
biopsy, 83% for lymph node biopsy, 97% for lumbar puncture , and 97% for  genital 
secretion collection. These sites are located in the US and internationally ( Thailand, 
Kenya, South Africa, and Peru). Specifically , there were 18 sites (6 domestic and 12 
international) that estimated enrollment of at least 10 acutely infected individuals per 
year and can also perform at least one invasive procedure.   
 
We intend to enroll individuals at ACTG sites with experience treating and  following HIV -
1-infected individuals . Sites will be selected based on the following criteria: 1) actively 
screen for  AHI, 2) track record of identifying acutely infected individuals , 3) demonstrate 
high retention and viral suppression rates on ART in previous studies, and 4) are 
capable of performing large volume blood draw  or the optional leukapheresis.  
 
The study team is confident that it will be feasible to enroll 196 participants in a 36-
month period. As of May 22, 2019, 202 individuals have been screened for 
enrollment into the study and 168 participants have been enrolled. Group 1 
remains open to accrual  and is nearing its target enrollment.  Groups 2 and 3 have 
been fully accrued under  protocol Version 1.0.  
 
Inclusion of Pregnant and Breastfeeding Women  
The inclusion of pregnant women in this study helps maintain the feasibility of enrolling an adequate number of female participants  in order to achieve overall enrollment goals . 
A new diagnosis of pregnancy indicates recent unprotected sexual activity  that, 
particularly in high -risk populations, may lead to HIV-1 acquisition. During pregnancy, 
immunological and hormonal changes affect the mucosa of the genital tract and increase 
the risk of HIV -1 acquisition [ 50, 51 ]. Previous studies have demonstrated higher rates of 
HIV-1 seroconversion among pregnant women than among non- pregnant peers [ 51-54]. 
The ongoing RV217 cohort study that screens HIV- negative participants at high risk for 
HIV-1 infection twice weekly to capture AHI observed 25 of the fi rst 48 female 
participants to be pregnant at some point during the study [Merlin Robb, personal communication]. Both the US Department of Health and Human Services ( DHHS ) adult 
and adolescent HIV treatment  guidelines and the perinatal HIV  treatment  guidelines 
recommend the initiation of ART in all pregnant women with acute or recent HIV -1 
infection as soon as possible in order to maximally reduce plasma HIV -1 RNA, both to 
improve maternal health and prevent perinatal transmission of HIV -1 (AI strength of 
recommendation) [55, 56 ]. Pregnant participants will not be eligible to volunteer for 
optional invasive procedures. Blood volumes collected from pregnant participants will be carefully monitored and will be adjusted as needed to maintain the safety of the 
participant.  Breastfeeding practice is common in many countries where the study sites 
are located. The DHHS guidelines highlight the increased risk of perinatal transmission 
 33 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
of HIV -1 during breastfeeding i n women with AHI; therefore, this protocol recommends 
ART initiation  in all HIV -1-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women . Because there 
are limited data on the safety of EVG/COBI/FTC/ TAF and BIC/FTC/TAF in pregnant and 
breastfeeding women, this protocol recommends that study sites secure alternat ive 
regimens according to local guidelines for these women until they are no longer 
pregnant or breastfeeding, at which time, they have the options to stay on the same 
regimen or use the regimen provided by  this study.  
 
Extended Follow -up Period  for All Study Groups Enrolled into Step 2 
Enrollment into the extended follow -up period (Step 2) for all study groups will 
require that participants have maintained virologic suppression while on study (i.e., no virologic failure per protocol definition) and have not discontinued from 
the study for other reasons through  week 72. As of the May 22, 2019 monitoring 
report, w e estimated that 74% of participants will qualify for the extended Step 2 
follow-up period . The team’s intention is to have these participants continue on 
study for an additional 3 years ( after the final Step 1 visit at week 72) with the 
extended follow -up visits occurring every 24 weeks until 144 weeks after entry to 
Step 2. Step 2 will involve limited evaluations, and there will be no invasive 
procedures. We expect that safety laboratory testing will be done according to standard of care outside of the protocol  and no less than every 6 months.  
 
Inclusion of Re-enrolled Participants from A5354 Version 1.0  into Step 2  
Group 1, 2, and 3 participants who completed the study at week 72 and went off study under protocol Version 1.0 will be allowed to re- enroll if they have 
maintained virologic suppression and  meet the Step 2 eligibility criteria. The “re-
enrolled” participants will be placed in the  Fiebig group in which  they were 
initially enrolled  in under protocol Version 1.0 and will be followed per the Step 2 
schedule.   The rationale  for the extended follow -up period is to expand the number of 
available participants for future therapeutic and cure studies without the burden 
of frequent visits and the cost of study -provided laboratory testing . 
 2.2 Rationale  
The study -provided regimen is STR EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or BIC/FTC/TAF . Other non -
study -provided ARV regimens will be allowed for participants who are pregnant, 
breastfeeding, or unable/ unwilling to take EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF , or for 
participants whose local health care/primary care provider  prefers starting a different 
initial ARV regimen .  
 
This study aims to understand the extent of HIV- 1 reservoir establishment  and HIV-1- 
specific immune responses across stages of AHI before and after suppressive ART in the context of diverse HIV -1 clades. Such insight will be critical in designing therapeutic 
strategies and understanding the responses observed to future interventions in cure-related studies. The study will also provide a well -characterized and virologically 
suppressed cohort of individuals who are well suited to test novel curative interventions 
 34 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
as they emerge.  The primary rationale for conducting this study is to achieve the 
following goals:  
1. Design a study to leverage existing infrastructure, resources , and expertise across 
DAIDS n etworks t o determine the effect of ART initiated during different stages of 
AHI on HIV -1 persistence and HIV -1-specific immune responses.  
2. Make ART available through this study to eligible individuals  to initiate ART within a 
very short time of being diagnosed with AHI. 
3. Accumulate a cohort of well -characterized participants who initiated ART during 
different stages of AHI with expected differences in HIV- 1 reservoirs and HIV -1-
specific immune responses and who will be well -suited for studies of curative 
interventions . 
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a Phase II , prospective, open- label two-step study to measure the effects of 
early ART on the establishment of HIV -1 reservoi r and HIV -1-specific immunity. 
Participants will be enrolled if they fulfill the inclusion criteria for AHI diagnosis within 7 
days prior to entry and will have an enrollment visit  with the immediate initiation of ART. 
Plasma and serum samples for Fiebig staging will be collected at the time of ART 
initiation.  
 
Participant s will be followed for up to 216 weeks  in Steps 1 and 2. Evaluations at weeks 
2 and 8 on Step 1 will be performed via telephone. The primary endpoint is CAHD in 5 
million blood -derived CD4+ T- cells assayed by qPCR  at week 48 on Step 1 .  
 
A subset of eligible participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 who have completed week 48 
on Step 1 will be consented for CSF collection via lumbar puncture  and/or  gut biopsy  
via flexible sigmoidoscopy . A target of  25 participants are estimated to have each of 
the aforementioned optional procedure. These procedures are optional and 
particip ants may consent  to one or both  of them , which  will be performed at any time 
from week 60 to week 72  on Step 1.   
 
The Fiebig stage -classification system will be used to characterize the progression from 
HIV-1 exposure to HIV-1 seroconversion at the time of ART initiation . Samples of 
plasma and serum will b e collected at the time of ART initiation, and the results of the 
Fiebig stage at ART initiation will be available within 12 weeks  following entry to Step 
1. In this study, the five Fiebig stages of interest will be simplified into three study groups  
as described below  (based on HIV -1 antibody diagnostic profile at time of ART 
initiation ). 
Group 1:  Fiebig I/II (non- reactive HIV -1 antibody)  
Group  2:  Fiebig III/IV (reactive HIV -1 antibody  and negative or indeterminate results on 
the WB or Geenius HIV -1/HIV -2) (This study group is closed to enrollment  
under protocol Version 1.0 .) 
Group 3:  Fiebig V (reactive HIV -1 antibody  and positive WB or Geenius HIV -1/HIV -2 
without p31 band)  (This study group is closed to enrollm ent under 
protocol Version 1.0.)  
 35 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
 
Each study group had a target enrollment of 50 participants under protocol 
Version 1.0. Study Groups 2 and 3 reached their target enrollment under protocol 
Version 1.0; therefore , the original inclusion criteria from protocol Version 1.0 
corresponding to these groups are no longer applicable for eligibility into the 
study. Participants who meet criteria for enrollment and are found to be in Group 
2 or 3 based upon Fiebig staging at time of ART  initiation  will be followed in those 
groups per protocol. Participants who are enrolled in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will 
complete Step 1 of the study at week 72, and willing participants who have 
completed Step  1 follow-up without meeting the criteria for study discontinuation 
(refer to section 9.2 ) will be encouraged to continue on Step 2 and complete study 
evaluations through 144 weeks of Step 2 follow -up. For those participants who 
completed the week 72 visit under protocol Version 1.0 and meet eligibility criteria for re-enrollment into Step 2, they will remain on Step 2 for up to 144 weeks of 
follow-up. 
 Although participants in Fiebig VI (positive WB or Geenius HIV -1/HIV-2 with p31 
band) are not specifically targeted for enrollment in this study, it is possible that a small number of participants will be determined to be in Fiebig VI based on analysis of the entry samples and will be followed on the study for no more than 
24 weeks on Step 1 . In order to provide time to ensure a smooth transition off of the 
study without compromising the continuity of ART, participants  who are determined to be 
in Fiebig VI (based on centralized testing)  will be followed on study for no more than 
24 weeks on Step 1 allowing ample time for them to pursue alternative sources for 
ART. Confirmed Fiebig VI and HIV negative participants will be replaced.  
 
NOTE: The CMC will review the Fiebig stage determination outcome and will ensure that 
these results are communicated to the site s (refer to  details in A5354 MOPS).  
 The study -provided regimen is STR EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF . 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF and BIC/FTC/TAF  are being provided for the following reasons: 1) 
rapid decline in viremia and potential to reduce reservoir seeding with INSTI , 2) 
generally low frequencies of transmitted INSTI resistance, 3) potentially improved 
adherence with STRs, and 4) the TAF formulation may have fewer renal and bone adverse effect  than TDF . Other non-study -provided ARV regimens will also be allowed 
for participants are pregnant, breastfeeding, or unable/unwilling to take EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or BIC/FTC/TAF , or for participants  whose local health 
care/primary care provider prefers starting a different initial ARV regimen . Investigators 
may choose an appropriate non -study -provided ARV regimen for  any of these reasons . 
Alternat ive regimens will not be provided by the study, but their use does not preclude 
participation in the study. This  flexibility is expected to enhance enrollment and 
adherence to the study  requirements . Use of alternat ive regimens other than 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF  must  not delay the initiation of ART.

Table 5.4.3 -1: Precautionary Medications for EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  
 
• Take caution when used in patients with known risk factors for liver diseases 
and impaired renal function.  
• Reduction of the dosage of Emtriva is recommended for patients with impaired 
renal function.  
• Take caution when used in patients at risk for renal dysfunction and/or who 
have new onset or worsening renal impairment.  
 46 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0

• Take caution when used in combination with a protease inhibitor and 
cobicistat.  
Anticoagulants  
Antifungals  
Anti-inflammatory  Colchicine  
Rivaroxaban  
Voriconazole  
• Take caution when used in patients with medical conditions (e.g., new onset or 
worsening renal impairment) or who are receiving drugs needing monitoring 
with estimated creatinine clearance.  
• Coadministration of Tybost and tenofovir DF is not recommended in patients who have an estimated creatinine clearance below 70 mL/min because dose 
adjustment of tenofovir DF is required below 50 mL/min and such dose 
adjustments have not been established for coadministration with Tybost.  
• Coadministration of Tybost and tenofovir DF in combination with concomitant 
or recent use of a nephrotoxic ag ent is not recommended.  
The following ARVs are not recommended in combination with Tybost because 
dosing recommendations for such combinations have not been established, and co-administration may result in decreased plasma concentrations of the ARV 
agents, leading to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance:  
• More than one ARV that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement (i.e., two protease inhibitors or a protease inhibitor in combination with elvitegravir)  
• Atazanavir in combination with efavirenz in treatment -experienced patients  
• Atazanavir in combination with etravirine  
• Darunavir 600 mg twice daily  
• Darunavir in combination with efavirenz, nevirapine, or etravirine  
• Other HIV -1 protease inhibitors including fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or 
tipranavir  
• Tybost in combination with Stribild fixed -dose combination tablets (elvitegravir, 
cobicistat, emtricitabine, tenofovir DF) is not recommended because cobicistat 
is a component of Stribild.  
• Tybost in combination with lopinavir/ritonavi r or regimens containing ritonavir 
is not recommended due to similar effects of Tybost and ritonavir on CYP3A.

6.3 Timing of Evaluations  
 
6.3.1 Screening Evaluations   
 
Screening evaluations must occur prior to the participant  starting any study 
medications.  
 
Screening evaluations to determine eligibility must be completed within 7 days 
prior to study entry unless otherwise specified.   
 
NOTE: The screening evaluations can be combined with entry evaluations and 
can occur on the same day.  
 In addition to data being collected on participant s who enroll into the study, 
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on screening failures will be captured 
in a Screening Failure Results form  and entered into the ACTG database.  
 
6.3.2 Entry  Evaluations  
 
Entry ev aluations must occur after the screening  evaluations , unless otherwise 
specified, and can  occur on the same day .  
 NOTE: All Step 1 post-entry evaluations occur in reference to the date on 
which the participant initiates ART treatment.  All Step 2 post -entry 
evaluations occur in reference to the date of enrollment into Step 2.  
 
Participants must immediately initiate ART  at the time of Step 1 study entry , 
ideally, within 24 hours but no later than 48 hours  after registration/enrollment . If 
ART is  not started within 48  hours after  enrollment , the site staff should contact 
the protocol team immediately for approval to redraw blood samples for HIV-1 
RNA and  Fiebig staging and to initiate  ART on the same  day as redraw .  
  
For participant s who  initiate d ART more than 48 hours after  enrollment  and who 
did not have  blood samples redrawn for HIV-1 RNA and Fiebig staging on the 
day of ART initiation, the site staff should contact the protocol team immediately 
for approval  to redraw blood samples for HIV- 1 RNA and Fiebig staging and to 
have the participant s continue on ART. If allowed to remain on the study, their 
participation may end at  the Step 1 week 24  visit if deemed by the study team 
that they are no longer  eligible for the study  based on the centralized testing 
results for Fiebig stage .  
 Pregnancy testing should be done prior to ART initiation to inform selection of 
ART, but pregnancy  is not an exclusion criterion for enrollment .  
 
HIV-1 RNA test ing will also be performed  at the time of study entry. Results of 
the HIV -1 RNA test will generally be made available within 72 hours. ART 
 52 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
initiation will not be delayed while awaiting confirmation of the entry HIV-1 RNA 
result s.  
 
Results of baseline hematology, chemistry, and liver function testing will also 
generally be made available within 72 hours of study entry. The results of 
baseline laboratory evaluations  and urinalysis  will be reviewed with each study 
participant as part of the clinical assessment at week 1. ART may be dose-
adjusted, otherwise altered, or discontinued if the estimated glomerular filtration 
rate is reduced or other medical indications for therapeutic changes are detected.  
 NOTE: ART must  be started immediately even if the baseline safety laboratory 
results are not available within the 48 -hour window.    
 
If an HIV -1 resistance genotype is performed as part of clinical care during 
screening or any time on the study, the results of that genotyping  report  will be 
collec ted. The site investigator may use this information to guide a change in 
ART, if clinically indicated, potentially including a change f rom the  study -provided 
ARV regimen to a non -study -provided  ARV regim en or a change from a non-
study -provided ARV regimen to the study -provided ARV regimen  or a change 
between the two study- provided ARV regimen s. Stored blood may be used 
for additional genotype testing for research purposes.  This testing will not be 
done in real -time. 
 
6.3.3 Post-Entry Evaluations  
 
All post -entry evaluations occur in reference to the date of ART initiation .  
 
On-ART Step 1 Evaluations   
The on- treatment visits have the following window:  
• W eeks 1 and 2 (±3  days ) for all participants  
• W eeks 4 and 8  (±7 days ) for all participants  
• W eeks 12  and 24 (±14 days ) for all participants  
• Week 36 (±14 days)  
• W eek 48 ( -14 days through +3 days)   
• W eek 49 (optional, if needed to achieve blood volume collection goal at 
week 48; -3 days through +14 days)   
• week 60 and 72 (±42 days)  
 
Step 1 Telephone Evaluations    
Evaluations that are scheduled for weeks 2 and 8 on Step 1 will be completed 
by the site staff via telephone (in lieu of an in -person visit by the participant ) and 
documented on the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  Site staff will call the 
participant to inquire about recent Grade ≥2 AEs and provide adherence 
counseling. If any Grade ≥2 AEs that require further investigation are reported, 
the participant may be asked to present for in- person evaluation.  Follow -up 
phone calls may be indicated. Site staff may use the telephone script provided 
 53 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
in the A5354 MOPS as guidance and for documentation of the telephone 
encounter(s) . 
 
NOTE: The day following the optional gut biopsy  via flexible sigmoidoscopy  
and/or lumbar puncture procedures to be performed between week s 60 and 72, 
site staff will contact the participants via telephone to inquire how they are 
feeling, which will be documented on the eCRF (refer to section 6. 4.11 for 
additional information). If any symptoms are present on the day of the initial 
telephone call, follow -up phone calls to the participants are recommended.  Site 
staff must ensure that the follow- up phone calls are completed as part of the 
follow-up of optional procedure evaluations.  
 
Step 2 Evaluations  
The Step 2 Registration  evaluation may be combined with the Step 1 Week 
72 visit. If the Step 2 Registration visit is not combined, then all Step 2 
evaluations must be performed within 2 weeks after the final Step 1 visit .  
Those participants re- enrolling into the  study after going off study at week 
72 under protocol V ersion 1.0  will complete all evaluations listed in the 
Step 2 Registration column.  
 
All visits following Step  2 registration will have a ± 60 -day visit window.  
 
Study Completion Evaluations   
The week 24 visit on Step 1 will be the final study visit for participants who 
initiated ART during Fiebi g VI (based on confirmed Fiebig stage results ), and 
these participants will be replaced.  For Step 2, t he final visit  will occur at 
week 144 for all the study groups, except in cases of premature study discontinuation as described in section 6.3.5
. Upon study completion, ART 
will no longer be provided through the study (i .e., post -trial access to ART is not 
within the scope of A5354). The study team will ensure that participants are referred to appropriate health facilities to continue their ART. After the study 
ends, ART regimens may be modified according to local practices and decision by the participants and their physicians. 
 
6.3.4 Confirmation of Virologic Failure ( VF) Evaluation  on Step 1 and Step 2  
 
VF is defined as having two consecutive HIV -1 RNA >200 copies/mL  24 weeks 
or more after study entry , or at any time after  achieving HIV -1 RNA <50 
copies/mL . A confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA me asurement  and other 
evaluations per sections 6.1  and 6.2 should be done as soon as possible, 
ideally within 7 to 14 days of the initial sample with a HIV -1 RNA > 200 copies/mL . 
If the visit for HIV -1 RNA  confirmation coincides with a regularly scheduled visit, 
the evaluations should be combined.  Refer to  section 6.3 .5 for instructions on 
the discontinuation evaluations for participants who have confirmed VF.  
Participants who interrupt ART for ≥7 consecutive days prior to meeting criteria for VF should be managed per  
section 6.3.6 .  
 54 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
 
NOTE: If genotyping is performed as part of routine care, then the results will be 
documented in the e CRF. Stored blood may be used for additional genotype 
testing for research purposes.  
 
6.3.5 Discontinuation Evaluations  
 
Evaluations for Registered Participants Who Do Not Start ART 
For participants who do not initiate ART per section 6.3 .2, all eCRFs must be 
keyed for the period up to and including the e ntry visit . These participants are 
not required to complete any study discontinuation visit. These 
participants will be replaced.  
 
Evaluations for Registered Participants Found NOT to H ave HIV -1 Infection 
Participants who initiated  ART and are subsequently determined not to have HIV -
1 infection will stop all ART , undergo a study discontinuation visit (refer to 
sections 6.1  and 6.2 for discontinuation evaluations) , and discontinue study 
follow- up (refer to section 6.4 .9 for the HIV -1 RNA detectable threshold 
requirement ). These participants  will be replaced. 
 
Premature Study Discontinuation Evaluations  
Participants who are confirmed to have VF or prematurely discontinue from the 
study  for other reasons  will have the study discontinuation evaluations 
performed (per sections 6.1  and 6.2) within 12 weeks of being notified of the 
need for study discontinuation . This may include recruitment for 
participation in future studies that enroll participants who initiated ART 
during AHI. In such cases, A5354 study discontinuation evaluations should 
be performed at or before enrollment into the new study.  
 
6.3.6 ART Inter ruption  
 
Participants who interrupt ART for ≥7 consecutive days will be considered for 
withdrawal from the study.  If the ART interruption occurs prior to study 
week 24 on Step 1 and the participant has not previously demonstrated an HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/m L (prior to the interruption  lasting ≥7 consecutive 
days), then the participant will be withdrawn from the study and undergo 
the premature study discontinuation evaluation (section 6.3 .5), after which 
study drug will no longer be provided. This visit should occur by week 24 on Step 1, or within 12 weeks of being notified of the need for study 
discontinuation, whichever is later. This timeline should allow the study 
staff and participant to identify an alternative source of medication.  
 
If the participant has previously been documented to have HIV -1 RNA <50 
copies/mL or the ART interruption occurs at study week 24 or later  in Step 
1 or Step 2, then the participant will be evaluated for VF ( section 6.3.4
). If 
the confirmatory HI V-1 RNA results indicate VF, then the participant will be 
withdrawn from the study and undergo premature study discontinuation 
 55 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
evaluation.  If the confirmatory HIV -1 RNA results do not indicate VF, then the 
participant  will remain in the study for continued  follow- up and will complete all 
scheduled study evaluations per sections 6.1 and 6.2, except no PBMC and 
plasma collection will be performed after the collection at week 48 on Step 1 
and no optional procedures at week 60 or 72 on Step 1 .

ART Modifications   
All modifications to ARV  medications including initial doses, participant -initiated 
and/or pro tocol -mandated interruptions  (that are ≥7 days) , modifications, 
permanent discontinuations, and last doses on study will be recorded.  
 
In Step 2, all modifications to ARV medications will be recorded.   
 
ART Initiation    
ART must be initiated at the time of study entry, ideally, within 24 hours  but no 
later than 48 hours after registration/study entry. If ART is not initiated within 48 hours after enrollment, and the participant remains eligible based on at least one 
inclusion criteria in section 4.1.1
, the site staff should  contact the protocol team 
immediately for approval to redraw blood samples for HIV -1 RNA and Fiebig 
staging and to initiate ART on the same day as redraw.  
 
For participants who initiated ART more than 48 hours after enrollment and who 
did not have blood samples redrawn for HIV -1 RNA and Fiebig staging on the 
day of ART initiation, the site staff should contact the protocol team immediately for approval to redraw blood samples for HIV -1 RNA and Fiebig staging and to 
have the participants continue on ART. If allowed to remain on the study, their 
participation may end at week 24 if deemed by the study team that they  are no 
longer  eligible for the study .  
 
6.4.7 Laboratory Evaluations  
 
At Step 1 entry and Step 2 registration, record all protocol -required laboratory 
values (performed by local laboratories)  with exception of the urinalysis , 
regardless of grade . For post -entry assessments, record all laboratory values for 
creatinine, CrCl, AST  (SGOT) , and ALT (SGPT) regardless of  grade.  
 
Please refer to section 7.2
 for AE reporting requirements for abnormal laboratory 
findings.  
 
NOTE: Creatinine clearance should be graded using the categorical  mL/min 
values from the DAIDS AE Grading Table, which begins with values below 90 mL/min. The percent change criteria will not app ly to A5354. In Step 2, 
only creatinine clearance greater than Grade 2 should be reported.

  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
 
Hematology , Chemistries , and  Liver Function Tests  
• Hemoglobin or hematocrit, white blood cells,  and platelets.  
• Serum c reatinine will be tested and used to calculate CrCl using the Cockroft -
Gault equation.  Refer to the calculat or located on the FSTRF website.  
 
AST and ALT 
Other laboratory tests for the optional procedures  between weeks 60 and 72: 
• Prothrombin time /partial prothrombin time  for the optional procedures  
• Complete blood count for the optional gut biopsy  
 
NOTE: Refer to the A5354 MOPS for additional information on these laboratory 
tests for the optional procedures . 
 
At Step 1 entry, the safety laboratory results for  CrCl, AST, and ALT will 
generally be available to  the site  within 72 hours after study entry and ART 
initiation . If necessary, the ARV regimen will be immediately adjusted upon 
recognition of relevant laboratory abnormalities, and site staff must notify the CMC of the adjustment in ART. The results of baseline laboratory evaluations will 
be reviewed with each study participant as part of the clinical assessment at 
week 1.  
 
In Step 2, record the results  of the safety laboratory tests, if available  as 
part of routine care. Perform only if not done and available as part of routine care.  
 
Urinalysis  
Blood, glucose, leukocyte esterase, pH, and protein. Reflex to microscopic 
urinalysis if dipstick result is abnormal.  Urinalysis will be performed per 
section 6.1 . At Step 1 entry , the safety urinalysis result will generally be 
available to the site within 72 hours after study entry and ART initiation. The 
results of baseline urinalysis will be reviewed with each study participant as part of the clinical assessment at week 1.  
 
Pregnancy Test  
For women of reproductive potential: urine β-HCG (urine test must have a 
sensitivity of 15 -25 mIU/mL)  or serum β-HCG test may be performed . Pregnant 
women who meet the eligibility criteria are allowed to enroll in the study. Record 
pregnancy and pregnancy outcome per section 8.0 .  
 At Steps 1 and 2 entry, the pregnancy test is to be performed, and the results 
must be available at the site prior to the first dose of ART in order to inform the 
appropriat e selection of ART.   
 
Pregnancy testing post-entry will be performed if pregnancy is suspected.  
Participants who have  positive pregnancy test  results  post-entry will remain on

study for cont inued follow -up. Pregnant participants will be switched from the 
study-provided ARV regimen to an alternative ART. Refer to  section 8.9 for 
information on the management of participants who are pregnant at study entry 
or become pregnant while on st udy.   
 
6.4.8 Immunologic Studies  
 
CD4+/CD8 + T-cells 
Obtain absolute CD4+/CD8+ T-cell count and percentages during the study  from 
a laboratory  that possesses  a CLIA certification or equivalent (US sites) or 
IQA certification (non- US sites) . 
 
In Step 2, record the results from the laboratory tests (if available) that are 
performed as part of routine care. Do not perform if results are not 
available from  routine care.  
 
HIV-1-Specific T -Cell Responses  
PBMC and plasma will be collected, frozen , and stored for studies of HIV-1-
specific T -cell responses. In addition, the PBMC samples  will be  shipped in batch 
for HLA typing and CCR5 delta -32 genotyping at the end of the study . Please 
refer to the A5354 LPC for instructions related to the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples.  
 Participants will have blood collected for PBMC and plasma storage at the 
visits indicated in the SOE . At the Step 1 entry visit , PBMC and plasma will 
be obtained from large volume blood collection (or the optional 
leukapheresis , as an alternative to the large volume blood draw) .   
 At week 49  (if needed) , blood collected may be pooled with, or tested in lieu 
of, blood collected at Step 1 week 48 to obtain a sufficient quantity for any 
assays. 
At weeks 60 and 72  on Step 1, PBMC and plasma storage will be obtained. 
 
For participants who started ART during Fiebig VI , PBMC and plasma storage 
will not be performed at weeks  12 and 24 after Step 1 entry . 
 
For participants who interrupt ART for ≥7 consecutive days before Step 1 week 
48 of the study, their  last PBMC and plasma storage will be at week 48  on Step 
1. If such interruption occurs after week 48, no PBMC and plasma storage will be 
performed at futur e visits.  
 
6.4.9 Virologic Studies  
 
Plasma HIV -1 RNA  
At Steps 1 and 2 entry, a real -time HIV-1 RNA  test will be performed . For HIV-1 
antibody negative participants who do not have documented HIV -1 RNA results 
 61 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
at screening but meet the AHI inclusion criteria  (section 4.1.1 , part b or c), the 
plasma HIV -1 RNA result at Step 1 entry must be  ≥500 copies/mL to be 
considered truly positive for HIV -1 infection. If the entry  HIV-1 RNA result does 
not meet this  detectable threshold value, the participant will be discontinued from 
the study.  
 
For post -entry HIV -1 RNA (real -time) evaluations, the laboratory must be certified 
by the DAIDS Virology Quality Assurance (VQA) Program.  
 
Fiebig Stage 
At entry, additional plasma samples will be collected and shipped to the 
designated central laboratory for testing to determine the Fiebig stage of 
participants. Please refer to the A5354 LPC for instructions related to the 
collection, processing, and shipping of these samples.  
 
HIV-1 Genotype  
Samples will be collected at the time points indicat ed in the SOE  and shipped to 
the designated central laboratory . Sites should refer to the A5354 LPC for 
instructions related to the collection, processing , and shipping of these samples.  
 
Genotyping at entry and at the time of VF may be performed on stored  samples 
for research purposes; therefore, results will not be available in a timely manner for clinical management. Entry plasma samples will be tested for reverse 
transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) resistance in those participants who did not 
have baseline genotype performed as part of standard of care. If genotyping is 
performed per standard of care, sites should document the results in the e CRF. 
 
For participants who experienced VF on study , a plasma sample will be collected 
for later genotyping. Samples for genotyping can either be from the initial visit 
with the HIV -1 RNA rise or at the time of confirmation of VF. Samples with HIV -1 
RNA above 1000 copies/mL are preferred for genotyping. Resistance testing will 
include RT, PR, and integrase resistance testing. A plasma sample collected at 
entry from these same participants will be forwarded for integrase resistance 
testing.  These genotypes are being performed for research purposes, and results 
will not be available in a timely manner for clinical management.  Therefore, s ites 
should follow  local standard practice regarding real-time genotyping at AHI 
diagnosis  and at the time of VF. 
 
NOTE: If an HIV -1 resistance genotype is performed as part of clinical care 
during screening or any time on the study  (section 6. 3.2
), the site investigator 
may use this information to guide a change in ART, if clinically indicated, 
including a change from the study -provided ARV regimen to a  non-study -provided 
ARV regim en or a change from a non -study -provided ARV regimen to the study -
provided ARV regimen.

  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Total HIV-1 DNA  
CAHD will be assayed by qPCR in 2 million CD4+T -cells from the Step 1 entry 
time point in participants who have undetectable CAHD at week 48 to ensure 
that each participant ’s viral DNA can be amplified by the qPCR assay. This will 
exclude false negative results for HIV -1 DNA detection at the primary endpoint 
(week 48) resulting from PCR primer mismatch or other inhibitors of PCR in the 
participant’s sample.   
 
 Total HIV -1 DNA will be obtained either from the stored PBMC and plasma 
or large volume blood collection (or optional leukapheresis).  
 
Primary Endpoint Determination 
Please refer to the A5354 LPC for instructions related to the collection, 
processing, and shipping of these samples. 
6.4.10 Adherence Assessment and Counseling  
  
Adherence to ART will be evaluated by self -report at all visits after study entry. 
Counseling to promote adherence to ART will be provided by site staff at all visits  
after study entry.  
 The adherence eCRF is posted on the DMC Portal in the Forms 
Management Utility.  
 6.4.11 Optional  Procedures  and Large Volume Blood  Collection  
 
Based on the primary endpoint determination results  (after week 48), you 
may be asked to provide consent for the optional procedures to be performed between weeks 60 and 72. 
 Participants will be encouraged to undergo at least one or both of the 
following procedures on Step 1:  
• Gut Biopsy  
• Lumbar Puncture  
 
The following conditions will render a participant ineligible from 
participating in the optional procedures:  
• Pregnancy 
• ART interruption ≥7 co nsecutive days at any point on Step 1  
• Virologic failure  
 
Telephone follow- up will be performed by site  staff th e day following the gut 
biopsy and/ or lumbar puncture to inquire about any AEs from the procedure. If 
any symptoms potentially related to the recent research procedure are present 
on the day of the initial telephone call, follow- up phone calls or in-person visits 
(depending upon the type of  symptoms or signs) are recommended. If any AEs

that require further investigation ar e reported, the participant should be asked to 
present for  in-person evaluation by a site  clinician.  Events meeting the reporting 
requirement in section 7.1 must be recorded in the eCRF.  
 
Large Volume Blood Collection OR Optional Leukapheresis  
A large volume blood collection for plasma and PBMC storage will take 
place at the Step 1 entry visit. Sites may choose to offer leukapheresis as 
an alternative to the large volume blood draw  at Step 1 entry .  
 
NOTE: Sites will not be reimbursed for the leukapheresis  performed at Step 1 
entry. O nly the routine PBMC and plasma collection or large volume blood draw 
will be covered at this visit.   
 Refer to the A5354 LPC for instructions related to the processing, shipping, 
and storage of these samples.

CSF will be collected via lumbar puncture and will be performed at any time on 
Step 1 from week 60 to week 72 in participants who consent  to this procedure.  
Please refer to the A5354 LPC for instructions related to the processing, 
shipping,  and storage of these samples.  
 7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
 7.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the 
conduct of the study REGARDLESS of the attribution (i .e., relationship of event to 
protocol imposed intervention).  This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or 
aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condi tion.  
 
All AEs must be reported in the clinical database if the reporting criteria have been met 
for any diagnoses, signs and symptoms, and abnormal laboratory findings as described 
below. AEs that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE) or expedited 
adverse event (EAE), as defined in section 7.3
, must also be recorded.  
 
 64 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Collection  Requirements  
 
Post-entry, all AEs must be reported on the eCRFs if the reporting criteria have 
been met.  
• All Grade ≥3 signs and symptoms  
• All Grade ≥2 laboratory findings  
• All targeted diagnoses (refer to the list on the A5354 PSWP)  
• All AEs that led to a change in study treatment/intervention regardless of grade 
• All AEs meeting SAE definition or EAE reporting requirement  
 
NOTE: Uterine pregnancy does not require reporting as an AE (unless other SAE 
criteria are m et) but must still be recorded on the eCRFs.  
 
NOTE: SAEs  or events meeting EAE reporting requirements should also be entered 
into the DAIDS Adverse Experience Report ing System (DAERS) , an Internet -based 
reporting system . 
 
All AEs that are reported must have their severity graded. To grade AEs, sites must refer to the DAIDS A E Grading Table , corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, which 
can be found on the DAIDS RSC website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/clinical -
research- sites/safety -reporting/daids -grading-tables. 
 
Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that : 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an  important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result 
in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the events listed above.  
 
7.3 Expedited Adverse Event (EAE) Reporting to DAIDS 
7.3.1  Expedited Reporting of Adverse Event s to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are outlined in Version 2.0 of the DAIDS EAE Manual, which is available on the RSC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research- sites/manual -expedited -

staff become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available information).  
 
7.4 Study Monitoring  
 
Refer to section 10.5.
 
 
8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
 
Criteria for participant management, dose interruptions, modifications, and discontinuation or changes will be mandated for toxicities attributable to the study -
 66 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
provided drug, EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or BIC/FTC/TAF . Participants who are receiving 
any non- study -provided ARV regimen should have toxicities managed for that drug 
according to the standard of care. NOTE: Site investigators are encouraged to consult 
the A5354 CMC for management of ART toxicities regardless of  the ARV regimens 
being used.  
 
Every effort should be made to retain participants on study as long as participant safety 
is maintained. If treatment -limiting drug toxicity occurs, site investigators working closely 
with primary care providers are encouraged to choose an alternative site -provided ART 
regimen based on their clinical assessment, standard of care at their site, and participant 
preference. Such regimen changes do not necessitate discontinuation of study 
participation. The A5354 CMC must be notified by e- mail regarding study drug toxicities 
that result in a change in regimen or discontinuation ( actg.cmcA5354@fstrf.org).  
 If there is a treatment -limiting toxicity resulting from STR EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or 
BIC/FTC/TAF , then the individual formulations of any component drug may be given 
along with a drug substitution, if necessary. However, the individual formulations will not 
be provided through the study. 
 
The DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2. 1, July 2017 , will be used for the 
grading of drug toxicities and is available on the DAIDS RSC website at 
https://rsc. niaid.nih.gov/clinical- research- sites/daids -adverse- event-grading-
tables.  
 
8.1 Toxicity  
 
The general guidelines presented in the subsequent sections below apply to toxicities that are not specifically addressed further in the DAIDS AE table. Because the goal of 
this study is to maximally reduce HIV -1 reservoir size with early treatment, continued 
viral s uppression on ART is critical. For any ongoing medical condition present prior 
to study entry and unrelated to ART, the study ART may be initiated provided that 
the site investigator deems it is in the best interest of the study participants.   
 
With the occurrence of AEs that are probably, possibly , or definitely related to  the 
participant’s ART, every attempt should be made to switch to safe alternative regimens. 
However, if there are no safe alternat ive regimens or the treating physician deems that it 
is in the participant’s best interest to discontinue all ART, the  ART must be promptly 
stopped. Participants who interrupt ART for ≥7 consecutive days must have HIV -1 RNA 
repeated as soon as possible and evaluated for possible VF ( refer to section 6. 3.4
). 
 8.1.1  Grade 1 or 2  
 
Participants who develop a Grade 1 or 2 AE or toxicity should continue ART 
unless deemed unsafe, and further m anagement will be  at the discretion of the 
site investigator.  
 
 67 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
8.1.2  Grade 3  
 
If the site investigator has compelling evidence that the AE has NOT been 
caused by the participant’s ART, dosing may continue and further management 
will be at the discretion of the site investigator. If the toxicity is thought to be related to ART, the regimen should be held or switched to site -provided 
alternative ART at the discretion of the site investigator , with the goal being to 
maximize tolerability and minimize time off ART. M edications other than 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF  will not be provided by the study protocol. 
Regardless of whether therapy is continued, stopped, or switched, the participant should be re -evaluated closely, preferably weekly, until the AE returns to Grade 
≤2. Consultation with the A5354 CMC is encouraged if there are questions about 
appropriate management.  
 
NOTE: The abnormal laboratory result(s) must be back to an acceptable level, as judged by the site investigator, prior to restarting therapy for any toxicity that led 
to a drug substitution or discontinuation.  
 
If AE returns to Grade ≤2 after regimen discontinuation or switch and original 
ART is restarted with recurrence of the same Grade 3 AE within 4 weeks, the 
implicated drug (s) should be permanently discontinued. If the same Grade 3 AE 
recurs after 4 weeks but is not thought  to be related to the ART, the management 
scheme outlined above may be repeated. Participants experiencing Grade 3 AEs 
requiring permanent discontinuation or modification of ART should be followed close ly until resolution of the AE.  
Participants with Grade 3 asymptomatic abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, creatinine phosphokinase, or liver enzymes may 
continue study drugs.  
 
8.1.3  Grade 4  
 
Participants  who develop a Grade 4 symptomatic AE or toxicity that is attributed 
to the study- provided ART must have their ART  discontinued or switched to an 
alternative  regimen if felt appropriate by the site investigator. After modification of 
regimen, participants should be followed closely until resolution of the AE (to a Grade ≤2 or a level d eemed acceptable by the site investigator), after which if 
treatment was discontinued it may be r estart ed with substitution of another drug. 
Those who require ART inter ruption for ≥7 consecutive days must  have HIV -1 
RNA repeated as soon as possible and evaluated for possible V F. Details on 
ART interruption are described in  section 6.3.6
.   
 
Participants with Grade 4 asympt omatic laboratory abnormalities  not specifically 
addressed below may continue ART if the site investigator has compelling 
evidence that the toxicity is  NOT related to the regimen. 
 
 68 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Participants with Grade 4 asymptomatic abnormalities in hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
white blood cells, platelets, or creatinine phosphokinase may continue study -
provided drug.  
 8.2 Rash  
 
NOTE:  In the event that Grade 2, 3, or 4 rash fails to resolve, increases in severity, is associated with systemic ( e.g., fever ) or allergic (e .g., urticaria) symptoms or 
Grade 3 or 4 LFT elevations, or is associated with exfoliative dermatitis or mucous membrane involvement or erythema multiforme, or suspected Stevens -
Johnson syndrome or necrosis requiring surgery, all ART and other potentially implicated medications must be discontinued until symptom resolution. The 
A5354 CMC must be consulted.   
 
8.2.1  Grade 1 or 2  
 
If the rash is considered to be likely due to concomitant illness or drug, standard 
management, including discontinuation of the likely causative agent, should be 
undertaken. If no other causative factor is found after clinical evaluation, the participant should be treated symptomatically until the rash resolves. 
Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids or antipruritic agents may be prescribed. 
The participant should be advised to contact the site staff immediately if there is 
any worsening of the rash. It is extremely important to closely monitor the 
participant to ensure that symptoms do not worsen. Additional guidance to avoid 
drug interactions  is described in section 5.4
. 
 
8.2.2  Grade 3  
 If the rash is thought to be related to an ART  agent , participants should 
discontinue their drug . An alternat ive ART regimen may be substituted with the 
goal of maximizing tolerability and minimizing ti me off ART. The A5354 CMC 
must  be consulted r egarding management.  
 
8.2.3  Grade 4  
 
Participants should discontinue all ART and other potentially implicated 
medications . The A5354 CMC must be consulted regarding management.  
 
8.3 Diarrhea 
 
Symptomatic treatment of diarrhea, regardless of grade, with oral antidiarrheal drugs , or 
modification of ART with site -provided medications  is permitted at the discretion of the 
site investigator. If Grade  ≥3 diarrhea thought to be related to current ART persists 
despite symptomatic management, then the regimen should be held or modified with 
site-provided medications at the discretion of the site investigator until it resolves to 
Grade ≤2. The site  staff is encouraged to consult with the A5354 CMC.  
 
 69 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
8.4 Nausea/Vomiting  
 
Nausea/vomiting, regardless of grade, may be managed with symptomatic agents such 
as oral antiemetics or antiemetic suppositories , or modification of ART with site -provided 
medications at the discretion of the site investigator . For Grade ≥3 nausea/vomiting 
thought secondary to ART that fails to improve on antiemetics, the regimen may be held 
or modified with site -provided medications until resolution to Grade ≤2. If Grade ≥3 
nausea/vomiting recurs with reintroduction of initial ART, the regimen should be 
permanently discontinued with the option to substit ute with site -provided alternative 
regimens at the discretion of the site investigator. The A5354 CMC must be consulted in these situations.  
 If nausea/vomiting thought to be related to ART, then an alternative  regimen may be 
substituted at any time at the provider’s discretion with the goal of maximizing tolerability 
and minimizing time off ART.  The site staff is encouraged to consult with the A5354 
CMC.  
 
8.5 Liver Enzyme Elevations  
 
8.5.1  Grade ≤3  
 
The participant’s ART may be continued for asymptomatic, isolated Grade ≤3 
AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) elevations at the discretion of the site investigator. Careful assessments should be done to rule out the use of alcohol, non- study 
drug- related toxicity, or viral hepatitis as the cause of the liver enzyme elevation.  
 
For symptomatic Grade 3 elevations of AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT), the ART 
should be held or changed to alternative site- provided medication until toxicity 
returns to Grade ≤2. However, ART may be continued for Grade 3 elevations 
that are unrelated to ART at the discretion of the site investigator. If 
symptomatic Grade 3 elevation recurs on rechallenge with ART, the regimen 
should be permanently discontinued and the A5354 CMC must be consulted.   
 An alternative ART regimen may also be substituted at any time at the provider’s discretion with the goal of maximizing tolerability and minimizing time off ART.  
 8.5.2  Grade 4  
 
The ART should be held or modified to alternative site- provided regimen at 
the discretion of the site investigator for confirmed asymptomatic AST 
(SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) Grade 4 elevations that are related to ART. Laboratory 
follow-up should be performed until the toxicity returns to Grade ≤2. If Grade 
≥3 elevation in AST (SGOT)  or ALT (SGPT) recurs on rechallenge with 
previously used regimen, these drugs  should be permanently discontinued 
and the A5354 CMC must be consulted.   
 
 70 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Any symptomatic Grade 4 AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) elevation that is 
believed to be related to ART shoul d lead to permanent discontinuation of the 
regimen with immediate consultation with the A5354 CMC.  
 
For asymptomatic and symptomatic Grade 4 AST (SGOT) and/or ALT 
(SGPT) elevations that are not related to ART, the ART may be continued at 
the discretion of  the site investigator provided that it is felt to be in the best 
interest of the participant.  
 Careful assessments should be done to rule out the use of alcohol, non- study 
drug- related toxicity, or viral hepatitis as the cause of the Grade 4 elevation.  
 
8.6 Headache 
 
Analgesics, anti -migraine drugs, muscle relaxants, and other symptomatic 
treatment should be used at the discretion of the site investigator. If the headache is considered to be most likely due to concomitant illness or drug, 
standard management, including discontinuation of the likely causative agent, 
should be undertaken. If the headache is thought to be related to their ART, the 
participant  should be managed at the discretion of the site investigator. The 
participant should be advised to contact the site investigator immediately if there 
is any worsening of the headache. If the regimen is discontinued, the A5354 
CMC must be consulted.  An alternat ive ART regimen may also be substituted at 
any time at the site investigator’s  discretion with the goal of maximizing 
tolerability and minimizing time off ART.  
 8.7 Hypophosphatemia  
 8.7.1  Grade 3  
 
For Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, participants should be given oral supplements 
or foods high in phosphates, with close follow -up at the discretion of the 
investigator. For pers istent Grade 3 hypophosphatemia despite supplementation, 
consideration should be given to holding any TDF or TAF- containing regimens as 
outlined for Grade 4 hypo phosphatemia. An alternative ART regimen may also 
be substituted at any time at the provider’s discretion with the goal of maximizing 
tolerability and minimizing time off ART.  
 
8.7.2  Grade 4  
 For Grade 4 hypophosphatemia, hol d any TDF or TAF -containing regimens  and 
switch to an alternat ive site-provided drug . Participants should be given oral 
phosphate supplements or foods high in phosphates. Retest phosphate levels weekly until they return to Grade ≤1.  
 
Continuation of supplemental phosphate is at the discretion of the site investigator. If Grade ≥3 hypophosphatemia persist despite discontinuation of 
 71 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
TDF or TAF -containing regimen and phosphate supplementation, neither TDF 
nor TAF- containing regimens should be reinitiated.   
 
8.8  Renal Insufficiency  
 
CrCl should be calculated from the serum creatinine using the Cockroft -Gault equation. 
Providers should consider testing for HLA -B5701 in any participant with renal 
insufficiency in anticipation of a potential switch of ART to an abacavir -containing 
regimen, i f not already taking in order to maximize participant safety and minimize time 
off ART.  
 
For participants prescribed study -provided EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF, any CrCl <30 mL/min 
or >0.4 mg/dL  increase from baseline creatinine value should be confir med by repeat 
testing within 1  week. If the calculated CrCl remains <30 mL/min, the regimen must be 
permanen tly discontinued and alternat ive regimen initiated. Participants with confirmed 
serum creatinine increases > 0.4 mg/dL above baseline should undergo an evaluation for  
potential causes of decreased renal function and should have serum creatinine 
monitored more frequently, at the discretion of the site investigator, until serum 
creatinine either stabilizes or decreases to ≤ 0.4 mg/dL above baseline.  
 
Management of increasing creatinine or declining CrCl on any site -provided ART should 
be managed per the standard of care at the discretion of the site investigator w ith the 
goal of maximizing tolerability and minimizing time off ART.  
 
The A5354 CMC must be consulted for any discontinuation or modification of ART due 
to renal insufficiency.  
 
8.9 Pregnancy  and B reastfeeding  
 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women are allowed in the study, assuming they meet other eligibility criteria, and  an appropriate alternat ive ARV regimen is available according to 
local standard practice. Participants who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not be 
prescribed EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF .  
 
Women who are diagnosed with pregnancy  following enrollment and are on study -
provided EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF  or site -provided regimen not 
recommended in pregnancy should be switched to a regimen that is suitable for use 
during pregnancy and/or breastfeeding according to the local standard practice.  
 
Incident pregnancies that occur while on study should be reported prospectively to The 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. More information is available at www.apregistry.com . 
Phone: 800- 258-4263; Fax: 800 -800-1052. (For studies conducted at sites outside the 
US: Report to The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry; Fax: 44 -1628 -789-666 or 910- 246-
0637; Phone: 910 -679-1598.)  
 
 72 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Pregnant women will continue on study on an alternative non-study-provided ARV 
regimen and will follow the schedule of evaluations outlined in section 6.1 , with 
exception of the optional procedures and large volume blood collection . 
 
For women who deliver and elect not to breastfeed or for those who complete 
breastfeeding, ARV  regimens can be switched to  study -provided E VG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or 
BIC/FTC/TAF .  
 If a pregnant woman has completed the study prior to delivery or if she elects to 
prematurely discontinue from the study before the end of the pregnancy, then site staff 
should request permission to contact her regarding pregnancy outcom es following 
delivery. This permission should be explicitly documented , and the women should be 
contacted within 2 weeks of her due date to obtain this information.  
 
Any intrapartum complications , pregnancy,  and pregnancy outcome will be recorded on 
the eCRFs.  
 
8.10 Lumbar Puncture  
 
The most common complication is positional headache (12 -24 hours post -procedure) , 
believed to be due to post -procedure leakage from the puncture site.  
 The primary therapy for this is to lie down. The headache subsides within minutes of 
lying down and if the participant stays inactive over a day or two the leakage stops. In 
rare cases where it is prolonged, or the participant must move about, a blood patch can 
be injected over the site of the puncture, effectively blocking the leakage. If a pencil point 
needle is used, the risk of lumbar puncture  headache is small (<10%) and a blood patch 
is rarely needed. Participant  should stay hydrated and limit strenuous activities, 
especially lifting of heavy weights  for 24 hours after lumbar puncture or until post -
procedure headache resolves. C ontact with the participant  on the day following the 
procedure is recommended. Heat and over- the-counter analgesics may be used if low 
back pain at the site of the puncture develops. P articipan t should be seen if any 
indication of significant increased disability is experienced.  
 8.11 Leukapheresis  
 On rare occasions, an allergic reaction to the citrate used during leukapheresis will 
require that the procedure be stopped early. Symptoms should be treated according to 
the site’s standard practice.  
 8.12 Gut B iopsy  
 
On extremely rare occasions, the gut biopsy via flexible sigmoidoscopy may cause pain, 
infection, bleeding, or perforation of the intestinal tract. If such a complication occurs, the 
participant will have appropriate clinical management in conjunction with the participant’s 
health care provider.

 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 10.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a prospective, open- label study to measure the effects of early ART on the 
establishment of HIV -1 reservoi r and HIV -1-specific immunity. Participants with AHI will 
have an enrollment visit and initiate ART at the time of  enrollment. Each participant will 
be followed on study for up to 216 weeks (72 weeks on Step 1 and 144 weeks on 
Step 2) unless they are  Fiebig VI at ART initiation in which case their last visit will be  no 
later than  week 24  on Step 1 . The primary endpoint is CAHD in 5 million blood -derived 
CD4+ T -cells assayed by qPCR  at week 48  on Step 1. Only participants who have not 
met criteria for permanent study discontinuation, have not missed more than 6 
 74 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
consecutive days of ART  and have  HIV-1 RNA <50 copies /mL at week 48 on Step 1 will 
be included in the primary efficacy analysis . If adequate sample and analyzable data 
are not available from the week 48 visit , week 49 will be used instead.   
 
Characterization of Fiebig stage using samples at the time of AR T initiation will be 
performed with results known within 12 weeks based on standardized, centralized 
testing; this will define the analysis groups . Each study group had a target enrollment 
of 50 participants under protocol Version 1.0. Study Groups 2 and 3 have reached 
their target enrollment and therefore the original inclusion criteria from protocol 
Version 1.0 corresponding to these groups are no longer applicable  for eligibility 
into the study. Because Fiebig stage for the analysis comparison will not be known until 
after therapy is initiated, over -enrollment based on available data at the time of entry 
may be implemented . 
 
10.2 Outcome Measures

10.3 Randomization and Stratification 
 
There is no randomization or  stratification. 
 
10.4 Sample Size and Accrual   
 
The primary study objective is to  compare the primary outcome measure at week 48 on 
Step 1 after ART dichotomized as : 0 versus  >0 copies of CAHD in 5 million blood -
derived CD4+  T-cells. The groups are expected to differ in likelihood that a participant 
has no detectable total HIV- 1 DNA , with percentages estimated to be: 
Fiebig I/II:  75% 
Fiebig III/IV:  25% 
Fiebig V:  <5% 
 
Forty -two (42) virologically suppressed participants at week 48 on Step 1 per group will 
provide high power to detect differences between all three groups based on this primary 
endpoint: >95% power for Fiebig I/II versus  III/IV, >95% power Fiebig I/II versus V and 
80% power for Fiebig III/IV versus V (assuming 3.5% for Fiebig V participants), based on 
Fisher’s exact test with type I error rate of 0.05 for each pairwise comparison. Table 
10.4-1 below shows power for the comparison between Fiebig I/II versus III/IV with 
different underlying probability of undetectable cell -associated HIV -1 DNA at week 48 
with 42 participants per group. The study will have moderate power (76%) to detect a 
difference between the two groups even with higher estimated probability in Fiebig III/IV 
group (35%) and lower estimated probability in Fiebig I/II group (65%).   
 Table 10.4-1: Power Comparisons  
 Fiebig III/IV  
Fiebig I/II  25% 30% 35% 
75% >95%  >95%  95% 
70% >95%  95% 88% 
65% 95% 88% 76% 
 
It is further assumed that 90% of participants who initiate study treatment will remain 
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies at week 48 for  primary endpoint evaluation. Taking  into account a 
 76 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
15% lost  to follow- up rate and insufficient samples at primary outcome week , the 
total sample size is 196 (a target enrollment of 50 per group).  
 
NOTE: Groups 2 and  3 closed to enrollment under protocol V ersion 1.0.  
 
The sample size increase to 196 participants is intended to aid in me eting the 
accrual target for Group 1 and increase the number of early -treated participants 
engaged in the cohort that are potentially eligible for future studies. This is an estimation of the additional number of participants that will need to be enrolled in 
order to fully accrue Group 1 (since group assignment is unknown at the time of 
enrollment) , based on the current rate of participants who were estimated to be in 
Group 1, and determined to be in Group 1 at study entry after centralized testing.   
 
Based on the available Fiebig staging data as of May 15, 2019, after the completion of centralized testing, 31% of participants estimated to be in Group 1 
were determined to be in Group 1, while 50% were determined to be in Group 2.  
Group 1 has enrolled 37 participants. Group 2 had enrolled 63 participants, and 
Group 3 had enrolled 54 participants. Assessing the current group counts and 
rates, we anticipate that , with 196 participants enrolled (an additional 36 
enrollments after replacing Fiebig VI and HIV negative participants), approximately 
50 participants will be determined to be in Group 1.  
 
Secondary objectives are largely exploratory without formal sample s ize calculation.  
However , based on data from the R V254 study, HIV-1- specific CD4+ T -cell responses to 
gag after ART are expected to be 15% in Fiebig I/II versus 30% in Fiebig III/IV versus 
80% in Fiebig V which will provide 30% power for Fiebig I/II versus III/IV, >90% power 
for Fiebig V versus  the other two groups.  
 
It is anticipa ted that the study will take 36 months to accrue with one third of the 
participants accrued during the first 6 months after at least three international sites have 
enrolled at least one participant .  
 
10.5 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
Accrual, baseline characteristics (including baseline laboratory values),  conduct of the 
study (including premature study discontinuations, data availability and sample acquisition), any  ART interruptions , VFs , and all reported toxicities and AEs will be 
monitored by the team during the study. The team will also closely monitor the Fiebig 
stages of the study population as defined by the standardized testing of samples 
obtained at ART initiation. In addition, the study will be reviewed by a Study Monitoring 
Committee (SMC) according to ACTG  standard operating p rocedures. The SMC will 
review accrual,  baseline characteristics (including baseline laboratory values), Fiebig 
stage at ART initiation,  AE summaries, CD4+ T -cell counts and HIV -1 RNA 
levels/suppression over time, study and ART discontinuations (and reasons) , and 
completeness of follow- up and sample availability. The SMC will convene, at a minimum, 
6 months after the first participant is enrolled or after 25 participants are enrolled, whichever is earlier and approximately annually thereafter or at the request of the SMC.  
 77 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Furthermore, the CMC or the team  may, at any time it thinks appropriate, ask for the 
SMC to independently review all available safety data.  
 
Since  characterization of Fiebig stage using samples at the time of ART initiation will be 
performed with results known within 12 weeks based on st andardized, centralized 
testing,  an estimated  Fiebig group at enrollment based on inclusion criteria  from section 
4.1.1 , as shown in the table below  will provide additional real- time monitoring for 
accruals into each study group. E ach Fiebig stage from I through IV has a median 
duration of approximately 5 days, the Fiebig stage at 7 days prior to enrollment may be 
expected to advance by one or possibly two stages by the time of enrollment. Both 
Fiebig stage determinations (centralized tested or estimated by inclusion criteria) will be used to guide accrual once enrollment is completed in at least one Fiebig group.  For 
instance, Groups 2 and 3 have reached their  enrollment target under protocol 
Version 1.0, thus enrollment is closed for those two groups.

10.6 Analyses  
 
Analysis of  the primary efficacy  will be restric ted to participants who maintain HIV-1 
RNA <50 copies /mL at week 48 on Step 1 with no ART interruption of ≥7 consecutive 
days and have available CAHD results  from  week 48 or week 49. Specifically, plasma 
HIV-1 RNA by commercial assay must be <50 copies/mL at week 48 with no prior VF 
(section 6. 3.4). This study is designed to evaluate the effect of suppressive ART initiated 
in different stages of AHI on the establishment and persistence of HIV -1 reservoirs; this 
is the rationale for analyzing HIV-1 DNA only among virally suppressed participants and 
not in those with incompletely suppressed viremia (>50 copies/ml). Primary outcome 
measures will be summarized as a binary outcome, 0 copies versus >0 copies of CAHD 
per 5 million CD4+ T -cells assessed separately and jointly by gag- and integrase-
assays. Each participant’s primary endpoint sample will be tested twice by gag - 
 78 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
and integrase- assays. For the primary outcome measure, in order for a participant 
to be considered as having 0 copies of CAHD, the participant  must be found to 
have an undetectable CAHD result from both assays.  Proportion of 0 copies of 
CAHD will be compared pairwise between groups using Fisher’s exact test. 95% 
confidence interval for the proportion estimated will be calculated using the exact 
binomial distribution. The analysis groups will be Fiebig I/II, Fiebig III/IV, and Fiebig V, as 
defined by the standardized testing of samples at ART initiation. Supplemental 
analyses  will use Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the primary outcome measure on 
the continuous  scale between analysis groups , separately  for the results from the 
gag- and integrase assays. We will also examine the primary  outcome measures that 
include participants with extended periods of ART interruption (≥7 consecutive days) 
while maintained HIV -1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at week 48.  For clades with sufficient data, 
supplemental sensitivity analyses will compare Fiebig stages stratified by HIV subtype.  
 Study and study treatment discontinuations (and reasons) will be summarized. In 
addition, use of non- study -provided ART will be summa rized including reasons (if any) 
for participant s to change from study -provided ARV regimen to non- study -provided ARV 
regimen.  
 
Analysis of secondary outcome measures will use the same approach as for the primary 
outcome measure if the outcome is binary. Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used to 
compare the continuous secondary outcome measures between groups.  Rank -based 
Spearman correlations will describe association between outcome measures.

SHORT TITLE FOR THE STUDY:  A5354/ EARLIER (Early ART to Limit Infection and 
Establishment of Reservoir ) 
  
SUMMARY  
 
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is  to have persons who are newly or 
recently infected with HIV -1 (the virus that causes AIDS) to start  
taking anti -HIV medicine  (antiretroviral (ARV) drugs) right away . The 
study will  look at how starting antiretroviral treatment (ART), as 
soon as the HIV-1 infection  is found , affects the amount of HIV-1 
virus and HIV -1 infection- fighting cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T- cells) in 
your blood. The study will also look at the amount of HIV -1 DNA (the 
genetic material for HIV -1) is seen in CD4+  T-cells after you have 
been on ART for 48 weeks.  
 
 The study will provide elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/ tenofovir 
alafenamide (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF)  and 
bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF).  The 
study doctor will have you take one of these study- provided 
medicine or a non-study-provided ARV medication. You must  be on 
ART while participating in this study.  
 NUMBER OF   
PARTICIPANTS:  Up to 196 people will take part in this study.  
 
LENGTH OF  
STUDY: The study will last about 5 years for most people. There are two 
parts to the study. Part 1 will take about 1 year and 6 months, and 
Part 2 will take about 3 years.  
 
You may need to stay at the clinic for almost half a day at some visits. You will have up to nine study visits in the first year of Part 1; 
two of these visits will be done by telephone. In the next year of Part 1 of the study, you will have up to two clinic visits. In Part 2 of the 
 87 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
study, you will need to come for study visits two times each year for 
the next three year s. 
 
REQUIRED  ACTIVITIES : Blood and urine collections  
At most visits, some blood will be collected from a vein in your arm. At entry and if you leave or stop the study early, you will be asked to provide a urine sample.  
  
Special procedure  
At entry of Step 1, a large amount of blood will be collected from a 
vein in your arm  or instead of this large volume blood draw, an 
optional procedure called leukapheresi s may be performed . The 
leukapheresis procedure uses a machine  that allows for collection 
of white blood cells ( infection -fighting cells in your blood ). This 
procedure may take 1½ to 3 hours.  
 
 
RISKS: EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  and BIC/FTC/TAF have been tested in humans 
and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
There are, however, some risks when taking these drugs. Below are 
some common drug reactions seen with t hese drugs when given to 
people.  
• Headache 
• Diarrhea  or loose, watery stools  
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Abdominal pain  
• Tiredness or weakness  
• Rash 
 
If you are taking EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF, you may also experience  
worsening or new damage or failure to your  kidney, pancreas, or 
liver.  
 
If you are living with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and taking BIC/FTC/TAF , 
there is a possibility of an unexpected worsening of hepatitis B if 
you stop taking BIC/FTC/TAF.  
  
BENEFITS : No direct benefits should be expected from participating in this 
study.  
 
 
OTHER CHOICES : Instead of being in this study, you have the option of receiving care 
from your primary provider  or other health care provider s.

INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study for two main reasons:  
1. You are living with acute human immunodeficiency virus  type 1  (HIV-1, the virus that 
causes AIDS) . Acute infection  means that you recently got HIV.  
2. You are willing and able to start taking antiretroviral therapy (ART, anti -HIV drugs) right 
away . 
 
This study is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The doctor in charge of this study at this site is: (site: insert name of Principal Investigator) . Before you decide if you want to 
be part of this study, we want you to know more about the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The study is being done to:  
• start ART  early in  those recently or acutely infected with HIV -1 
• see how starting ART as soon as the infection is found affects the amount of HIV -1 in your 
blood and how well your body fights the HIV -1 infection  
• look at the amount of HIV -1 DNA  (genetic material  for HIV -1) seen in CD4+ T -cells 
(infection- fighting cells in your blood) after 48 weeks of ART  
• see how early treatment for HIV affects the numbers of  HIV-1 infection fighting cells  (CD4+ 
and CD8+ T -cells) in your blood  
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART  IN THIS STUDY?  
 Up to 196  people (men and women age 18 years and older) who have acute HIV -1 infection will 
take part in this study.  
  
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be in this study between about 1 year and 6 months and about 4  years and 6 
months depending on when you join.  
 
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you decide to join this study, you will first need to be screened for the study to make sure that 
you qualify. You will start taking ART at study entry. At study  entry, a sample of your blood will 
be tested to confirm your HIV -1 infection. At th e time of starting ART, an additional sample of 
 89 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
your blood will be tested to see how far along you are with your HIV -1 infection; this is called 
Fiebig staging. There are three  study groups determined by Fiebig staging . Based on your 
medical records of HIV testing and the results from the day that you start the HIV medications , 
the study team will  determine which study group you will be included in.  
 The study will provide two tablets – each tablet contains 3 to 4 different drugs. Three of these 
drugs treat HIV, and one is a drug that increases the levels of one of the anti -HIV drugs. The 
names of these drugs  are elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/  tenofov ir alafenamide 
(EVG /COBI/FTC/TAF) and bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (BIC /FTC/TAF).  
These drugs  have  been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.  
 
If you are not able to take the study -provided drug , then you will be allowed to take the best 
ART available to you, as prescribed by your primary care doctor. These non-study -provided 
ART must be obtained locally.  
 
Both you and your doctor will know which drugs you are taking. The study staff will work 
with you to make sure you are taking your medication correctly.  
 There are two parts  to the study, which are described below.  
 
If you are eligible and enter the study, you will need to come for study  visits up to  nine times 
in the first year  of Part 1 of the study; two of these visits will be done by telephone. If during 
these telephone visits, the study staff determines that you should be seen in person, you will be 
asked to go to the clinic. In the next year  of Part 1 of the study , you will have up to two clinic 
visits  that will include the study staff contacting you by telephone the day after completing the 
optional procedures (gut biopsy and/or lumbar puncture) . You will be notified by the study staff 
of when t o expect to receive these telephone calls before you are actually called.   
 If after completing  the visit  72 weeks (about 1 year and 6 months) after entering the study 
in Part 1  (under either Version 1.0 or Version 2.0), you remained virologically suppressed 
(having HIV-1 viral load levels <50 copies/mL),  never stopped ART for 7 days or more, 
and did not have detectable levels of HIV -1 viral load (higher than what the study would 
allow), you will enter Part 2 of the study . You will be asked to come for st udy visits two 
times each  year for approximately the next 3  years. Part 2 of the study has limited 
evaluations and no invasive procedures.  
 NOTE: Groups 2 and 3 closed to enrollment since the accrual goal was met under 
protocol Version 1.0.   
  Most clinic visits will last about 1 hour. The study staff will tell you how long each visit will last.  
 
NOTE S:  
• If your laboratory  tests from entry show that you do not qualify for the study, the study staff 
will tell you to stop all ART. You will be asked to complete the discontinuati on evaluations, 
and your follow -up will end.   
• After you enter the study , if your blood test shows that you  have had HIV longer  than 
expected at the time of entry , then your follow- up and HIV study treatment will end at week 
 90 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
24. Your doctor will tell you the results of the tests  by week 12 so you will have time to 
pursue HIV treatment outside of the study .  
• If you stop taking your ART for 7 or more days in a row, the last peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells ( PBMC , cells separated from the blood taken from you ) and plasma (the 
liquid part of blood taken from you) collection will be done at week 48.  
 
You may need to come to the clinic for extra visits if you develop side effects or if you need to 
switch to non-st udy-provided ART or if the level of HIV in your blood increases after it has been 
undetectable . More information about the study procedures is given at the end of this consent 
(Attachment A). During the study, you will receive results, when they are available, from any routine tests that are done during the study.  
 At most visits, we will collect b lood samples for routine safety labs and study -required tests.  
Some of your blood will be stored (with protectors of identity) and used for immunologic, resistance, and genetic testing that is required for this study.  
 
You will get the site’s usual adherence support (procedures to help you remember to take your 
ART).   
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
After signing this consent form, if you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not meet 
the eligibility requirements, the study team  will still use some of your information. There is some 
information that we collect on everyone who is screened for an ACTG study.  As part of 
this screening visit, some demographic (for example, age, gender, race), clinical (for  example, 
disease condition,  diagnosis), and laboratory (for example, HIV-related blood test results ) 
information will be  collected from you . We also collect information on whether you use (or 
have used) IV drugs.  
 We will collect this information even if you do not enroll in this st udy. This information is 
collected so that ACTG researchers may determine whether there are patterns and/or 
common reasons why people do not join a study.  
 
Extra Samples and Blood C ollections  
Part of the entry visit includes taking a larger amount of blood (large volume blood draw) than 
what is collected on a typical blood draw. At some sites , blood will be collected during a medical 
procedure called leukapheresis , which  may be performed in pla ce of large volume blood 
collection  at entry . For this procedure, you will need to be in a semi -reclining  or reclining position 
for most of this time . By collecting blood using this procedure, researchers are able to get many 
more white blood cells than is  usually possible. F or additional information, see Attachment B of 
Appendix I.  
 After week 48  on Part 1 of the study, you may  be asked whether you  agree to have additional 
procedures done and samples coll ected. You will be provided more information about these 
additional procedures during that visit. These additional procedures are optional and include gut biopsy  by flexible  sigmoidoscopy  and lumbar puncture  (see Appendix II  for additional 
information). You will not receive the results of these procedures because they will be done in 
 91 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
the future.  No matter what you decide, it will not affect your participation in the study. About 25 
people participating in this study will take part in these  two optional pr ocedures.   
 At non- US sites, b iologic al specimens may  be shipped and/or stored outside the country from 
which they were collected (e.g., sites that do not have a central testing laboratory in- country) . 
 
NOTE : If you are pregnant or  become pregnant on study, these  optional procedures will not be 
done. If you stop taking ART for 7 days or more in a row or if you have a viral load 
that is confirmed to be more than or equal to 50 copies/mL , you will not  be able to 
participate in the gut biopsy and lumbar puncture optional procedures. 
  
CAN I CHOOSE THE TYPES OF RESEARCH THAT MY SAMPLES AND INFORMATION 
ARE USED FOR?  
 
Some of your blood will be stored and used for study -required immunologic and 
virologic t esting.  
 
Identifiers will be removed from your samples and from any private information that has been collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other 
information will be able to know that the samples or information came from you.  
 
The tests described above are required by this study. If you do not agree to the storage 
or testing that has been described above, you should not join this study.  
  
Some blood that is collected from you during the study might be left over after all  
required study testing is done. This blood will be stored and, if you give your consent 
below, may be used for ACTG -approved research. This means that researchers who are 
not part of the protocol team may use your samples without asking you again for your  
consent . As noted above, none of your samples will have any private information about 
you on their labels.  
 You may decide whether this “extra” blood may be stored and, if so, whether additional 
testing may be performed on it.  You may withdraw your consent for research on your 
extra samples at any time and the specimens will be discarded.  
 You will not be paid for your samples. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific 
discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan 
to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
 At this time, we do not know whether any of the research will include testing of your genes or your DNA (your own genetic information). We do not know whether a type of 
testing called whole genome sequencing, or WGS, might be done. In WGS, researchers 
look at all of your genes and at almost all of your DNA. In “standard” genetic testing, 
researchers look at specific genes or subsets of genes, but not at all genes. S ome 
possible genetic testing is described below.

Research With Human Genetic Testing – OPTIONAL (Human genetic research on leftover 
blood)  
If you agree, some of your blood that is left over after all required study testing is done 
may be stored (with usual protection of your identity) and used for ACTG -approved HIV -
related research that includes human genetic testing, and may include whole genome 
sequencing (WGS).

Sharing Genetic Data - OPTIONAL   
Genetic Research Databases: If you agreed to possible genetic testing of your blood 
above, researchers may want to share genetic information  (with protection of your 
identity) with other researchers around the world, so that they can learn more about the causes and treatment of diseases. They may store this information in dbGaP, a genetic 
database maintained by the National Institutes of Healt h, as well as in other protected 
databases.

WHAT IF I HAVE TO STOP TAKING BOTH STUDY -PROVIDED AND NON- STUDY -
PROVIDED ART?  
 During the study:   
If you must stop taking ART for 7 or more days in a row before the week 24 study visit and you have not had an HIV -1 RNA test showing that your viral load was <50 copies/mL, 
then you will be asked to complete the discontinuation evaluations before having to stop 
the study medication and be taken off the study. The study staff will discuss other 
options that may be available to you.  
 
If you must stop taking ART for 7 or more days in a row either during the first 24 weeks after 
you have had HIV -1 viral load <50 copies/mL or after week 24  on Parts 1 and 2 of the 
study,  or if you have two HIV -1 viral loads in a row that are >200 copies/mL  at week 24 or 
after on Part 1,  you will be asked by the study staff to return to the clinic to have a repeat HIV- 1 
viral load test that will check whether your ART regimen is working. This test is called a virologic failure (VF) confirmatory test. If the confirmatory test results show that your ART regimen is 
working for you, then you will remain in the study for continued follow -up and no more PBMC 
and plasma collection and no optional procedures will be done after week 48 on Part 1 of the 
study. If the t est results show that your ART regimen has failed, then you will be asked to 
complete the discontinuation evaluations before having to stop the study medication and being taken off the study. The study staff will discuss other options that may be available to you.  
 After the study:  
After you have completed the study, the study will not provide you with study drugs. The study 
staff will talk with you about your choices. You and your doctor will decide what treatment you 
should have, and the study staff will discuss  with you how you may be able to obtain ART after 
the study ends .  
 
 WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 The main risks of the procedures and study -provided drug  are described below.  
 Risks of Social Harm  
Although the study site will make every effort to protect your privacy and confidentiality, it is 
possible that other people could find out that you are in a study and this could cause problems 
for you. For example, other people might figure out that you are infected with HIV -1. If this 
happens, you could be treated unfairly or you could have problems being accepted by other family members, friends, and/or the community.  
 Risks of Drawing Blood  
Taking blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising 
where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting or infection.  
 
Risks Related to Pregnancy  
The ART in this study may be unsafe for unborn babies. If you are having sex  that could lead to 
pregnancy, you must agree not to become pregnant or to attempt to make a woman pregnant.  
 94 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
Because of the risk involved, you and your partner must use at least one effective method of 
birth control. You must continue to use birth control while receiving study drugs.  
 
Remember: If you are having sex, you need to use condoms to prevent transmitting your HIV -1 
infection to others.  
 
Approved methods of birth control are listed below. The study staff will talk with you about your 
choices.  
• Birth control medications that prevent pregnancy given as pills, shots, or placed on or under the skin  
• Male or female condoms with or without a cream or gel that kills sperm   
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with a cream or gel that kills sperm   
• Intrauterine device  
 If you can become pregnant, you must have a pregnancy test, and the test result must be 
available at the study clinical research site before you can start ART. If you think you may be 
pregnant at any time during the study, you must tell the study staff right away. If you become 
pregnant during the study, you may choose to stay in the study [ Sites: Please modify this 
language as necessary to comply with local/national guidelines ]. The study staff will talk to you 
about your choices.  
 
If you become pregnant while on study, the study staff would like to obtain information 
from you about the outcome of the pregnancy (even if it is after your participation in the 
study ends). If you are taking anti -HIV drugs when you become pregnant, your pregnancy 
will be reported to an international database that collects information about pregnancies 
in women taking anti -HIV drugs. This report will not use your name or other information 
that could be used to identify you.  
 Risks of ART  
All ART medications can have side effects. The drug regimen provided in this study may have side effects . Listed below are the more serious or common side effects that may be related to 
the study -provided drugs.  Please note that these lists do not include all the side effects seen 
with the study -provided drugs. The staff will be able to tell you which are the most serious side 
effects. They will also be able to tell you what to do if you have any of these side effects.  If you 
have questions concerning the additional study -provided drug side effects, please ask the 
medical staff at your site.  
 
BIC/FTC/TAF 
BIC/FTC/TAF (50/200/25 mg) is a fixed dose combination tablet containing three 
medications: bictegravir (BIC, B, GS -9883), emtricitabine (FTC, F) , and tenofovir 
alafenamide (TAF). The safety information known about this tablet is from studies GS -
US-380-1489 and GS -US-380-1490, in which 634 patients who had never been treated for 
HIV received B/F/TAF (50/200/25 mg) for 96 weeks. Adverse drug reactions that have 
been identified are as follows:  
• Very common: headache, diarrhea, nausea.     
• Common: vomiting, abdominal pain, indigestion, passing gas, fatigue, and rash.     
 95 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
• Other adverse reactions: hives (urticaria) and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or 
throat (angioedema).  
 
If you are living with hepatitis B virus (HBV), there is a possibility of an unexpected worsening of hepatitis B if you stop taking BIC/FTC/TAF.  
 In a study in pregnant rats, a possible effect on the fertility of male and female baby rats 
born to mothers given BIC 300 mg/kg/day was observed.  The decreases in fertility were 
slight and  remained within the range seen in animals not given any drug in other studies. 
At the next lowest dose, 10 mg/kg/day, no effects were noted in the baby rats. At this dose, the mother’s BIC plasma exposure was approximately eight times higher than the 
estimated blood concentrations of BIC in humans when administered as BIC/FTC/TAF (50/200/25 mg).   
 Please talk to your study doctor for more details on adverse events or see the 
BIC/FTC/TAF package insert for more information.  
 
Emtricitabine (FTC)  
The following side effects have been associated with the use of FTC: 
• Headache 
• Dizziness  
• Tiredness  
• Inability to sleep, unusual dreams  
• Loose or watery stools  
• Nausea or vomiting  
• Abdominal pain

side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways 
to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the aforementioned side effects 
continue, are bothersome, or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care 
professional.  
 
Some side effects of EVG may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the 
medicine, these side effects may disappear.  
 
Use of Combination Antiretroviral (ARV) Drugs  
In some people with advanced HIV-1 infection, symptoms from other infecti ons or certain 
diseases may occur soon after starting combination ART but can also occur later.  Some of 
these symptoms may be life threatening. If you start having new symptoms, or notice that 
existing symptoms are getting worse after starting your ART, tell your health care provider right 
away.  
 
The use of potent ARV drug combinations may be associated with an abnormal placement of 
body fat and wasting. Some of the body changes include:  
• Increase in fat around the waist and stomach area 
• Increase in fat on the back of the neck  
• Thinning of the face, legs , and arms  
• Breast enlargement

There is a risk of serious and/or life- threatening side effects when non -study -provided  
medications are taken with the study -provided drugs. For your safety, you must tell the study 
doctor or nurse about all medications you are taking before you start the study. It is also important that you do not start any new medications while on the study  before discussing it with 
the study doctor o r nurse . Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in any 
other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
 
CAN I JOIN THE STUDY IF I AM CURRENTLY PREGNANT  OR BREASTFEEDING ? 
 If you are pregnant  or breastfeeding, you are allowed to take part in the study as long as you 
meet the requirements of the study. If you are pregnant at the time of enrollment, you  will be 
instructed by the study staff to take alternative , non -study -provided ART during your pregnancy 
or while breastfeeding . 
  
WHAT IF I BECOME PREGNANT DURING THIS STUDY?  
 If you become pregnant while on study, you must tell the study staff right away and see your doctor to get the best care possible. You will be asked to return to the clinic for a study visit at 
your earliest possible c onvenience. You may remain on study during your pregnancy or you 
may leave the study. Either way, the study staff will contact you to find out about any events that happen during your pregnancy and about the health of the baby.  
 
If you choose to stay in this study, you will not be able to continue on the study -provided drug. 
You and your study doctor will decide what ART are best for you now that you are pregnant.  If 
you are on study -provided EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or BIC/FTC/TAF , you will need to change to 
alternative non- study -provided ART that is felt to be appropriate for use in pregnancy by your 
study doctor and/or primary care provider. You will continue to have regularly scheduled study 
visits , but you will not take part in the optional procedures and large volume blood collection.   
This study will not provide care related to your pregnancy, the delivery of your baby, or the care of your baby. You must arrange for your care and your baby’s care outside of this study. Your 
study doctor will help you find appropriate care.   
 
Long- term follow- up is recommended for a baby whose mother takes ART during pregnancy. 
The study staff will talk with you about long- term follow- up and the possibility of enrolling you r 
baby in a long -term follow -up study.   
 After your baby is delivered, you may be able to return to the study -provided drug regimen you 
were taking before you became pregnant . It is unknown if the study -provided drugs pass 
through the breast milk and whether this may produce adverse effects in your baby. It is also unknown if taking the study- provided drugs will reduce the risk of passing HIV to 
your baby while breast feeding. If you decide to breastfeed  your baby, you cannot remain on 
the study- provided drug regimen and must continue taking your current non-study -provided 
ART prescribed by your doctor .

WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME OFF THIS STUDY EARLY? 
 The study doctor may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
• You never started AR T (study -provided or non -study -provided  drugs ) or started ART later 
than 48  hours after joining the study . 
• An HIV -1 test shows that you are not infected with HIV or you have had HIV infection for a 
longer period of time than expected or your laboratory  tests from entry show that you do not 
qualify for the study . 
• You miss 3 study visits in a row .  
• Your viral loads show that the HIV medications you are taking are no longer working well for 
you or if you have two viral loads in a row that are >200 copies/mL at week 24 or after 
on Part 1; this is known as having VF. 
• You stop taking ART for 7 days or more in a row, and you have not had a viral load <50 copies/mL (before stopping ART that lasted ≥7 days in a row)  during Part 1.  
• Your doctor believes that remaining on the study is  no longer what is best for you . 
• You are unable to follow the requirements of the study . 
• The study is stopped or cancelled.  
 
The study doctor may also need to take you off the study -provided drugs  without your 
permission if:  
• Continuing the study -provided drugs may be harmful to you, for example, if the study drugs 
are making you sick . 
• You need a treatment that you may not take while on the study -provided drugs.  
• You become pregnant and/or start breastfeeding.  
If you must stop taking ART before the study is over or i f you want to stop the study visits, then 
the study staff will ask you to return to the clinic for a final visit.  
 If you are taken off the study early because you never started ART, you do not need to have a final visit.  
  
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY? 
 It is possible that being in this study will be of no direct benefit to you and that the optional 
procedures being done will not change your clinical care.  
 
It is also possible that being in this study benefits you in one of the following ways:  
• Gives you access to ART (for about 1 year) .  
• Gives you more detailed information about your HIV -1 infection than you could get from your 
local anti -HIV care center; having this information could help you get better treatment for 
your HIV -1 infection . 
• Provides you with frequent health checks that could help identify problems early; having this 
information could help you get good treatment at the right time.

Finally, it is possible that your being in this study will provide information that will help others 
with HIV -1 infection. 
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 Instead of being in this study, you have the choice of:  
• treatment with the anti -HIV drugs available to you locally  
• treatment with experimental drugs, if there is a study available locally for which you qualify  
• no treatment  
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other choices available to you. Your doctor will explain the risks and benefits of these choices.

WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO ME?  
 You will not have to pay for the study -provided drug, E VG/COBI/FTC/TAF or BIC/FTC/TAF . If 
your doctor decides that other drugs would work better for you, then you might have to pay for 
those drugs. This could happen if you are unable or unwilling to take EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF  or 
BIC/FTC/TAF  or if you become pregnant while on study.  
 
You will n ot have to pay for study visits, exams, and laboratory  tests needed for this study. The 
study will perform  one resistance test for all participants (at entry prior to taking the study 
medications)  and possibly  another resistance test in those participants whose ART regimen has 
failed (at the VF confirmatory visit) . In addition, some of your blood may  be tested at the end of 
the study to look at  genetic factors. The results  of these tests  will not be available r ight away  
since the tests will be done later in the study.

1Screening: After you have read and signed the consent form, the study staff will check your 
medical records for available documentation of your HIV -1 diagnosis;  for instance, whether you 
are recently or acutely infected with HIV -1 to make sure that you meet the requirement for 
joining the study.  You will be asked about anti -HIV and other kinds of medications you 
have taken in the past.  
  
2Entry Visit: If you are eligible to join the study, you will enter Part 1 of the study  and be placed 
into a group. At the entry visit on Part 1 of the study, you will st art taking ART. If you are 
unable or unwilling to take the study -provided drug, then you must have access to and can 
begin to take an alternative ART in order to enter the study.  
 
NOTE: In Part 1 of the study, large volume blood collection (about 320  mL of blood) will be 
done, and at some sites, optional leukapheresis may be done in place of large volume blood 
collection at entry.  
 If you remain eligible after completing Part 1 of the study, you will enter Part 2 of the study. You will continue to take ART while on  Part 2. If you are unable or unwilling to 
continue taking the study- provided drug, then you must have access to and can begin to 
taking an alternative ART in order to remain on the study.  
 
3Most Other Visits: Most participants  will be seen at 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks 
after entering the study and then at 48 weeks and thereafter at week s 60 and  72. T hose 
participants whose test results show Fiebig VI will have th eir final study visit at week 24  on Part 
1 of the study . Participants in Part 2 of the study will be seen every 24 weeks until week 
144.   
 
The approximate amount of blood (in mL) that will be drawn at study  visits  will be from 3 mL 
(or about 1 tsp) to 173 mL (or about 35 tsp) .

4Some Other V isits: At weeks 2 and 8  (of Part 1) and the day after having the optional 
procedures (gut biopsy and/or lumbar puncture), you will be contacted by the study staff over 
the phone to check how you are doing. At week 36, you will come to the clinic  to have a physical 
exam, a viral load test, and an adherence evaluation. 
 
At weeks 60 and 72, you will have blood drawn (23 mL or about 5 tsp) for routine safety labs at 
each visit. Depending on whether or not you reached the main goal of the study at week  48, you 
may be asked as to whether you are willing to have additional optional procedures done and 
samples collected between week s 60 and 72 (see Appendix II  for details on these procedures) .  
 
5Special V isit: You may be asked to return for an extra visit at week 49 if you need to have 
blood drawn for an HIV test and other research tests. If it seems that the ART regimen is not 
working  or if you are having side effects from your treatment regimen, then you may be asked to 
come to the clinic for an extra  visit.  
 
6Leaving the Study Early: You will be asked to come to the clinic for an extra visit if you leave 
the study or stop the study treatment early.  
 
III. Explanation of Evaluations  
 
Consent and contact information collection  
After you read the consent and have had a chance to ask questions about the study, you will sign the consent form if you want to continue to be evaluated for study participation. You will 
also be asked how to be contacted in case you miss a visit or there are problems with your tests, and whether you give the study team permission to contact you. 
 
Acute HIV -1 infection documentation  
The study staff will check your medical records to see if you had an HIV test done as part of local routine care and whether you were recently or acutely infected with HIV-1 .  
 
HIV-1 infection confirmation and Fiebig staging  
Blood will be collected to confirm that you have HIV-1 infection, and an additional blood sample 
will be collected for Fiebig staging (a test to show how far along you are with your HIV -1 
infection).  
 Group assignment and study treatment/locally -provided ART 
You and the clinic staff will discuss your assigned group and the optimal ART options for you. 
These will be based on your acute HIV-1 diagnosis and medical history.  At study entry, you will 
receive either study -provided or other non-study -provided ART based upon your discussion with 
the study site doctor. The study staff and the study pharmacist will tell you how often to take 
your drugs and whether you should take them with food.  
 
Physical examination  
You will have a physical exam and will be asked questions about your health and about any  
medicines you have taken or are taking now.  You will also be asked about any symptoms 
and illness you may have had since the last visit.  
 
 108 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
ART modifications  
You will be asked if there has been any change in how you take your study- provided or 
non-study-provided anti-HIV medications  since the last vi sit. 
 
ART continued  
In Step 2, you will be asked to confirm that you continue to take your study -provided or 
non-study-provided anti -HIV medications since the last visit.  
 
Blood collection  
Blood will be collected from you for various tests during the study. These include: routine safety laboratory  tests, HIV -1 viral load (a test that shows how much HIV -1 is in your blood), CD4+ T -
cell count (a test that shows how many infection- fighting cells you have in your blood),  and liver 
function tests.  
 
NOTE: F or Part 2 of the st udy, laboratory tests, CD4+ T -cell count, and liver function 
tests may be collected from clinical records.  
 
At entry  and at the confirmatory visit to check whether your ART regimen has failed, a sample 
will be collected for resistance t esting (a test that shows whether the ART is  working for you). 
Routine PBMC and plasma storage will be done.  
 
Human genetic  testing  
Some of your blood will be tested to see whether the ART you are taking are making a 
difference by looking at  your immune response  (levels of infection fighting cells, CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cells, in your blood) or whether development of resistance to ART is associated with 
different genes. You will not receive the results of these studies because they will be done in the 
future.  
 Pregnancy testing  
If you are a woman who is able to become pregnant, then you may be asked to give a small 
urine or blood sample for a pregnancy test.  
 HIV-1 resistance testing  
Your blood will be used to see which ART might work best for you.  
 NOTE: If resistance testing was done as part of routine care, the study doctor may review these 
results to make sure that your current ART is still the best for you.  
 
Urine collection  
You will be asked to provide a small amount of urine that will  be used i n safety tests.  
 Primary endpoint determination 
At week 48, you will be asked to give blood samples for testing to determine whether you met 
the main goal of the study by looking at the total amount of HIV genetic material in infection-
fighting cells at study week 48 (also known as the primary endpoint) .

ATTACHMENT B : SAMPLES COLLECTION AND OPTIONAL PROCEDURE   
AT STEP 1  ENTRY 
 
A. Explanation of Samples Collection and Optional Procedure  
 The samples collection and optional procedure below will advance the scientific goals of this 
study but will offer no direct benefit to participants. Neither you nor your doctor will receive 
any results from the samples collection and optional procedure because these tests are for 
research purposes only. If you choose not to participate in the optional procedure, it will not 
affect your ability to take part in this study.   
 
NOTE: If you are pregnant, the  samples collection and optional procedure will not be done.  
 
• Large volume blood collection  
 A large volume blood draw (about 320 mL) will be collected.  
 
NOTE: At some sites, leukapheresis may be done in place of large volume blood 
collection.  
 
• Leukapheresis  (in place of large volume blood draw)  
 
The leukapheresis procedure may  be performed at [insert site -specific details] . The 
procedure will take about [insert site -specific details]  and the full visit will last about 
[insert site -specific details] . You will have to remain in a semi -reclining or reclining 
position for  most of this time.  
 Leukapheresis is a medical procedure that involves removing whole blood from an individual/donor and separating the blood into individual components so that leukocytes 
(white blood cells) can be removed. The remaining blood components are then put back 
into the bloodstream of the individual/donor. This will be done by inserting a needle 
attached to sterile tubing in one arm, and first sending your blood through a machine. 
This machine spins your blood to separate the red blood cells (cells that carry oxygen), the white blood cells (cells that fight infection) and the platelets (cells that help form 
clots). The white blood cells  will be kept for testing. The rest of your blood will be 
returned to your body through another needle and tube in your other arm. Not all of your white blood cells are removed, and your body will make more white cells within a few 
days. Losing the number of white blood cells that are collected does not pose a danger 
to your health.  
 B. Risks Associated with Samples Collection  and Optional Procedure  
 
• Large volume blood collection  
 
Taking blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or 
bruising where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting or infection.

• Leukapheresis  (in place of large volume blood draw)  
 
Leukapheresis has been shown to be safe in donors living with HIV and does not affect 
CD4+ T -cell count or immune status of short -term donors. The needle used is larger 
than normal blood draw and may be uncomfortable. Rarely, a participant may feel faint during or after leukapheresis.  This sort of reaction can be handled by changing the 
participant’s position or administering intravenous fluids.  You may experience chills, 
nausea, and heartburn caused by the citrate anticoagulant that is used during the 
procedure to keep the collected cells from clumping together in the bag.  This chemical 
may use up some of th e calcium in your blood stream, and tingling in the face, lips , or 
hands may be noted. If this happens, study staff may slow the rate of infusion of t his 
chemical and may offer you one or two calcium carbonate tablets to correct the calcium 
loss. Participants will be observed closely by an experienced blood bank technician during the procedure.

 APPENDIX II:  CONSENT FOR OPTIONAL PROCEDURES  AND SAMPLES COLLECTION 
AFTER WEEK 48  ON STEP 1  
 
If you met the main goal of the study (i .e., to look at the total amount of HIV genetic material in 
infection fighting cells  at week 48) , you may be asked and consented to take part in the optional 
procedures  and samples collection that will be done between week s 60 and 72. The optional 
procedures and samples collection (as described below ) will advance the scientific goals of this 
study but will offer no direct benefit to participants. Neither you nor your doctor will receive any results from these procedures because these tests are for research purposes only. If you 
choose not to participate in the optional procedures, it will not affect your ability to take part in 
this study.   
 NOTES:  
1. About 25 people participating in this study will take part in these optional procedures.  
2. If you are pregnant, these optional procedures  and samples collec tion will not be done.  If 
you stop taking ART for 7 days or more in a row or if you have a viral load that is 
confirmed to be more than or equal to 50 copies/mL, you will not be able to 
participate in these optional procedures.   
 
A. Explanation of Optional Procedures  and Samples Collection 
 
• Gut biopsy  
 The gut biopsy procedure will be performed at [insert site -specific details] . The 
procedure will take about [insert site -specific details] , and the full visit should last about 
[insert site -specific d etails] .    
 
A gut biopsy is a medical procedure that involves removing a sample of tissue taken 
from your gut to closely examine it.  This will be performed following the local standards 
of care for this procedure. Just before the gut biopsy, you may have an enema (a salt water rinse that will flush out your lower bowel). Next, a lubricated flexible tube will be placed into your rectum.  Using this instrument, the doctor will examine the inside of your 
intestine and will collect samples of tissue for testing.    
You should not have anal sexual intercourse for 3 days before and for 7 days after the 
procedure. The study or clinic staff will  call you the day after the procedure to check on 
how you are feeling.  
 [Note to sites: Insert details regarding how this procedure is performed in your institution 
and whether an additional consent form is required at the clinic where it will be 
performed ]. 
 
• Lumbar puncture  
 A lumbar puncture is a medical  procedure that involves removing a small amount of 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from your spine. You should drink plenty of fluids the day 
 113 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
before the lumbar puncture procedure. The procedure will be performed at [insert site -
specific details] . You will be asked to lie down on your side or to sit “backwards” in a 
chair (so that you are facing the back of the chair). An area of skin on your lower back 
will be sterilized with fluid. You will get an injection to numb the skin in the sterilized 
area. You may feel a burning sensation from the fluid that is injected. When the area is numb, the doctor will insert a thin needle between two of the bones in your spine. A 
small amount of fluid will be collected through the needle. The entire lumbar puncture procedure to this point will take about 30 minutes.  
 
After the CSF collection, you may be asked to lie flat for up to 30 minutes to reduce the 
chance that you will get a headache. You should limit your physical activit y for the 
remainder of the day. The study or clinic staff will call you the day after the procedure to check on how you are feeling.  
 
B. Risks Associated with Optional Procedures  and Samples Collection 
 
• Gut biopsy  
 The preparation before the procedure may include taking laxatives or enema, which may 
be uncomfortable and may make participants feel weak from diarrhea. You may feel 
pressure or discomfort as the instrument (a lubricated flexible tube called a sigmoidoscope) is placed into your rectum as it passes through the curves of your colon 
during the procedure. You may receive medication throughout the procedure to reduce 
any discomfort. The doctor will put air into your colon in order to see the lining, and you 
may have some bloating or abdominal discomfort from the air. You may feel as though you need to have a bowel movement. You can pass the air if you feel the need. The doctor will remove as much air as possible after the procedure.  
 
There is a small risk (about 1/3,600) for bowel perfor ation which is a tear through the 
wall of the bowel that may allow leakage of bowel fluids. Perforations are generally treated with hospitalization, antibiotics, and possibly surgery. Bleeding can occur but usually will stop without treatment or can be controlled at the time of the procedure. 
Rarely, blood transfusions or other treatments may be required to stop the bleeding.  
 After the procedure, you may feel dizzy or sleepy from the sleep and pain medicines. 
You should have someone come with you to accompany you home. You should not drive a car or a motorcycle. There is a small risk (less than 1/10,000) for a more severe 
allergic reaction to the sleeping medicine.  
 
• Lumbar puncture  
 The risks of lumbar puncture include local soreness at the site of needle entry and pain 
and possible allergic reaction associated with local anesthesia. There is a small risk of 
headache or decreased blood pressure from removing the small amount of fluid or 
leaking of CSF after the procedure. There is a small risk of infection and a very small risk 
of damage to nerves in the lumbar spinal roots after the procedure, which could cause 
pain, numbness, or loss of sensation to the legs. Before the procedure, the area where 
 114 A5354 
  FINAL Version 2.0  
  12/31/19  
 
the needle will be inserted will be cleaned with antiseptics (such as betadine or rubbing 
alcohol) in order to reduce the risk of infection. A bandage will be placed on the skin where the needle went in , and the participants will be asked to remove it the next day 
and tell the study doctor right away if any redness or tenderness is present. Participants will be asked to remain lying flat for up to 30 minutes after the procedure and will be 
given fluid to drink after the procedure. The site staff will ask the participants about 
history of any allergies to anesthetics and will not perform lumbar puncture in any participant with such history.  
 Please indicate below if you agree to have any of these optional procedures and large volume 
blood collection done. No matter what you decide, it will not affect your participation in the study. You will not receive the results of these studies because they will be done in the future. You do 
not have to decide about the  optional procedures and blood collection until week 48 of the 
study.

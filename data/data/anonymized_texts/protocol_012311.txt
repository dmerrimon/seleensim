Purpose  
Hypothesis:   
We hypothesize that non responders to infliximab will have lower early drug levels then 
responders thus reflecting an increased risk of colectomy. Additionally, we will estimate an optimal day 4 level based on the study results.  
 
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives:  
 
Summary  
There is increasing interest in the pharmacokinetics of biologics such as Infliximab and their clinical relevance. In 
this study we propose to measure infliximab levels during the first week after infusion in adult patient s hospitalized 
with severe ulcerative colitis (UC). We will compare those infliximab levels with one and three month outcomes 
including the requirement for colectomy, changes in inflammatory markers, and complications such as intercurrent infections and ca rdiac, renal, or respiratory deterioration  
 Background and Significance  Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel with significant associated morbidity and risk of colectomy.
1 . 
Although many environmental risk factors including smoking, medications, childhood hygiene, and infections have 
been implicated and studied, none can fully explain the disease pathogenesis.2 Additionally, genetic susceptibility 
and a complex interplay between the microbiome and the immune system likely lead to the development of this 
inflammatory bowel disease.3 
 Acut e and chronic complications associated with UC include severe bleeding, toxic megacolon, infection and 
colorectal cancer. Hospitalized patients with a flare of moderate- to-severe ulcerative colitis can be especially 
difficult to manage if they do not respond to intravenous corticosteroids. At this point, medical therapy or a total 
proctocolectomy with a two or three stage ileal pouch– anal anastomosis (IPAA) is frequently considered. 
4 
Treatment with cyclosporine may only delay colectomy in most patients.5 Additionally, cyclosporine carries a 
substantial risk of toxicity. 6  Increasingly, Infliximab, a TNF alpha inhibitor, is being used a rescue therapy in this  
situation. 7 
 .
 Infliximab is approved for induction and maintenance of clinical remission and mucosal healing in patients with moderate to 
severe active ulcerative colitis, in those who have an inadequate response to conventional therapy such as IV steroids. It is  
typically dosed a t 5 mg/kg at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter  The alternative to rescue 
medical therapy with infliximab is proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anastomosis, which carries risks including  pouchitis, fecal incontinence, pouch fail ure requiring further surgical procedures and female infertility 
8 9, 10 or 
proctocolectomy with permanent end- ileostomy, which many patients wish to avoid.  An induction regimen of 3 
doses of Infliximab followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks is used to achieve response in hopes of avoiding 
colectomy. 11  Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients are unable to achieve (primary fa ilure, approximately 
30%) or sustain a clinical response over time (up to 50%, secondary failure) 12 and end up getting a colectomy.” . 12 
 Potential implicated pathways in non -responders include fecal wasting of infliximab 
13 and factors that accelerate 
drug clearance such as a large TNF or CRP burden, anti -infliximab antibodies (ATI), low ser um albumin, male sex 
and larger body size. 14 Patients with severe ulcerative colitis who fail corticosteroids and standard dosing with 
infliximab usually proceed to proctocolectomy.  Optimizing infliximab blood levels in pa tients with moderate -
severe ulcerative colitis would improve the efficacy and further reduce the need for colectomy. However, there is a 
paucity in the literature as this is a relatively new school of thought.  Our study will address this deficit by 
evaluating the relationship between early drug levels of infliximab in ulcerative colitis and colectomy rates at one 
and three months.   Specific Aims  
Primary Aim  
The primary aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between daily infliximab levels and colectomy free survival at 1 and 3 months. We hypothesize that non responders will have lower early drug levels and correlate with increased colectomy rates. B ased on the resulting correlations, we will estimate an optimal drug level to improve 
clinical outcomes and provide data to support future research. If our hypothesis is correct, we intend to pursue a second study which will be randomized and involve early infliximab dose stacking (weeks 0 and 1) in patients with 
suboptimal infliximab levels vs standard infliximab administration (weeks 0, 2, 6) to see if the risk of colectomy can be decreased.  
 Secondary Aims  
The secondary aims of this study are to assess relationships between colectomy and other potential biomarkers

Study Design  
 Methods:  
Design  
We propose an open label pilot study of 25 adult moderate -severe ulcerative colitis inpatients. Since existing 
literature on our study hypothesis is scarce, this sample size was chosen based on other pilot studies of biologic 
therapies in patients with IBD .  
 Study Population  
Included patients must be receiving clinically indicated infliximab at the discretion of their treating physician during an acute hospitalization with a flare of moderate to severe UC. We recognize that our patient population will include 
referral amongst those from the local Olmsted County and surrounding areas.  
To identify subjects, the inpatient gastroenterology service list at St Mary’s Hospital in Rochester Minnesota will be 
reviewed daily. Patients will also be enrolled from any Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS) site LaCrosse ,  if they 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria and are under the care of Mayo gastroenterologist. To capture those on 
the internal medicine service, the gastroenterology consult service list will also be reviewed daily. As these patients 
will be admitted with a suspected IBD flare, a clinically indicated colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy will have been completed with colon, terminal ileum and/or sigmoid colon biopsies. Endoscopic findings will be noted  and 
those deemed to have moderate to severe disease activity will be included based on the Mayo Scoring System for 
Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis Activity will be considered. Subject will participate for a maximum of 3 -months and will 
complete the study  when the 3-month follow -up phone call is completed.” . Informed Consent Process  
 A member of the study staff will meet with the potential participant with the assent of the hospitalist who is in charge of the 
patient’s care. The study will be explained to the potential subject and the risks and benefits will be discussed  the potential 
subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions.  Only subjects who agree and sign an informed consent 
document will be included in this study. A copy of the written consent document will be provided to the potential 
participant. “Infliximab doses and frequency of administration will be at the discretion of the treating physician.”

Data Collection  
As part of the study, subjects will complete a daily questionnaire of clinical symptoms including stool counts, presence of blood or mucous, number of nocturnal bowel movements, fever, malaise, weight loss, urgency or 
tenesmus and abdominal pain
3. Estimated time to complete a questionnaire is 5 m inutes  Additionally stool and blood 
laboratory data such as CBC with differential, creatinine, TNF levels, albumin, fecal calprotectin, ESR, CRP, infliximab and antibodies to infliximab levels will be obtained daily for a week, following week 0 Infliximab infusion. If any of these labs has been performed on the given day for a clinical indication or to guide management 
by the treating physician, they will not be repeated.  If a subject undergoes colectomy within the first 7 days of the 
study we will stop collecting lab data from them.  
 All samples collected for the study will be deidentified. Sample labels will contain only subjects study ID, visit # 
and date of collection.    Lab test will be requested by the study physician using Mayo standard of practice  
procedure.  Samples will be collected, processed and sent to the lab per Biospecimens Accessioning and Processing 
(BAP) department at Mayo Clinic.  They will be aliquoted per testing instructions and delivered to the appropriate 
lab for analysis.   
 
 Those  subjects who are discharged prior to a week’s time will have blood 
and stool collected as outpatients at the Mayo 
Clinic outpatient lab area.  Similarly, subjects will receive the rest of daily questionnaires and self -addressed envelopes 
Subject s that are unable to return to Mayo Clinic, will receive mail in blood and stool kits that can be mailed to the 
Mayo Clinic lab at the time of discharge. They will be provided instructions regarding venipuncture at outside labs, stool sample collection and  shipping of samples. The subjects will be given addressed and postage paid mail in kits. 
They will not be responsible for venipuncture or shipping cost.  Subjects will receive remuneration of $25.00 if they complete the study or a pro -rated portion of that amount if they complete only a part of the study. Subjects will 
receive a follow up phone call at 1 and 3 months after Inflixambe intitation (+/ - 5 days). A followup symptom 
questionnaire also will be completed at these phone calls. to gather information  about progression of symptoms.  In 
an effort to minimize any potential risks to subjects, all information will be treated in accordance with Mayo Clinic patient confidentiality rules and regulations as well as with HIPAA regulations.
 Samples will be destr oyed at the end of 
the study.”

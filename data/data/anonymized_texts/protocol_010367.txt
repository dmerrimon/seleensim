Study Title  A Phase I /IIa Multicenter, Double -Masked, Randomized, Vehicle -
controlled, Dose -ranging Study to Evaluate the Safety of TRS01 Eye 
Drops in Subject s with Post -surgical Inflammation.  
Study Objective  The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety of TRS01 
 (w/v) eye drops compared to vehicle  in subject s who 
have undergo ne cataract surgery.  
Study 
Population  The study population will consist of male and female subjects, aged 18 
or older, who have undergone routine uncomplicated cataract surgery 
and experience ≥ grade 2 threshold level of ocular inflammation 1 day 
post-operatively . 
Number of 
Subjects  Approximately  60 subjects that meet the selection criteria will be 
randomized  for treatment following cataract surgery (o ne study eye ). 
The number of subjects that will be screened to obtain 60 randomized 
subjects is estimated at approximately 100 subjects . 
Investigational 
Product  TRS01 - , TRS01 - , and TRS01 - eye drops,  or vehicle , will 
be supplied as investigational product.   
Route and 
duration of 
administ ration  Study subjects will administer the randomly assigned treatment, as eye 
drops, four times a day (QID) for 2 weeks.  
Study Design  A Phase I /IIa multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -
controlled, dose-ranging study designed to evaluate the safety and 
preliminary efficacy of TRS01 eye drops (  compared 
to vehicle  in subject s with post-surgical inflammation.  Potential study 
participants will be asked to sign an informed consent document before 
the surgery  and have to meet all preoperative inclusion/exclusion 
criteria . Following cataract surgery , subjects who are observed to have  
anterior chamber cells ≥ grade 2 in the stud y eye on the Day 1 post -
operative visit  following a routine, uncomplicated cataract s urgery  will 
be eligible to be randomized to treatment ( subjects who have <  grade 2 
anterior chamber cells must be screen failed) . Once it is determined that 
all eligibility criteria have been met, subjects will be enrolled and 
treated with one of three con centrations of TRS01 or vehicle  in a 
1:1:1:1 ratio. Approximately  60 eligible  subjects will be enrolled  in 
approximately  five centers located in the United States  (US)  and 
France . 
Study subjects will administer the randomly assigned treatment  four times 
a day (QID) for 14 (±1) days. All study subjects will return for 
examination on day 3, day 8 and day 1 5 post surgery . Day 15 visit will be

Intraocular inflammation is  a typical  undesirable consequence of intraocular surgery such as 
cataract surgery.  It is manifested principally as conjunctival injection, corneal edema, ciliary 
flush  and aqueous cells and flare . Surgical  trauma and phacoemulsification energy activate an 
inflammatory cascade that ultimately leads to formation of prostaglandins, which results in local 
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability.  
Inflammation may resolve with no treatment in 15 -28% of patients. However, i nadequately 
treated  inflammation after cataract surgery frequently causes  pain, photophobia, increased risk 
for elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) , corneal edema , corneal scarring  and cystoid macular 
edema  [Aptel et al., 2017 ]. Thus, managing and treating postoperative inflammation is an 
important goal following cataract surgery.   
Other ocular inflammatory diseases include , for example , non-infectious uveitis, a potentially 
blinding condition that is the fifth leading cause of visual loss in the developed world ( third 
leading cause of preventable blindness), has been estimated to account for 10% of all visual 
impairment in the western wo rld and 10–15% of cases of total blindness [Nussenblatt, 1990; 
Merida et al., 2015 ]. Anterior uveitis accounts for approximately 80% of non -infectious uveitis 
cases in the United States [Thorne et al., 2016 ].  
Uveitis is characterized by an inflammatory process that may be acute, recurrent, chronic or 
acute -on-chronic. Untreated, recurrent bouts of uveitis eventually lead to tissue destruction from 
direct infla mmation or from complications such as cataract, glaucoma and macular edema.  
Topical corticosteroids represent first line treatment for both non-infectious uveitis and 
postoperative inflammation.  In the US, topical corticosteroids are routinely prescribed with four 
times daily (QID) dosing for at least 2 weeks following cataract surgery  [Kim et al., 2019 ]. 
The side effects associated with steroid use , significantly limit prolonged treatment. The most 
common adverse effects of ocular steroids are cataract  and elevated IOP which can lead to 
steroid related glaucoma.  
Given the limitations of treatment , there is a need for a n effective anti -inflammatory drug that 
does not have an IOP -elevating effect.  Tarsius Pharma has developed  a novel therapeutic 
approach for local prevention and treatment of ophthalmic inflammatory diseases.

Tarsius Pharma Ltd .                                               CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 51 3 STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a phase I/IIa multicenter, double -masked, randomized, vehicle -controlled, dose -ranging 
study . 
It is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of TRS01 eye drops (  
) compared to vehicle in subjects with post -surgical inflammation.  
 
3.1 SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
The primary safety parameter in this study is the i ncidence and severity of treatment -emergent 
and treatment -related adverse events ( AEs), both systemic and ocular events  in subjects with 
post-cataract inflammation. Changes that are expected due to uncomplicated cataract surgery will 
not be classified as A Es but will be recorded . 
1. Snellen distance visual acuity (VA) by pinhole method   
2. Slit lamp biomicroscopy  
3. IOP measurement  
4. Dilated ophthalmoscopy  
5. Change from baseline ( 1-day post-surgery) to each post -surgery visit in ocular signs : 
o Conjunctival hyperemia  
o Corneal Edema  
All Relevant clinical findings will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). 
3.2 EXPLORATORY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
1. Anterior Chamber Cell count on slit lamp  biomicroscopy . 
 
2. Anterior chamber flare  
3. Subject -rated ocular pain assessment  
3.3 DESCRIPTION OF  THE STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase I /IIa Multicenter, Double -Masked, Randomized, Vehicle -Controlled, Dose -
ranging study designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of TRS01 eye drops at 
three  dose levels  compared to vehicle  in subject s with post-surgical inflammation.   
Approximately  60 subject s with  ocular  inflammation following cataract surgery will be  
randomized at  approximately  five centers , in the USA and in France .

Tarsius Pharma Ltd .                                               CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 51 Subject s who provid e informed consent and me et all study randomization  criteria w ill be  
enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1: 1:1 ratio to receive TRS01 %, TRS01 - , 
TRS01 -% or vehicle  eye drops four times daily .  
Treatment assignments w ill be  masked to Tarsius , study subject s, Investigators, and site staff.  In 
order to prevent unmasking, all study medications during the Treatment Period w ill be  supplied 
in identical packages . 
The study design include s 14-days of a d ouble -masked treatment period, with the endpoint 
assessment conducted on Day 15 (FIGURE 1 summarizes  the study phases, anticipated visits and 
number of subjects at each phase and Appendix 1 summarizes  the schedule of assessment s from 
Screening through Day 15). 
Randomization is employed as an unbiased method of assigning subject s to four groups in equal 
allocation.  
Male and femal e subjects aged 18 or older  and 1-day post cataract surgery with anterior chamber 
cells ≥ grade 2 in the study eye, are eligible to be randomized  to participate in the treatment 
phase of the study .   
Double -masked eye drops will be administered four times daily from Day 1 through Day 14 by 
the study participant (or care provider ) to the study eye . The safety endpoint is on Day 15. 
Exploratory efficacy measurements will be collected.   
Visits (including  the surgery day) : 
1. Visit 1/Days -30 to -1 – Screening: Initial screening for eligibility  – 1-30 days before the 
surgery.  
2. Visit 2 /Day 0  – Surgery: Eligible subject s will undergo routine cataract surgery according to 
investigator’s standard  procedure s. No st eroid or NS AID will be given before, during or after 
the surgery.  Acetaminophen on the day of surgery is allowed.  
3. Visit 3 /Day 1  – Randomization: Subject s who meet the post-surgery  qualification criteria of 
≥ grade  2 anterior  chamber cells in the study eye will be randomized and will initiate dosing 
with IP. The subject’s  first dose will  occur after randomization under the observation of an 
Unmasked staff member .  
3.1. 40 minutes ± 10 minutes post first dose, AEs, if any , will be r ecorded . Changes that are 
expected due to uncomplicated cataract surgery (such as discomfort, scratchy feeling, 
significant brightness, changes in the perception of the operated eye,  corneal edema) will 
be collected, but will not be classified as AEs.  Subjects will be given one bottle of IP and 
instructed to dose three  more times  that day and to begin dosing four times a day on the 
following day and onward.  The eye that underwent cataract surgery is defined as the study eye. TRS01 should not be 
administered  in the fellow eye .

In order to prevent unmasking during the study, the three  doses of TRS01 and the vehicle  will be 
supplied in identical packages.  
Treatment assignments during the treatment period will be masked to all Tarsius  staff, subjects 
and investigators , except  delegated unmasked site personnel . The designated unmasked site 
personnel should collect  all AEs related to IP and will hand le all IP related responsibilities  but 
will not perform any study related assessments.   
The first dose will be administered  under the supervision of  an un masked staff member  and will 
serve as  confirmation that the subject was adequately trained on d rop admin istration  at the 
screening visit . In the event that it becomes necessary to unmask  a specific  subject ’s treatment 
assignment, the Principal Investigator will contact Tarsius Medical Officer or the back -up 
Medical Officer. Unmasking will be allowed for indi vidual subjects after it is determined 
necessary by the Medical Officer and the Principal Investigator , thus leaving the masking of the 
remaining subjects intact

Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive TRS01 - , TRS01 , 
TRS01 % or vehicle  dose on Day 1.  
Randomization will occur after subjects m eet all eligibility requirements at Screening and Day 
1/Visit 3  (1-day post -surgery). Each subject will be assigned a unique subject number.  
Each kit package (contain ing two IP bottles) will contain  a kit number that can be later corelated 
to the subject number at the site.  
Randomization for the US sites will be sepa rate from the French site.  
The randomization codes and all data sets will be stored in a secure area accessible only to 
delegated study personnel and only released on completion of the study and after the study 
database has been locked.  
In this study all p arties are to be masked to the allocated treatment; investigators, study staff  and 
subjects . At the site, there will be designated unmasked study staff that will train the subject  on 
all study procedures  related to IP administration . 
In emergency situations for reasons of subject  safety (e.g.  serious unexpected /unlisted drug 
related event;  medical emergency;  potentially life-threatening  drug interaction)  the masking  code 
may need to be broken. In those cases, whenever  possible,  a request for unmasking  should be 
discussed with the sponsor (or designee) prior to unmasking . Detailed instruction on the method 
for breaking the mask  will be provided during site training and noted in the Investigator  study 
file. 
Following the first IP administration, if the subject  perceives any AE that may be attributed to 
the IP, these should be reported to the unmasked  site personnel.   
4.4 INFORMED  CONSENT   
Prior to undergoing any study -related activity, the Principal Investigator  or his/her designee will 
discuss  the purpose and pertinent details of the study with each potentially eligible subject . The 
explanation w ill be  sufficiently detailed to allow the subject  to make an informed decision to 
participate in the study. If the subject  is willing to participate in the study, he/she w ill be 
requested to give written informed consent. A copy of the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) will be  
signed by both the subject  and th e Principal Investigator or his/her designee . 
The signed and dated ICF w ill be  retained with the study records, and a copy of the signed and 
dated ICF w ill be  given to the subject .

6.1 PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
At the Screenin g visit, medications that were taken within the previous 30 days will be  collected. 
At each study visit thereafter, subject s will be  questioned concerning any new medications or 
changes in their current concomitant medications since their previous study vi sit. 
For all medications, the generic name, indication, route of administration, frequency, dose, start 
date and end date  (if applicable) w ill be  collected.  
6.2 PERMITTED MEDICATIONS  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject ’s welfare that does not interfe re with the evaluation 
of the study medication will be permitted to be given at the discretion of the Principal 
Investigator .  
The decision to administer a prohibited medication or treatment would be taken with the safety 
of the subject  as the primary cons ideration. Whenever possible, the Tarsius  Medical Monitor will 
be notified before any prohibited medications or treatments are administered. The Tarsius  
Medical Monitor  should also be contacted if the permissibility of a specific medication or 
treatment is in question.   
Any subject placed on rescue therapy will discontinue use of the study medication and continue 
study participation through Visit 6.  
Subjects on r escue will be considered treatment failures, but the need for rescue therapy will not 
be considered an AE. Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be 
followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever comes 
last). Rescued subjects should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed to resolution 
of signs and symptoms or until the Investigator has deemed the subject is stable.  
6.3 RESCUE MEDICATION USE  
Rescue medications will be administered  in cases detail ed in section 7.2.2 . Rescue therapy will 
be defined as any treatment that would have a therapeutic effect on inflammation  in the anterior  
segment , other than the IP (e.g., systemic treatment with an immunosuppressant agent, or topical  
corticosteroid s in the study eye), regardless of the purpose of administration and whether it was 
recorded as a rescue therapy on the eCRF .  
Systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, 
chlorambucil, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, azathioprine, or adalimumab) or other ther apy 
considered as a rescue therapy, would be administered based on the Investigator’s best judgment 
and only after discussion  with Tarsius’ Medical Director. Prior to treatment with rescue 
medication, the subject should answer the “Subject -Rated Ocular Pai n Assessment” . Only then, 
rescue medication can be administered and  treatment will be recorded as a rescue therapy in the 
Medications eCRF.

Adverse events w ill be  collected for subjects following signing of the ICF through the end of the 
study. The information  will include at least a description of the event, onset date, and resolution 
date, as well as  seriousness, severity  and relation to study medication  (as deter mined by the 
Investigator ), location  (right eye [OD], left eye [OS], both eyes [OU] or other), action taken, and 
outcome. All AEs w ill be  coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) dictionary, current version . Ocular and non -ocular AEs w ill be  summarized 
separately.   
Suspected adverse reactions  (SARs), also known as  adverse drug reactions  or suspected adverse 
drug reactions , are AEs considered by the Investigator to be related to the study medication  and 
included in the Investiga tor’s Brochure . 
An AE w ill be  considered as an ocular AE  if the Investigator select s ‘OD’, ‘OS’, or ‘OU’ for the 
AE eCRF field “Eye (s) affected”.  
Any AE that causes  loss of vision of 15 or more letters (i.e., 3 lines) should be recorded as a 
serious adverse event ( SAE ). Examples include endophthalmitis, retinal vascular occlusion, 
retinal detachment involving the macula/fovea, etc. AEs that cause loss of 15 or more letters  (i.e., 
3 lines) that are expected to resolve sh ould not be recorded as an SAE .  Examples include 
corneal edema, corneal abrasion, cystoid macular edema or other conditions that are known to 
affect vision but expected to resolve and not results in a permanent impact on vision.   
7.2.2 Criteria for Rescue Thera py

Other safety measures are discussed in section  7.2 above.  
 
7.3 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonab le possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes 
of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpected: An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
Investiga tor’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
  
Life-threatening: An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might ha ve caused death.  
 
A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring at 
any dose that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization.  
• Prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require 
intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above).  
 
A NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs 
as described above.

above.  
 
The SEVERITY of each AE will be classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.  
The Investigator will review each event and assess its RELATIONSHIP to use of 
investigational product (unrelated,  probably, definitely). The AE will be assessed using the 
following definitions :  
 
Unrelated:  
• Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event  easily explained by uncomplicated cataract surgery  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational product 
use.  
 
Probable:  
• Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known 
pharm acology.  
• Event cannot easily be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Definite:  
• Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
• Known reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by known pharmacology.  
• Event ca nnot be explained by subject’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
7.4 PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY THE INVESTIGATOR  
AEs will be monitored throughout the study and will be recorded on the CRF with the date and 
time of onset, date and time of resolution, sever ity, seriousness, causality (relationship to use of 
investigational product), treatment required, and the outcome.  
 
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the trial. For example:  
• How have you felt since your last assessment?  
• Have you had any health problems since your last assessment?  
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe.  
 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by the 
Principal Investigator after careful medical consideration a nd categorized as unrelated, probable, 
or definite.  
 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate. If a 
non-SAE is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to follow 
Tarsius -2020 -Trial   001 Clinical Study Protocol

8.1.3 Subject -Rated  Ocular P ain Assessment    
In the clinic, subjects will be handed a laminated card on which is printed the Subject -Rated 
Ocular Pain Assessment. Each subject will be asked to subjectively rate their pain at Visit 3 to 6 
based on this scale. This information will be provided to study  personnel to enter into the 
subject’s source documentation.  
The grading scale for pain to be used will be as follows:  
0 = None: Absence of pain.  
1 = Minimal: Presence of mild sensation or discomfort typical of post  cataract  surgery (e.g., 
diffuse or fo cal foreign body sensation, mild transient burning or stinging, etc.)  
2 = Mild: Mild, tolerable aching of the eye.

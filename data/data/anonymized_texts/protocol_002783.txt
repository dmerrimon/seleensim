2 INTRODUCTION  
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate of the upper and lower eyelids, where they terminate 
along the interior rim (o r margin) of the eyelids.  These glands secrete meibum, which is a lipid -rich 
essential component of a healthy tear film. When sufficient meibum is not present in the tear film, the 
aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupted and readily evaporates causing  irritation, redness, and 
inflammation of the lid margin and surrounding tissues.  Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is 
associated with a failure of these glands to produce adequate quantities of meibum due to atrophy, 
inflammation, or obstruction, and is thought to be the most common cause of evaporative dry eye 
disease [1]. 
 
A common clinical treatment to restore normal gland function in patients with obstructive MGD 
involves the application of heat and pressure therapy to the eyelids to express the meibomian gland 
obstruction and other material from the gland  [2].  Warming the eyelid tissue softens or melts the 
meibum, which is known to facilitate expression  using pressure.  
 
3 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The iLux™ System is a medical device intended for use by Eye Care Professionals (ECP) to apply localized 
heat and pressure therapy to a patient’s eyelids.  The system consists of a handheld instrument 
coupled to a single -use, sterile Disposable component that is positioned behind the eyelid. The iLux 
device allo ws an ECP to view the eyelid margin through a magnifier, then warm the eyelid tissue to a 
range of 40 to 42˚C, and then apply compression to the eyelid in order to express melted meibum from 
obstructed glands.  
3.1 iLux Indications for Use  
The iLux System is indicated for the application of localized heat and pressure therapy in adult patients 
with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), also 
known as evaporative dry eye.  
3.2 iLux Components  
The iLux system is shown i n Figure 1.

3.2.1 iLux Disposable  
The iLux Disposable  is a sterile component used for a single patient treatment , and then disposed.   The 
main parts of the Disposable  are shown in Figure 2 .  During a treatment, the Inner Eyelid Pad is inserted 
behind the eyelid in the fornix and is intended to contact the inner mucosal lining (i.e., the palpebral 
conjunctiva).  The Outer Pad, which opp oses the Inner Pad, contacts the skin on the outer surface of 
the eyelid.  Light  produced by the Instrument is transmitted through the clear Outer Pad to warm the 
eyelid tissue.  The Outer Pad is used to apply p ressure to the eyelid by moving this componen t towards 
the Inner Pad by means of a mechanism in  the Instrument.  Temperature sensors in the Outer and 
Inner Pads monitor eyelid temperature during a treatment.

3.2.2 iLux Instrument  
The iLux Instrument  is a handheld , electronic  instrument used together with the iLux Disposable  to 
apply heating and pressure  to the eyelid.   The Instrument  includes electronic circuits that  read sensors 
in the Inner and Outer Eyelid Pads  to measure temperatures  representative of inner and outer eyelid  
temperature, respectively .  Warming is accomplished using light energy emitted from LEDs  in the 
Instrument .  A mechanism in the Instrument allows the operator to apply pressure to the eyelid by 
controlling the movement of the Outer Pad using finger pressure applied to the Compression Control 
button.  The force applied to the Compression Control is measured by a sensor in this mechanism.  A 
graphic Screen displays information for operating the Instrument  during a treatmen t. A magnifier 
allows the operator to view the e yelid margin during treatment.  
 
Eyelid temperature is measured using sensors in the Disposable including two sensors  in the Outer Pad 
and two in the Inner Pad.  When the Disposable is attached to Instrument, spring loaded pins mounted 
above the Shroud make an electrical connection to the pads in the Disposable.  Electronic  circuitry  in 
the Instrument reads the sensors and determines temperatures more than 20 times a second.  The 
accuracy of the temperature measurement system is ± 1 °C.  The circuitry performs self -test checks to 
ensure the sensors are operating properly.  If  the electronics detect a failure, an error code is displayed  
and the heat source  is disabled . 
 
The Instrument features an integrated Display Screen shown in Figure 3.  The Display Screen shows 
the elapsed warming time that the temperature is above 38 °C ( in seconds), the compression force 
applied by the user, the highest of the two temperature sensors located in the Inner Eyelid Pad, and 
status of the rechargeable batteries as indicated by a battery icon. The Display also provides messages 
regarding status  or conditions that require the operator’s attention.

Figure 3: The information displayed on the screen.   Any operating message is displayed on the bottom row.  
Pressure applied to the eyelid is controlled by the ECP depressing the Compression Control button 
using their thumb or finger, which causes the Outer Pad to move towards the opposing Inner Pad.  The 
mechanism that connects the Compression Control button to  the Outer Eyelid Pad is shown in Figure 
4.  When the Disposable is attached to the Instrument, the Outer Eyelid Pad automatically attaches to 
the front of the Shroud.  The Compression Control button is connected to the movable Shroud by a 
linkage, which r educes the force applied to the Compression Control button by at least 50%.  The ECP 
can retract or advance the Outer Eyelid Pad and Shroud combination as well as control the amount of 
pressure applied using the Compression Control button.   A sensor is mou nted in this mechanism to 
measure the force applied by the user to Compression Control button.  Electronic circuitry monitors 
the sensor output and then displays the compression force on the Screen to provide feedback for the 
user during a treatment.  
 
 
Figure  4  A mechanism in the Instrument  allows the eye care professional to control the pressure applied to the eyelid .  
Depressing the Compression Control button causes the Outer Pad attached to the Instrument Shroud to advance towards the 
Inner Pad.   A spr ing-return feature causes the Outer Pad and Shroud to retract when the Compression Control is released.  
 
The eyelid tissue is warmed by light energy produced by LEDs in the Instrument  and transmitted 
through the clear Outer Pad .  The LEDs are located behind a clear window on the open end of the 
Shroud. Two wavelengths of light are used : lime -green (568 nm) and near -infrared (850 nm).  
Chromophores in the eyelid absorb the light energy and heat the surrounding tissue  [3].  Similarly , 
chromophores in the black plastic of the Inner Pad absorb the light energy and warm nearby tissue of

the inner eyelid.  A small fan, which creates an audible sound, provides cooling for the LEDs by drawing 
air through slotted openings in the housing.  
 
The system is designed to protect against unintended exposure to the light.  The Inner Pad and Eye 
Shield block light transmission directly into the eye during a treatment.  The Instrument is designed to 
prevent heat source operation w ithout a Disposable att ached.  To minimize stray light , the heat source 
cannot be operated without the user advanc ing the Outer Pad to within 4 to 6 mm of the Inner Pad  by 
depressing the Compression Control.  
 
The top surface of the Compression Control has a Heater Control switch  that is slid forward by the 
operator’s thumb or forefinger to turn on the warming  LEDs.  This switch has a spring -return feature, 
so that when it is released, or when the ECP’s thumb or forefinger is relaxed, the Heater Control switch 
returns to its norma l “off” position.  The highest temperature measured by the Inner Eyelid Pad  sensors  
is shown on the LCD.  When the heater is turned on by the ECP, circuitry adjusts power to the LEDs to 
raise eyelid temperatures to 40 to 42 °C.  At any time during heating , if any of the measure d eyelid 
temperatures exceeds 42  ⁰C, the high -temperature alert symbol is displayed  and the light source is 
dimmed.  If any one of the temperatures exceeds 44  ⁰C, the attention required  symbol is displayed  the 
Instrument autom atically turns off the light source  until the temperature drops below 40 ⁰C.  The 
elapsed time that the tissue is warmed above 38°C is displayed on the screen.  The duration that the 
LEDs can be operated is limited to 90 seconds from initial activation ; after this period , sliding the 
Heater Control switch forward will no longer turn on the LEDs .  Momentarily depressing the  Instrument 
power ON/OFF switch resets the 90 second LED timer and the elapsed warming  timer . 
 
The instrument records temperature and for ce along with other operating data in internal memory.  
Data.  The performance data can be downloaded to an external compute r by Tear Film for the 
purposes of troubleshooting or other data needs . 
3.2.3 Device Operation  
The Instrument is turned ON by depressing t he ON/OFF button  for four seconds .  The instrument first 
verifies proper operation of the internal electronics and beeps once if no errors are detected.   Without 
a Disposable attached, the Screen displays the “Attach Disposable” message.  If the Screen dis plays an 
error message, the operator should refer to the Troubleshooting section of this manual.  If the battery 
power is low, which is indicated by a flashing battery icon with a single bar, the Instrument should be 
turned OFF and the batteries removed an d placed in the charging stand.  When the Instrument is 
ready, th e Disposable  is removed from the packaging immediately before a treatment and attached 
to the Instrument  by means of snap clips on the two sides.   The Screen now displays the  elapsed time, 
which is “0”, the compression force, and the highest Inner Pad temperature.  
After the patient is prepared, t he Inner Eyelid Pad is placed  adjacent to the region of the palpebral  
conjunctiva contain ing the meibomian glands to be treated .  Figure 5  illustrates the Inner Pad 
placement for a lower eyelid and Figure 6 shows Inner Pad placement for an upper eyelid.  The orifices 
of the targeted glands should be visible through the Magnifier.  The Outer Eyelid Pad  is then  moved 
against the outer surface of t he eyelid by depressing the Compression Control on the Instrument .  
Since the Outer Eyelid Pad  opposes the Inner Eyelid Pad , this action applies pressure to the eyelid that 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 14 of 36 
can be varied by the force  applied to the Compression Control .  This force is displ ayed on the Screen 
to provide feedback to the user.  If compressing the glands using a gentle pressure (force < 3) does 
not produce secretions,  then the tissue should be warmed to approximately 40 to 42 ⁰C to melt the 
meibum and facilitate expression.  Sli ding the heater control switch forward causes the Instrument to 
energize the LEDs.    
 
 
 
Figure 5:  To treat a lower eyelid, the patient is instructed to look up and the Inner Eyelid Pad  is placed  in the inferior fornix 
adjacent to the  blocked meibomian glands .  The Compression Control i s then depressed causing  the Outer Eyelid Pad  to apply 
pressure against the outer eyelid . 
 
 
Figure 6: Treatment of an upper lid  is illustration.  The patient is instructed to look down and the Inner pad is placed in superior 
fornix adjacent to the blocked meibomian glands.   The screen content is automatically re -oriented to remain upright when the 
Instrument is inverted.

3.3 LipiFlo w System  
The Lipiflow Thermal Pulsation System is a commercially available device used in the treatment of 
MGD.  It is cleared to be marketed by the United States Food and Drug Administration and will be used 
as the control device in this study.  
3.4 LipiFlow I ndications for Use  
The LipiFlow Thermal Pulsation System is intended for the application of localized heat and pressure 
therapy in adult patients with chronic cystic conditions of the eyelids, including meibomian gland 
dysfunction (MGD), also known as evap orative dry eye or lipid deficiency dry eye.  
3.5  LipiFlow Components  
The LipiFlow Console provides the user interface and control elements of the system, including all 
software, algorithms and control elements.  The Activator, a single -use sterile device, del ivers 
automated therapeutic energies to each meibomian gland.  Its contoured design vaults the cornea and 
protects the eye allowing a maximum therapeutic temperature of 43 degrees Celsius to reach glands 
from the inner eyelid, without damaging the eyelid o r delicate structures of the globe. Insulation 
protects the cornea from exceeding a safe 39.5 degrees Celsius, while a pressure feedback loop sends 
pulsed sequences to expel blockages.  Force equalization protects the globe from pressure 
transmission by fo cusing energy only on the eyelid.   Delivered through the LipiFlow Activator, Vectored 
Thermal Pulse™ (VTP) technology applies a combination of heat and pressure to the inner eyelid to 
safely remove gland obstructions and stagnant gland content. Vectored he at and adaptive force 
equalization targets the pulse, heat, and pressure on the meibomian glands to maximize effectiveness. 
Therapeutic motion provides proximal -to-distal parastalsis to clear gland contents.

This study is a randomized , open -label, multisite clinical trial comparing the iLux System to an active 
control, which will be the LipiFlow® Thermal Pulsation System.  The goal of this study is to verify that 
technological differences between the iLux System and the LipiFlow System do not adversely affect 
safety and effectiveness.   The comparison between the two systems will determine if the iLux System 
is non -inferior to the LipiFlow System.  The proposed sample size is 256 eyes (128 subjects) to 
demonstrate non -inferiority of treat ment with iLux relative to treatment with LipiFlow for the two 
coprimary effectiveness endpoints.  A total of 14 2 subjects is requested to allow for 10% fallout during 
patient screening. One hundred twenty -eight subjects will be randomized for bilateral tr eatment and 
will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio into the iLux treatment group or the control group at least 7 study sites.  
4.3 Non -Significant Risk  
The iLux device is a non -significant risk device because it does not meet the criteria for a significant 
risk device . 
The criteria for a significant risk device are as follows1: 
1. The device is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject;  
2. The device is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and 
presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
3. The device is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
4. The device otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
4.4 Outcome Measures  
4.4.1 Co-Primary E ffectiveness Endpoint s 
The co-primary  effectiveness endpoint s are the changes from baseline  to the 4 -week exam  in total 
Meibomian Gland Score (MGS)  and Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT) .  MGS must be assessed by a masked

rater .  Clinical and statistically significant improvements from baseline for each parameter are 
required to achieve success for these co -primary endpoints.  
The MGS is determined  for the lower eyelids  using a device  that applies a standardized pressure  to an 
area including 5 glands (Meibomian Gland Evaluator, Model MGE -1000, TearScience , Inc.)  while 
viewing the eyelid margin using a slit lamp microscope to determine the presence and quality of the 
gland secretions.  A  total of  15 glands  in three lower eyelid zone s (nasal,  medial, temporal ) will be 
evaluated.  Each gland is graded from 0 to 3 (0 =  no secretion,  1 = inspissated,  2 = cloudy, 3 =  clear  
liquid).  The maximum MGS score is 45  in each eye .  This endpoint has been used in previous studies 
evaluating the LipiFlow device  [5, 6].  The clinician performing the MGS must not be involved in the 
study procedure and must be blinded to which arm of the study the subject is randomized.  
TBUT is evaluated  using the fluorescein method [4].  This measurement provides an aggregate 
assessment of the effectiveness of treatments to both the lower and upper eyelids.  
4.4.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The secondary effectiveness endpoint will be the c hange from base line in p atient symptoms using the 
Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)  at the 4-week exam .  OSDI is a scoring that evaluates patient 
symptoms based on a validated questionnaire  [7].  This assessment has been used in several clinical 
studies for treating MGD with the LipiFlow [ 5, 6]. 
4.4.3 Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint will be a comparison of the incidence of device -related adverse events 
(e.g., changes in the lid marg in, development of floppy eyelids, entropion or ectropion; and lash 
integrity) for the two treatments . 
4.4.4 Secondary Safety Endpoint  
A secondary safety endpoint will be following assessments:  
• The evaluation of discomfort and pain during treatment  
• Changes from baseline following treatment for the test and control devices  for the following 
assessments : 
o Ocular Surface Staining  
o Intraocular Pressure

6 STUDY PROCEDURE S 
6.1 Subject Enrollment  
Patients  will be screened, assessed, treated and followed according to the schedule in Appen dix A.   
Patients must have the study explained to them by a member of the site study team, they must be 
provided sufficient time to consider their participation in the study and provided an opportunity to ask 
questions of the study team.  Subjects must sig n the most current version of an informed consent form  
(ICF) approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).  All patients who sign an ICF are considered 
enrolled  subjects  in the study.  Therefore, patients should be screened to the extent possible prior to 
signing an ICF but patients should not undergo any study -specific assessments until they have signed 
the ICF.  
 
Enrolled subjects will be assigned a unique study identification (ID) number.  No subject -specific 
information (e.g., initials) will be used in the ID number.  Only the study ID number will be used to 
identify subjects once they are enrolled.  
6.2 Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time, for any reason.  
Investigators may also withdraw subj ects from the study at their discretion in order to protect the 
rights, safety, or welfare of the subject.   All withdrawn subjects will be included in study analyses but 
they will not be replaced.  No missing data will be imputed.  
6.3 Screening  
The following steps and information will be performed/completed  up to 7 days prior to the treatment 
day: 
• Informed Consent  
• Demographics/Medical/Ocular history  
• Concomitant Systemic and Ophthalmic Meds  
6.4 Pre-Treatment /Baseline  Assessment  
The following assessments will be performed on Day 0, prior to  treatment ( Note : the OSDI , Discomfort ,

Discomfort  and P ain 
Questionnaire s The Pain Questionnaire (provided in Appendix C) is a Linkert scale 
questionnairesusing a scale of 0 -10 with anchored descriptions for the scale.  The 
Discomfort Questionnaire is a visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaire using a scale 
from 0 -100% to assess eye discomfort.  Both questionnaires are to be self -
assessed by the subject pri or to any clinical assessment.

questionnaires include 12 questions  in 3 categories asked of the subjects by 
clinicians who circle a number  next to a  description  that best represents the 
subject’s  answer  on a paper form . The numbers for each category are totaled and 
the total OSDI score is calculated by the formula: sum of scores x 25/# of 
questions answered .  Dry eye severity is then assessed using th e chart on the 2nd 
page of the questionnaire.

7 DATA ANALYSIS  
Descriptive statistics will be provided to summarize outcomes at each visit as well as for change from 
base line.  Continuous endpoints will be summarized with N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
maximum, and median.  Categorical or binary endpoints will be summarized by count and percentage. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to assess the treatment effect between baseline and 4 
weeks for iLux and LipiFlow (LF) treatments for the primary and secondary effectiveness endpoint s. 
For each endpoint analyzed, the baseline value will be used as a covariate.  
Given that non -inferiority  is demonstrated for the iLux endpoints , success will not be claimed unless 
the mean change from baseline in the test arm is clinically significant and significantly different from 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 24 of 36 
zero.  For any endpoints for which non -inferiority is demonstrated and mean  changes from baseline 
are clinically significant and significantly different from zero, a test for superiority will be performed.  
All subjects enrolled  and treated  in the study shall be included as part of the safety analysis.  
Subjects who are randomized  but not treated for any reason will be included in the intent -to-treat 
analysis as part of the arm to which they are randomized but they will be excluded from the per -
protocol analysis.  
7.1 Clinically Significant Effects  
The values for clinical significance a re used to establish the non -inferiority margins.  
7.1.1 Meibomian Gland Score (MGS)  
The clinical significance of the MGS score change  both from baseline and in comparing study arms  is 
based on a severity ranking using an alternative scoring method established by the consensus of 
clinical experts in the Diagnosis Subcommittee of the International Workshop on Meibomian Gland 
Dysfunction [4].  A difference in score of 5 changes the staging  of the severity of MGD, and therefore 
represents  a clinically significant level.  
7.1.2 Tear Break -Up Time  
The clinical significance for a change in TBUT both from baseline and in comparing study arms  has not 
been reported in any of the published LipiFlow studie s or other studies of MGD diagnosis and 
treatment.  As a result, the clinical significance of the TBUT is based on labeling for the DET test strip 
(Table 2).  The diagnosis of dry and abnormal tear stability is determined by a span of 5 seconds.  If 
we use  a moderate change in effect of 50%, then a difference in TBUT of 2.5 seconds is determined to 
be clinically significant.  Based on this determination of a clinically significant change, a value of 2.5 
seconds for the non -inferiority margin is used for TBU T primary endpoint.  
Table 2: AMCON DET strip labeling  
TBUT (seconds)  Significance  
≥ 10  Normal  
> 5 to < 10  Borderline dry eye  
< 5 Dry eye  
7.1.3 OSDI  
A change in score of 7 is the minimal clinically significant difference for patients with moderate and 
severe dry eye established in a clinical study by Miller [9] using an anchor -based method.  For this 
study, this value is being used both from baseline and in comparing study arms.  
7.2 Non -Inferiority Compared to Control  
7.2.1 Primary Effec tiveness Endpoint s Hypothesis  
7.2.1.1  MGS  
The co-primary effectiveness endpoint, MGS, will be tested for non -inferiority against LipiFlow using 
a 5-point  non-inferiority delta (δ) in a one -tailed test.   
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 25 of 36 
It is hypothesized that the MGS mean score from the iLux group will not be lower than (not inferior 
to) the MGS mean score from the LipiFlow group at  the 4 -week exam : 
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) + δ ≤ 0  
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) + δ > 0  
Where μ (iLux -MGS – LF-MGS) is the  mean difference in the MGS between iLux and LipiFlow from 
baseline to week 4 and δ = 5.  
The MGS was found to be highly correlated across eyes in the previously complet ed pilot study data 
(correlation of 0.68); consequently, OD and OS values will be averaged to form an overall person score.  
An ANCOVA model, with baseline MGS as a covariate, will be used to assess the difference between 
the LipiFlow  System  and the iLux System  results.  The lower boundary of the least square means group 
confidence interval will be tested against t he non -inferiority boundary of 5 points.  To be successful, 
the lower boundary of the confi dence interval must exceed -5. 
7.2.1.2  TBUT  
The co -primary end point, Tear Break -Up Time (TBUT) will be tested for non -inferiority against LipiFlow 
using a 2.5 -second non -inferiority delta (δ) in a one -tailed test.  A similar ANCOVA model will be used 
to compare TBUT between devices, with covariate adjustment for base line TBUT.  It is hypothesized 
that the TBUT mean time for the iLux group will not be less than (not inferior to) the TBUT mean time 
for the LipiFlow group at the 4 -week exam:  
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -TBUT – LF-TBUT) + δ ≤ 0  
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iL ux-TBUT – LF-TBUT) + δ > 0  
Where μ (iLux -TBUT – LF-TBUT) = mean difference in the TBUT between iLux and LipiFlow from 
baseline to week 4 and δ = 2.5.  
7.2.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis  
If the co-primary effectiveness endpoint s demonstrate non -inferiority, the secondary effectiveness 
endpoint, change from baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) at the 4 -week exam , will be 
compared against the control devic e to test for non -inferiority .  A similar ANCOVA model will be use d 
to compare OSDI between devices, with covariate adjustment for baseline OSDI.   
It is hypothesized that the OSDI mean score from the iLux group will not be lower than (not inferior 
to) the OSDI mean score from the LipiFlow group at  the 4 -week exam : 
Null Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) - δ ≥ 0 
Alternate Hypothesis:   μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) - δ < 0 
Where μ (iLux -OSDI – LF-OSDI) = mean difference in the OSDI between iLux and LipiFlow from baseline 
to week 4 and δ = 7. 
7.2.3 Multiplicity  
Both co -primary endp oints, MGS and TBUT, must be successful to demonstrate non -inferiority.  The 
secondary endpoint is only tested if the co -primary effectiveness endpoints are non -inferior.  
7.2.4 Sample Size Justification  
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 26 of 36 
The proposed sample size is 256 eyes  (128 subjects) for this open -label, prospective multicenter trial 
designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of treatment with iLux relative to treatment with LipiFlow for 
the primary effectiveness endpoint.  A total of 142 subjects is requested to allow for 10% fallout during 
patient screening.  This study design provides a combined power of 88% to demonstrate non -
inferiority given the following primary endpoint assumptions:  
• MGS non -inferiority delta of 5 points and standard deviation of 8 points, provides a MGS 
primary endpoint power of 93.9% . 
• TBUT non -inferiority delta of 2.5 seconds and s tandard deviation of 4 seconds, provides a TBUT 
primary endpoint power of 93.9%  
• Power that both endpoints are significant, assuming independence, is 0.9392 = 0.882, or 88.2% 
power.  
For the secondary endpoint, a standard deviation of 14 is assumed based on pilot data and the non -
inferiority delta is set to 7.  The chosen sample size and α =.025 provides 80% power for this endpoint.  
7.2.5 Safety  Endpoints  
The primary safety endpoint is the c omparison of the incidence of device -related adverse events (e.g., 
changes in the lid margin, development of floppy eyelids, entropion or ectropion; and lash integrity) 
for the two treatments .  The reporting period is from baseline  through the last study visit.  
The secondary safety endpoint is the evaluation of discomfort and pain during treatment and changes 
from baseline following treatment for the test and control devices for the following a ssessments:  
• Ocular Surface Staining  
• Intraocular Pressure  
• BSCVA  
Adverse events a nd other  findings shall be summarized  by presenting  the percentages of subjects with 
each event type.  Continuous  endpoints shall be summarized using  summary  statistics such as means, 
medians, standard deviations,  minima, maxima, and relevant percentiles.   Definitions of adverse 
events, serious adverse events, and categorizations of events can be found in Appendix D.  
All adverse events shall be evaluated beginning with onset, and  evaluation shall continue until 
resolution is noted, or until the investigator determines that the subject’s condition is stable.  
All AEs shall be characterized by the following criteria (see Adverse Event Definitions in Appendix D): 
• Event diagnosis  
• Inten sity or severity ( mild, moderate, severe ) 
• Expectedness ( anticipated, unanticipated ) 
• Relatedness to study treatment ( related, not related ) 
• Treatment ( none, medication, non -drug treatment/procedure, ER visit/hospitalization ) 
• Action taken ( none, study procedu re interrupted, study procedure discontinued ) 
• Outcome  (resolved without sequelae, resolved with sequelae -specify, ongoing  at time of assessment , 
death, unknown ) 
If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event shall be recorded separately.

7.2.5.1  Antici pated Adverse Events  
• Eyelid/eye Pain   
• Eyelid Irritation or Inflammation  
• Ocular Surface Irritation or Inflammation  
• Ocular Symptoms – Burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreign body sensation, 
visual disturbance, sensitivity to light.  
7.2.5.2  Serious Adverse Event and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Reporting  
SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) must be reported to the study sponsor as soon 
as possible and no later than 48 hours after the investigator first learns of the event.   
For initial reports, Investigators shall record all case details t hat can be gathered within the reporting 
timeframe.  The contact information for Tear Film Innovations, Inc. below:  
Study Sponsor:  
Tear Film Innovations, LLC  
Rob Thornhill, Chief Executive Officer  
12625 High Bluff Drive, Suite 107  
San Diego, CA  92130  
PHON E: (858) 755 -3333  
E-Mail:  rthornhill@tearfilm.com  
Relevant follow -up information shall be submitted to the sponsor as soon as it becomes available 
and/or upon request.  For some events, the sponsor or designee may follow up with the site by 
telephone, fa x, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details deemed 
necessary to appropriately evaluate the event (e.g., hospital discharge summary, consultant report, 
or autopsy report).  Reports relating to the subject’s subsequent med ical course must be submitted 
to the study sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the event 
stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained.  
7.2.6 Poolability Analysis  
Subject demographic characteristics and background variables shall be summarized.   To ensure 
poolability, primary effectiveness  endpoints will be compared across site and gender.  Analysis of 
variance will be used to test mean effects and interaction of stratification variables of treatment.   A 
p-value of 0.15 will be used for these assessments.  
7.2.7 Missing Data  
Primary and secondary effectiveness  endpoints will be imputed when missing to preserve the 
randomization in the intent -to-treat analysis population. The primary method of imputation used will 
be by multiple imputation. Ten imputations will be produced for each endpoint using SAS PROC MI. 
The seed used to begin random number generation will be 11142016. The Markov chain Monte Carlo 
method will be used to compute with the following predictor  variables: baseline tear break -up time, 
baseline M GS score, gender, and age.  Alternate imputation methods used to assess sensitivity to the 
presence of missing data will by last observation carried forward (LOCF), best case (a test subject’s 
best prior v alue and a predicate subject’s worst prior value is imputed) and worst case (a test subject’s 
worst prior value and a predicate subject’s best prior value is imputed). If best case and wor st case 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 28 of 36 
conclusions differ, a tipping point analysis will be perform ed. In the absence of post -treatment data, 
baseline values will be used for imputation for alternate imputation methods.  
 
8 RISK ANALYSIS  
Risks associated with using the iLux 2020 were assessed in accordance with ISO 14971, which is an 
international standard  for medical device risk management that is recognized by the FDA.  Most of the 
potential hazards identified in the analysis are common to many medical devices and are addressed 
by compliance with international standards. Other potential hazards unique to the iLux were 
addressed by assessing risk using Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and identifying 
controls to reduce residual risks to acceptable levels.  
The iLux is used in the eye and the sterile disposable may come in contact with the conjunctiva and or 
cornea during the treatment of each lid.  The sterile disposable is covered with a biocompatible 
silicone similar to a contact lens.  There is nothing implanted either temporarily or permanently in the 
eye related to the iLux and the  risk is similar to other meibomian gland treatments.  Testing 
demonstrated that the disposable meets the requirements for biocompatibility (ISO 10993) and 
sterilization and packaging (ISO 1135, ISO 11607).   
 
9 MEDICAL MONITOR  
David Hardten, MD will serve a s Medical Monitor for this study to oversee the overall safety and 
conduct of the study.  There are no formal stopping rules for this study but the Medical Monitor is 
responsible for notifying the Sponsor of any circumstances in which he believes the right s, safety, 
and/or welfare of study subjects or potential future study subjects is compromised.  The Sponsor is 
responsible for supplying the Medical Monitor with timely, complete, and accurate accounts of all 
adverse events in the study as well as regular progress reports that provide information such as 
enrollment rate, study compliance, and/or any other issues that may impact the scientific integrity of 
the study.  The Medical Monitor will meet periodically with the Sponsor to review study status and any 
issues with study conduct and/or subject safety.  
 
10 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
Unscheduled visits will be recorded by the site and data will be collected relating to any adverse events, 
device -related events, or any endpoint of the study.  Data will be recorded on the most appropriate 
CRF depending on when the unscheduled visit occurs relative to the procedure.   Any unscheduled visit 
should not replace  or be in lieu of  any scheduled visit unless agreed to by the Sponsor  and documented 
in the site regulatory file .

11 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N 
The study sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the study 
may include, but are not limited  to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to subjects  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory  
• Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete.  
 
12 RECORD RETENTION  
The investigator sha ll maintain all subject records for a period of two years after the latter of the 
conclusion or termination of the investigation or the time it is determined that the information is no 
longer needed to support a regulatory submission for market clearance.  
 
The investigator must maintain accurate records of the receipt of all investigational material shipped 
by the sponsor, including the date and lot numbers received.  In addition, accurate records must be 
kept on the amount and date that the investigational  material, by lot number, was used and for each 
subject.  
 
The investigator must assure that study supplies are used only in conjunction with subjects enrolled in 
the study and under the direct supervision of the investigator or co -investigators.  
 
13 STUDY MO NITORING REQUIREMENT S 
It is the responsibility of the study Sponsor to ensure proper monitoring of the investigation and to see 
that all the clinical requirements are met.  Either sponsor personnel or a contracted third party will 
perform monitoring.  In g eneral, monitoring will consist of an initiation visit to train the site on the 
proper use of the device and execution of the protocol.  Ongoing monitoring will consist of periodic 
visits to the site to compare study eCRF data with site source data.  The f requency of these visits will 
depend on site enrollment and observations during prior visits.  During monitoring visits, the monitor 
may review the subject records to verify that all records and files are current and to assure compliance 
with all requireme nts of this protocol as well as with applicable IDE regulations.  The final monitoring 
visit may also serve as the study close -out visit.  
 
14 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS/ AMENDMENTS  
An investigator may deviate from the protocol to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in 
an emergency, and must notify the sponsor and the reviewing IRB within 5 working days after the 
emergency occurred.  Except in such an emergency, an investigator may not deviate from the protocol 
 
2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 30 of 36 
unless he/she obtains the prior approval of the sponsor.  Depending on the specifics of the deviation, 
IRB approval may also be required.  
 
15 DEVICE ACCOUNTABILIT Y 
All investigational devices will be tracked  during the study  by either lot number or serial number 
depending on the device .  The Sponsor will track all device shipments and all device returns.   An 
accountability log will be maintained at each site to record the date and number of devices received 
by the site as wel l as the date and number of devices used, returned  to the Sponsor , and/or disposed 
of during the study.  This log will be included in the review of documentation during monitoring visits.  
Overall accountability for all devices will be maintained by the Sp onsor.

2020 -03 Ver 1. 3 (03Apr2019 ) ***CONFIDENTIAL***  Page 36 of 36 APPENDIX D:  ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an investigational drug or device, or other protocol -imposed intervention, 
regardless of the suspected cause  
• Chronic but stable c onditions or diseases are not A Es 
• Changes in a chronic condition o r disease consistent with natural disease progression 
are not AEs  
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  SAEs are AEs that:  
• Led to death  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the patient that resulted in:  
o A life -threatening illness or injury  
o A permanent impairment of a body function  
o In-patient or prolonged hospitalization  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to body structure or a body function  
AE Severity  Mild :  Awareness of sign o r symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause i nterference with usual activity  
Severe :  Incapacitating with inabili ty to work or do usual activity  
• Severity is irrespective of procedure relationship or seriousness of the event  
• Severity is a measurement of intensity but not seriousness; thus, a severe reaction is 
not necessarily a SAE  
AE Expectedness  Anticipated :  The nature, severity, or degree of i ncidence was previously described, 
including those anticipated events listed in the protocol and/or 
IFU/User Manual  of the device . 
Unanticipated : The nature, severity, or degree of incidenc e was not previously 
described.  
AE Relatedness  Not related : Clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the subject, 
and does not follow a known response pattern  to the procedure  
Related :  Follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of procedure 
and/or follows a known response pattern to the study procedure and 
cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant therapy administered to 
the subject

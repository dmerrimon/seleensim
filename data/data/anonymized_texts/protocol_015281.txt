Varian Confidential  1Day 2- Day 1 1 bone pain flare assessment questionnaire is completed remotely.   
2It is desirable to have follow -up visits in -person.  However, it is acceptable to carry out remote follow -up visits  as an alternative in the event of the subject’s inability or 
reluctance to travel  given the current COVID -19 pandemic . In these circumstance s, photographs of the treatment site may be taken at home by caregivers , and physical 
evaluation will be carried out to the extent that is feasible via telehealth.  
3 Long Term follow -up will continue until subject death or lost to follow -up. Following the Month 3  visit, subsequent l ong-term follow -up visits will take place every 2 
months . Questionnaires will be completed as subject’s clinical status permits.  Subject evaluation (review of pain medications  (including steroid medications) , 
performance status , physical evaluation ) and adverse event evaluation may  be carried out using a combination of remote visits and/or records review  as an alternative 
to in -person visits  to accommodate the subject’s  inabili ty or reluctance to travel . 
4See section  2.8.6  for the description of the questionnaires.  
5Physical evaluation includes photographs of skin at entry and exit sites of beam . These should include an image that encompasses  the entire anatomi c region treated 
(upper leg, lower leg, upper arm, lower arm), with close -up photographs of the skin in each treated area (s), if the treated area (s) is readily identifiable.

Varian Confidential  2.3 Introduction  
Rationale for evaluating FLASH radiotherapy:  
Radiotherapy is one of the primary treatment modalities for the treatment of patients with 
cancer.  Most radiotherapy is delivered using linear accelerators or cyclotrons/synchrotrons to 
create ionizing radiation in the form of x -rays, electrons, or protons.  Th e radiation  is delivered 
to cancer -containing tissue with the intent of eradicating cancer whi le minimizing harm to 
surrounding normal tissue.  Creation of a favorable “therapeutic ratio” for radiotherapy damage 
to tumor with sparing of adjacent normal tissue is primarily accomplished through careful 
targeting of the tumor, conforming the delivered  radiation to the target volume, and delivery of 
modest “sub -lethal” amounts of radiation repeatedly over time (termed “dose fractionation”).  
One potential strategy for increasing the therapeutic ratio that has been largely unexplored is 
the delivery of r adiation at ultra -high dose rates.  
 
Due to technical limitations of current radiation -generating devices, most radiotherapy is 
delivered at dose rates of approximately 0 .03 Gy/s .  Decades of experimental and clinical 
experience have been obtained demonstrating the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy given at 
these dose rates, and this is the standard of care for treating patients with cancer.  More 
recently, radiation -generating devices have been devised that are capable of delivering much 
higher r adiation dose rates – 40 Gy/s or greater.  Radiation produced at these high dose rates 
has been termed “FLASH” radiotherapy  since the entire fraction of radiotherapy can be 
delivered in less than a second .   
 
The effects of FLASH radiotherapy  have been stu died in vitro and in animals with encouraging  
results.  Compared to radiotherapy given at conventional dose rates, FLASH radiotherapy  has 
been shown in multiple models to cause less injury to normal cells and tissue, while having  equal 
or greater tumor cel l killing.  Favaudon et al. irradiated mouse lungs in  vivo with both FLASH 
radiotherapy  and conventional dose  rate radiotherapy (CRT)  [1].  Using a single dose of 17 Gy, 
100% of mice given CRT developed pneumonitis and fibrosis  whereas none of the mice given 
FLASH radiotherapy  developed these toxicities .  FLASH radiotherapy  doses were escalated to 30 
Gy single dose before the mice began developing pneumonitis and fibrosis.  The same 
investigators treated orthotopic lung tumors i n mice with single dose FLASH radiotherapy  and 
CRT.  15 Gy CRT controlled tumors in only 20% of mice , most of which developed significant 
pneumonitis.  27 Gy FLASH radiotherapy  controlled tumors in 70% of mice, none of which  
developed pneumonitis.  
 
Montay -Gruel et al.   treated mouse brains in vivo with 10 Gy of radiation using both FLASH 
radiotherapy  and CRT techniques.  Neurocognitive impairment developed subsequently in the 
CRT group  whereas mice treated with FLASH radiotherapy  remained functionally intact  [2].  The 
normal tissue sparing effects of FLASH have also been observed in several other tissues and 
animal models including mouse intestine  [3], mouse skin  [4], and cat and pig skin  [5]. The 
mechanism for FLASH is not fully understood, but there are data that suggest FLASH produces 
lower levels of toxic oxygen reactive species in  normal  tissues as compared to CRT  [6].  
To date, there has been one published case report of the use of FLASH radiotherapy  in a human.  
A single  patient with cutaneous T cell lymphoma and extensive prior radiotherapy to the skin 
was treated with electron FLASH radiotherapy  for a recurrent cutaneous lymphoma lesion.  A 
CIP: Feasibility Study of FLASH Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Bone Metastases (VAR -2019 -02) 
 Page 12 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  single dose of FLASH radiotherapy  using 15 Gy electron radiotherapy was delivere d.  This 
resulted in a complete response of the lesion with minimal toxicity to the surrounding skin  [7]. 
Given the preclinical data suggesting significant reduction in normal tissue toxicity using FLASH 
radiotherapy  compared to CRT and equivalent efficacy of treatment, we propose to assess the 
workflow feasibility of FLASH radiotherapy in a clinical setting, toxicities, and pain relief at the 
treated site(s) following treatment of painful bone metastasis( -es) in extr emities.  
 
 
Rationale for using protons for FLASH radiotherapy:   
Currently, there is no commercially available medical linear accelerator capable of delivering x -
rays at FLASH  dose rates.  However, some cyclotrons used to produce proton radiation for 
treat ment of cancer have high beam currents that are capable of these dose rates.  Therefore, 
this clinical  study will be carried out at investigational sites with  the ProBeam  Proton Therapy 
System, an FDA cleared device  (510(k) K133191 ), that utilizes a cyclot ron to deliver proton 
radiation , and that is  modified to deliver the proton radiation at a FLASH dose rate.  
 
 
Rationale for selecting patients with bone metastases for study:  
Patients with painful bone metastas es represent an ideal population for a feasibility  study of 
FLASH radiotherapy .  These patients are known to benefit from the palliative effects of 
radiotherapy using single dose radiation dose regimens , similar to those  tested in pre -clinical 
studies of FLASH radiotherapy  [8] [9].  If treated off -study with CRT, these patients’ photon 
treatment regimen and follow -up is expected to  be very similar to what would be performed on -
study using FLASH radiotherapy  with protons .  Therefore, the time and social burden imposed 
by study participation would be minimal  and risk of toxicities would also be minimized .   
 
 
Amendments to th is Clinical Investigation Plan ( CIP) will be made by revising the CIP and 
producing a “track changes” version showing changes from one version to another version.

2.6 Study Design  
This study is designed as  a prospective feasibility study.    
 
Subjects will be followed until death or lost to follow -up.  
 
The study patients will be enrolled and undergo FLASH radiotherapy  at 1 investigational site.  
 
 
2.7 Study Population  (Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria)  
Patients with up to 3 painful bone metastas is(-es) in the extremit ies (limbs , excluding feet, 
hands, wrists ) will be evaluated for this study. Only limb bones will be treated with FLASH  
(excluding feet, hands, wrists).  Other  bone metastases  (i.e., non -limbs or feet, hands, wrists)  
may be treated with conventional radiation therapy while the patient is on  study.  Painful 
lesions of the limb bones must be treatable with fixed protocol field sizes (see below) for each 
limb bone lesion, without overlap of radiation fields.  Patients should have expected life 
expectancy  >2 months, in the judgement of the inves tigator.  Women of childbearing age must 
verbally deny being pregnant at the time of consent (pregnancy test will be performed  prior to 
CT simulation  as per standard of care at the investigational site ). 
 
All inclusion criteria must be met and none of the e xclusion criteria may be present for a patient 
to be eligible for the study.  All eligibility criteria will be assessed prior to study enrollment .

Varian Confidential  Baseline Evaluation  
Subject  characteristics  will be recorded, including age, gender, performance status, history of 
medical comorbidities or autoimmune disorders, diagnosis date, prior cancer -directed 
treatments . Tumor characteristics will be recorded, including histology, anatomic l ocation of the 
original primary tumor and the anatomic location of treatment site(s), target lesion size, target 
lesion extent of bone circumferential involvement (if available ), metastasis type (i .e., lytic, 
blastic , mixed ). Subject evaluation data will b e recorded: review of pain medication s (including 
steroid medication s), performance status, photographs of skin and any physical findings on 
examination involving the skin or other normal tissue in the planned treatment site(s) . 
 
Subjects may continue to t ake steroids during their participation in the clinical trial if prescribed 
by their physician .  Steroid medication  is optional and at the discretion of the prescribing 
physician.  
 
2.8.2 CT-based Simulation  
Simulation imaging is performed as part of  standard of care  in order to develop the radiation 
treatment plan . During the simulation procedure, the subject  is placed on the CT simulator 
couch  in a stable and reproducible  position suitable for targeting the metastatic lesion(s). 
Immobilization  devic es such as a Vac-Lok bag will be used for all subjects  to aid in immobilizing 
the target site(s) and for reproducing the subject’s  positioning at the time of treatment. A CT 
scan will be obtained through the areas of interest  and used for radiotherapy plan ning.   
 
Adequate radiotherapy coverage of the target lesion (s) will be assessed using th is CT during the 
treatment plan selection process (see section 2.8.3 ). This a ssessment will be carried out for  each 
of the planned FLASH treatment sites  (up to 3 FLASH treatment sites for each subject ). Subjects  
who cannot be treated using the available pre-defined treatment field sizes (see inclusion 
criteria) will be removed from the study  and replaced . 
 
Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test at the time of CT simulation. If 
the pregnancy test is positive, the subject will be removed from the study and replaced.  It is 
standard of care  at the investigational site to evaluate pregnancy status for women of 
childbearing age  at the time of CT simulation .  
2.8.3 Treatment Plan  Selection  
The simulation  CT images will be electronically transferred to the Eclipse treatment planni ng 
workstation (Varian, Palo Alto, CA ; Eclipse is used without modification to the present 510(k) 
clearance ) and the target site(s) will be delineated by one of the radiation oncologist 
investigators.  A single -field 250 MeV transmission plan will be chose n from a pre -defined  library 
of plans having different field sizes  (see section 2.7). Based on a review of bone metastases 
cases treated at the investigational site over a 12 -month period, these field sizes will be 
adequate to treat sufficient patients successfully. Plans will be matched  for each of the FLASH 
treatment sites ( up to 3  FLASH  treatment sites for each subject ). Using image guidance, clinical 
lesions up to 6.5 cm in diameter  will be treated .  A Planning  Tumor Volume ( PTV) margin of 5 
mm will be added to the Gross Tumor Volume/Clinical Target Volume ( GTV/CTV ).  There will be 
no G TV to CTV margin.  This is consistent with standard clinical practice in the palliative

 Page 17 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  treatment of bone metastases.  Patients who cannot be treated using the pre -defined treatment 
field sizes will be removed from the study and replaced.  
 
The pre -defined  plans are designed to deliver a prescription of 8 Gy in a single fraction at 40 
Gy/s  to the PTV . Since the treatment will be delivered with transmission FLASH, there will be no 
Bragg Peak within the body; t he relative biological effectiveness (RBE ) of 1. 0 will, therefore , 
apply since no correction is required for Bragg Peak . The volume of PTV receiving 90%  of the 
prescribed dose shall be greater than or equal to  90% , and the dose to 10%  of the PTV will not 
exceed 110% . The prescribed dose of 8 Gy in a single fraction  is a standard fractionation for 
painful bone met astases whose efficacy has been validated in prior multi -institutional 
prospective randomized clinical trial s [10, 11] .  
 
2.8.4 QA 
There are two forms of QA routinely performed for treatment with standard dose rate proton 
radiation. The first is daily machine QA and the second is patient specific QA. Patient specific QA 
for subjects treated on this FLASH study protocol may be performe d, for example, using film  and 
ion chamber  dosimetry . An additional  QA procedure will be performed  on the day of treatment 
prior to the subject ’s treatment confirming the FLASH dose and dose rate constancy  of the 
proton delivery  system .  
 
2.8.5 FLASH Radiotherap y Delivery (Day 1) 
The treatment plan will be  transferred from the ARIA Oncology Information System (Varian, Palo 
Alto, CA; ARIA  is used without modification to the present 510(k) clearance) to the FLASH 
enabled ProBeam Proton Therapy System console  for FLASH radiotherapy  delivery . Subjects  will 
be positioned on the treatment couch as determined at the time of their simulation visit.  Image 
guidance  will be used  to verify that the target is in the co rrect position for treatment . The 
treatment will be carried out for up to 3 treatment sites for each subject , depending on the total 
number of painful bone metastases in limb bones (excluding feet, hands, wrists ) to be treated . 
 
On the day of treatment, but before start of treatment, the following baseline data will be 
recorded: patient reported pain score overall and specifically at each treated site  (see section 
2.8.6  for questionnaires to be used) ; subject evaluation (use of pain medication  (including 
steroid medications) , performance status, photographs of s kin and any physical findings on 
examination involving the skin or other normal tissue in the treatment site(s)).  
 
2.8.6 Pain Assessment Questionnaires  
There are several questionnaires used in this study as described below:  
 
Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form  questionnaire :  
Patient reported pain score (overall) at baseline and post -treatment (Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, 
Month 3 , long -term ) will be assessed using the BPI short form  questionnaire  (see section 2.2.2  
Schedule of Activities table) .  
 
CIP: Feasibility Study of FLASH Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Bone Metastases (VAR -2019 -02) 
 Page 18 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  The BPI short form questionnaire was employed in a prior cooperative -group (Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group) prospective, phase III, randomized study evaluati ng the efficacy of 8 Gy 
radiation for the treatment of painful bone metastases  [10]. Using the BPI short form 
questionnaire will allow comparison of the current study results to th ese historical data. This 
form assesses overall  pain response without focus on an individual metastasis.  
 
Treated Sites Pain questionnaire : 
Additionally, p atient reported pain for each treated site at ba seline  and post -treatment (Day 15, 
Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 , long -term ) will be assessed using a four  item subset of the 
questions from the BPI questionnaire  (see section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ). This form 
assesses pain response in each treate d site . 
 
Pain Flare questionnaire : 
An additional three item questionnaire is required only at baseline  and for the first 10 days after 
treatment to assess radiation treatment related flare in bone pain   for each treated site (see 
section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ). The questionnaire uses the methodology employed by 
Chow et al. [12] to specifically identify flare in bone pain. The patient reported questionnaire 
will be use d to collect the following  information: for each treated site , worst pain over the last 
24 hours  and comparison of this worst pain to the worst pain in the treated site on the day of 
treatment ; pain medications usage, includ ing steroid medications.  
 
2.8.7 Adverse Event Checks  
Adverse events will be monitored from start of treatment to completion of the final study 
follow -up visit. Adverse event checks will take place on th e day of treatment (Day 1 after 
treatment delivery) and at the follow -up visit time points Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 , 
and long -term follow -up (see section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ). The adverse event check 
on Day 2 will be carried out by remote review. All other a dverse event checks during follow -up 
may be carried out using a combination of remote visits and/or records review as an alternative 
to in -person visits to accommodate the subject’s inability or reluctance to travel . Adverse event 
checks will be recorded on the corresponding case report form.  All adverse events will be 
collected regardless of severity or attribution. Adverse events will be classified per CTCAE 
version 5.0. 
 
2.8.8 Follow -Up 
During the first 10 days after completion of FLASH radiotherapy, subjects will complete a 
questionnaire daily to assess radiation treatment related flare in bone pain for each treated site 
(see section 2.8.6  for questionnaires to be used ; see section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ). 
 
Subjects are expected to have in-person  follow -up visits at Day 15 (+/- 2 business days ), Month 1  
(+/- 5 business days ), Month 2  (+/- 10 business days ), and Month 3  (+/- 10 business days);  long -
term follow -up 2 months  (+/- 10 business days) beyond Month 3 , until subject death or lost to 
follow -up.  
 
For the Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3  follow -up visits , the following data will be recorded : 
CIP: Feasibility Study of FLASH Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Bone Metastases (VAR -2019 -02) 
 Page 19 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  • Patient reported pain score overall and specifically at each treated site  (see section 2.8.6  
for questionnaires to be used; see section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ) 
• Subject evaluation : use of pain medication s (including steroid medications) , 
performance status, physical evaluation including photographs of skin and any physical 
findings on examination involving the skin or other normal tissue in the treatment site(s)  
• Adverse event evaluatio n (including skin and other normal tissue toxicities)  
• It is desirable to have follow -up visits in -person.  However, it is acceptable to carry out 
remote follow -up visits as an alternative in the event of the subject’s inability or 
reluctance to travel give n the current COVID -19 pandemic. In these circumstances, 
photographs of the treatment site may be taken at home by caregivers, and physical 
evaluation will be carried out to the extent that is feasible via telehealth.  
 
Long-term follow -up visit s beyond Mon th 3 may be carried out using a combination of remote 
visits and/or records review as an alternative to in -person visits to accommodate the subject’s 
inability or reluctance to travel . The following data will be recorded:  
• Patient reported pain score overal l and specifically at each treated site  (see section 2.8.6  
for questionnaires to be used; see section 2.2.2  Schedule of Activities table ). 
Questionnaires will b e completed as subject’s clinical status permits.  
• Subject evaluation  (use of pain medication  (including steroid medications) , performance 
status , physical evaluation ) 
• Adverse event evaluation  (including skin and other normal tissue toxicities)  
 
Follow -up v isits that are in-person  (Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 ) and any in -person visits 
during long -term follow -up will take place at a location(s) listed in section  9, as determined by 
mutual convenience of the subject  and investigator.  
 
Choice of f ollow -up visit time point s was informed by the study designs of Chow et al. [12] and 
Hartsell [10]. 
 
Patients may continue to take steroids during their participation in the clinical trial if prescribed 
by their physician.  Steroid medication is optional and at the discretion of the prescribing 
physician.  
 
Subject s tudy participation will end following subject death or lost to follow -up. 
 
 
2.9 Adverse Events  
Adverse event evaluation and management will be conducted by the investigator or his /her  
designee (must be study physician, nurse, or PA/ARNP).  Radiation dermatitis within the 
irradiated field is the adverse event that would be most likely to occur.  This  adverse event  
would be managed as an outpatient treatment at the locations listed in section 9 by the 
investigator or his/her designee using an appropriate combination of topical emollients, topical 
steroids, topical antibiotics, and dressings as determined to be  necessary by the investigator or 
designee.  Other adverse events that might occur such as pathologic fracture of the treated 
bone would be referred to the appropriate specialist for management (note that pathologic 
fracture of a bony metastasis is a known  complication of the disease process ).

 Page 20 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential   
The CTCAE version 5.0 defines an adverse event (AE) as follows: “Any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered 
related to the medical treatment or pr ocedure. An AE is a term that is a unique representation 
of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analyses.”  
 
AEs will be given an attribution by the investigator as follows:  
• Definitely  related to the FLASH radiotherapy  delivery  
o AE has timely relationships to the investigational device administration and 
there is no known alternative etiology responsible for the AE . 
• Probably  related to the FLASH radiotherapy  delivery  
o AE has a timely relationship to the investigational device admini stration. 
No potential alternative etiology is apparent.  
• Possibly  related to the FLASH radiotherapy  delivery  
o AE has a timely relationship to the investigational device administration; 
however, a potential alternative etiology may be responsible for the AE. 
• Unlikely ( Probably not ) related to the FLASH radiotherapy  delivery  
o There is no definitive evidence that the AE has a relationship to the 
investigational device. It was either present before the study, a 
symptom(s) of primary disease, or due to use of c oncomitant 
medications . 
• Definitely not  related to the FLASH radiotherapy  delivery  
o There is clearly no evidence that the AE has a relationship to the 
investigational device.  
 
The investigator will document  whether the AE is attributable to the FLASH radioth erapy  
delivery.  
 
Grades will be assigned  to clinical AEs  by the investigator or his /her  designee per the CTCAE 
version 5.0, which consists of a scale from 1 to 5 to describe the severity of the AE. A copy of the 
CTCAE version 5.0 will be provided.  For refe rence, an overview  of the grades is given below , but 
the CTCAE v5 needs to be consulted for specific grading criteria : 
 
• Grade 1 – Mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
 
• Grade 2 – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  (ADL) . Instrumental ADL refer 
to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
 
• Grade 3 – Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL.  Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using 
the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
 
CIP: Feasibility Study of FLASH Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Bone Metastases (VAR -2019 -02) 
 Page 21 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  • Grade 4 – Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 
• Grade 5 – Death related to AE.  
 
 
There are a nticipated adverse events associated with the delivery of 8 Gy radi ation in a single 
fraction at standard dose rate for the treatment of bone metastases. The frequency and severity 
of these toxicities were evaluated at standard dose rates in a prior benchmark multi -institutional 
prospective randomized clinical trial [10] . In this trial, a cohort of 455 patients  (433  and 354  
patients analyzed  for acute and late toxicities, respectively ) were treated with 8 Gy for palliation 
of painful bone metastases . Grade 2 -3 acute toxicity (within 90 days after starting radiation 
therapy ) occurred in 10% of the patient s, and “late toxicity was rare (4%) ”. The most common 
toxicity  was gastrointestinal , which accounted for approximately half of all acute adverse events . 
Gastrointestinal toxicity  should not be relevant to th e present feasibility  study as treatment is 
limited to the extremities . No patients in the  cited study receiving 8 Gy had Grade 4 acute or 
late toxicities.  
 
It is expected that the majority of toxicities in the present clinical study will be related to the 
skin. In  the prior cited  study , there were  no acute or late grade 3  or grade 4  skin toxicit ies in 
patients treated with 8 Gy  at standard dose rates . Of the 433 patients, acute grade 1/ grade 2  / 
grade 3 / grade 4 skin toxicities occurred in 15 / 1 / 0 / 0 patients , respectively. Acute g rade 1 / 
grade 2 / grade 3 / grade 4 hematologic toxicities occurred in 1 0 / 7 / 2 / 0 patients, respectively. 
“Other” (not specified) acute grade 1 / grade 2 / grade 3 / grade 4 toxicities occurred in 11 / 6 / 
6 / 0 patients, respec tively.  These toxicities were scored using the (RTOG) Acute and Late 
Morbidity Criteria . This grading system has since been supplanted by the CTCAE system. For the 
great majority of toxicities  (skin)  expected in the present clinical  study, the RTOG skin and CTCAE 
radiation dermatitis scoring systems are very similar. In addition, the hematologic scoring 
criteria for both RTOG and CTCAE are very similar or can be readily numerically converted  for 
comparison purposes .  
 
 
Serious  Adverse Events  
 
Per ISO 14155 :2011 , the following definitions apply:  
• A Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended

medical device*  that:  
o Led to a death , 
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject , that either resulted 
in 
▪ a life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
▪ a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  or 
▪ in-patient or prolong ed hospitalization **, or 
▪ medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function

• If the subject  meets an exc lusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
 
 
2.13 Planned Analyses , Sample Size, and Stopping Rule s 
The Sponsor will conduct the following analyses corresponding to the study objectives and 
prepare a clinical study report.  Where appropriate, descriptive statistics will be used.  
 
Primary Objective:  
1.  Workflow feasibility:    
For each subject, workflow feasibility will be judged as successful or not based on the 
following criteria:  
 
Treatment  for an individual subject  will be deemed NOT feasible  if:  
• Total treatment time on table is greater than one hour  OR  
• A delay in study treatment of more than 7 business days from simulation to 
treatment  occurs related to the investigational device  (excluding delays due to 
patient or facility factors not related to the study treatment ) 
 
2.  Toxicities of treatment:    
All toxicities will be tabulated and summarized. Toxicities that are possibly, probably, or 
definitely related to FLASH radiotherapy  will be used for the assessment of toxicity of 
the FLASH treatment.  
 
Note:  A dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a Grade 3 toxicity attributed as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to FLASH radiotherapy . The number of DLTs will 
be monitored through the duration  of the study  and will be used as a criterion  in the 
Stopping Rules (see section 2.13  for a Stopping Rule related to DLT.)  
 
Secondary Objective:  
3.  Pain relief :   
As discussed above in section  2.8.6  patient  reported pain score (overall) at baseline and 
post -treatment (Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, long -term ) will be assessed using 
the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) short form  questionnaire . Patient reported pain score for 
each treated site will be assessed using the Treated Sites Pain questionnaire . 
 
The BPI short form questionnaire was selected to permit the results of this study to be 
compared with prior published results us ing this instrument  [10].  
 
Per the methodology of  Hartsell, et  al. [10]: The worst pain score in the BPI short form 
will be used  to assess  treatment response ; a complete response will be defined  as 
having no pain at 3 months after radiation therapy ; a partial response will be defined as 
a pain score that is at least two points lower than the initial response ; a stable response 
CIP: Feasibility Study of FLASH Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Bone Metastases (VAR -2019 -02) 
 Page 25 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  will be defined as a one -point chang e in pain score in either direction ; a progressive 
response will be defined as a pain score that is at least two points higher than the initial 
score. The same analysis will be applied to the individual sites treated by FLASH, as 
assessed by the questionna ire with the four -item  subset of the BPI questionnaire.  
 
Per the methodology of Chow et al., flare in bone pain due to radiation will be assessed 
using the Pain Flare  questionnaire administered on Day 1 - Day 1 1. Pain flare is defined 
as either of the following: a minimum of a two -point increase in the worst pain score for 
the treated site without a reduction in analgesic intake; or a 25% or greater increase in 
analgesic intake based on daily oral morphine equivalence without a  reduction in the 
worst pain score. If the worst pain score before treatment was nine or ten, the criteria 
for pain flare were met if the follow -up worst pain score was ten and reported as worse 
than the worst pain before treatment with no decrease in anal gesic intake. To 
distinguish pain flare from progression of pain, the worst pain score and analgesic intake 
had to return to baseline levels during the 11 -day (Day 1 - Day 1 1) time  period.  
Consistent with the Chow study, we will document use of steroid med ication.   
 
Data on use of pain medication will be collected and changes in pain medication  use will 
be evaluated between baseline , during each of the first 10 days after treatment,  and 
follow -up visits  (Day 15, Month 1, Month 2, Month 3 ). The percentage o f patients 
requiring narcotic, non -narcotic analgesics, and no pain medications will be assessed 
and compared to literature values from prior clinical trials.  
 
 
Sample Size : 
For this feasibility study, a  sample size of up to 10 patients will apply .  
 
Stopping Rules : 
Triggering of a stopping rule will result in a cessation of enrollment and in a review of  the study 
data  by the Cincinnati Cancer and Blood Disease Institute Data Safety Monitoring Board and 
Study Committee (PI and co -investigators) . 
 
The study will be stopped if any of the following occurs:  
• 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) (see section 2.13  for definition of 
DLT)  
• 3 subjects have  time on  the treatment table >1 hour  
• 3 subjects have  a delay in study treatment of more than 7 business days from simulation 
to treatment related to the investigational device (excluding delays due to patient or 
facility factors not related to the study treatment.)  
• A major device malfunction in dose delivery (as indicated by the dose monitoring 
system) . This includes potential recordable or reportable medical events under the Ohio 
Department of Health  classification.

3 Risk Analysis  
The clinical risk analysis is presented in this section.  The justification for the investigation and a 
description of the study  population are provided.  
 
 
3.1 Risks and Mitigations  
A risk with any modality of radiation therapy, including FLASH radiotherapy , is harm to normal 
tissues that are included within the treatment volume. In the case of FLASH radiotherapy, the 
side effects are expected to have the same spectrum of sympt oms or physical  findings that can 
result from conventional photon radiotherapy at conventional dose rates. Preclinical data 
suggests  that FLASH radiotherapy may  result in less toxicity  to normal tissues . 
 
Potential risks/toxicities  in this clinical study : 
• Skin 
o Red skin  
o Weeping  of skin  
o Ulceration  of skin  
o Necrosis  
o Fibrosis  
o Hyper - or hypopigmentation  
o Hair loss in the treated area  
• Swelling in the extremities (lymphedema)  
• Potential damage to other normal tissues in the radiation field, including to muscle, 
nerve, and/or bone  
• Insufficient pain relief  
• Fracture at the metastasis site  
• Decre ased blood cell count  
• Radiation related secondary  malignancy  
 
Patients who are pregnant or nursing are excluded from the study because radiation treatment 
can pose risk to an unborn or nursing child.  
 
The machine and patient specific QA processes outlined in section  2.8.4  are in place to verify 
that the correct dose is delivered as prescribed.  
 
In the event of an interrupted FLASH treatment ( as sometimes can occur with standard dose 
rate radiation treatment delivery) , treatment may be resumed and the system will correctly 
execute the remainder of the plan such that the full absorbed dose of 8 Gy will be delivered t o 
the target volume .  If a spot is partially delivered, the system automatically recalculates the 
maximum allowed beam current to complete the remaining monitor units for that spot.   This 
may reduce the dose rate for the remainder of the field.   The potent ial normal tissue sparing 
benefit of the FLASH dose rate may be less. However, treatment can be completed likely

 Page 28 of 32 Version 08 29APR2021  
Varian Confidential  without any reduced effect in treating the tumor. Based on reliability testing , treatment 
interruption is unlikely to occur.  
 
3.2 Justification for  the Investigation  
This study is designed to assess the workflow feasibility of delivering FLASH radiotherapy in a 
clinical setting , toxicities of treatment, and pain relief at the treated sites.  It is expected that the 
subjects with painful bone metastas is(-es) treated on this study protocol will receive the same 
benefits in terms of pain control as if treated with conventional dose rate photon radiotherapy . 
Normal tissue toxicity is expected to be no more than and potentially less than from treatment 
with conventional dose rate photon radiotherapy . The clinical implementation data acquired in 
this investigation will contribute to optimizing FLASH enabled ProBeam Proton Therapy System  
workflows and  making this technology routinely available to  radiation oncologists and their 
patients.  
 
3.3 Study Population  
The study population will consist of up to 10 patients  with painful bone metastas is(-es) in the 
extremities who will be treated using FLASH radiotherapy  to 1-3 sites . Patients  at least 18 years 
of age  will be considered regardless of race or gender .  
 
 
4 Description  of Device  
The ProBeam Proton Therapy System is an FDA Class II and an EU MDR Class IIb medical device 
that incorporates a superconducting cyclotron that produces 250 MeV protons. A degrader 
followed by an energy selector is used to vary the proton beam energy. The adjusted energy, 
current, and size of the proton beam is sequentially channeled to a treatment room using a 
beamline. A treatment room is equipped with a robot -mounted tr eatment table and, in many 
installations, a gantry to allow the proton beam to be applied to a patient from all directions.  
 
The FLASH enabled version of the ProBeam Proton Therapy System is being developed under 
the regulations pertaining to 21CFR 820 . This FLASH enabled device is a modified and tested 
ProBeam Proton Therapy System with the ability to deliver pre -defined  high dose rate plans of 
fixed field sizes and total dose, using a specific treatment workflow. These pre-defined  plans will 
be delivered with a minimum dose rate to the target volume  of 40 Gy/s and a maximum 
fluctuation of 10% around the mean.  
 
No changes are anticipated to the device during the clinical investigation.  
 
 
5 Monitoring Procedures  
The study will be monit ored according to US FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices.

Hypotheses:   A formal hypothesis will not be tested in this study .  The percentage of time with a 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L in the first 6 months of the study will be estimated.   
Primary Endpoint:   
• The percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L starting from week 2 in the 
first 6 months of the treatment period without  rescue medication use in the past 4 weeks   
Secondary Endpoints :   
• The percentage of time with a platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L starting from week 2 until the 
end of the treatment period without rescue medi cation  use in the past 4 weeks  
• The percentage of time with an increase in platelet  count ≥ 20 x 109/L above baseline 
starting from week 2 until the end of the treatment period without rescue medication use 
within the past 4 weeks . 
• Subject incidence of rescue ITP medications used  
• The incidence of anti- romiplostim  neutralizing antibodies  and cross -reactive antibodies to 
thrombopoietin ( TPO) at any time during the study 
• The incidence of adverse events, including clinically significant changes in laboratory 
values

 • The subject incidence of romiplost im self -administration  
Study Design:   
This is a phase 3b single arm, open label, multicenter study describing the percentage of time 
pediatric subjects with ITP have a platelet  response w hile receiving romiplostim, defined as a 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and in the absence of ITP rescue medications  in the past 4 weeks .  
This protocol will provide open label romiplostim to thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects with ITP 
diagnosed for at least 6 months  and who have received at least 1 prior ITP therapy (exclud ing 
romiplostim) or are ineligible for ITP  therapies .  
The study design consists of a 4 -week screening period,  up to  a 3-year treatment period, an end 
of treatment (EOT) visit , and an end of study (EOS) visit.  
Sample Size:   Approximately 200 subjects  
Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria:  
Eligible pediatric subjects diagnosed with ITP according to the American Society of Hematology  
(ASH)  guidelines  (Neunert et al, 2011) must have thrombocytopenia ( defined as a platelet count 
≤ 30 x 109/L) or have bleeding that is uncontr olled with conventional therapy  within 4 weeks of 
enrollment .   
For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1 and Section 4.2. 
Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:   
Investigational product will be administered as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of 
romiplostim will be 1 µg/kg based on the subject’s recorded screening weight  in the clinic by a 
qualified healthcare provider .  Throughout the treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic 
for platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.  
Weekly dose increases will be made in increments of 1 µg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 
10 µg/kg, in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 109/L.  Dose adjustments will be 
allowed to maintain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L.  Subjects who 
receive their first 8 doses in clinic and achieve a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without romiplostim 
dose adjustments for 4 consecutive weeks will be eligible to self -administer romiplostim or have 
the injection administered by a caregiver.   
For detailed instructions regarding investigational product presentation, dose, administration, and 
dose adjustments, please see Section 6. 
Control Group:  The study design does not include a control arm . 
Procedures:    
At specified time points , subjects will undergo the following assessments:  informed consent  (and 
assent, if applicable), confirmation of  ITP diagnosis, ITP and medical history, physical exam 
including weight and vital signs.  Subjects will have complete blood counts  with differentials , 
blood chemistry profiles, local platelet counts , and a blood or urine pregnancy test for female s of 
child-bearing potential.  Research staff will document the use of concomitant and rescue 
medications and all adverse events reported for the subject.  Subjects will also provide blood 
samples for anti -TPO/romiplostim antibodies and peripheral blood smears.   
For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7 and Table 2. 
Statistical Considerations:   
The primary analys is will be descriptive.  No formal hypothesis will be tested.  Summary statistics 
will be provided for the primary and secondary endpoints.  Categorical data will be presented in 
the form of number and percentage.  Continuous data will be provided with the de scriptive 
statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, Q1 [25th percentile], Q3 [75th percentile], 
minimum, and maximum).  The analysis of efficacy and safety endpoints will be based on the set 
of subjects receiving at least one dose of romiplostim.  Product:

The primary objective is to describe the percentage of time that pediatric subjects with 
immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP) have a platelet response in the first 6 months from the 
start of treatment with romiplostim. 
1.2 Secondary  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To describe the percentage of time that pediatric subjects with ITP have a plat elet 
response over the study duration  
• To describe the  percentage of time that pediatric subjects with ITP have an increase 
in platelet count ≥ 20 x 109/L above baseline over the study duration  
• To describe the use of rescue ITP medications  
• To describe  the incidence of antibody formation 
• To describe the safety of romiplostim as a long -term treatment in pediatric 
thrombocytopenic subject s with ITP 
1.3 Exploratory  
• To describe the incidence of sustained platelet responses  
• To describe the incidence of splenectomy   
• To describe the subject incidence of romiplostim self -administration  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Immune thrombocytopenia is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low circulating platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and decreased platelet production.  Historically, the 
low circulating platelet counts were attributed to antibodies binding to platelet antigens, 
resulting in destruction of platelets in the reticuloendothelial system , primarily the spleen 
(Bottiger and Westerholm, 1972; McMillan, 1981; Kelton  and Gibbons, 1982; 
George  et al, 1995).   However, a recent international consensus report suggests that a 
more complex disease process is present in which impair ed platelet production may play 
an important role in the disease ( Provan et al, 2010) .  Thrombocytopenia, as a result of 
ITP, places patients at risks for bruising, mucocutaneous bleeding, and, more seriously , 
intracranial hemorrhage.   
The annual incidence of ITP among children in the United States and Europe is estimated between 19 and 64 cases/million population, with a peak incidence between Product:

 ages  2 and 10 and affecting boys and girls equally ( Terrell et al, 2010; Glanz  et al, 2008; 
Tarantino,  2006; Zeller et al, 2000; Lilleyman, 1999).  
Treatment guidelines for ITP have been published by the American Society of 
Hematology (ASH) ITP study group, ( Neunert et al, 2011), the British Committee for 
Standards in Hematology and General Hematology Task Force ( BCSH, 2003 ) and an 
International ITP consensus group ( Provan et al, 2010).   Guidelines from these groups 
review and provide recommendations on the diagnosis, management and treatment 
options for ITP s ubjects.  
Unlike adult ITP in which the majority of cases are chronic in duration, pediatric ITP most 
commonly occurs in the acute form (platelet count < 150 x 109/L for < 6 months from 
diagnosis), accounting for 70 % to 80% of ITP cases in children ( Glanz et al, 2008 ).  
Many children with acute ITP require no treatment, and in approximately 60% to 75% of 
cases, the thrombocytopenia resolves within 2 to 4 months regardless of therapy 
(Nugent,  2006).  In pediatric ITP cases, 20% to 30%  are considered chronic ( platelet 
count <  150 x 109/L for > 6 months from diagnosis ) and may become refractory to 
standard treatments ( Glanz et al, 2008).  Chronic ITP in childhood has an estimated 
incidence of 0.46 per 100,000 children per year ( Lilleyman, 1999;  Zeller et al, 2000).  
Predictors for chronic ITP in children include older age (> 10 years) and an insidious 
presentation ( Robb and Tiedeman, 1990 ).  In addition, chronic ITP in children is 
associated with higher presenting platelet count (> 20 x 109/L), lack of mucosal bleeding 
at presentation, and lack of a previous acute illness ( Glanz et al, 2008 ). 
The traditional classification of chronic and acute ITP in the literature is based solely 
on persistence of thrombocytopenia from time of diagnosis, whereas previously 
mentioned, acute ITP is <  6 months and chronic ITP is > 6 months ( Kuhne, 2003 ).  
However, this definition is commonly considered arbitrary ( Bolton- Maggs, 2007; 
Buchanan and Adix,  2006; Glanz  et al, 2008 ; Kuhne, 2006 ).  As a result, an international 
working group of ITP experts recently convened and re -defined the classification.  The 
working group now defines “newly diagnosed ITP” as 0 to 3 months from diagnosis, “persistent ITP” as  lasting between 3 and 12 months from diagnosis, and “chronic ITP” 
as a disease duration ≥ 12 months.   This classification includes patients not reaching 
spontaneous remission or not maintaining complete response off therapy (Rodeghiero  et al, 2009 ).  Based on these recent definitions, important determinants of 
disease severity and need for treatment include time since diagnosis, failure of prior ITP therapy, and bleeding symptoms. Product:

 2.2 Treatments for ITP in Pediatric Patients   
The treatment of ITP in pediatric patients is warranted to prevent clinically significant 
bleeding events, especially intracerebral hemorrhage.  Although fatal bleeding events 
among children with ITP are rare and the overall incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage is between 0.2% and 1% ( Cines  and Blanchette, 2002), one review of 332 medical 
records revealed that 17% of children had major hemorrhage defined as intracranial bleeding, epistaxis requiring cautery or nasal packing, gross hematuria, or other bleeding causing a decline in hemoglobin concentration.  Approximately 75% of bleeding episodes in this review occurred in children with platelet counts < 10 x  10
9 /L 
(Tarantino,  2006 ). 
The principal aim of treating children with chronic ITP is to maintain a hemostatically 
safe platelet count and improve quality of life, instead of trying to achieve a cure 
(Kalpatthi and Bussel , 2008).  Clinical management of chronic ITP  in children varies and 
does not always adhere to recommendations set forth by the ASH and the B CSH and 
General Hematology Task Force  (Neunert  et al, 2011; BCSH, 2003 ).  The ASH 
guidelines incorporate both clinical  and platelet count data to arrive at specific treatment 
recommendations; drug therapy with either intravenous immuno globulin (IVI G) or 
corticosteroids is recommended for children with a platelet count (<  20 x 109/L) and  
minor purpura , and for children with severe life-threatening  bleeding 
(George  et al, 1996 ).  The BCSH gu idelines suggest that pronounced skin purpura and 
bruising may not reflect a serious risk of bleeding and recommend that only patients who experience significant mucous membrane bleeding receive treatment (Tarantino  and Bolton -Maggs, 2007 ; Tarantino, 2006).  Furthermore, the BCSH 
recommends that IVIG be used only for emergency treatment or for those who do not respond to corticosteroids.   
In 2010,  an international consensus report was publ ished to address  the investigation, 
diagnosis , and management of childhood ITP ( Provan et al, 2010 ).  The consensus 
report guidance for the diagnosis and management of ITP remains largely unchanged from the previously published BCSH and ASH guidance.  Cent ral to the committee’s 
recommendations is the adoption of an ITP classification by duration, which is separated 
into 3 distinct periods : newly diagnosed ITP (0 to 3 months from diagnosis), persistent 
ITP (3 to 12 months from diagnosis), and chronic ITP ( 12 months or more from 
diagnosis).  Once an ITP  diagnosis and classification are confirmed, individual subject 
disease characteristics (eg, bleeding symptoms, platelet counts), psychosocial issues , Product:

 level of activity, and lifestyles should be considered when selecting the appropriate 
management  and treatment of the disease.  
Regardless of which guidelines are being followed, medical management is generally  
preferred over splenectomy for children who have ITP between 6 and 12 months.  
Traditional pre- splenectomy  treatment options include oral corticosteroids (including 
pulse oral dexametha sone), IVIG, and for chi ldren who are Rhesus -positive, intravenous 
(IV) anti-D (Blanchette and Price, 2003).  Less commonly, immunosuppressive 
strategies have been used to treat  chronic ITP  which include cyclophosphamide, 
azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and autologous stem cell 
transplantation ( Buchanan and Adix, 2006).  While each of these therapies has been 
shown to result in increased platelet counts, the potential toxicity of these approaches 
compels physicians to weigh the likelihood of clinical efficacy against the likelihood of the occurrence of clinically relevant adverse events ( Tarantino, 2006).  
Recently rituximab has also been used to treat pediatric ITP.  A prospective study of the 
use of rituximab among children with chronic refractory ITP demonstrated a 31% response rate with response defined as maintenance of a platelet count >  50 x 10
9/L for 
4 consecutive weeks ( Bennett et al, 2006 ).  However, rituximab carries a significant  
warning regarding infusion reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, severe mucocutaneous reactions, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(Rituxan
® [rituximab]  Prescribing Information, 2012 ).  Long- term suppression of B cells 
by rituximab is generally not associated with decreased immunoglobulin levels (except possibly in very  young children) or serious infections ( Parodi et al, 2006) .  Although the 
need for prophylactic IVIG has not been demonstrated, patients must be closely 
monitored.  H epatitis B virus reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and 
death can occur in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab 
(Kalpatthi  and Bussel, 2008;  Rituxan
® [rituximab]  Prescribing Information, 2012).  
Splenectomy is considered only for those children who have severe ITP.  The fact that 
36% of chronic pediatric ITP patients are reported to experience spontaneous remission (Reid, 1995 ) suggests that there could be a role for therapeutic agents that have the 
ability to delay splenectomy.  Splenectomy is recommended in both ASH and BCSH guidelines for children with ITP lasting > 1 year with both low platelet count and bleeding  symptoms, although the BCSH guidelines stress that splenectomy is warranted 
only with  demonstrable impairment on quality of life ( Kalphatthi and Bussel, 2008;  
Tarantino and Bolton- Maggs, 2007 ).  In the recently published international consensus Product:

 report, splenectomy is also cited as a surgical treatment option, but is generally deferred 
for as long as possible (Provan et al, 2010).  
Splenectomy is successful in resolution of life threatening thrombocytopenia in 
75% to 85% of pediatric patients but is associated with an increased risk of sepsis 
(Nugent , 2006).   A recent survey revealed that only approximately one- third of 
respondents would recommend splenectomy as first -line therapy for a child with severe 
chronic refractory ITP, a decision influenced mostly by factors affecting long -term 
outcome, such as risk of sepsis, thromboembolic events,  possible relapse, likelihood of 
spontaneous remission without splenectomy , and the irreversible nature of splenectomy 
(Neunert et al, 2008).  Moreover, s plenectomy  may not be warranted in younger patients 
who are at relatively  high risk for infection with encapsulated organisms 
(Kuhne et al, 2007;  Bennett et al, 2006 ).  
2.3 Romiplostim B ackground  
Romiplostim is a recombinant non- glycosylated 59 kDa thrombopoietic protein produced 
in Esch erichia  coli.  It is a fusion protein (peptibody), composed of a human 
immunoglobulin IgG1 Fc domain with each single chain subunit covalently linked at the 
C-terminus to a peptide chain containing 2 thrombopoietin (TPO)  receptor binding 
domains.  Romiplostim stimulates platelet production by a mechanism similar to that of 
endog enous thrombopoietin (eTPO); however, there is no amino acid sequence 
homology between romiplostim and eTPO.  The lack of sequence homology with eTPO 
reduces the probability that if antibodies to romiplostim are produced they will cross react with eTPO and  cause thrombocytopenia.  
Romiplostim is approved for use in the adult chronic ITP setting in various regions of the world under the trade name of Nplate
® (romiplostim) ; the specific clinical indication 
varies by region.   The most common side effects reported include headache, aching 
joints, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, pain in extremities and abdominal pain.

2.4 Pediatric Clinical Data  
Proof of concept for the treatment of ITP in the pediatric population has been established in Study 20060195.  Protocol 20060195 was a Phase  2 randomized, double- blind, 
placebo- controlled, 12- week study designed to assess the safety, t olerability , and Product:

 efficacy of romiplostim for the treatment of pediatric thrombocytopenic subjects with ITP.   
A total of 22 subjects (17 romiplostim ; 5 placebo) between 12 months and 17 years of 
age were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive romiplostim or v olume-m atched placebo at 
a starting dose of 1 µg /kg administered weekly by subcutaneous injection .  Subjects 
returned to the clinic weekly for platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the 
supervision of the treating physician.  
All 22 subjects received blinded investigational product (IP) and were evaluated for 
efficacy.  Of the 17 subjects who received romiplostim, 15  (88%) achieved a platelet 
response ≥ 50 x 109/L for 2 consecutive weeks during the 12- week treatment period 
(after excluding  platelet counts within 4 weeks after rescue medication  use).  The same 
15 subjects also achieved an increase in platelet count ≥ 20 x 109/L above baseline for 
2 consecutive weeks (after excluding platelet counts within 4 weeks of rescue 
medication use).  None of the placebo- treated subjects achieved either endpoint.  
With regards to rescue medication use, 2 of 17 subjects (11.8%) in the romiplostim 
group, and 2 of the 5 subjects (40.0%) in the placebo group received rescue medication 
support during the treatment period. 
During the treatment period, adverse events were reported for the majority of subjects in 
each treatment group (16 of 17 subjects [94.1%] in the romiplostim group and 4 of 5 subjects [80%] in the placebo group) , with most adverse events reported as mild 
to moderate in severity.   The most frequently reported adverse events (subject incidence 
> 25% in either treatment group) were (romiplostim, placebo) headache (6  subjects, 
35.3%; 2 subjects, 40.0%), epistaxis (6 subjects, 35.3%; 1 subject, 20.0%), cough (2 subjects, 11.8%; 2 subjects, 40.0%) , vomiting (2 subjects, 11.8%; 2 subjects , 40.0%), 
and nasal congestion (0 subjects , 0.0%; 2 subjects , 40.0%) . 
Bleeding  was the only event of interest observed on study.  When adjusted for exposure 
duration, the rate of bleeding was 7.3 events per 100 subjects -weeks in the romiplostim 
arm and 11.9 events per 100 subject- weeks in the placebo arm.  Bleeding events were 
mostl y mild and occurred early in the treatment period when platelet counts were 
< 50 x 10
9/L.  No bleeding adverse events were considered to be serious or treatment 
related.  Product:

 2.5 Bone Marrow Reticulin Evaluation i n ITP 
Reticulin is a normal component of the bone marrow that can be detected with reticulin 
(silver) stain ( Thiele et al, 2005 ; Kuter et al, 2007 ).  Increased reticulin (reticulin fibrosis) 
is associated with many benign conditions, while increased collagen fibrosis (detected 
by trichrome staining) is characteristic of myeloproliferative disease ( Kuter et al, 2007 ). 
In a retrospective analysis of bone marrow  biopsies  from 40 patients with ITP, reticulin 
was present in approximately two- thirds of romiplostim -naïve patients ( Mufti et al, 2006 ). 
Increased reticulin above normal levels may be observed with or without concomitantly increased collagen in several conditions. Increased reticulin without collagen fibrosis is associated with conditions such as hairy cell leukemia, human immunodeficiency virus  
infectio n, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and treatment with hematopoietic growth 
factors ( Kuter et al, 2007 ). 
Increased reticulin has been observed following treatment with recombinant human thrombopoietin (rHuTPO), interleukin -3, and interleukin- 11 (Kuter, 2007 ; 
Kuter  et al, 2007 ), and is likely a response to stimulation of megakaryocytes by 
thrombopoietin (TPO) ( Douglas et al, 2002 ), or related to cytokines or other factors that 
are elaborated by the megakaryocytes ( Castro -Malaspina et al, 1981;  
Yanagida et al, 1997;  Schmitt et al, 2000).  Bone marrow reticulin (or the presence of 
reticulin on study) was observed in 3.7% (10 of 271) of subjects evaluated who had 
received romiplostim for ITP  [data on file].  Increased reticulin formation may be due to 
the increased number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow as a result of romiplostim treatment, consistent with findings associated with other thrombopoietins (Kuter, 2007).  
Recent evidence has shown that the amount of bone marrow reticulin detected by silver staini ng often exhibits no correlation to disease severity, while the presence of type 1 
collagen, as detected by trichrome staining, is often associated with more severe disease, a poorer prognosis ( Kuter et al, 2007 ), and may be associated with malignant 
condi tions such as chronic  idiopathic myelofibrosis  (Tefferi, 2005 ). 
To prospectively evaluate the incidence of both reticulin and collagen formation in the 
bone marrow during  treatment with romiplostim, a trial in adults with ITP receiving open 
label romiplostim for up to 3 years is in progress  (Amgen study 20080009) .  Three 
cohorts of subjects will undergo repeat bone marrow evaluation after 1, 2, or 3 years to 
evaluate the incidence and potential sequelae of reticulin and collagen formation in the 
bone marrow .  To date, no development of collagen has been seen in cohorts 1 (1 year) 
and 2 (2 years). Increase by 2 grades in reticulin has been observed in no subjects in Product:

 cohort 1 and 2 subjects in cohort 2.  Cohort 3 evaluations are in progress.  Bone marrow 
studi es of children with ITP to evaluate reticulin and collagen formation have not 
previously been conducted. 
2.6 Anti-romiplostim Antibody Results 
To date, anti-romiplostim neutralizing antibodies have been detected in samples from 
2 adult subjects with ITP.  One of the subjects presented with anti- romiplostim 
neutralizing antibodies at the end of study (EOS) time point but tested negative for 
neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim on follow -up 4 months later (after discontinuation 
of romiplostim).  The second subj ect had neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim at an 
unscheduled time point after dosing with romiplostim but tested negative for neutralizing 
antibodies to romiplostim at 2 follow -up time points (week  132 and EOS ) after 
discontinuation of romiplostim.  No cross -reactive binding antibodies to TPO were 
observed.  
For a complete summary of all safety and efficacy data collected in both the adult and 
pediatric ITP indications for the romiplostim clinical development program, please refer to the most recent vers ion of the Romiplostim Investigator ’s Brochure.  
2.7 Pediatric Risk Assessment  
Previously reported safety results of the earlier phase 2 study (20060195 ), the currently 
enrolling phase 3 study  (20080279) , and open -label long -term follow -up study  
(20090340)  support a favorable benefit risk profile with the use of romiplostim in 
thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects .  This study represents the fourth investigation of 
romiplostim in thrombocytopenic pediatric subjects with ITP.  
2.8 Rationale  
The treatment of ITP in pediatric patients is warranted to prevent clinically significant 
bleeding events, especially intracerebral hemorrhage.  The management of children with 
ITP who either fail to respond to treatment or relapse following splenectomy is often challenging.  It is r ecognized that multiple therapeutic options are available and can be 
used as a single agent or in combination.  However, the sustained remission rate with monotherapy has proved disappointing, and controlled studies  have not been performed.  
Furthermore, small studies have demonstrated the potential for improved outcomes with combination therapy, but there is no accepted standard of care (Robb and Tiedeman, 1990) .  Appreciating the toxicities associated with many of the 
available treatments and knowing the limitations of current t herapies, including  failure 
after splenectomy, the management of pediatric ITP remains medically challenging.   Product:

 Treatment with a thrombomimetic therefore represents a unique opportunity to treat this 
challenging disease with a novel therapy.  The route of administration, schedule, starting 
dose, and subsequent dose adjustments of romiplostim have  been well established in 
previous pediatric and adult ITP studies and will be used for dosing and administration in 
this protocol.   Romiplostim will be administered initially in  the clinic by a qualified health  
care provider as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of romiplostim will be 
1 µg/kg /week  based on the subject’s recorded screening weight.  Throughout the 
treatment period, subjects will return to the clinic to provide platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.   Weekly dose increases 
will continue in increments of 1 µg/kg up to a maximum dose of 10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10
9/L.  Dose adjustments will be allowed to 
maintain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L. 
2.9 Clinical Hypotheses 
No formal hypothesis will be tested in this study .  The percentage of time with a platelet 
count ≥ 50 x 109/L in the first 6 months of the study will be estimated . 
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design 
This is a phase  3b single arm, open- label, multicenter study evaluating the percentage of 
time pediatric subjects with ITP have a response while receiving romiplostim, defined as 
a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L and in the absence of  ITP rescue medications in the past 
4 weeks .  This protocol will provide open- label romiplostim to thrombocytopenic pediatric 
subjects with ITP diagnosed for at least 6  months  and who have received at least 1 prior 
ITP therapy (excluding romiplostim) or are ineligible for other ITP therapies.  
The study design consists of a 4 -week screening period, up to a 3-year treatment period, 
an end of treatment (EOT) visit , and an end of study (EOS) visit.  
Subjects entering the study on medications to raise platelet counts may remain on these concomitant medications, as needed, along with romiplostim.  After the initiation of romiplostim, if subjects require additional medications to raise platelet counts,  or an 
increase in dose of existing medications,  rescue  ITP therapies  may be initiated (see 
Section 6.4).  If the subject’s platelet count is ≥ 50 x 10
9/L, concomitant or rescue ITP 
therapies can be reduced or disc ontinued.  Product:

 Approximately 200 subjects with ITP will be enrolled and will receive weekly romiplostim 
until they complete the study , discontinue participation in the study for any reason, or the 
study ends.  
The overall study design is described by a study sch ema at the end of the 
protocol  synopsis  section.  
The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1. 
3.1.1 S ubjects With an Onset of Sustained Platelet R esponse  
During the treatment period, romiplostim doses will be adjusted as outlined in Table 1.  
Subjects who dose reduce romiplostim such that they no longer require treatment with 
romiplostim, no longer require ITP medications  (concomitant or rescue) , and have an 
onset of a sustained platelet response (defined as a consecutive platelet count s 
≥ 50 x 109/L) will be monitored for at least 6 months beginning with the first platelet count 
≥ 50 x 109/L.  Subjects whose platelet count remains ≥ 50 x 109/L in the absence of any 
medications for ITP for at least 6 months will then be followed every 12 w eeks for the 
duration of the 36 -month treatment period.   
If during the 36 -month treatment period the platelet count subsequently falls  below 
< 50 x 109/L, treatment with romiplostim at the initial starting dose may be resumed. 
Subsequent doses will be adj usted as shown in Table 1.  Clinic visits will be resumed 
per the Schedule of A ssessment s (Table 2). 
3.1.2 Non-responding S ubjects 
Subjects who have a platelet count ≤ 20 x 109/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the 
maximum romiplostim dose of 10 µg/kg should be discontinued from romiplostim and will 
be considered non- responders.  If the subject is a non- responder but the investigator 
believ es the subject has obtained clinical benefit, the investigator must contact the 
Amgen medical monitor for  the subject to continue participation in the study.  
3.2 Number of Centers  
There will be approximately  50 centers located in (but not limited to) Australia, Canada, 
Europe, Israel, South Africa, South  America, and the United States.   
Sites that do not enroll any subjects within 6 months of site initiation may be closed. Product:

Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “s ubjects .”  It is 
anticipated that approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled into this study.  
Please refer to Section 10.2 for sample size considerations  
3.4 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who are withdrawn or removed from treatment or the study will not be replaced.  
3.5 Estimated Study Duration 
3.5.1 Study Duration for Participants  
For an individual subject, the length of participation includes a 4 -week screening period,  
up to a 36-month  treatment period, an EOT visit , and an EOS visit .  The maximum 
duration for a subject completing the study will be approximately 3 years and 2 months .  
3.5.2 End of Study  
Primary Comp letion
4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  :  the time when the last subject is assessed or receives an 
intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary analysis.  This will 
occur once the last subject participating  has completed the EOS visit.  
Before any study -specific procedure is performed, the appropriate written informed 
consent must be obtained (see Section 11.1).  In addition to written informed consent, 
the assent of the child also must be obtained if requested by the investigative site ’s 
respective institutional review board/independent ethics committee (IRB /IEC).  
Once informed consent (and assent , if applicable) has been obtained , the site will 
register the subject in the interactive voice response system (IVRS)  and enter limited 
information about screening of potential candidate (sex, age , and race), date, and 
outcome of the screening process (eg, enrolled into study, reason for ineligibility, or 
refused to participate).  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of screening).  Product:

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects may be entered into the study, Amgen requires a copy of the site’s 
written institutional review board/i ndependent ethics c ommittee ( IRB/IEC) approval of the 
protocol, informed consent form and assent form if applicable.   All subjects or legally 
acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the consent and assent form 
(if applicable) before study -specific  procedures are performed.   Adverse events are only 
reported for subjects enrolled in the study.  Subjects are considered enrolled once they have been entered through the IVRS and have received their first dose of IP. Product:

 All subjects who enter into the screening period for the study (entry is defined as the 
point at which informed consent  is signed ) will receive a unique subject identification 
number before any study procedures are performed.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the cli nical study and must be used on all study 
documentation r elated to that subject.  
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed at the time of rescreening or enrollment . 
6. TREATMENT PROCEDU RES 
6.1 Classification of Product(s) and/or Medical Device(s)  
The Amgen Investigational Product used in this study : romiplostim . 
The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, and administration of romiplostim . 
6.2 Romiplostim   
Romiplostim will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. and distributed using 
Amgen’s clinical study IP distribution procedures.  Romiplostim is supplied in a 5 mL 
single -use v ial as a sterile, white, preservative- free, lyophilized powder containing a 
protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL of 10 mM histidine, 4.0% mannitol, 2.0% sucrose, 
0.004% polysorbate 20, and a pH 5.0 when reconstituted with 1.2 mL of sterile water for injectio n. 
6.2.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule  
IP will be administered as a subcutaneous injection.  The starting dose of romiplostim 
will be 1  µg/kg based on the subject’s recorded screening weight.  Initially, IP will be 
administered in the clinic by a qualified health  care provider and subjects will return to 
the clinic weekly to provide blood samples for platelet counts and undergo any dose 
titrations under the supervision of the treating physician.   Subjects who receive their first 
8 doses in the clinic and achieve a stable dose of romiplostim for at least 4 weeks  may 
be allowed to self -inject romiplostim or have the injection administered by a caregiver .  
Weekly dose increases will continue in increments of 1  µg/kg up to a maximum dose of 
10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of ≥ 50 x 10
9/L.  Dose adjustments 
will be allowed to main tain a platelet count between ≥ 50 x 109/L and ≤ 200 x 109/L.  
Dose adjustments will be evaluated every 12 weeks due to potential body weight 
changes . Product:

 If a dose of < 0.05 m L is required, dilution of romiplostim in a 1:2 ratio (a protein 
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL) or a 1:4 ratio (a protein concentration of 0.125 mg/mL ) 
may be made with 0.9% saline to ensure an appropriate dispensable volume is 
delivered.  
Subjects will be monitored for the onset of a sustained platel et response (see 
Section 3.1.1 ) and, if achieved, may dose- reduce romiplostim.  If a subject no longer 
requires treatment with romiplostim but there is subsequently a fall in platelet counts  of 
< 50 x 109/L during the 36- month treatment period, treatment with romiplostim should 
resume at the initial weekly dose of 1 μg/kg. 
The effects of overdose of romiplostim are not known.   In high -dose preclinical studies, 
the noted effects were related to the pharmacological action of romiplostim.  In the event 
of an overdose, platelet counts should be monitored frequently.   Please refer to 
Section 6.2.2  for dosage adjustments.  
Specific romiplostim details, includin g labeling, storage, preparation, dilution, 
administration, etc., are provided in a separate Investigational Product Instruction 
Manual.  Each romiplostim box number is to be recorded on each subject’s 
Investigational Product Administration electronic  case report form ( eCRF ). 
6.2.2 Dosage Adjustments: Delays or Rules for Withholding 
Investigational Product  
Each subject’s dose will be adjusted based on platelet counts.  The rules outlined in 
Table 1 describe how the adjustments are to be made during the study.  Product:

50 to 200b Dose remains constant  
> 200 to < 400 b,c After the platelet count remains in this range for 2 consecutive 
weeks, dose reduce by 1 µ g/kg  
> 400 b,c,d Withhold the dose and dose reduce by 1 µ g/kg on the next 
scheduled day of dosing when platelet count falls <  200 x 109/L  
a If the platelet count is elevated in response to the initiation or increase in dose of another ITP medication, 
then the same dose of IP should be administered when the platelet count is ≤  200 x 109/L. 
b Romiplostim may be used with other therapies  for ITP  (refer to Section  6.4).  If the subject’s platelet count 
is ≥ 50 x 109/L, other  ITP therapies may be reduced or discontinued.  
c If the current dose is 1 μg/ kg and a dose reduction is required, the dose will be withheld until the platelet 
count falls to < 50 x 109/L.  Once the platelet count is < 50 x 109/L, dosing will resume at a dose of 1 μg/kg 
using the dose adjustment rules above.  
d If platelet count ≥ 400 x 109/L is due to rescue medications, it is at the discretion of the investigator to 
reduce the dose by 1 µg/kg.  
In situations in which withholding a romiplostim dose results in a rapid drop in platelet 
count , an alternate dosing schedule may be authorized on a case -by-case basis with the 
approval of an Amgen medical monitor.  
The subject’s body weight will be reassessed every 12 weeks.  Subsequent doses of 
romiplostim will be re -calculated using the new weight.  If the  volume (mL or μL) of IP will 
be increasing due to an increase in body weight >  2.5 kg, the unit dose (μ g/kg) of IP 
should not be increased until a platelet count has decreased to < 50 x 109/L requiring an 
increase in dose.  
All doses of romiplostim will be  administered on a weekly basis.  Should a subject miss a 
dose of romiplostim , the dose can be taken within 1 day of the scheduled date of 
administration.   Should the subject miss a dose outside of the 1 day window, the subject 
will continue with the subsequent dose at the next scheduled weekly date. 
Dosing will be stopped at any time during the study if neutralizing antibodies to 
romiplostim or to eTPO are detected.   
6.2.3 Non-responders to Romiplostim  
Subjects with a platelet count of < 20 x 109/L for 4 consecutive weeks at the maximum 
romiplostim dose of 10 µg/kg  should be discontinued from romiplostim and will be 
considered non -responders.   Non-responders will be discontinued from the study and 
undergo all  EOT and EOS procedures . 
If the subject is a non- respo nder but the investigator believes the subject has obtained 
clinical benefit, the investigator must contact the Amgen medical monitor for Product:

 consideration of continued participation in the study.  If subject is  allowed to remain on 
study and receive a stable romiplostim  dose for at least 4 weeks, the subject  will be 
eligible for self - administration.  
6.3 Self-administration of Romiplostim  
Romiplostim will initially be administered by the investigator or qualified health care 
professional at clinic visits.   At the investigator’s discretion, subjects who have been 
dosed in the clinic and achieve a platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L without romiplostim dose 
adjustments for 4 consecutive weeks  will be eligible to self -administer romiplostim or 
have the injection administered by a caregiver.  
Those subjects who self -administer their medication, as well as those who are eligible to 
self-administer but choose not to, will only be required to return to the site for ongoing 
evaluations (including platelet counts) at designated study visits (performed every 4 weeks), as long as their dose of romiplostim remains stable.  
In the event of a change in dose of romiplostim (per the dose adjustment rules in  
Table 1), subject s will be required to return to the clinic for 2 consecutive week s to 
confirm that the dose adjustment was appropriate .  Subject s will need to be on a stable 
dose and have a platelet count ≥ 50 x 10
9/L for 2 consecutive weeks without romiplostim 
dose adjustments before  resuming self -administration.   
Before subject s begin romiplostim  self-administration, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to ensure that subject s or their caregiver s are trained to prepare and 
administer the injection.  Subjects and/or subject’s  caregivers will receive training and 
study tools designed to educate the subject on the proper s torage, reconstitution, and 
self-administration of romiplostim .  Once subject s or their caregiver s have  adequately 
demonstrated their ability to reliably administer the medication, subjects  may be allowed 
to self -inject  (or have the injection given by their  caregiver)  away from the investigational 
site.  The completion of training on self - injection (or training to a caregiver) will be 
recorded in the subject’s source documentation.   All training will be monitored. 
The site will be required to ensure that subject s are supplied with necessary materials 
required for self -injecting, including dispensing of the IP.  All used vials of romiplostim  
must be returned to the clinic for drug accountability.  Subject diary cards to record the 
dose, dosing date , and any dosing or storage errors will be provided to subjects.  
While subject s are self-injecting, the IP must be provided to subjects every 4 weeks, 
during the regular clinic visit s.  Shipping of romiplostim  to subject s is prohibited.  Product:

 Subjects are expected to stor e romiplostim  in a refrigerator and to notify the site 
personnel if an error  in storage or dosing was made. 
6.4 Concomitant Therapy  
Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or 
treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care, except for those 
listed in  Section 6.6. 
All prescription and non- prescription concomitant m edications , used to treat conditions 
other than ITP, administered at the time of enrollment, ongoing after enrollment ,  as well 
as changes in such concom itant medications  and any new concomitant medications 
taken while the subject is on study, will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF t hrough 
the EOT or the EOS visit, whichever is later . 
Concomitant medications are allowed for subjects enrolled into the study in any situation deemed medically necessary to increase platelet counts.  Medications to increase platelet counts starting before enrollment and continuing unchanged (dose and schedule) while on treatment with romiplostim will be defined as concomitant medications for ITP.   Rescue medication is defined as any medication or transfusion, 
other than romiplostim and excluded medications, that is administered  after enrollment  
to the subject with the intent of raising platelet counts or to prevent bleeding and 
includes concomitant medications for ITP in which the dose and/or schedule is 
increased.  For the purposes of this study, the permitted rescue medications include the 
following : Concomitant and Rescue Therapy for  ITP 
• co rticosteroids  
• platelet transfusions  
• IVIG 
• azathioprine 
• anti-D immunoglobulin  
• danazol  
Antifibrinolytics can be used at any time during the study and will not be considered 
rescue medication (s). 
Inhaled and/or topical corticosteroids intended to treat non ITP  conditions (eg, inhaled 
steroids for as thma) will not be considered concomitant medications for ITP or rescue Product:

 medications and continuing on such medication(s) will not affect the definition of platelet 
response.  
Rescue medication is allowed throughout the  duration of the study when platelet counts 
are < 20 x 109/L and/or when a subject has bleeding or wet purpura.   Rescue medication 
is also allowed in any situation deemed medically necessary by the treating physician to 
increase platelet counts to treat or  prevent bleeding. 
Reduction or discontinuation of concomitant or rescue medications for ITP is 
recommended based on investigator judgment when platelet counts are ≥ 50 x 109/L. 
Rescue medications are not provided by Amgen.  
6.5 Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic or oral communication that alleges 
deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of any investigational or non- investigational product(s) or device(s).  
Any product complaint(s) associated with an investigational product(s) or non-investigational product(s) or device(s) supplied by Amgen are to be reported 
according to the ins tructions provided in the IPIM.  
6.6 Excluded Treatments During Study Period  
The following medications are not permitted during this study:  
• commercially available romiplostim  (Nplate
®) 
• other thrombopoietic receptor agonists  (eg, eltrombopag, also known as Promacta® 
or Revolade®) 
• any cytotoxic agents or  alkylating agents  
• Mycophenolate Mofetil  
• Rituximab  
• rHuTPO  
• interferon  
• treatments for ITP other than allowed rescue medications  
• any other investigational agents that are not approved for commercial use  
If a subject requires administration of any of the medications listed above, Amgen should 
be consul ted before  administration of the medication when possible.  In all cases, 
Amgen must be informed within 24 hours.  Amgen may decide that the subject will be 
ineligible to receive additional administrations of IP, in which case, the subject should 
complete the EO T and EO S visit s. Product:

 6.7 Other Treatment Procedures  
If treatment with romiplostim is deemed to be ineffective or intolerable, the investigator 
may decide to perform a splenectomy.  If a splenectomy is performed, the subject will 
discontinue treatment with romiplostim  and follow the procedures for the EOT and EOS 
visits.  
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
All subjects and/or  their legally acceptable representatives (eg, parents, legal guardian) 
will sign and date the informed consent form before subject s can undergo any 
study -specific procedures.   If required by the IRB/ IEC, the assent of the child also must 
be obtained in addition to written informed consent .  Refer to the S chedul e of 
Assessments (Table 2) for an outline of the procedures required at each visit.  The visit 
schedule is calculated from day 1 (first administration of romiplostim) .  All study 
procedures have a window of ± 1 day. Procedures that are part of routine care and not 
considered study specific procedures may be used as screening procedures to 
determine eligibility.  
Missed visits or procedures that are not completed must be reported as such in the subject’s source documentation, with an explanation of why the procedures were not completed.  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to ensure minimize d risks to study subject s.  This includes testing to ensure  analytical 
methods produce reliable and valid data throughout the course of the study .  This can 
also include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
If informed consent is provided by the subject,  or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative, Amgen may do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and 
back -up) to investigate and better understand ITP , the dose response and/or predicti on 
of response to romiplostim, characterize antibody response, or  characterize aspects of 
the molecule (eg, metabolites).  Results from this analysis will be documented and maintained, but may not be reported as part of this study.  
All subjects enrolled will have samples assayed for binding and if positive, neutralizing 
antibodies.  Product:

 7.1.1 Routine Blood Tests  
Screening and baseline blood tests for central laboratory testing must be obtained after 
written informed consent and assent  (if applicable) .  Screening laboratory studies may 
be used in lieu of any required pre-treatment day 1 week 1 laboratory  tests  if performed 
within 10 days prior to the first dose.  
Refer to the central laboratory manual for instructions on collection, preparation, storage , 
and shipment o f blood samples.   Complete blood counts ( CBC) with differential and 
blood chemistries will be evaluated at a central laboratory and as outlined in Table 3 
(List of Analytes in Laboratory Specimens ). 
The i nvestigato r should review locally assessed peripheral blood smears before the first 
dose of romiplostim  and every 4 -12 weeks thereafter.  Additional locally -assessed blood 
smears may be collected more frequently as clinically indicated or at the request of 
Amgen.  Abnormalities such as nucleated red blood cells , teardrop cells (dacrocytes), 
and blasts  should be recorded in the eCRFs .  
Should an abnormality be identified in a CBC or a peripheral blood smear at any time 
during the study, it is recommended that a bone m arrow biopsy be performed a nd 
submitted to a central laboratory for further assessment.  In addition to routine analysis, 
silver and trichrome stains for the assessment of reticulin and collagen , as assessed by 
the modified Bauermeister scale  (Appendix B), will be conducted  by the central 
laboratory .  All data  collected from the bone marrow biopsy will be reported to Amgen as 
part of the study.  
Urine or blood pregnancy testing , for female subjects of child bearing potential  (defined 
as having first menses) , will be reported by the local laboratory before the first dose of 
romiplostim, every 12 weeks thereafter, and at the end of treatment visit .  Pregnancy 
testing will not be analyzed or reported by the central laboratory.  Product:

c Platelet counts are performed by local laboratory only.  
7.1.2 Platelet Counts  
Platelet counts will be evaluated by the investigative site’s  local laboratory and used to 
assess the need for romiplostim dose adjustments and to evaluate platelet response to 
therapy.   Platelet counts will not be analyzed or reported by the central laboratory.  The 
investigational site’s laboratory should be used whenever possible for the assessment of platelet counts; however , in certain circumstances platelet count may be assessed at a 
laboratory local to the subject’s residence.  Throughout this study, the laboratory 
analyzing a subject’s platelet count should be consistent.  
All platelet counts required for dosing decisions will be collected and recorded on the eCRFs.  Product:

 7.1.3 Antibody Testing Procedures 
Refer to the central laboratory manual for instructions on collection, preparation, storage , 
and shipment of antibody samples.  Baseline antibody samples must be obtained on 
day 1 before the first administration of romiplostim.  
Blood samples will be collected from all subjects for the measurement of  
anti-romiplostim binding antibodies.  Binding antibodies will be assessed for their ability 
to bind to romiplostim or the peptide portion of romiplostim, and their potential (if any) to cross- react with eTPO.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will also be 
tested for neutralizing antibodies by assessing their ability to neutralize romiplostim and/or eTPO in a cell- based bioassay.  Binding antibodies may be further characterized 
for quantity/titer, isotype, affinity and presence of immune complexes.  While the subject 
is receiving IP,  blood samples will be collected for anti-romiplostim antibodies at 
week  12, week 52, every 24 weeks thereaft er, and at the EOT visit.  Only positive results 
for neutralizing antibodies will be provided to investigational sites; if no results are provided, sites may assume that no neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim were identified.  
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies to romiplostim or to eTPO during the course of the study (or at the EOT visit) will be removed from treatment and will be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  This testing should occur every 3 months 
starting from when the site has been notified of the positive result, until: (1) neutralizing 
antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the subject has been followed for a period of at least 1 year (± 4 weeks).   More frequent testing (e g, every month) or testing for a 
longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related concerns.  
Subjects who test positive for binding, non- neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -romiplostim antibody 
response, may also be asked to return for additional follow -up testing.  
Should a subject fail to respond or fail to maintain a response to romiplostim, an unscheduled serum sample will be required to rule out anti -romiplostim antibodies.  
7.2 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods 
produce reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also Product:

 include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for met hod tr ansfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure 
confidentiality.  
If informed consent is provided by  or for  the subject,  Amgen can do additional testing on 
remaining samples (ie, residual and back -up) to inves tigate and better understand ITP 
and characterize aspects of the m olecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  
Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are not necessarily 
reported as part of this study.  Samples can be retained for up to 20 years.  
Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, 
the personal physician, or other  third parties, except as specified in the informed 
consent.  
The subject  and/or the subject’s legally authorized representative retain the right to 
request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator.  Following 
the request from the subject  (or their legally authorized representative) , the investigator 
is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining (eg, blood) samples and any other components from the cells can be located 
and destroyed.  Samples will be destroyed once all protocol -defined procedures are 
completed.  However, information collected from samples prior to the request for 
destruction, will be retained by Amgen.  
The sponsor is the exclusive owner of any data, discoveries, or deriv ative materials from 
the sample materials and is responsible for the destruction of the sample(s) at the 
request of the subject through the investigator, at the end of the storage period, or as appropriate (eg, the scientific rationale for experimentation with a certain sample type no 
longer justifies keeping the sample).  If a commercial product is developed from this research project, the sponsor owns the commercial product.  The subject has no commercial rights to such product and has no commercial right s to the data, information, 
discoveries, or derivative materials gained or produced from the sample.  Product:

 7.3 Medical History  
A complete medical history is required .  The complete medical history related to ITP 
including prior therapies, bleeding history, and any bone marrow biopsy data will be 
collected at screening.  For subjects referred to the research center, copies of the 
subject records from the referring physician should be obtained.  
7.4 Concomitant Medications 
In addition to routine concomitant medications  for conditions other than ITP , during the 
course of the study, all concomitant and rescue medications administered for ITP  will be 
recorded in the eCRF from screening until the end of treatment or end of study visit .  
7.5 Screening  
The screening period begins on  the date that the subject (and/or the subject’s legally 
authorized representative) signs the IRB/IEC -approved informed consent form and 
continues until the date of enrollment.   Procedures that are part of routin e care are not 
considered study -specific procedures.  All subjects will be screened for eligibility before 
enrollment.  
The following screening procedures must be completed within 4 weeks  before  the day of 
first dose of romiplostim:  
• informed consent  (and assent if required by IRB/ IEC) 
• confirmation o f ITP diagnosis  
• ITP and m edical history  
• physical exam as per standard of care including weight and vital signs .  Physical 
examination findings should be recorded on the medical history or adverse event 
eCRF  
• concomitant medications  
• central lab CBC with dif ferential and blood chemistry  
• confirmation of one local lab platelet count ≤ 30 x 109/L and/or documentation of 
bleeding that was uncontrolled with conventional therapies for ITP  
• local lab urine or serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child- bearing potential 
(defined as having first menses)  
• serious adverse events that occurred after the signing of informed consent  
If subjects do not successfully complete screening within 4 weeks after initial informed 
consent, their  screen failure will be registered  in the IVR S.  Subjects who fail screening 
will be allowed to re -screen.  Subjects who rescree n must repeat relevant  screening 
procedures within the new 4-week screening window.  If the subject ’s screening platelet 
count is >  30 x 109/L without evidence of  uncontrolled bleeding with conventional Product:

 therapies upon initial assessment the site may reassess the platelet count during the 
4-week screening period without registration of screen- failure or re -consenting the 
subject.  
7.6 Romiplostim Treatment Period (U p to a 36 Months D uration) 
Subject s that meet  all study entrance criteria will be enrolled using IVRS to receive 
romiplostim. 
The following procedures will be completed during the romiplostim  treatment period at 
the times designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2): 
• documentation of concomitant and rescue medications  
• adverse event reporting 
• central lab  CBC with differential (every 4 weeks)  
• central lab blood chemistry (every 12 weeks)  
• local lab platelet counts . 
• collection of blood samples for anti -romiplostim antibodies (first sample is collected 
before first dose of romiplostim, then at week 12, week 52, and every 24 weeks 
thereafter)  
• local lab peripheral blood smear  (every 4 weeks)  
• physical exam with vital signs  and weight  (every 12 weeks)  
• local lab urine or serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child- bearing potential 
(defined as having first menses) every 12 weeks  
• romiplostim administration  
Note: Administration of romiplostim should be the last procedure completed during each 
visit that it is required. 
For the first 8 weeks of treatment , all subjects will return to the clinic for weekly 
administration of romiplostim.  Subjects who have received their first 8 doses in the clinic 
and achieve a stable dose of  romiplostim for at least 4 weeks may be allowed to 
self-inject romiplostim or have the injection administered by a caregiver.  For subjects 
who established a stable dose of romiplostim and are self -administering, platelet counts 
will be monitored every 4 weeks .  For complete details on self-administration, refer to 
Section 6.3.  Subjects who stop romiplostim and all other medications  for ITP 
(concomitant or rescue) due to the onset of a sustained platelet response will  continue to 
be monitored per the schedule of assessments  for at least 6 months from the first 
platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L. Product:

 If the subject has maintained a sustained platelet response, subsequent visits and 
procedures including the platelet counts, CBC , and peripheral blood smears will be 
performed  every 12 weeks  for the duration of the 36- month treatment period.  If the 
subject’s platelet counts fall to < 50 x 109/L and treatment with romiplostim is resumed, 
the visit schedule will revert to weekly platelet counts , and CBC with peripheral blood 
smear evaluations every 4 weeks.  The visit assessment weeks and procedures resume counting from first dose of  romiplostim after enrollment. 
7.7 End of Treatment Visit  (EOT) 
All subject s will complete an EOT visit.  For subjects who complete the 36 -month 
treatment period and who have been off romiplostim and other medications for ITP (concomitant or rescue) for 4 weeks or  more , the EOT  visit will be the final study visit  
and will occur after  the completion of the 36 -month treatment period .  For subjects 
ending the 36 -month treatment period for non- response or other reasons while still 
receiving romiplostim, this visit will be 1 week after the last administration of romiplostim.   
The following assessments will be completed at the E OT visit:  
• physical exam, including vital signs  
• documentation of concomitant and rescue medications   
• adverse event reporting 
• central lab CBC  with differential and blood chemistry  
• local lab platelet counts  
• collection of blood samples for anti -romiplostim an tibodies  
• local lab peripheral blood smear  
• local lab urine or serum pregnancy test for female subjects of child- bearing potential 
(defined as having first menses)  
7.8 End of Study Visit  (EOS) 
Four weeks after the last dose of romiplostim for subjects who end t he 36 -month 
treatment period for non- response or other reasons while still receiving romiplostim will 
have an EOS visit.  
The following  assessments will be completed at the EOS visit:  
• local lab platelet count

 8. WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP or 
procedures at any time during the study  but continue participation in the study .  If this 
occurs, the investigator  is to discuss with the s ubject the appropriate processes for 
discontinuation from IP and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2) and collection of data, including endpoints and 
adverse events.  The investigator  must document the change to the S chedule of 
Assessments (Table 2) and the level of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject (eg,  
follow -up in person, by telephone/mail, through fa mily/friends, in 
correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records).  
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further protocol -required therapies or procedures, and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after withdrawal of consent.  The investigator  is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  Subjects who withdraw 
early should complete an EOT and EOS visit .  The data generated may potentially not 
be included in the subject’s study data, except in the case of a possibly related serious 
adverse event, where data will be collected.  
8.2  Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion  
The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subjec t(s) from investigational 
product and/or other protocol- required therapies, protocol procedures, or the study as a 
whole at any time prior to study completion.  
Subjects may be eligible for continued treatment with Amgen investigational product(s) and/or other protocol -required therapies by a separate protocol or as provided for by the 
local country’s regulatory mechanism, based on parameters consistent with Section 12.1. Product:

 8.2.1 Reasons for Removal From Treatment  
Reasons for removal fro m romiplostim or observation might include the following : 
• protocol specified criteria  
• subject request  (or the subject’s legally authorized representative)   
• safety concern (eg, due to an adverse event, ineligibility determined, protocol 
deviation, non- compl iance, requirement for alternative therapy, pregnancy )  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
• decision by Sponsor (other than subject request, safety concern, lost to follow -up) 
8.2.2 Reasons for Removal From Study  
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study are as follow s: 
• protocol specified criteria  
• decision by s ponsor  
• withdrawal of consent from study  
• death  
• lost to follow -up 
8.3 Replacement of Subjects 
Subjects who withdraw from the study early will not be replaced.  
9. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING  
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial 
subject.  The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. 
The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre- existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates the pre- existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study, and involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In t he event a subject, or subject’s Product:

 legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapies 
or the study due to an adverse event, refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on 
the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or 
the study.  
9.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the 
following serious criteria: 
• fatal 
• life th reatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
• requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• other medically important serious event  
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”.  Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias,  or events that necessitate 
an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
9.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the 
investigator or reported by the subject that occur after first dose of investigational 
product through the end of  treatment period are reported using the applicable e CRF (eg, 
Adverse Event Summary CRF) . 
Because all subjects who enter the study will be diagnosed with ITP according to the ASH guidelines, ITP should not be reported as an adverse event during the conduct of 
the study.  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
• adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s),  if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) 
• dates of onset and resolution (if resolved)  Product: 
Date: Romiplostim
Clinical Study Report:  20101221

Date: 15 August 2014 Page 43 of 69 
 • severity  
• assessment of relatedness to romiplostim   
• action taken  
The adverse event severity grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) version 3.0 grading scale.  The severity grading scale used 
in this study is described in Appendix A. 
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the 
romiplostim.  This r elationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by t he romiplostim?    
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -manda ted activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapies, device(s) and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s)).  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonabl e possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, 
administrati on of investigational product, protocol -required therapies, device(s)), and/or 
procedure?”  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and det ermining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable,  
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.  
The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
9.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by  
the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after signing of the informed 
consent  through 30 days af ter last dose of IP (for subjects who have sustained platelet 
responses and never resume IP after sustained response during the trial); or the later of 
the EOT and EOS  visits, are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted Product:

 to Amgen.  All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours 
following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the applicable CRF.  
After the protocol -required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not 
need to actively monitor subjects for serious adverse events.  However, if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event after this protocol -required 
reporting period, the investigator will report the event to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event.  Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as 
clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.   
If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the Serious Adverse Event, the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Serious Adverse Event  (eSAE) Contingency Report Form within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  See Appendix A for a sample of the Serious 
Adverse Event Worksheet/electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  
For EDC studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available  
The investigator mus t assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to 
any study -mandated activity or procedure.  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or 
“no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused  by a study activity/procedure”?  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversi bility.  
New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen.   All new information for serious adverse events  must be sent to 
Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information.   The invest igator 
may be asked to provide additional follow -up information, which may include a discharge 
summary or extracts from the medic al record.   Information provided about the serious 
adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse 
Event Summary CRF).  
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the study because of a serious adverse event, this inf ormation must be submitted to Amgen. Product:

 Amgen will report serious adverse events  and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/ IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirement s according to local regulations and good 
clinical practice . 
The investigator should notify the appropriate IRB/ IEC of serious adverse events 
occurring at the site and other adverse event reports received from Amgen, in 
accordance with local procedures and  statutes.  
9.3 Pregnancy and Lactation Reporting  
If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the subject is taking protocol -required therapies report the pregnancy to Amgen as specified 
below.  
In addition to reporting any pregnancies occurring during the study, investigators should 
monitor for pregnancies that occur after the last dose of protocol -required therapies 
through 1 month  after the last dose of romiplostim.  
The pregnancy should be reported to Amgen’s global Pregnancy Surveillance Program 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet (Appendix C).  The Pregnancy 
Surveillance Program (PSP) will seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and her baby up to 12 months after birth.  
If a lactation case occurs while the female subject is taking protocol -required therapies 
report the lactation case to Amgen as specified bel ow.  
In addition to reporting a lactation case during the study, investigators should monitor for lactation cases that occur after the last dose of protocol- required therapies through  
1 month after the end of the dose of romiplostim.  
Any lactation case should be reported to Amgen’s global Lactation Surveillance Program (LSP) within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of event.  Report a lactation case on the Lactation Notification Worksheet (Appendix D).

 10.1.2.4 Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol analysis set will consist of all subjects who received at least 1  dose of 
IP and met all eligibility criteria.  A sensitivity analysis using the per protocol set will be 
conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size for this study is governed by the number of pediatric ITP subjects who 
meet the eligibility requirements during enrollment period.  It is estimated that  
approximately 200 subjects will enroll into this study.   The percentage of time achieving 
platelet response in the first 6 months of treatment period for ITP subjects  with 
romiplostim (both adults and pediatric) is estimated at 74%.  The standard deviation of 
percentage of time is estimated between 30% and 36% based on previous Nplate data. Given the sample size of 200 subjects, the half width of the 95% confidence int erval (CI) 
for the percentage of time achieving platelet response is estimated to be between 4% and 5%.  
10.3 Planned Analyses 
The analysis will be descriptive in nature.   No formal hypothesis is to be tested.  
10.3.1 Interim Analyses  
Interim analyses will be conducted to support reg ulatory filings , and accumulated data 
for this study will be summarized to provide ongoing assessments of the safety of romiplostim.  These interim analyses will occur at least annually until the end of the study.  
10.3.2 Analysis of Key Study Endpoi nts 
10.3.2.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
The primary endpoint for this study is the percentage of time with platelet response starting from week 2 in the first 6 months of the treatment period.  Platelet response is 
defined as platelet count ≥ 50 x10
9/L at a scheduled protocol visit .  Platelet counts within 
4 weeks of a rescue ITP medication will not  be deemed as platelet response. The 95% 
CI will be calculated for the estimated percentag e of time.  
Summary statistics of platelet counts and responses will be provided at weeks 1 to 8 and 
then every 4 weeks.  
The percentage of time with platelet res ponse starting from week 2 until the EOT period 
will be summarized with 95% CI. Product:

 Missing platelet counts at weeks 12 and  16, and every 4 weeks thereafter will be 
imputed by using the mean of the 2 closest non- missing platelet counts within ±1 week 
before study discontinuation.  If still missing after imputation, platelet counts will be 
considered as non- response.  
The proportion of subjects with splenectomy during the study will be summar ized for the 
subjects who entered this study without splenectomy.  
10.3.2.2 Safety Endpoints 
The exposure- adjusted incidence rates as well as subject incidence rates of adverse 
events will be summarized by system organ class and by preferred term according to the 
MedDRA dictionary.  Exposure- adjusted rate is defined as total number of events 
divided by time of duration when subjects were under observation.   The summary 
includes all treatment -emergent adverse events recorded from the start of IP on this 
study, or any worsening of conditions present at baseline before  dosing in this study.  
This summary for adverse events will be performed for the following categories  
• all adverse events  
• romiplostim- related adverse events  
• serious adverse events  
• adverse events leading to withdrawal from the study  
• adverse events of interest  (hemorrhage events, etc.)  
In addition, incidence and exposure- adjusted rates of adverse events by period may also 
be explored.  
Subject listings for all adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events 
leading to withdrawal from the study will be provided.  
The incidence and percentage of subjects who develop anti -romiplostim antibodies 
(binding and if positive, neutralizing) at any time will be tabulated.  
Summary statistics will be provided for blood chemistry and CBC at each time point.  
Shift tables between the worst post -baseline and baseline values will be provided (based 
on the National Cancer Institute CTCAE , version 3.0).  
10.3.3 Primary Analysis 
The objective for the primary analysis will be to summarize the data with the respect to the primary and secondary endpoints for the trial. The primary analysis will occur after the last subject has completed all investigational treatment  and observations  on this 
protocol.  The primary analysis will serve as th e final analysis for the trial.  Product:

 obtaining written assent from the subject.  For specific local information, consult the 
country -specific requirements of the applicable countries. 
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent and assent  (if applicable)  from the subject and/or 
legally acceptable representative after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific 
screening proce dures or any IP is  administered.   A legally acceptable representative is 
an individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical study. 
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject  or his/her legally  acceptable 
representative if the subject has a primary care physician and if the subject agrees to 
have his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject or his/her legally acceptable representative agrees to such 
notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s primary care physician of the 
subject’s participation in the clinical study.  If the subject does not have a primary care 
physician and the investigator will be acting in that capacity, the investigator should document such in the subject’s medical record.  
The acquisition of informed consent  and, if applicable, assent  and the subject’s 
agreement or refusal of his/her notification of the primary care physician is to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records, and the informed consent /assent form  
should be signed and personally dated by the subject or a legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the in formed consent discussion.  The 
original signed informed consent form and assent form, if applicable,  should be retained 
in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form /assent 
form should be provided to the subject or legally  acceptable representative. 
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the informed consent form/assent form  to the subject and must allow for questions.  
Thereafter, both the subject and the witness must  sign the informed consent form /assent 
form to attest that informed consent was freely given and understood.

 In this study, the IVRS captures the following data points and these are considered 
source data:   subject identification number, the date of the screening, the date of 
enrollment, date of first dose and the date and rea son for early  withdraw or study 
completion.  
The investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
central ized filing system of all study related (essential) documentation, suitable for 
inspection at any time by representatives from Amgen and/or applicable regulatory 
authorities.  Elements should include:  
• subject files containing completed CRF, informed consent forms, and subject 
identification list  
• study files containing the protocol with all amendments, investigator’s brochure, 
copies of  prestudy documentation, and all correspondence to and from the IRB/IEC 
and Amgen  
• proof of receipt/delivery sheet , Investigational Product Accountability Record, Return 
of Investigational Product for Destruction, Final Investigational Product Reconciliation 
Statement (if applicable), and all drug- related correspondence 
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the eCRFs must be 
maintained and be readily available.  
Retention of study documents will be governed by the Clinical Trial Agr eement.  
12.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection  
The Amgen representative and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for 
contacting and visiting the investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, inspecting the various records of the clinical study (eg, CRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Amgen Clinical M onitor is responsible for verifying the CRFs at regular intervals 
throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research.  The Clinical Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other 
study -related records needed to verify the entries  on the CRFs.  
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing CRFs, are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’s Global Compliance Auditing function (or Product:

 designees).  Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, drug storage areas, laboratories) 
and review of study -related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and 
compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  
• All source documentation supporting entries into the electronic CRFs  must be 
maintained and readily available.  
• Updates to electronic CRFs  will be automatically documented through the software’s 
“audit tr ail.” 
• To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review will be performed on subject data rec eived at Amgen.  During 
this review, subject data will be checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be reviewed for adherence to the 
protocol and GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical  data 
management review process, data queries and/or site notifications will be created in 
the EDC system database for site resolution and closed by Amgen reviewer.  
• The principal investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this 
electroni c data capture study.  This signature will indicate that the principal 
investigator inspected  or reviewed the data on the CRF, the data queries, and the 
site notifications, and agrees with the content.  
Amgen (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database, as documented in the Study -specific Self -evident Corrections 
Plan.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by Amgen (or designee) 
include deletion of obvious duplicate data (eg, same results sent twice with the same 
date with different visit —week 4 and early termination) and clarifying “other, specify” if 
data are provided (eg, race, physical examination).   Each investigative site will be 
provided a list of the types of corrections applied to study data at the initiation of the 
study and at study closeout.  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection 
The investigator is responsible for complying with the requirements for all assessments and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapies) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior to completion of all protocol- required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.  This ensures that the data set(s) 
produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible. Product:

 12.5 Language 
eCRFs must be completed in English.  TRADENAMES® (if used) for concomitant 
medications may be entered in the local language.  Consult the country -specific 
requirements for language requirements.  
All written information and other material to be used by subjects and investigative staff 
must use vocabulary and language that are clearly understood.   
12.6 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, Amgen encourages the formation of a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and appropriate 
Amgen staff,  the governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication 
Charter .  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance from other 
investigators and to collaborate with authors and Amgen staff as appropriate as defined 
in the Publication Charter.  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and 
Amgen staff) does not guarantee authorship—the criteria described below should be met for every publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ), which states:  
• Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; and (3) final approval 
of the version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, and 3.  
• When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
should fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
• Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
• All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should be listed.  
• Each author should have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.  
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) 
based on this study must be submitted to Am gen for corporate review.  The Clinical 
Study Agreement among the institution, principal investigator, and Amgen will detail the 
procedures for, and timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.  Product:

Serious Adverse Event Completion Instructions  
Completion Instructions  - Electronic Adverse Event Contingency Report Form  
NOTE:  T his form  is to be used under restricted conditions outlined on page 1 below.  If you must fax 
an event report to Amgen, you must also enter  that event into the EDC system (eg, Rave)  when it 
becomes available.    (for use for Studies  using Electronic Data Capture [ EDC]) 
The protocol will provide instruction on what types of events to report for the study. This form is to 
be used ONLY to report events that must b e captured in the Amgen safety database. *Indicates a 
mandatory field. General Instructions  
Definitions:  
• Adverse Event - Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. The event does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment.  
• Serious Adverse Event – An adverse event that meets serious criteria  
• Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) – An adverse event that is suspected to be related to an 
Amgen product in an observational study.  
• Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction – An SAR that meets serious criter ia 
What types of events to report on this form:  
Type of Event  Clinical Trials  
Adverse Event that is not serious  No 
Serious Adverse Event (regardless of 
relationship)  Yes 
  
Type of Event  Observational Studies  
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  Yes 
Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  Yes 
Serious Adverse Events that are not suspected 
to be related  ONLY if instructed by protocol or by local 
Amgen office or CRA  
  
1. Site Information  
Site Number * – Enter your assigned site number for this study  
Investigator *, Country *, Reporter *, Phone No., and Fax No. – Enter information requested   
2. Subject Information  
Subject ID Number * – Enter the entire number assigned to the subject  
Age at event onset, Sex, and Race – Enter the subject’s demographic information  
End of Study dat e – If the subject has already completed the study or terminated the study early, enter 
the End of Study date  
If you are submitting follow -up information to a previous report, provide the adverse event term for 
the previous report as well as the start date for the initial event.   
3. Adverse Event  
Provide the date the Investigator became aware of this Information  
Adverse Event Diagnosis or Syndrome * –   
 If the diagnosis is known, it should be entered. Do not list all signs/symptoms if they are 
include d in the diagnosis.  
 If a diagnosis is not known, the relevant signs/symptoms should be entered.  
 If the event is fatal, the cause of death should be entered and autopsy results should be submitted, when available.   Product:

Protocol Number:  20101221  
Date: 15 August 2014 Page 62 of 69 
 Date Started * – Enter date the adverse event first started rather than the date of diagnosis or 
hospitalization. For serious events, the start date is the date the event started, not the date on which the 
event met serious criteria. This is a mandatory field. 
Date Ended – Enter date the adverse event ended. For serious events, this is not the date when the 
event no longer met serious criteria.  If the event has not ended at the time of the initial report, a follow -
up report should be completed when the end date is known.  If the event is fatal, enter the date of death 
as the end date.  
If event occurred before the first dose of Investigational Product (IP)/drug under study , add a 
check mark in the corresponding box.  
Is event serious? * – Indicate Yes or No. This is a mandatory field. 
Serious Criteria Code * – This is a mandatory field for serious events. Enter all reasons why the 
reported event has met serious criteria:  
 Immediately life -threatening – Use only if the subject was at immediate  risk of death from the 
event as it occurred.  Emergency treatment is often required to sustain life in this situation.  
 If the investigator decides an event should be reported in an expedited manner, but it does not 
meet other serious criteria, “Other Medically Important  Serious Event” may be the appropriate 
serious  criterion.  
Relationship to IP/drug under study * – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of 
the event to the IP /drug under study  at the time the event is initially reported. For observational 
studies, remember that SARs are, by definit ion, related to the drug under study.  This is a 
mandatory field.  
Relationship to Amgen device * – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of the 
event to the Amgen device (e.g. prefilled syringe, auto-injector) at the time the event is initially reported. 
If the study involves an Amgen device, this is a mandatory field. This question does not apply to 
non-Amgen devices used in the study (e.g. heating pads, infusion pumps)  
Outcome of Event * – Enter the code for the outcome of the event at the time the form is completed. 
This is a mandatory field  for serious events.   
 Resolved – End date is known 
 Not resolved / Unknown – End date is unknown 
 Fatal – Event led to death  
If event is related to a study procedure, such as a biopsy, radiotherapy or withdrawal of a current drug 
treatment during a wash- out period, add a check mark to the corresponding box. This does not include 
relationship to IP/drug under study or concomitant medication – only diagnostic tests or activities 
mandated by the protocol.  
4. Hospitalization  
If the subject was hospitalized, enter admission and discharge dates.  Hospitalization is any in-patient 
hospital admission for medical reasons, including an overnight stay in a healthcare facility, regardless of 
duration.  A pre-existing condition that did not worsen while on study which involved a hospitalization for an elective treatment, is not considered an adverse event.  Protocol specified hospitalizations are exempt.   
5. IP/Drug Under Study  Administration including Lot # and Serial # when known / available.  At the top of Page 2, provide your Site Number and the Subject ID Number in the designated section.  
Blinded or open -label – If applicable, indicate whether the investigational product is blinded or 
open-label  
Initial Start Date – Enter date the product was first administered, regardless of dose.  
Date of Dose Prior to or at the time of the Event – Enter date the product was last administered prior 
to, or at the time of, the onset of the event.  
Dose, Route, and Frequency at or prior to  the event – Enter the appropriate information for the dose, 
route and frequency at, or prior to, the onset of the event.  
Action Taken with Product – Enter the status of the product administration.   
6. Concomitant Medications  
Indicate if there are any medi cations.  
Medication Name, Start Date, Stop Date, Dose, Route, and Frequency – Enter information for any 
other medications the subject is taking.  Include any study drugs not included in section 5 (Product

Header Information  
New / Follow -up – Indicate if this is a new adverse event, or a follow -up of a pre-reported event.  
Follow-up – Send a Follow -up report if additional data adds to or changes the clinical interpretation of the 
event.  Some examples are:  
 The initial reported event has changed and additional serious criteria have been met (such as if 
event outcome is now fatal).  
 Signs and symptoms were reported at the time of the initial report and a final diagnosis has now 
been made.  
 A change in relationship of a study procedure or activity has occurred from the initial report.  
 A significant change has occurred in the start date of the event or start date of a suspect 
concomitant medication.  
 Additional concomitant medications and/or diagnostics have been identified that may contribute to 
or explain the event.  
When sending a follow -up report, either:  
 On a photocopy of the prior report, add the additional information, re- sign and date, then fax in the 
follow -up form – or –  
 Complete a new form with the new information.  If the serious adverse event terms have not

1. Site Information  
Site Number  – Enter your assigned site number for this study  
Investigator, Country, Reporter, Phone No., and Fax No. – Enter information requested  
2. Subject Information  
Subject ID Number  – Enter the entire number assigned to the subject  
 Initials – Enter the subject’s initials in accordance with local laws.  If middle initial is unknown or does not 
exist, please enter a “hyphen“ (eg, ESB, E -B)  
 Date of Birth, Sex, and Race – Enter the subject’s demographic  information   
3. Serious Adverse Event  
Provide the date the Investigator became aware of this Serious Adverse Event Information  
Serious Adverse Event Diagnosis or Syndrome –   
 If the diagnosis is known, it should be entered.  Do not list all signs/symptoms if they are included in 
the diagnosis.  
 If a diagnosis is not known, the relevant signs/symptoms meeting serious criteria should be 
entered.  
 If the event is fatal, the cause of death should be entered and autopsy results should be submitted, 
when available.  Do not enter “Death”, as this is an outcome, not an event.  
Date Started – Enter date the adverse event first started; not when the event met serious criteria, when a 
diagnosis was made or when the subject was hospitalized.  
Date Ended – Enter date the adverse event ended, not the date when the event no longer met serious 
criteria.  If the event has not ended at the time of the initial report, a follow -up report should be completed 
when the end date is known.  If the event is fatal, enter the date of death as the end date.  
Serious Criteria Code – Enter reason why the reported event has met serious criteria:   
 Immediately life -threatening – Use only if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  Emergency treatment is often required to sustain life in this situation.  
 If the investigator decides an event should be reported in an expedited manner, but it does not 
meet other serious criteria, “Other significant medical hazard” may be the appropriate serious criteria.  
Relations hip to IP* – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of the event to the IP at 
the time the event is initially reported. This is a mandatory field.  
Relationship to Amgen device – The Investigator must determine and enter the relationship of the event to 
the Amgen device at the time the event is initially reported. If the study involves an Amgen device, this is 
a mandatory field. 
Outcome of Event – Enter the code for the outcome of the event at the time the form is completed.  
  Resolved – End date is known  
  Resolving / Not resolved – End date is unknown  
  Fatal – Event led to death  
 If event is related to a study procedure , such as a biopsy, radiotherapy or withdrawal of a current drug 
treatment during a wash- out period, add a check mark to the corresponding box. This does not include 
relationship to concomitant administration – only diagnostic tests or activities mandated by the protocol.    
4. Hospitalization  
If the subject was hospitalized, enter admission and discharge dates.  Hospitalization is any in-patient 
hospital admission for medical reasons, including an overnight stay in a healthcare facility, regardless of duration.  A pre-existing condition that did not worsen while on study, which involved a hospitalization for a n 
elective treatment, is not considered an adverse event.  Protocol specified hospitalizations are exempt. 
However, if the subject is retained in the study unit and becomes an in-patient due to an AE, the event would 
be reportable as an SAE.

Statistical Considerations  Not applicable  The analyses of bone marrow collagen as evidenced by trichrome staining, bone marrow reticulin increases using the modified Bauermeister grading scale , and cytogenetic 
abnormal ities in the bone marrow after Year 1 and Y ear 2 will be descriptive. The 
proportion of subjects developing collagen, increase in reticulin, and any cytogenetic abnormalities in the bone marrow and the corresponding 95% exact confidence interval will be provided by treatment cohort. Logistical regression may be used to investigate 
the association of bone marrow abnormality and potential predictive factors.

determine eligibility; this can be either a bone marrow biopsy within 1 year prior to 
planned first dose of romiplostim (with available bone marrow tissue block or a 
minimum of 5 unstained, evaluable histological slides to send to a central laboratory) 
or a pre -treatment bone marrow biop sy and aspirate within 3 weeks prior to planned 
first dose of romiplostim.  Central laboratory evaluation is required prior to the first dose of romiplostim.  A further bone marrow biopsy  and aspirate  is required at Year 
1 or Year 2, depending on the cohort in which the subject is enrolled (as designated by IVRS).  Additional bone marrow biopsies and aspirates may be performed if 
clinically indicated at the discretion of the investigator and/or Amgen.  
b  End of Treatment (EOT):  Subjects who are non -respon ders and withdraw from the 
study will require a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate at the EOT visit.  A bone 
marrow biopsy and aspirate should be obtained for discontinued subjects who have not yet had a cohort- defined bone marrow biopsy performed.  
c   End of Study (EOS):  EOS will be delayed for subjects who are withdrawn from the 
study due to the presence of collagen, or subjects who have a change to grade 3 reticulin, per central laboratory evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy.  These subjects will complete a n EOS visit 12 weeks after discontinuation of romiplostim and will 
require a repeat bone marrow biopsy.

7.1.4 Bone 
Marrow Biopsy  
 Not applicable  Bone Marrow Biopsy  
For the protocol supplement, a baseline bone marrow biopsy and aspirate is required to determine eligibility; central laboratory evaluation is required prior to first dose of romiplostim .  A baseline bone marrow biopsy can be either a bone marrow biopsy within 
1 year prior to the planned first dose of romiplostim (with available bone marrow tissue block or a minimum of 5 unstained, evaluable histological slides to send to a central 
labora tory) or a pre -treatment bone marrow biopsy and aspirate within 3 weeks prior to 
planned first dose of romiplostim.  
A repeat bone marrow biopsy and aspirate is required at Year 1 or Year 2 ( ± 4 week 
window) depending on the cohort assignment. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate 
should be obtained for discontinued subjects who have not yet had a cohort -defined 
bone marrow biopsy performed.  
Should collagen be detected in any subjects during the course of the study, study drug will be discontinued and the subject will undergo an EOT visit.  A repeat bone marrow 
biopsy  will be required 12 weeks later at the EOS visit (+ 2 week window) for subjects 
who are withdrawn from the study due to the presence of collagen.  
Subjects who have a change to grade 3 reticulin, per central laboratory evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy, will undergo a repeat bone marrow biopsy 12 weeks after their last dose of romiplostim at the EOS visit (+ 2 week window).   
Subjects who are considered non -responders and will be discontinued from the study 
will require a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate sample to be taken at the EOT visit (+ 2 week window).  A repeat bone marrow biopsy will also be required 12 weeks later at 
EOS visit (+ 2 week window) for non -responders who have a change to grade 3  reticulin 
or collagen, per central laboratory evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy.  
Bone marrow biopsies  and aspirates where applicable, will be sent to a central 
laboratory for reticulin and collagen staining and analysis.  Refer to Central Laboratory Manu al for instructions on collection, preparation, storage, and shipment of samples. 
The modified Bauermeister Scale (Bauermeister, 1971)  will be used for this study.  
Subjects with a reticulin grade of 0, 1, 2, or 3 will be eligible for this study.

Sample Size Considerations  Not applicable  A sample size of at least 60 subjects was selected for subject s undergoing bone marrow 
evaluations.  The sample size was chosen to provide an assessment/estimation of the 
development of bone marrow abnormalities  (eg, collagen as evidenced by trichrome 
staining ) at Year 1 or Year 2 after romiplostim exposure using the  modified Bauermeister 
grading scale.  
With 30 subjects in each cohort, the number of evaluable bone marrow results in each cohort is expected to be between 20 and 25.   The assumption of 20 to 25 evaluable subjects is based on the approximate 30% rate of r epeat inevaluable or missing bone 
marrow samples observed in the current Amgen adult ITP bone marrow study with romiplostim (Study 20080009).  The 95% exact confidence intervals for outcomes of bone marrow abnormalities when there are 20 and 25 evaluable bone marrow results are described in Table 4.   
No historical data are available regarding the change in bone marrow morphology in this patient population.  Clinical data from adult ITP subjects receiving romiplostim demonstrated that increases in bone marrow reticulin (or the presence of reticulin on study) were observed in 3.7% (10 of 271 of subjects: romiplostim 120 -day safety update 
dataset used).  However the potential incidence rate could be higher or lower given that bone marrow assessments were not s ystematically performed on all subjects during 
clinical studies.

 Interim analyses will be conducted to support regulatory filings, and accumulated data for this study will be summarized to provide ongoing assessments of the safety of romipl ostim.  These 
interim analyses will occur at least annually until the end of the study.  
A Bone Marrow Panel comprised of experts in the treatment of ITP and interpreting bone marrow pathology will convene approximately one time per cohort when all bone marrow biopsy samples have been evaluated for each respective cohort.  The Bone 
Marrow Panel will independently review the central lab bone marrow results and report those results to Amgen once each respective cohort has completed.  The bone marrow panel is n ot chartered to make recommendations to study conduct.  
A report will be generated including details of study compliance, the number of samples submitted and bone marrow biopsy results.  Additional data may be summarized at 
intervals throughout the duration  of the study.  These data may be provided for 
regulatory or publication activities .

The number and percentage of subjects who develop collagen as evidenced by trichrome staining at Year 1 or Year 2, will be summarized by study cohort,  splenectomy 
status at baseline, years since diagnosis (
≤ 3 vs > 3 years), age at enrollment ( ≥ 1 year to 
< 6 years; 6 years to <12 years; 12 years to < 18 years) and maximum doses and drug exposures if appropriate.  In addition, logistic regression may be used to investigate the association of bone marrow abnormality and potential predictive facto rs. 
The number and percentage of subjects with collagen as evidenced by trichrome staining 12 weeks after romiplostim discontinuation among subjects who developed collagen will be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with bone marrow reticulin  increases by ≥ 2 
severity grades or any increase to grade 4  (ie, grade 0 to 2 -4, 1 to 3- 4, 2 to 4), or change 
to grade 3 to 4 over baseline as evidenced by reticulin silver staining at Year 1 or Year 2, post romiplostim exposure using the modified Bauerme ister grading scale will be 
summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with improvement of reticulin to a grade of ≤ 2 
for subjects who developed grade 3 reticulin after initial exposure to romiplostim as measured by the modified Bauermeister gradi ng scale will be summarized.

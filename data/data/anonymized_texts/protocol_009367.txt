Confidential and Propri etary 6 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018PROTOCOL SUMMARY
On 05 Jul 2018, Celgene informed all study sites that further development of CC-122 in Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) will be discontinued after completion of the current Phase 1 Dose 
Escalation Phase. Enrollment into the Phase 2 Dose Expansion Phase will not proceed forward 
as originally planned. The decision was not ba sed on adverse safety findings, and no new safety 
signals for CC-122 have been identified.  Subjects already enrolled and who are receiving 
clinical benefit in the opinion of the treating inves tigator may continue to receive study treatment 
up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122 irrespective of treatment arm.  Protocol Amendment 7 
is issued to provide further guidance regarding study procedures for the remaining patients on 
study treatment, study closure, and long-term follow-up.
Study Title
Phase 1/2 Study to Determine the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Single Agent 
CC-122 and the Combinations of CC-122 and Ibrutinib and CC-122 and Obinutuzumab in 
Subjects with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
Objectives
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into  Phase 1 has been discontinued. Subjects 
already enrolled who are receiving clinical bene fit in the opinion of the treating investigator may 
continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122.
Primary Objectives
!Determine the safety of single agent CC-122 in subjects with relapsed/refractory 
(R/R) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL)
!Determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of CC-122 and 
ibrutinib and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination in 
ibrutinib naïve CLL/SLL subjects
!Determine the safety and tolerabilit y of the combination of CC-122 and 
obinutuzumab and determine the RP2D of the combination in subjects with R/R
CLL/SLL
Secondary Objectives
!Characterize CC-122 pharmacokinetics (PK) in subjects with CLL and assess 
potential drug-drug interactions when CC-122 is given in combination with ibrutinib  
or obinutuzumab
!Determine ibrutinib plasma concentrations when given alone or in combination with CC-122
!Determine the preliminary efficacy of single agent CC-122, the combination of 
CC-122 and ibrutinib, and the combination of CC-122 and obinutuzumab

Study Design
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into 
Phase 1 has been discontinued. Phase 2 will 
not proceed.  
CC-122-CLL-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose finding study to determine the 
safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 administered orally to subjects with CLL/SLL.
The following will be evaluated:
!Arm A:  CC-122 single agent
!Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
!Arm C:   CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab
The Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) will be comprised of an intrasub ject dose escalation cohort 
for single agent CC-122 (Arm A) in paralle l with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the 
combinations of CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B) and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C) 
evaluated using a 3 + 3 design to determine the not tolerated dose (NTD) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Up to approximately 20 subjects will be evaluated in the intrasubject dose escalation cohort in 
Arm A and three to six subjects will be evaluated in each fixed-dose cohort in Arms B and C; 
therefore, approximately 68 (46-92) subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in Phase 1.  The final 
number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested and the number of dose 
limiting toxicities (DLTs) obs erved within each cohort. 
For Arm A, subjects will receive a starting dos e of 1.0 mg, and may dose escalate every 2 weeks 
in 0.5 mg increments, based on subject tolerability at the discretion of the investigator.  For Arms B and C, a safety review committee (SRC) whose members include the sponsor’s medical monitor, drug safety physician, and a subset of investigators, will determine a preliminary RP2D 
for each combination treatment arm based on an integrated assessment of the safety, available 
PK and pharmacodynamic data, and preliminary efficacy information.  For the fixed-dose cohorts, the SRC will make the recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the 
incremental increase in dose (ie, 0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety data of the current dose 
cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT evaluation period).  The 1.0 mg increment is allowed only after the first two dose cohorts of 0.5 and 1.0 mg have been 
completed.
After completion of the fixed-dose cohorts in Arms B and C, the SRC will make the 
determination whether to evaluate an additional intrasubject dose escalation cohort per each 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018combination treatment arm.  The starting dose will be determined by the SRC, with intrasubject 
dose escalation up to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg.
If in the event higher doses of CC-122 are shown to be safe in other hematologic malignancies in ongoing CC-122 studies, the maximum dose of 4.0 mg may be increased after approval by the SRC.
Once the RP2D is established for Arms B and C, an expansion cohort per arm may be opened in 
the Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2) to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and/or CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab:
Arm B (CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib) (N = 50):
!Expansion Cohort 1:  Subjects who are ibrutinib-naïve and have high-risk CLL
(see Section 7.2)
oTreatment-naïve (TN) CLL (N = 10) 
oR/R CLL (N = 40)
Arm C (CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab) (N = 40):
!Expansion Cohort 2:  CLL subjects who are B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor 
(BCR PI) or venetoclax failures (see Section 7.2)
In total, approximately 90 subjects are anticipated to enroll in the Dose Expansion Phase.
All active subjects who are receiving clinical bene fit in the opinion of the treating investigator 
may continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122, or un til 
disease progression (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, 
whichever is earlier.  Subjects who achieve minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (in both 
peripheral blood and bone marrow) lasting for a minimum of 3 months in duration have the 
option to discontinue study treatment; study treatment in these subjects may be resumed at the 
time of MRD positivity (Section 4.1for additional details).
Study Population
The study population consists of Dose Escalatio n Phase (Phase 1) subjects who were enrolled 
under previous amendments and were ongoing during Amendment 6, dated 06 Jun 2017. As of 
05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued and Phase 2 will not 
proceed.  
Eligible subjects include those with CLL/SLL requiring treatment as defined by the modified 
International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) Guidelines for the 
Diagnosis and Treatment of CLL  
For Arms A and C, subjects must have received at least one prior treatment which must include 
chemoimmunotherapy or an approved Bruton’s tyro sine kinase (BTK) inhibitor unless co-
morbidity or contraindication precludes such a therapy.  
For Arm B, subjects must not have received prior i brutinib treatment (ie, ibrutinib naïve) or any 
BTK inhibitor.  During the Expansion Phase, s ubjects must also possess high-risk features.  
Please refer to Section 7.2for additional details regarding st udy population for each treatment
arm.

Confidential and Propri etary 9 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Length of Study
The study is expected to last approximately 5 years and will consist of three phases: Screening, 
Treatment, and Follow-up.  
During the Screening Phase, lasting up to 28 days from the time of signing informed consent to 
first dose administered, subjects will undergo assessments to determine their eligibility.  
Subjects who qualify for enrollment into the study w ill enter the Treatment Phase, during which 
subjects will receive investigational product(s) [IP(s)] at a predetermined dose and schedule until 
the underlying CLL/SLL has progressed or the subject has discontinued IP treatment for 
unacceptable toxicity or other reasons.  
Subjects enrolled as of 05 Jul 2018 who are receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the 
treating investigator may continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of 
CC-122 irrespective of treatment arm.The Follow-up Phase will begin at study treatment discontinuation.  Subjects will have a visit at 
the end of treatment as soon as possible once IP has been discontinued and at 28 days after the 
last dose of IP.  All subjects discontinued for any reason other than progressive disease, 
withdrawal of consent, or death, will be contacted every 90 days following the date of the 28-day follow-up visit for information regarding the status of their disease and for the type and start date 
for any subsequent anticancer therapy.  Effica cy assessments (including clinical, laboratory tests, 
and CT scans as indicated in the Tables of Events, Table 3 through Table 5 ) will continue until 
documented PD or initiation of subsequent anti-CLL therapy.
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary, and/or exploratory analysis, as  pre-specified in the protocol and/or the 
statist ical analysis plan ( SAP), whichever is the later date.

4.1. Study Design
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued.  Phase 2 will 
not proceed.  
CC-122-CLL-001 is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose finding study to determine the 
safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of CC-122 administered orally to subjects with CLL/SLL.  The following will be evaluated:
!Arm A:  CC-122 single agent
!Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
!Arm C:   CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab  
The Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1) will be comprised of an intrasub ject dose escalation cohort 
for single agent CC-122 (Arm A) in parallel with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the 
combinations of CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B) and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C) 
evaluated using a 3 + 3 design to determine the NTD and MTD.  
Up to approximately 20 subjects will be evaluated in the intrasubject dose escalation cohort in 
Arm A and three to six subjects will be evaluated in each fixed-dose cohort in Arms B and C; 
therefore, approximately 68 (46-92) subjects are anticipated to be enrolled in Phase 1.  The final number of subjects will depend on the number of dose levels tested and the number of DLTs
observed within each cohort. 
For Arm A, subjects will receive a starting dos e of 1.0 mg, and may dose escalate every 2 weeks 
in 0.5 mg increments, based on subject tolerability at the discretion of the investigator.  For Arms 
B and C, an SRC whose members include the sponsor’s medical monitor, drug safety physician, 
and a subset of investigators, will determine a preliminary RP2D for each combination treatment arm based on an integrated assessment of the safety, available PK and pharmacodynamic data, 
and preliminary efficacy information. For the fixed-dose cohorts, the SRC will make the 
recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the incremental increase in dose(ie, 0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment 
and completion of the DLT evaluation period).  The 1.0 mg increment is allowed only after the 
first two dose cohorts of 0.5 and 1.0 mg have been completed. 
After completion of the fixed-dose cohorts in Arms B and C, the SRC will make the 
determination whether to evaluate an addi tional intrasubject dose escalation cohort per each 
combination treatment arm. The starting dose will be determined by the SRC, with intrasubject 
dose escalation up to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg.
If in the event higher doses of CC-122 are shown to be safe in other hematologic malignancies in 
ongoing CC-122 studies, the maximum dose of 4.0 mg may be increased after approval by the SRC.
Once the RP2D is established for Arms B and C, an  expansion cohort per arm may be opened in 
the Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2) to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-122 in 
combination with ibrutinib and/or CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab:

Arm C (CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab) (N = 40):
!Expansion Cohort 2:  CLL subjects who are BCR PI or venetoclax failures (see Section 7.2)
In total, approximately 90 subjects are anticipated to enroll in the Dose Expansion Phase.
All active subjects who are receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the treating investigator 
may continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122, or until PD,
unacceptable toxicity or discontinuation for any ot her reason, whichever is earlier. Subjects who 
achieve MRD negativity (in both peripheral blood and bone marrow) lasting for a minimum of 3 months in duration have the option to discontinue study treatment, with subsequent MRD tests 
follow-up (in peripheral blood and/or bone marrow) every 3 cycles for the first year, and every 6 
cycles thereafter.  Study treatment in these subjects may be resumed at the time of MRD 
positivity (either in peripheral blood or bone marrow).
Dose Escalation Phase:
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued.
The Dose Escalation Phase will be comprised of an intrasubject dose escalation cohort for single 
agent CC-122 (Arm A) in parallel with ascending fixed-dose cohorts of the combinations of 
CC-122 and ibrutinib (Arm B), and CC-122 and obinutuzumab (Arm C), evaluated using a 3 + 3 design:
Arm A (CC-122 single agent):
An intrasubject dose escalation cohort of CC-122 starting at the 1.0 mg dose level up to a 
maximum of 4.0 mg will be evaluated.  
In the event higher doses of CC-122 are shown to be safe in other hematologic malignancies in 
ongoing CC-122 studies, the maximum dose of 4.0 mg may be increased after approval by the SRC.
Each subject will be permitted to dose escalate by 0.5 mg increments every 2 weeks based on 
investigator assessment of the individual subject ’s tolerability (ie, escalation to the next dose 
level requires no DLT or dose reduction at the c urrent dose level in a ddition to meeting the 
criteria outlined in Section 8.2.8 ).  
However, dose escalation per cycle is not mandatory  if the subject is be nefiting (ie, objective 
evidence of disease response based on absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] reduction or shrinkage 
in measurable lesions required) from their current dose in the absence of significant toxicities.
Subjects who are enrolled to fixed dose cohorts (0.25 mg or 0.5 mg) in Arm A under earlier protocol amendments (ie, protocol amendment 3 or 4) will be allowed to undertake intrasubject 
dose escalations as described above.
EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 40 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Subjects in Arm A will have the option to receiv e the addition of ibrutinib or obinutuzumab if 
there is evidence of PD while on CC-122 monotherapy after the completion of the DLT 
evaluation and CC-122 in combination with these standard agents has been demonstrated to be 
safe in the context of this trial.  These subjects will receive a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122
(including prior CC-122 monotherapy). The dose of CC-122 may need  to be decreased to the 
level that has been shown to be safe in Arms B or C per the SRC (ie, < 2 DLTs/6 subjects).  Subsequent intrasubject escalation is allowed if higher doses of CC-122 have been deemed tolerable in Arms B or C.  This option will als o apply to subjects that have enrolled in Arm A 
prior to IRB/EC approval of Amendment 5 after discussion with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.
CC-122 will be administered starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 on a 5/7-day schedule (5 continuous days 
out of 7 days per week) up to a maximum of 24 cycles, or until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever is earlier. Each cycle 
consists of 28 days.
Subjects will be observed for early DLTs in Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation peri od). Monit oring for 
late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during
Cycles 2 through 6. 
Arm B (CC-122 + ibrutinib):
The following arm will be evaluated in parallel to Arm A:Ascending fixed-dose cohorts of CC-122 starting at 0.5 mg up to a maximum of 4.0 mg or NTD, 
whichever occurs first, in comb ination with ibrutinib  will be evaluated.  After completion of the 
0.5 and 1.0 mg fixed-dose cohorts, subsequent c ohorts will be allowed to escalate in either 0.5 
mg or 1.0 mg increments.  Escalation to the next dose level requires 0/3 or ≤1/6 DLTs at the 
current dose level. Further, an escalation increment of 1.0 mg requires the absence of any Grade 
3 drug related non-hematologic AEs, any Grade 4 hematological event, and TLS or TFR of any 
grade at the current dose level.  The SRC will make the recommendation of whether to open the next dose cohort and the incremental increase in dose (0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review of the safety 
data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT evaluation
period).  
CC-122 will be initiated on Cycle 2 Day 1 and admin istered on a 5/7-day schedule.  Ibrutinib 
will be administered QD starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 (see Section 8.2for Treatment Description, 
Administration and Schedule).  CC-122 and ibrutinib will be administered up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122, or un til 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation fo r any other reason, whichever is 
earlier.  In the event CC-122 is discontinued prior to ibrutinib or if patients have surpassed the 24 
cycles of CC-122, Celgene will continue to provi de an additional 3 cycles of ibrutinib from the 
investigational supply to allow time for patients to be switched to commercially available ibrutinib and/or other therapies at the discretion of the treating physician.  Subjects will be observed for early DLTs for 28 days following the initiation of CC-122 combination therapy 
(Cycle 2 Days 1 through 28) (DLT evaluation period).  Monitoring for late toxicities 
necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during the first 6 cycles of combination treatment.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 41 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Arm C (CC-122 + obinutuzumab):
The following arm will be evaluated in parallel to Arms A and B:
Ascending fixed-doses cohorts of CC-122 starting at 0.5 mg up to a maximum of 4.0 mg or 
NTD, whichever occurs first, in combination with obinutuzumab will be evaluated.  After completion of the 0.5 and 1.0 mg fixed-dose cohorts, subsequent cohorts will be allowed to 
escalate in either 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg increments.  Es calation to the next dose level requires 0/3 or 
≤1/6 DLTs at the current dose level. Further, an escalation in crement of 1.0 mg requires the 
absence of any Grade 3 drug related non-hematologic AEs, any Grade 4 hematological event, and TLS or TFR of any grade at the current dose level.  The SRC will make the recommendation 
of whether to open the next dose cohort and th e incremental increase (0.5 or 1.0 mg) after review 
of the safety data of the current dose cohort (after full enrollment and completion of the DLT 
evaluation period).
CC-122 will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 9 and adminis tered on a 5/7-day schedule.  For subjects 
on Arm C, Cycle 1 only will consist of 29 days to accommodate the 5/7-day schedule;  
subsequent cycles will consist of 28 days.  Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously on 
Cycle 1 Days 1, 2, 8, and 15 (see Section 8.2for Treatment Description, Administration and 
Schedule).  The dose of obinutuzumab on Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1 may be adjusted per 
institutional practice provided t he combined dose equals 1000 mg. Obinutuzumab will be 
administered on Day 1 every cycle thereafter up to Cycle 6.
CC-122 will be administered up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122, or until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason, whichever is earlier.  
In the event CC-122 is discontinued prior to obi nutuzumab, Celgene will continue to supply the 
protocol-specified total of 6 cycles of obinutuzumab.  In addition, for patients that have 
surpassed the 24 cycles of CC-122, Celgene will continue to provide an additional 3 cycles of 
CC-122 to allow t ime for patients to be switched to commercially available therapies at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
Subjects will be observed for early DLTs for 28 days following initiation of CC-122 combination 
therapy (Cycle 1 Day 9 through Cycle 2 Day 8) (DLT evaluation period).  Monitoring for late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations will be conducted during Cycles 2 
through 6.
Early DLT Evaluation of Intrasubject Dose Escalation Cohort in Arm A:
Up to approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled to Arm A to assess an intrasubject dose 
escalation schedule for CC-122.  
If > 20% (eg, > 4 of 20) of subjects meet the criteria for DLT within 28 days of initial escalation 
to a dose level, no further intrasubject dose escalation to that dose level will be permitted.
Early DLT Evaluation for Fixed-Dose Cohorts in Arms B and C:
An initial 3 subjects will be enrolled to each of the fixed-dose escalation cohorts in Arms B and
C.  A dose level will be considered tolerable if 0 of 3 treated subjects experiences a DLT during 
the DLT evaluation period of each respective group.  If 1 of 3 subjects experiences a DLT, 3 
additional subjects will be enro lled to that dose level.  A dose w ill be considered the NTD when 
≥2 out of 6 evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT.  If DLTs are observed in ≥2 out of 
EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 42 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 20186 evaluable subjects at the first dose level, a lower dose combination may be explored after 
review of safety data by the SRC (see Section 8.2.1 ).
After full enrollment and completion of the D LT evaluation period of each dose level, the 
number and type of DLTs and AEs occurring during the DLT evaluation period will be evaluated.  A dose level will be considered tolerated after discussion of these data by the SRC.  
Subsequent dose cohorts will only be authorized to open for enrollment following a consensus by 
the SRC.  Subjects enrolled in lower CC-122 fixed-dose cohorts will be allowed to escalate immediately to the next higher CC-122 dose le vel upon SRC a pproval of the subsequent CC-122 
dose.  For example, if the SRC has declared the 1.0 mg dose level tolerable and confirmed the opening of the 1.5 or 2.0 mg dose level, the subjects in the lower combination, ie, 0.5 mg CC-122 dose level may escalate to 1.0 mg. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level below the 
NTD with 0 or 1 of 6 DLT evaluable subjects experiencing a DLT during the specified DLT evaluation period.  If only 3 subjects have been enrolled at the last dose level below the NTD, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled.  A dose le vel will be declared the MTD when at least 6 
subjects have been enrolled and < 2 subjects have experienced a DLT at that dose level.
An intermediate dose (ie, one between the NTD and the last dose level before the NTD) or 
additional subjects within any dose cohort may be  added to determine the MTD and RP2D more 
precisely.
Monitoring for Late Toxicities During the Dose Escalation Phase:
Continuous safety monitoring will continue for all cohorts for late toxicities necessitating dose 
reduction or discontinuation.  If at any time during the first 6 cycles of CC-122 treatment > 20% 
of subjects experience a late toxicity necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation that is clearly not related to disease progressi on, medical proce dure, or interc urrent illness, the dose 
level will have been considered to exceed the MTD and the RP2D will be selected at a lower dose level.  The SRC will be responsible for moni toring these late toxicities and will make the 
determination that the limit of 20% has been exceeded.
Determination of RP2D:
The SRC will identify a preliminary RP2D for Arms B and C based on an integrated assessment 
of the safety, available PK and pharmacodynamic data, and preliminary efficacy 
information.CC-122 data available from other clinical studies will also be considered by SRC.  
The RP2D selected will not exceed the MTD from the dose escalation cohorts.  
Expansion Phase:
As of 05 Jul 2018, Phase 2 will not proceed.
An expansion cohort may be e nrolled at each RP 2D for Arms B and C for a total of up to 2
expansion cohorts.  
During the Expansion Phase of the study, the SRC will continue to review safety data regularly 
and make recommendations about the study con tinuation as appropriate.  The SRC will monitor 
for early DLTs (first cycle of CC-122 dosing during CC-122 combination therapy) and will 
monitor for late toxicities necessitating dose reductions or discontinuations that are clearly not 
related to disease progre ssion, med ical procedure, or intercurrent illness th rough completion of
the first 6 cycles of CC-122 treatmen t in the expansion cohorts.  If at any time the early DLT rate 
exceeds 20% or the late toxicity rate exceeds 33%, enrollment to that expansion cohort will be

that cohort at a lower dose level that has been shown to be tolerated during the dose escalation 
portion of the study.
The expansion cohorts will be conducted with  a futility inter im analysis for each cohort as 
outlined in Section 10.3.1.
Follow-up Phase:
The Follow-up Phase will begin at study treatment discontinuation.  Subjects will have a visit at 
the end of treatment as soon as possible once IP has been discontinued and at 28 days after the 
last dose of IP.  All subjects discontinued for any reason other than progressive disease, withdrawal of consent, or death, will be contacted every 90 days following the date of the 28-day follow-up visit for information regarding the status of their disease and for the type and start date 
for any subsequent anticancer therapy.  Thes e contacts will typically be via telephone and will 
not require site visits.  Contact will continue until the subject experiences disease progression, 
starts a new anti-CLL therapy, withdraws consent for further follow-up, or expires.
Efficacy assessments (including clinical, laboratory tests, and CT scans as indicated in the Tables 
of Events, Table 3 through Table 5 ) will continue until documented PD or initiation of 
subsequent anti-CLL therapy.

During the Screening Phase, lasting up to 28 days from the time of signing informed consent to 
first dose administered, subjects will undergo assessments to determine their eligibility.  
Subjects who qualify for enrollment into the study w ill enter the Treatment  Phase, during which 
subjects will receive IP at a predetermined dose and schedule until the underlying CLL has
progressed or the subject has discontinued IP treatment for unacceptable toxicity or other reasons.  
Subjects enro lled as of  05 Jul 2018 and who are receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the 
treating investigator may continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of 
CC-122 irrespective of treatment arm.
The Follow-up Phase will begin at study treatment discontinuation.  
4.3. End of Trial
The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for 
primary, secondary and/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol and/or the SAP, 
whichever is the later date.

Confidential and Propri etary 60 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 20186. PROCEDURES
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued, and Phase 2 
will not proceed. Subjects already enrolled who are receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of 
the treating investigator may continue to receiv e study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles 
of CC-122.
The screening period begins on the date the Informed Consent Document (ICD) is signed and 
will last for up to 28 days.  The ICD must be obtained prior to beginning any assessments solely 
for the purpose of this study.  Standard of care assessments performed prior to signing the ICD(as described in the protocol) may be used for this study, assuming they meet the protocol 
requirements and following discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor.  Recording of 
AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) will begin once the sub ject has signed the ICD.  All prior 
anticancer treatments (eg, chemotherapy, surgeries) and medical history, including approximate 
dates of treatment or diagnosis, must be recorded during screening. 
All study-required procedures should be performed as outlined in Table 3 through Table 5 , 
depending on the arm to which the subject is assigned:
Table Arm
Table 3 Arm A:  CC-122 single agent with intrasubject dose escalation
Table 4 Arm B:  CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib
Table 5 Arm C:  CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab
As of Protocol Amendment 7, some clinic visits and assessments may be omitted as noted in
Table 3 through Table 5 , and in Section 6.6 below.
Excursions from the timing of assessments will be considered protocol deviations and should be recorded in the source document along with the reason for the excursion. 
All scheduled laboratory assessments are to be performed at the designated central laboratory.
However, local laboratories may be used for the biweekly assessments (Days 8 and 22) during 
the third cycle of CC-122 dosing, and for decisio ns affecting treatment and dose modifications.  
For subjects on Arm A who dose escalate every 2 weeks, local laboratories may be used however 
the designated central laboratory is recommended.  
All laboratory values should be carefully monitored, especially following the initial treatment, 
throughout the first two cycles and for dose escalations of CC-122.  Serum creatinine and 
creatinine clearance, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium labs should be monitored 
closely on Days 1, 2, 4, and 8 during the first cycle of CC-122 (ie, Cycle 1 in Arms A and C) and (Cycle 2 in Arm B)  and unscheduled 
assessments performed as needed.
6.1. Safety Assessments
Study safety evaluations will occur in accordance with Table 3 through Table 5 , and should be 
performed in accordance with this section of the protocol.  The safety of CC-122 single agent 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 61 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018and CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib a nd in combination with obinutuzumab will be 
assessed using AEs, physical examinations (PEs), concomitant medications and procedures, 
clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electro cardiograms (ECGs), and an echocardiogram/multi-
gated acquisition scan (MUGA).
Detailed procedures for obtaining each assessment are provided below.  
6.1.1. Demographics / Medical History / Baseline Stage and Prognostic Classification
Demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and date of birth), medical history, and the Cumulative 
Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) Score ( Appendix G ) will be documented by a qualified clinician at 
the time of the Screening visit.  The medical history will be general enough to document common comorbid conditions as well as specif ic enough to reveal any conditions listed as 
participation exclusion criteria, and will documen t whether the identified conditions are active or 
inactive at the time of enrollment.  The CIRS score will be collected to assess the performance status and fitness of subjects.  
6.1.1.1. Prognostic Classification
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia-specific internati onal prognostic classificat ion reflecting the 
subject’s status at the time of enrollment will be documented 
 
 
 
 
 
6.1.2. Adverse EventsAll subjects will be evaluated for AEs during all scheduled visits starting at the signing of the 
ICD until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 62 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 20186.1.3. Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements will be obt ained at each visit as indicated in Table 3 through Table 5 .  
These assessments include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, body 
temperature and body weight.  Measurements of height will be recorded only at the Screening 
visit.
Vital signs should be measured after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes.  Vital sign 
measurements should be repeated for confirmation if clinically significant observations or changes from baseline occur.  All confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements must 
be recorded as an AE.
After the first 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ 2 adverse events related to
CC-122, and as clinically indicated, some clinic visits and assessments may become less frequent 
as detailed in Section 6.6.
6.1.4. Physical Examination
Complete PEs, including evaluation of lymph nodes, spleen and liver will be performed during 
Screening, on Cycle 1 Day 1 and will continue to be performed on Day 1 of each subsequent 
treatment cycle under Protocol Amendment 7 as part of the assessment for response (in the 
absence of imaging), at the EOT visit and at 28 days after the last IP discontinuation.  
Measurements of lymph nodes and documentation of any enlargement of the spleen and/or liver 
should be recorded in the source document and eCRF.
Symptom driven limited PEs will be performed as clinically indicated at any study visit.
6.1.5. Cardiac Laboratory Testing
Subjects will undergo laboratory monitoring of plasma troponin-T and B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) to evaluate for potential early evidence of cardiac toxicity.  Testing will be performed at 
Screening, weekly during the first cycle of CC-122 treatment and for the first cycle of each dose 
escalation (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22), Day 1 of each s ubsequent cycle, and at the EOT visit.  A 
significant elevation of troponin-T is defined as a value greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the assay with associated elevation of BNP or other significant cardiac symptoms or findings.  A significant elevation of BNP is defined as a ≥20% increase over baseline with an 
absolute value > 100 pg/mL.  Subjects who are found at Screening to have baseline troponin-T > ULN or BNP > 100 pg/mL must have a baseline evaluation by a cardiologist during screening to optimize cardioprotective therapy.
After the first 12 cycles of CC-122, in the absence of Grade ≥ 2 adverse events related to
CC-122, and as clinically indicated, some clinic visits and assessments may become less frequent 
as detailed in Section 6.6.
6.1.6. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
Triplicate or single standard 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at the visits listed in Table 3 through 
Table 5 .  The 12-lead ECGs (12-lead at 25 mm/sec reporting rhythm, ventricular rate,

Subsequent ophthalmologic examinations will be pe rformed as clinically indicated.  If there are 
any clinically significant findings, a full ophthalmologic exam will be conducted by a qualified ophthalmologist. 
6.1.13. Contraceptive and Risk Counseling
Subjects will be counseled about appropriate contraception during Screening.  Complete 
abstinence or double contraceptive methods (one of which must be a barrier method) for females 
(eg, oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptive; intra-uterine device; barrier 
contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner) must be used from the time ICF is signed, throughout the study and for 28 days after the last dose of CC-122.  A single 
contraceptive method for males (complete abstin ence or a condom) must be used from the time 
the ICF is signed, throughout the study, and for 3 months after the last dose of CC-122.  Counseling should be documented in source documents.
The CC-122 Pregnancy Risk Minimization Plan for Celgene Clinical Trials ( Appendix F ) applies 
to all subjects receiving CC-122 therapy and will be given to sites as a separate document. 
CC-122 will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare professional (including but not limited 
to nurses, pharmacists and physicians). These healthcare professionals will be trained by 
Celgene, or designee, in requirements  specific to counseling of subjects.  
Once trained, these healthcare staff will counsel subjects prior to the administration of CC-122 to 
ensure that the subject has complied with all requirements including use of birth control and that 
the subject understands the risks associated with CC-122.  This step will be documented with a completed Education and Counseling Guidance Document, and CC-122 will not be administered 
until this step occurs.  
A CC-122 Information Sheet will be provided to each subject before IP is dispensed.  Females of childbearing potential and males, other than the subject, should not handle or 
administer CC-122 unless they are wearing gloves. 
Arm C:  Females of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during 
obinutuzumab treatment and for 18 months following obinutuzumab therapy ( GAZYVA , 
GAZYVARO ).
Arm B:  Females of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while taking 
ibrutinib because ibrutinib can cause fetal harm ( IMBRUVICA ).
6.1.14. Pregnancy Test
A female of child bearing potential (FCBP) is defined as a sexually mature woman who has: 
1. Not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, and 
2. Not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule 
out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018The investigator will classify a female subject as a FCBP according to this definition.  Pregnancy 
testing is not required for non-FCBP subjects but justification must be recorded in the eCRF and 
the source document.  Pregnancy testing will be conducted by the local laboratory.
For a FCBP, pregnancy testing will be conducted at the visits listed in Table 3 through Table 5 :
!A serum pregnancy test with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL is to be obtained at 
Screening.  
!A serum or urine pregnancy test (based on investigator’s discretion and minimum test 
sensitivity [25 mIU/mL]) s hould be done weekly for the first cycle, within 72 hours 
prior to Day 1 of every cycle (with the ex ception of the first day of CC-122 dosing on 
which it must be performed within 24 hours of first dose), EOT visit and 28 days post IP discontinuation.  
!The subject may not receive IP until the investigator has verified the Screening pregnancy tests to be negative.
!A FCBP must avoid activities that could lead to conception for 28 days after the last dose of CC-122 or a male subject whose partner is an FCBP must avoid activities that 
could lead to conception for 3 months after the last dose of CC-122.
!Please refer to the ibrutinib and the obinutuzumab  PI(s) or SmPC(s) for additional recommendations.
Note: FCBP receiving CC-122 will undergo pregnancy testing according to the schedule 
described in the CC-122 Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan (PPRMP) and CC-122 Informatio n Sheet.
Results for pregnancy tests will be recorded in the source document and eCRF.  
6.2. Efficacy Assessments
6.2.1. Efficacy Parameters
The following efficacy assessments will be performed at scheduled intervals throughout the 
study as described in Table 3 through Table 5.
6.2.2. Tumor Imaging Assessment
Tumor imaging assessment by CT scan is mandatory at Screening (neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis), and after the first 6 cycles of CC-122 dosing [the 2ndscan is mandatory only for the 
affected regions with abnormal findings at baseline; Week 25 (for subjects on Arms A and C) or 
Week 29 (for subjects on Arm B), +4 weeks/-1 week], and is recommended if the subject 
discontinues study treatment due to an advers e event (if the subject shows signs of preliminary 
efficacy).  Additional CT scan(s) is allowed if clinically indicated until documented disease 
progression or initiation of subsequent CLL therapy.  The unscheduled CT scan(s) should be 
documented in the CRF.  A CT scan with contrast is the recommended imaging modality.  MRI may be used only if CT with contrast is medically contraindicated or if the frequency of CT 
scans exceeds local standards.  Standard of care CT scans or MRI performed up to 56 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be acceptable for Screening, even if performed prior to signing the ICD.  All imaging assessments will be evaluated by a reader at the local institution.

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are optional for all subjects at Screening.  A bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy must be collected for all subj ects at the time of the CR/CRi confirmation visit 
within 12 weeks after clinical, imaging, and laboratory response criteria have been met.
6.2.4. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Assessment
Peripheral blood for MRD assessment s hould be collected during Screening, every 6 cycles (only 
if subject is receiving CC-122, up to a maximum of 24 cycles), and at the time of CR/CRi 
confirmation visit (within 12 weeks after clinical and laboratory response criteria have been 
met).  For those subjects found to be MRD pos itive in the peripheral blood at the CR/CRi 
confirmation visit, a peripheral blood sample for MRD assessment should be collected 
approximately every 6 cycles thereafter until MRD negativity is achieved or relapse/progression 
is documented. Peripheral blood for MRD assessment s hould also be collected at the time of PR 
(within 12 weeks after clinical, imaging, and laboratory response criteria have been met).  A 
bone marrow aspirate for MRD assessment should be collected at the time of CR/CRi 
confirmation visit and once MRD-negativity is achieved in peripheral blood unless MRD negativity in bone marrow was documented earlier.  Peripheral bl ood for MRD assessment 
should also be collected at the time of relapse/progression in subjects who previously achieved MRD negativity in peripheral blood.
MRD analyses will be performed by a central laboratory.

6.2.7. Efficacy Response Assessment
Response assessment for CLL will be com
pleted according to the updated IWCLL guidelines for 
the diagnosis and treatment of CLL as described in Appendix A with modifications.  Subjects 
with SLL will be assessed according to the lymphoma guidelines as described in Appendix B .  
Lymph node responses will be assessed separately and independently of increases in blood 
lymphocyte counts.  
Efficacy response according to the respective criteria for CLL/SLL will be formally assessed at 
the same schedule as CT scans and at the End of Treatment visit.  In addition, efficacy 
assessment should also be performed every 3 cycles (+4 weeks/-1 week) during the first two 
years and every 6 cycles (+4 weeks/-1 week) thereafter at the time of physical examinations until documented progression or initiation of subsequent  CLL therapy.  CR/CRi confirmation by bone 
marrow examination must be completed within 12 weeks after clinical criteria have been met.

8.1. Description of Investigational Products
8.1.1. CC-122
Celgene Corporation will supply CC-122 in appropr iate strengths.  The active pharmaceutical 
ingredient in capsules (AIC) was employed from the beginning of the current study 
(non-formulated, white opaque gelatin capsules). There are no other excipients in the capsules. 
During the course of the current study, a new formulation, Formulation 6 [F6] of CC-122 is 
being developed at various strengths (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg, 4.0 mg) to be made available over the course of the study. The F6 formulations have different 
CC-122 base free amounts compared to the CC-122 AIC that was employed from the beginning of the current study. CC-122 AIC 0.5, 1, and 3 mg strengths were based on CC-122 HCl and are equivalent to 0.44, 0.88, and 2.64 mg CC-122 base  free, respectivel y. CC-122 formulated 
capsules of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 mg strengths are based on CC-122 base free and are equivalent to 0.56, 1.13, 1.69, 2.25, 2.81, 3.38 , 3.95 and 4.51 mg CC-122 HCl, respectively.
Study CC-122-CP-002 Part 2 was an open-label, randomized, three-period, six-sequence, 
three-way single-dose crossover study in healthy adult sub jects to evaluate the PK of CC-122 
after administration of formulated (test formulations: Formulation 4 [F4] and F6) and AIC 
CC-122 capsules.
Following a single oral administration of CC-122 at the dose level of 3 mg from reference AIC 
formulation and formulated capsule F-6 formu lation in healthy adult subjects (N=18), the total 
plasma exposures (AUC
inf) is 16.29% higher and the peak plasma exposure (C max) is 35.58% 
higher from the F-6 formulation as compared to  that from the reference AIC formulation. The 
CC-122 F-6 formulation has been selected for further development ( Data on File, 2015 ).
For subjects on Arm A, subjects who start with AIC will continue to receive AIC; subjects who 
start with F6 will continue to receive F6 for all dose levels.
For subjects on Arms B and C, F6 will be introduced in the 1.0 mg cohorts after the 0.5 mg AIC 
fixed-dose cohort has been completed, and will continue to receive F6 thereafter. The 0.5 mg 
fixed dose cohorts will use AIC.  Any subjects requiring doses of 0.25 mg or lower due to dose 
reductions will use AIC.
The formulated capsules will be provided in reddish brown gelatin capsules and contain the 
following excipients: Avicel PH 102, spray dried ma nnitol, crospovidone, areosil, and stearic 
acid.
Celgene will continue to provide up to 24 cycles of CC-122 for ongoing patients experiencing 
clinical benefit.  
Please refer to the CC-122 IB and pharmacy manual for detailed information concerning the 
physical properties of CC-122.
The IP will be labeled per local regulations. Store as directed on package label.

stored in a refrigerator at 2oC to 8oC (36oF to 46oF) for up to 24 hours prior to use. 
Subjects will be premedicated prior to each infusion as described in Section 9.3.3 .  
Obinutuzumab will only be administered as a slow IV infusion through a dedicated line and 
never as an IV push or bolus. Infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate. Do 
not use an additional in-line filter because of  the potential for adsorption. Infusion rates are 
outlined in Table 10.
After the end of the first infusion, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in place 
for ≥ 2 hours to be able to administer IV treatments for infusion reactions if necessary. For 
subsequent infusions during Cycle 1, the IV line or central venous catheter should remain in 
place for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. For Cycles 2 and later, subjects who 
tolerate the infusion well without infusion reactions can have the IV line removed or the central 
venous catheter de-accessed immediately after the end of each infusion.

treatments and remain on study with th e other treatment in compliance with all study 
requirements if in the judgment of the investigator the subject will derive benefit from continued 
study treatment. Sub jects who achieve MRD negativity (in both peripheral blood and bone 
marrow) lasting for a minimum of 3 months in duration have the option to discontinue study treatment; study treatment in th ese subjects may be resumed at the time of MRD positivity (see 
Section 4.1).
8.2.4. Definition of Stopping Criteria for Expansion Cohort
If at any time the early DLT rate (first 28 days of CC-122 dosing during CC-122 combination 
therapy) exceeds 20% or the late toxicity rate (AEs id entified during the first 6 cycles of CC-122 
dosing necessitating dose reduction or discontinuation that are clearly not related to disease 
progression, medical procedure, or intercurrent illness) exceeds 33%, enrollment to that 
expansion cohort will be suspended pending evaluation of the safety by the SRC.  The SRC may 
reopen enrollment into that cohort at a lower dose level that has shown to be tolerated during the dose escalation portion of the study.
In addition, an interim analysis will be performed for each expansion cohort as outlined in 
Section 10.3.1 .  If criteria as specified are not met at the time of interim analysis, enrollment to 
that cohort will be stopped.
8.2.5. Definition of Not Tolerated Dose (NTD)
A dose level will be considered NTD when ≥2 out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects in a fixed-dose 
cohort experience an IP-related DLT.

The MTD is defined as the last dose level below the NTD with ≤1 out of 6 DLT evaluable 
subjects experiencing DLT during the DLT evaluation period.
8.2.7. Definition of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)
National Cancer Institute CTCAE Version 4.03 are used as a guide for the grading of severity of 
adverse events (except as otherwise specified).  Dose- limiting toxicities are described below:
!A non-hematologic AE that is clearly not related to disease progression, medical procedure or intercurrent illness and that commences within 28 days of first CC-122 
dose and is ≥ Grade 3 EXCEPT for:
∀Alopecia
∀Grade 3 rash of the acneiform or maculopapular type of not more than 4 days 
durations (with optimal medical management)
∀Grade 3 diarrhea or vomiting lasting less than 72 hours (with optimal medical management)

!AST/ALT is < 3x ULN and total bilirubin is < 1.5x ULN 
!Subject does not meet any other criteria for dose reduction or modification
During the every 2 week dose escalation visit, th e following safety assessments will include but 
are not limited to: 
!Hematology
!Chemistry
!Vital signs
!Tumor Flare and Tumor Lysis Monitoring
!Adverse Event and Concomitant Medication Reporting 
!CC-122 Contraceptive and Risk Counseling and Education (requirement at each  CC-122 dispensation visit)
8.2.9. Dose Interruptions/Modifications
Dose modifications are permitted in any cycle, including Cycle 1 and the DLT evaluation period:
!Dose reductions that occur during the D LT evaluation period will constitute a DLT, 
but subjects will be allowed to continue on IP at a reduced dose.  
!Dose reductions are allowed for CC-122 and ibrutinib.  No dose reduction is allowed 
for obinutuzumab, but treatment may be discontinued at the discretion of the 
investigator for severe in fusion or allergic reactions. 
8.2.9.1. General Dose Modification Guidelines
Subjects will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity, with the exception of tumor flare (NCI CTCAE version 3.0), 
 and laboratory abnormalities  as reco mmended by the IWCLL
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  as 
listed below:

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 91 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Subjects experiencing related AEs or SAEs ≥ Grade 3 must interrupt dosing of the responsible IP 
or both IPs until resolution of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline seve rity unless as otherwise 
indicated in Table 14. If IP-related events do not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline severity within 
28 days despite adequate medical management, th e sponsor’s study medical monitor should be 
notified.  
The dose of CC-122 may be reduced successively by one level from the starting dose.  There will 
be no more than one dose level reduction from one cycle to the next unless otherwise permitted 
after consultation with the s ponsor medical monitor.  In additi on, if a subject continues to 
experience unacceptable toxicity after two dose reductions (with the exception of CC-122 per 
Table 15 where up to 3 dose reductions may be allowed for selected doses), IP w ill be 
discontinued permanently.  If a dose is reduced for toxicity other than a Grade 4 non-hematological toxicity, re-escalation is permitted after the toxicity is resolved.  If the toxicity recurs after re-escalation, the subject should remain at the lower dose level.  Subjects who 
experience a Grade 4 non-hematological toxici ty may not have their dose re-escalated.
For the combination of CC-122 and ibrutinib or obinutuzumab, in the event of a toxicity 
requiring dose modification, CC-122 should be considered for interruption and dose reduction 
first if possible.  If the subject continues to require dose modification after a dose hold and/or reduction of CC-122 a dose interruption of obinutuzumab or ibrutinib or reduction of ibrutinib may be considered.
Dose interruptions lasting beyond 28 days should be discussed with the sponsor’s study medical 
monitor.

Confidential and Propri etary 92 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018If it becomes necessary to permanently stop administration of one of the IPs, continuation on the 
other IP will require discussion and agreement between the sponsor’s st udy medical monitor and 
the investigator.
8.2.9.2. Dose Modification Guidelines 
Any IP-related toxicity meeting the definition of DLT will require dose reduction or interruption.  
The criteria for dose reduction are listed in Table 14, should be used for dose modifications.  
Chronic Grade 2 toxicity (other than specified b elow) may warrant dose reduction or interruption
of one or both IP.  Such cases should be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor before 
changes are made.  
Dose modification decisions for patients with cytopenia (below the lower limit of the normal 
range) at baseline will be based on the IWCLL guideline ( Table 13). For patients with a normal
neutrophil count, platelet count and/or hemoglobin value at baseline, the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) w ill be used.
Any dose modifications must be recorded on the respective Study Drug Record eCRF.

8.2.9.2.3.
Cardiac Laboratory Abnormalities
In addition to routine ECG monitoring in all treatment arms, additional monitoring for potential 
cardiac toxicity is included for subjects treated with CC-122.  This in cludes routine monitoring 
of troponin-T and BNP as well as more intensive monitoring of ECGs and LVEF as described in 
Section 6.  Elevations of troponin-T or BNP warrant further investigation including assessment 
of the subject for signs and symptoms of cardiac injury, consideration of a cardiology 
consultation, other cardiac evaluations (such as an exercise stress test, additional evaluation of 
LVEF, or other cardiac tests recommended by a cardiologist), and the addition of cardioprotective therapy (eg, beta blockers) as appropriate.  Laboratory evaluation to assess for 
assay interference may also be warranted.  Isolated asymptomatic elevations of troponin-T or 
BNP without associated ECG or LVEF changes or other cardiac findings do not require that

Confidential and Propri etary 100 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018CC-122 dose be held.  For any elevation of troponi n-T > ULN associated with either significant 
elevation of BNP (20% increase from baseline with an absolute value > 100 pg/mL) or 
associated cardiac symptoms or findings, CC-122 dosing should be held and the sponsor should 
be notified.  Additional cardiac monitori ng should be performed as described in Table 14 and as 
medically indicated. CC-122 may be restarted at th e same dose or a reduced dose, in consultation 
with the sponsor, based on troponin-T/BNP guidelines in Table 14 and general guidelines 
provided in Section 6. 
8.2.9.2.4. Pneumonitis
Pneumonitis has been observed in patients taking CC-122. The diagnosis should be considered in 
subjects presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, pleural 
effusion, cough, dy spnea, or interstitial pulmonary infiltr ates, and in whom infectious, neoplastic 
and other causes are excluded by appropriate investigations. Subjects should be specificallyadvised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms they experience. 
Those with radiological features suggestive of non-infectious pneumonitis but with minimal
(Grade 1) symptoms may continue CC-122 wi thout dose alteration. For drug-related Grade 2 
pneumonitis, CC-122 treatment should be interrupted  and corticosteroids may be indicated. Once 
symptoms have resolved completely, CC-122 may be reintroduced at the next lower dose level. 
For drug-related Grade 3 or 4 pneumonitis CC- 122 must be permanently discontinued and 
corticosteroids are recommended until clinical symptoms have resolved.
 
 
8.2.10. Management of Select AEs While Receiving Obinutuzumab
8.2.10.1. Infusion-Related Reactions (IRRs)
Two-thirds of patients experienced IRRs with the first infusion of obinutuzumab; reactions can 
also occur with subsequent infusions, but the frequency is lower ( GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ).
Infusion reactions typically occur within 24 hours of receiving obinutuzumab. Symptoms may 
include anaphylaxis, acute life-threatening respiratory symptoms, hypotension, tachycardia, 
dyspnea, bronchospasms, larynx and throat irritation, wheezing, and laryngeal edema. Additional 
potential symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, flushing, skin rash, 
urticaria, headache, pyrexia, and chills.
To minimize the potential for these reactions, premedication is administered as described in 
Section 9.3.3 . Full emergency resuscitatio n facilities should be immediately available in the 
event of a severe and life-threatening infus ion reaction and subjects should be under close 
supervision of the investigator or appropriately trained staff during the infusions. Medical 

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 101 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018management of infusion reactions should be instituted according to standard medical pract ice 
using glucocorticoids, epinephrine, oxygen, intravenous fluids and other medications as 
medically indicated.  Subsequent infusions  should be administered with appropriate 
premedications as in Section 9.3.3 .
Subjects with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary c onditions should be monitored more frequently 
throughout the infusion and after the infusion. Hypotension may occur and investigators should 
consider withholding antihypertensive agents (for subjects not at risk for hypertensive crisis) for 12 hours prior to, during the infusion, and for 1 hour after the infusion until blood pressure is 
stable. 
8.2.10.2. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
John Cunningham (JC) virus infection resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML), which can be fatal, has been observed in patients treated with obinutuzumab. Subjects 
with new onset or changes to pre-existing neur ologic manifestations shoul d be evaluated for 
PML. The symptoms of PML are unspecific and can vary depending on the affected region of 
the brain. Motor symptoms with corticospinal tract findings (eg, mu scular weakness, paralysis, 
and sensory disturbances), sensory abnormalities, cer ebellar symptoms, and visual field defects 
are common. Some signs/symptoms regarded as “cortical” (eg, aphasia or visual-spatial disorientation) may occur. Evaluation  of PML includes, but is not limited to, consultation with a 
neurologist, brain MRI, and lumbar puncture  
Obinutuzumab and CC-122 should be discontinued in subjects who develop PML. 
The subject should be referred to a neurologist for the evaluation and treatment of PML.
8.2.10.3. Neutropenia, Thrombocytopenia, and Anemia
 
  
 
Severe and life-threatening thrombocytopenia,  including acute thrombocytopenia (occurring 
within 24 hours after the infusion), has been observed during treatment with obinutuzumab. Fatal 
hemorrhagic events have also been reported in Cycle 1 in patients treated with obinutuzumab(GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ). A clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic 
events has not been established. Subjects should be closely monitored for thrombocytopenia, especially during the first cycle. Regular laborat ory tests should be performed until the event 
resolves, and dose delays should be considered in case of severe or life-threatening 
thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of blood products (ie, platelet transfusion) according to 
institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician. Use of all concomitant therapies, which could possibly worsen thrombocytopenia-related events such as platelet 
inhibitors and anticoagulants, s hould also be taken into consideration, especially during the first 
cycle. 
Hematopoietic growth fact ors or other hematologic support, such  as erythropoiet in, darbepoetin, 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF), RBC- or platelet- transfusions are allowed in the study with therapeutic intent.

Confidential and Propri etary 102 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Therapeutic use of G-CSF is allowed at an y time for subjects experiencing Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia or any grade febrile neutropenia.  Prophylactic use of granulocyte (or granulocyte-
macrophage) growth factors is not allowed during Cycle 1.
8.2.10.4. Gastrointestinal (GI) Perforation
Cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in patients receiving obinutuzumab 
(GAZYVA , GAZYVARO ) mainly in NHL. Monitor patients with GI involvement for GI 
perforation.
8.2.11. Management of Select AEs While Receiving Ibrutinib
Fatal bleeding events have occurred in  patients treated with ibrutinib ( IMBRUVICA ). Grade 3 or 
higher bleeding events (subdural hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post 
procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of patients. Bleeding events of any grade, 
including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients treated with IMBRUVICA .  The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.  IMBRUVICA
may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies. 
Consider the benefit-risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre and post-
surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding.
Inform subjects of the possibility of bleeding, and re port any signs or symptoms (bl ood in stools 
or urine, prolonged or uncontrolled bleeding). Inform the subject that IMBRUVICA may need to 
be interrupted for medical or dental procedures. Subjects should be closely monit ored for hemorrhagic events. Regular laboratory tests should be 
performed until the event resolves, and dose delays should be considered in the event of ≥Grade 
2 hemorrhage ( Table 14). Transfusion of blood products (ie, RBC- or pl atelet- transfusions) 
according to institutional practice is at the discretion of the treating physician.
For any subjects receiving ibrutinib (Arm B), major hemorrhages as defined in Section 11.1 are 
considered adverse events of special interest and must be reported on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form using the “Important Medical Event” as the seriousness criteria and sent via email 
or fax to Celgene and/or designee, within 24 hours of awareness (see Section 11.5.1 ).
8.2.11.1. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
Cases of ILD have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor patients for 
pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. Shoul d symptoms develop, follow the protocol dose 
modification guidelines as outlined in Table 16 .
8.2.12. Dose Reduction Steps
If a subject develops toxicity, the dose of CC-122 may be reduced as outlined in Table 15 and
ibrutinib as outlined in Table 16.
8.2.12.1. CC-122 Dose Reduction StepsRecommendations for dose reduction steps for CC-122 are presented in Table 15.  Up to 3 dose 
reductions will be permitted for patients who receive an init ial starting dose of 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg or 
4.0 mg, provided data from the fixed-dose cohorts during the escalation phase demonstrates that

8.2.12.3. Dose Modification Guidelines for ObinutuzumabThere is no allowable dose reduction schedule for obinutuzumab.  In the event of toxicities or 
adverse events, dose modification should be based on Section 8.2.9.1.
8.2.13. Overdose
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to CC-122, ibrutinib and obinutuzumab dosing 
only.  
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified 
dose of CC-122 or ibrutinib assigned to a given subject, regardless of any associated adverse 
events or sequelae.  
!PO any amount over the protocol-specified dose
!IV 10% over the protocol-specified dose
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the 
protocol required schedule or frequency.  
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is define d as any rate faster than the protocol-specified 
rate.

Confidential and Propri etary 104 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the 
overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case report form.  See 
Section 11for the reporting of AEs associated with overdose.  
8.3. Method of Treatment Assignment
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into Phase 1 has been discontinued.
Assignment of subjects to Arms A, B, or C will be based on current open dose levels, investigator choice, and available slots.
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to track subject assignments to the 
treatment arms and dose levels.
8.4. Packaging and Labeling
The label(s) for IP will include sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or re gulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local 
regulations.
8.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal
The investigator(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of IP received and comparing it with the accompanying IP shipping order form.  The investigator(s) will verify the 
accuracy of the information on the form to register the IP received at the site and retain a copy of the form in the study f ile.
At the study site, all investigational IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.  The IP should be stored as directed on the package label.
Celgene (or designee) will review with the inve stigator and relevant site personnel the process 
for Investigational Product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the 
site versus Celgene (or designee).
8.6. Investigational Product Compliance
Subjects will return all IP at the Day 1 scheduled visit of each cycle to assess treatment 
compliance.  Subjects must miss no more th an 5 scheduled doses of IP during the DLT 
evaluation period (eg, forget to take or lose their IP; or if discontinued early due to progressive 
disease) to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the missed doses were due to IP-related AE(s), in which case they remain evaluable for DLT.  During subsequent cycles, a subject will 
be considered compliant with each IP and overall if the IPs taken are ≥80% to ≤120% of the 
assigned dosage.  IP accountability will be evaluated on Day 1 of each cycle; full and/or partial 
bottles may be re-dispensed once IP accountability has been performed.

10.1. Overview
The primary objectives of this Phase 1/2 Study are to determine the safety of single agent 
CC-122 and the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of CC-122 when administered in combination 
with ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab to subj ects with CLL/SLL.  The secondary 
objectives are to evaluate the PK profiles of subjects administered CC-122  in combination with 
ibrutinib and in combination with obinutuzumab , to determine ibrutinib concentrations when 
given alone and in combination with CC-122, and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 
at selected dose levels/regimens.
As of 05 Jul 2018, enrollment of new subjects into  Phase 1 has been discontinued. Subjects 
already enrolled who are receiving clinical benefit in the opinion of the treating investigator may 
continue to receive study treatment up to a maximum of 24 cycles of CC-122.
In the following, statist ical analyses w ill be performed by study arm, dose level and visit cycle as 
needed or applicable.
10.2. Study Population Definitions
For the purpose of statistical analysis and data prese ntation, the study populatio ns are defined as 
follows:
!Safety Population – all sub jects who take at least one dose of IP.
!Dose-Limiting T oxicity Evaluable Population –
∀Arm A:  all subjects who completed at least one cycle of treatment and did not 
miss more than 5 days of CC-122 dosing during the first cycle are to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the missed doses were due to IP related 
AE(s) or the cycle was not completed due to a DLT, in which case they remain 
evaluable for DLT.
∀Arm B:  all subjects who completed at leas t one cycle of CC-122 (Cycle 2 Day 1 
through Cycle 2 Day 28) and did not miss m ore than 5 days of CC-122 treatment 
are to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the missed doses were due to IP related AE(s) or the cycle was not completed due to a DLT, in which case they 
remain evaluable for DLT.
∀Arm C:  all subjects who completed at leas t one cycle of CC-122 (Cycle 1 Day 9 
through Cycle 2 Day 8) and did not miss more than 5 days of CC-122 treatment 
are to be considered evaluable for DLT, unless the missed doses were due to IP related AE(s) or the cycle was not completed due to a DLT, in which case they 
remain evaluable for DLT.
!Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population – all sub jects who complete at least one cycle of 
their assigned treatment regimen, and have a baseline and at least one post-baseline 
efficacy assessment.
!Pharmacokinetic Population – all subjects who have at least 1 measurable CC-122 
and/or ibrutinib concentration datum.

Confidential and Propri etary 110 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 201810.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
During the Dose Escalation Phase of the study, an intrasubject dose escalation schedule and
standard “3 + 3” dose escalation design will be used to identify initial toxicities and safety of 
single agent CC-122 and to determine the MTD of the combination treatments.  The final 
number of subjects needed in the Dose Escalation Phase depends on number of DLTs observed within each cohort.  Non-DLT evaluable subjects withdrawn prior to completion of the DLT 
evaluation period due to reasons other than DLT will be replaced.  After the MTD and 
preliminary RP2D have been determined for CC-122 in combination with ibrutinib and CC-122 in combination with obinutuzumab, 2 additiona l cohorts may be enrolled to further evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of the combination therapy in specific subject populations at the preliminary RP2D in the Expansion Phase.  
10.3.1. Expansion Cohorts
As of 05 Jul 2018, Phase 2 will not proceed.The sample size of 50 subjects/cohort for Expansion Cohort 1 and 40 subjects/cohort for 
Expansion Cohort 2 are not based on formal statistical calculation to have adequate power for 
hypothesis testing.  Rather it is to provide additi onal efficacy and safety  information beyond the 
limited number of subjects in th e Dose Escalation Phase. To re duce the risk that subjects 
exposure to less efficient IP, a fu tility interim analysis w ill be conducted for each expansion 
cohort.
Estimates of expected response rate were calculated for each patient population to be evaluated 
in the expansion cohorts based on currently available published data, when available:
!Arm B, Expansion Cohort 1, will evaluate  subjects with high risk CLL (n=10 for TN 
CLL, n=40 for R/R CLL). A design with fu tility interim will be app lied to both TN 
(n=10) and R/R CLL cohorts (n=40).  An estimated ORR of 97% (including both PR and PRL) and CR of 12% is projected for single agent ibrutinib in TN CLL with 17p-
/TP53 mutation ( Farooqui, 2015).  An estimated ORR of 60% is projected based on
single agent ibrutinib data in R/R high risk CLL.  Four studies with ibrutinib in 17p-
/TP53 mutation positive R/R CLL reported response rates ranging from 40% to 71% 
(Pollyea, 2014; IMBRUVICA ; Preetesh, 2015; Farooqui, 2015 ).  The total number of 
responders was divided by the total number of subjects from the four studies to 
estimate an ORR of 60%  for this cohort.
!Arm C, Expansion Cohort 2, will evaluate patients who are resistant to or intolerant 
of prior ibrutinib/idelalisib/venetoclax or alternate BTK or PI3K inhibitors.  Limited 
data is available on the response of patients post-treatment failure with ibrutinib and 
idelalisib. One st udy reported 25% to 76% response rates with kinase inhibitors 
(idelalisib or ibrutinib if not previously experienced) or non-kinase inhibitors (anti-CD20 antibody, chemotherapy, BCL-2 inhibitor, etc) in patients who were resistant or 
intolerant of idelalisib or ibrutinib ( Mato, 2015), therefore an ORR of 50% is 
projected for this cohort.
Based on the above assumptions, a design with a futility interim analysis w ill be applied in the 
expansion cohorts: 
EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 111 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018!Arm B, TN CLL cohort: Considering 97% of TN CLL patients are expected to have a 
response with monotherapy ibrutinib, the stopping rule will be based on either 
excessive toxicity or lack of efficacy. Specifically, the enrollment to the TN CLL 
cohort will be stopped if  ≥ 2 DLTs are observed among the first ≤ 6 patients or if < 5 
responses (CR, PR/PRL) are observed among the first 6 efficacy evaluable subjects.
!Arm B, Expansion Cohort 1, the hypotheses for the true ORR to be tested are p ≤ 0.5
versus p ≥ 0.7. An interim analysis for futility purpose will be conducted on the first
16 efficacy evaluable subjects. If there are at least 10 responders, the cohort will be 
completed to include a total of 40 subjects . The probability of early termination of the 
study at the interim analysis is not less than 0.77 if the true ORR rate is 0.5 or less. If 
the true ORR is 0.7 or greater and there are at least 10 responders at the fut ility 
interim, the expected lower boundary of exact 95% confidence interval is larger than 0.5.
!Arm C, Expansion Cohort 2, the hypotheses for the true ORR to be tested are p ≤ 0.4 
versus p ≥ 0.6. A fut ility interim analysis w ill be conducted when there are 17 
subjects that are efficacy evaluable. If there are at least 9 responders, the trial will be 
completed to include a total of 40 subjects. The probability of early termination of the 
study at the interim analysis is not less than 0.80 if the true ORR rate is 0.4 or less. If the true ORR is 0.6 or greater and there are at least 9 responders at the fut ility interim, 
the expected lower boundary of exact 95% confidence interval is larger than 0.4.
10.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics, while gender, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabulations.  Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by SOC and 
preferred term (PT).
10.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, discontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
10.6. Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy evaluable subjects will be included for efficacy analysis.
Response, including evaluation of MRD, will be  assessed by IWCLL guidelines for diagnosis 
and treatment of CLL with modifications. The 
response rate based on the best response during the treatment period and t he relative proportions 
in each response category will be examined. Distributions of the responses into the response 
categories (CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PRL, SD, PD) will be provided for each arm and dose level. 
Response at selected time points (eg, end of Cycle 3, end of Cycle 6, end of Cycle 12, end of 
treatment) may also be provided for each arm a nd dose level. Overall response rate (CR + CRi +
PR + nPR + PRL [PRL is applicable to Arm B only] ) and MRD negativity rate together with

Confidential and Propri etary 112 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018confidence intervals will be provided for each treatment arm and dose level. For subjects having 
brief signs of progression while off CC-122, or combination of this with ibrutinib or 
obinutuzumab, which resolves with reinitiation of therapy, this will not be considered 
progression.
Duration of response is defined as the time from first PRL [applicable to Arm B only], nPR, PR, 
CRi, or CR to PD.  Duration of response will be  censored at the last date that the patient was 
known to be progression-free for: 1) patients who have not progressed at the time of analysis; 2) 
patients who have withdrawn consent or ar e lost to follow-up prior to documentation of 
progression. Duration of response will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median duration of response along with two-sided confidence interval will be provided for eachtreatment arm and dose level.
Progression-free survival is calculated as the time from first IP dose to the first documented 
progression or death due to any cause during or after the treatment period, whichever occurs first. Median PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimates and the 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) will be computed by the method of Klein and Moeschberger w i t h
log-log transformation with each treatment arm and dose level. 
10.7. Safety Analysis
All subjects who receive at least one dose of any assigned IP will be included in the safety analyses. Adverse events, vital sign measurements, physical exam findings, clinical laboratory 
information, ECG interpretations, LVEF assessments, pregnancy tests for FCBP, concomitant medications and procedures will be tabulated  and summarized by study phase, treatment arm, 
and dose level, as appropriate. 
In the Dose Escalation Phase, during the 28 days following initiation of CC-122, DLTs and all 
available safety information will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the investigators and 
sponsor and summarized at the conclusion of each dose level for each treatment arm.  Treatment 
arms will be evaluated independently.  After completion of each dosing cohort the SRC will review the summarized data to determine the next step.  Dose- limiting toxicity occ urrence will 
be summarized by treatment arm and dose level as appropriate.
Adverse events observed will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). The severity or intensit y of adverse events will be  graded according to the 
CTCAE version 4.03 unless otherwise specified.
The frequency of AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA SOC and PT. In the by-subject analysis, a 
subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once. Adverse events leading 
to discontinuation from treatment, events classified as CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, IP-related 
events, and serious AEs will be tabulated and listed separately. By-subject listings of all AEs, serious AEs, and their attributes will be provided.
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized. Laboratory data will be graded according to 
CTCAE version 4.03 criteria for select analytes unless otherwise specified. The frequencies of the worst severity grade observed during treatment will be displayed in cross-tabulations by 
screening status.

The PK population includes all subjects who have at least 1 measurable CC-122 and/or ibrutinib 
plasma concentration datum. The evaluable subjects in the PK population will be included in the 
PK data analysis.
Noncompartmental analysis will be performed on the drug concentration data for subjects with 
intensive PK sampling. Pharmacokinetic parameters include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
Cmax Peak (maximum) drug plasma concentration

11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any conc omitant impairment of the subject’s h ealth, including 
laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria in Section 8.2.9 ), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be cons idered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF (see Section 8.2.13 for the definition of overdose). Any sequela 
of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE eCRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be 
identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and eCRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary.  There is no known specific antidote for CC-122, 
obinutuzumab, or ibrutinib overdose.  Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameter s:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by the investigator from the time the subject signs i nformed consent 
until 28 days after the last dose of IP and those SAEs made known to the investigator at any time 
thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP.  Adverse Events and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) will be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF and in the subject’s source documents.  All
SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by facsimile, or other appropri ate met hod, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.  
Additionally, for any subject receiving obinutuzumab, the site will simultaneously send the SAE 
Report Form to Celgene and Hoffmann-La Roche within the same timeframe and method.
11.1.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of safety 
monitoring activities by the Sponsor.

Confidential and Propri etary 116 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 201811.1.1.1. Major Hemorrhage (Arm B)
For any subjects receiving ibrutinib (Arm B), major hemorrhages as defined below are 
considered adverse events of special interest and must be reported on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form using the “Important Medical Even t” as the seriousness criteria and sent via email 
or fax to Celgene and/or designee, within 24 hours of awareness (see Section 11.5.1 ).
Major hemorrhage is defined as any of the following: 
!Any treatment-emergent hemorrhagic adverse events of Grade 3 or higher* 
!Any treatment-emergent serious adverse events of bleeding of any grade
!Any treatment-emergent central nervous system hemorrhage/hematoma of any grade
*All hemorrhagic events requiring transfusion of red blood cells should be reported as a Grade 3 
or higher AE per CTCAE.
 
 
 
 
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospi talization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 117 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospitalization 
or prolonged hospitalization for a complicatio n of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not asso ciated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication.  However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/d isease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hosp italization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE.
!A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starting of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication re mains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre-existing condition unrelated to the studied indication. 
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the investigator will provide infor mation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event. The severity / intensity of AEs will be gra ded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the CTCAE Version 4.03 with the exception of TFR (NCI 
CTCAE version 3.0),  and laboratory abnormaliti es as recommended by the 
IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CL
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale:

EDMS Doc. Number: 22914699 - 19766462CC-122
Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 118 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may 
be needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or 
hospice care probable
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
The term “severe” is often used to describe th e intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This criterion is notthe same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.  
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a gui de for defining regulatory obligations.
11.2.3. Causality 
The investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IPadministration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP 
and the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassesse d and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event.
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.

The investigator will report the action taken with IP  as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the 
SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE and reported if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the study; or
!requires treatment, modification/ interrup tion of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!considered clinically significant by the inve stigator, regardless of the severity. 
Grade 3/4 laboratory  abnormalities will be reported as adverse events independent of associated 
signs or symptoms, if it requires treatment, modification or interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention, or results in discont inuation from the study. The associated signs and 
symptoms will be considered as additional event terms and graded according to their own 
criteria.
Regardless of severity grade, la boratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to 
be documented as a serious adverse event.  
Note: If a laboratory abnormality is one component  of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  If the 
abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be 
recorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnorm ality s hould be recorded as a medical term 
and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result  (eg, record thrombocytopenia rather than 
decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
The following are considered immediately reportable events:
!Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test 
regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is 
on study drugs, or within at least 28 days of the subject’s last dose of CC-122.

Protocol CC-122-CLL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 120 CC-122-CLL-001 Amendment 7 Final: 27 Jul 2018!Pregnancies of female subjects occurring wh ile the subject is on study drug, or within 
at least 18 months after the subject’s last dose of obinutuzumab.  
IP is to be discontinued immedia tely and the sub ject instructed to return any unused portion of 
the IP to the investigator as applicable.  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celg ene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other 
appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The exposure of any pregnant female (eg, caregiver or pharmacist) to CC-122 is also an 
immediately reportable event.
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
The investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety imme diately about the ou tcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg,  spontaneous abortion), the investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If  the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 28 days that the investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
Additionally, for any subject receiving obinutuzumab, the site will simultaneously send the SAE 
Report Form to Celgene and Hoffmann-La Roc he within the same timeframe and method.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP 
should notify the investigator, and the pregnant  female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, 
or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE reports as well as any follow-up reports.
The investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) that occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs in formed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP) or any 
SAE made known to the investigator at any time thereaf ter that are suspected of being related to 
IP.  Serious AEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.

of hospital records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by local legislation, the investig ator is responsible for informing the Institutional 
Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant 
initial and follow-up information about the event.  The investigator must keep copies of all SAE 
information on file including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
11.5.1. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of safety 
monitoring activities by the Sponsor. 
11.5.1.1. Major Hemorrhage (Arm B)
For any subjects receiving ibrutinib (Arm B), major hemorrhages as defined in Section 11.1.1.1
are considered adverse events of special interest and must be reported on the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form using the “Important Medical Event” as the seriousness criteria and sent via 
email or fax to Celgene and/or designee, within 24 hours of awareness. 
 
 
 
 
 
11.6. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by phone.
11.7. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to CC-122 based on the IB.
In the US, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.

All aspects of the study will be carefully moni tored by Celgene or its authorized representative
for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and standard 
operating procedures.
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Document Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the investigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeting.  Prior to e nrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan.
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via queries by the investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their  proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of th is unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The investigator is required to permit direct acce ss to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/IECs, regulatory au thorities (eg, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The invest igator should make every effort to be available 
for the audits and/or inspections.  If the investigator is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene immediately.

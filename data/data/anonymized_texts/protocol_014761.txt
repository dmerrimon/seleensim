3.5 Protocol Summary  
Study  number : SL75.14  
Title of the study : 
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study of the efficacy and safety  
of STG320 sublingual tablets of house dust mite (HDM) allergen extracts in adults and 
adolescents with HDM -associated allergic rhinitis . 
Study  objectives : 
To assess the efficacy and safety of 12 months of treatment with 300 IR of STG3 20 sublingual 
tablets compared with placebo in adults and adolescents with HDM -associated allergic rhinitis 
(AR).  
Primary objective :  
To evaluate the efficacy of STG320 sublingual tablets at a daily dosage of 300  IR when 
administered for 12 months to adult s and adolescents with HDM -associated AR.  
The primary efficacy variable will be the average Total Combined Score ( TCS), calculated for 
each patient as the average of the non -missing daily T CSs during the primary evaluation period 
(i.e., the last 4 weeks  of treatment). The daily TCS (scale 0 -15) is the sum of the subject’s daily 
Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS , scale 0 -12) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS , 
scale 0 -3). 
Secondary objectives :  
1) To assess the efficacy of STG320 sublingual tablets at the dosage of 300  IR as evaluated  by 
the following secondary efficacy variables during the primary evaluation period : 
• Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) : itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose   
• Rescue Medication Score (RMS)  
• Adjusted Symptom Score (ASS)  
• Combined Symptom and Medication Score ( CSMS)  
• Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS): itchy/red eyes and watery eyes  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score  (RCTSS ): four rhinitis symptom scores and  
two ocular symptom scores  
• Individual Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Scores (RSSs): itchy nose, sneezing, runny 
nose, blocked nose , itchy/red eyes and watery eyes  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication use, overall and by type of treatment  
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 11 of 123 
 
• Overall assessment of allergic rhinitis  symptoms by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
(ranging 0 -100) 
• Proportion of Symptom Controlled Days (PSCD) , Proportion of Not-Controlled Days 
(PNCD) and Controlled Patients (CP)  
• Overall Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Q uality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ (S)≥12) 
and RQLQ (S)≥12 domains  
• Health questionnaire EQ -5D-5L  
• Global Rating of Change Score (GRCS) ( 15-point Likert scale)  
2) Rhinoconjunctivitis symptom evaluation and rescue medication use will also be evaluated 
during the 2 -week secondary evaluation periods  (i.e., assessment to be started 2 weeks  
before  the relevant visit  at month 3, month 6 and month 9 ). The following endpoints will be 
assessed:  
• TCS 
• RTSS  
• RMS  
• ASS 
• CSMS  
• TOSS   
• RCTSS  
• RSSs  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication use, overall and by type of treatment  
• Overall  assessment of allergic rhinitis  symptoms by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  
3) To assess the effect of STG 320 on other variables at the end of the treatment:  
• Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment 
Questions: Allergy Specific (WPAI + CIQ: AS)  
• Immunological markers: D. pte  and D. far-specific serum IgE and IgG 4 
Exploratory objectives : 
• To assess the impact of HDM exposure lev el on the efficacy results  
• To measure the levels of candidate serum and RNA biomarkers bef ore and after study 
treatment to evaluate the correlation between these biomarkers and the clinical response 
to STG320  (serum and RNA banking wherever permitted by local regulations )

Safety objectives : 
To assess the safety of 12 months of treat ment with STG320  at the daily dose of 300  IR. The 
safety assessments include adverse events (AEs), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
(anaphylaxis, severe laryngopharyngeal disorders, autoimmune disorders  and eosinophilic 
esophagitis ), vital signs and routine safety laboratory tests.  
Methodology :  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase III study with two parallel arms 
in patients with house dust mite (HDM) -associated allergic rhinitis (AR).  
The study  consist s of a screening phase  (1 to 6 months) , a treatment phase ( 12 months ) and a 
post-treatment  follow -up phase (2 weeks) .  
Study  Type/Phase : III 
Inclusion Criteria  
The patient must fulfill the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for the study : 
1. Have  house dust mite (HDM) -associated allergic rhinitis (AR) (with or without asthma) 
for at least 1 year  based on the presence of:  
• Symptoms  for 4 or  more consecutive weeks in the previous year and for at least 
4 days per week during those weeks.  
• Symptoms  requiring regular intake of symptomatic treatment(s).  
• Symptoms  evaluated as “troublesome” by the patients or impairing their daily 
activities, leisure or sport, school or work or involving sleep disturbance.  
2. Have given signed informed consent to participate, after having been informed of the 
nature and aims of the study, in accordance with local regulation and requirements.  
3. Male or female outpatients 12  to 65  years of age .  
4. Sensitized to  D. pteronyssinus ( D. pte) and/or  D. farinae ( D. far) defined as skin prick 
test wheal diameter at least 5 mm greater than the negati ve control and HDM -specific

CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES

- Baseline evaluation period: last 4 weeks of the 5 -week run -in period  
- Interim evaluation periods: 2 weeks every 3 months after randomization (i.e., Month 3, 
Month 6 and Month 9 ), 
- Primary evaluation period: 4 weeks prior to the end of the treatment period   
Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Efficacy Variable : Total Combined Score  
The primary efficacy variable will be the average Total Combined Score ( TCS). The average 
TCS is calculated for each patient as the average of the non -missing daily TCSs. 
The daily TCS (scale 0 -15) is the sum of the patient’s  daily Rhinitis Total Symptom Score 
(RTSS , scale 0 -12) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS , scale 0 -3).  
The RTSS is defined as the sum of the four rhinitis symptom scores (i.e., itchy nose, sneezing, 
runny nose, and blocked nose ) evaluated daily by the patient. The pa tient assessment will 
address symptom  intensity o ver the previous 24  hours and will be performed  at the same time 
every morning, using a 4 -point scale (0 = no symptoms; 1 = mild symptoms (symptom clearly 
present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated ), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness 
of symptom  that is bothersome but tolerable ), 3 = severe symptoms (symptom that is hard to 
tolerate; causes interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping).  
If any of the four individual rhinitis symp toms for a given day is missing, then the RTSS for 
that day will be considered missing.  
The RMS is based on the assumptions that a n intranasal corticosteroid  is more effective than 
an antihistamine and an oral corticosteroid is more effective than a n intranasal corticosteroid , 
leading to a derived ordinal scale: 0=absent, 1=oral associated or not with topical ( ocular drops ) 
non-sedative H1 antihistamine (H1A), 2=intranasal corticosteroids (INS) with or without oral 
or topical (ocular drops) H1 antihistamine , 3=oral corticosteroids with or without INS or oral 
or topical (ocular drops) H1 antihistamine .  
If rescue medication data  for a g iven day are missing, then the RM S for that day will be 
considered missing . 
Secondary Variables  
• Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS , scale 0 -12).  
• Rescue Medication Score (RMS , scale 0 -3). 
• Adjusted Symptom Score (ASS, scale 0 -12). This score is derived from the daily RTSSs, 
after adjustment for the patient's rescue medication use.  
• Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS, scale 0 -6). The CSMS is  derived from 
RTSS and RMS .

Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 18 of 123 
 
• Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS, scale 0 -6). The TOSS is calculated as the sum of 
individual scores for itchy/red eyes and watery eyes.   
• Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (RCTSS, scale 0 -18). The RCTSS is calculated 
as the sum of the four rhinitis symptom scores and the two ocular symptom scores . 
• Each of the six individual Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Scores (RSSs , each scored on a 
scale of 0 -3): itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose , itchy/red eyes and watery eyes  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication use, overall and by type of treatment  
• Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) assessing the intensity of the allergic rhinitis  symptoms 
(ranging from 0 = absence of symptoms to 100 = very severe symptoms).  
• Proportion of Symptom -Controlled Days (PSCD) defined for each patient during the 
evaluation  periods as: 
- PSCD 2-0: Proportion of days with RTSS ≤ 2 and no rescue medication used  
• Proportion of Not -Controlled Days (PNCD)  defined for each patient during the evaluation 
periods as the proportion of days with : 
- At least one individual rhinitis symptom score = 2 and RMS>0, or  
- At least two individual rhinitis symptom scores = 2 whatever the RMS, or  
- At least one individual rhinitis symptom score = 3 whatever the RMS  
• Controlled patients (CP ) as follows:  
- CP75 2-0: Patients with at le ast 75% of the days with RTSS  ≤2 and no rescue medication 
used (control led for at least three quarters of the evaluation period s) 
• Overall Standardized Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Qu estionnaire (RQLQ (S)≥12) 
score  and RQLQ (S)≥12 domain scores  
The RQLQ (S)≥12 consists of 28 questions, divided into 7 domains (activities, sleep, non -
nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotions), 
each question being evaluated on a 7 -point Likert scale (lower being better).  
• EQ-5D-5L 
EQ-5D-5L des cribes the patient’s health state using 5 questions and a VAS score.  
• Global Rating of Change Score (GRCS): questionnaire  assessing  treatment efficacy by the 
patient compared to the baseline evaluation period  (15-point Likert scale)  
Other variables  
• Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment 
Questions: Allergy Specific (WPAI + CIQ: AS)  
• Immunological markers: D. pte and D. far-specific  serum  IgE and IgG 4

Safety variables : 
Adverse events, Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) including anaphylaxis, severe 
laryngopharyngeal disorders , autoimmune disorders and eosinophilic esophagitis,  assessment  
of routine laboratory safety tests, physical examinations and vital signs.  
Study Conduct:  
Screening Phase:  
Visit 1 ( Selection Visit ):  
Study patient information and informed consent form signature, demographics/ height/ weight, 
medical history, and prior and concomitant medication use, diagnosis of asthma and its 
treatment, FEV 1 for all patients (i.e., whether asthmatic or not), physical examination and SPT

Sampling for serum and RNA banking wherever permitted by local regulations.  
Visit 2 (Run -in period Visit):  
Patients meeting all the selection criteria will enter a single -blind placebo run -in period of 
5 weeks (including the baseline evaluation period). This 5 -week period is to be selected based 
on the patient’s history of HDM -related rhinitis symptoms and the investigator’s knowledge of 
the pea k season for HDM in the area. During this 5 -week period, patients will take 1  placebo 
tablet sublingually each day. Rescue medications as treatment for symptoms of allergic 
rhinoconjunctivitis will  be provided with instructions fo r their use . Patients will  score  their 
rhinoconjunctivitis  symptoms and rescue medication use in an electronic diary (e -diary) daily 
for 5 weeks.  
Treatment Phase : 
Visit 3 (Randomization  Visit ): 
This Visit is to be performed within the 7 days following the 5 -week run -in period.  Patients 
with an average TCS 5/15 over the baseline evaluation period will be included in the treatment 
phase of the study. FEV 1 will be performed only on asthmatic patients.  The patients will be 
randomized and assigned to one of the two treatment  groups. Patients will be re-supplied  with 
rescue medications as treatment for symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis  if necessary,  and 
reminded of instructions fo r their use . Patients will be asked to complete the RQLQ (S)≥12, EQ-
5D-5L, and WPAI + CIQ:  AS questionnaires prior to the first dose administration. The first 
dose of study treatment will be a dministered in the doctor’s office and the patient will be 
monitored for at least 30  minutes  thereafter .

Dust sampling kit s will be supplied to the patients to collect a dust sample at their residence . 
The dust samples will be  central ly assay ed for HDM load.  
 
During the treatment phase, patients will be scheduled for visits 1 month after randomization 
(Visit 4) and every 3 months thereafter (Visits 5 to 7).  
In order to prevent missing data, patients who discontinued  the treatment before the first interim 
evalu ation period (i.e. , before 3 months of treatment) will be asked to continue the study 
(without study treatment) until Visit 5 ( i.e., until the end of the first interim evaluation period ). 
Patients will be asked  to score their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms a nd rescue medication use 
on the e -diary during the first interim evaluation period .  
Visit 4 (Month 1 ): 
This Visit is to be performed  30 days ± 4 days after Visit 3. Treatment  compliance and adverse 
event occurrence will be evaluated and recorded. Any pote ntial issues or questions will be 
addressed. If necessary, additional training will be provided.   
Visits 5 to 7 (Months 3, 6, and 9) :  
Visits 5, 6 and 7 are to be performed 90 days, 180 days and 270 days ± 7 days after Visit 3,  
respectively.  Patients will be instructed to record their rhinoconjunctivitis  symptoms and rescue 
medication use on the e -diary daily for a period of 2 weeks  befor e each relevant visit scheduled 
after 3, 6 and 9 months of treatment . Patients will also evaluate the overall severity of the rhinitis  
symptoms on the VAS, on a weekly basis.  Visits will be scheduled at the end  of the 2 -week 
evaluation period , or as close as possible  thereafter .  
Visit 8 (Month 11) : 
This Visit is to be performed  323 to 330 days after Visit 3 . For patients who enter the study  in 
late winter or spring  (from February to June), this visit can be anticipated , but should not be 
earlier than  270 days after Visit 3 . Patients will be instructed to start recording their 
rhinoconjunctivitis  symptoms and rescue medication use daily using  the e -diary and continue 
the daily recording for 4 weeks after this visit. This 4 -week period will represent the primary 
evaluation period and should be performed one year later close to  the 4  weeks of the baseline  
evaluation period . Over this 4 -week period, p atients will also evaluate the overall severit y of 
the rhinitis  symptoms on the VAS, on a weekly basis.  
Visit 9 (Month 12) : 
This visit will be held at the end of the treatment period , 360 to 367 days after Visit 3 . For 
patients who enter the study  in late  winter or spring  (from February to June), this visit can be 
anticipated , but should not be earlier than 300  days after Visit 3 . Patients will be questioned 
about any HDM avoidance  measures implemented  since the study start. RQLQ (S)≥12, EQ-5D-

Post-treatment follow -up Phase:  
Visit 10 : 
The p ost-treatment follow -up visit will be held  14 days ± 7 days after Visit 9.  
Adverse events and use of concomitant medications will be recorded at all visits.  
 
In the context of the study, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review 
cumulative safety data to monitor overall study safety.  
Statistical methods :  
Determination of Sample Size  
The primary endpoint is the average TCS defined, for each patient, as the average of the non -
missing daily TCSs over the last four weeks prior to the end of the treatment period.  
As recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), t he clinical relevance of 
the efficacy results on the primary endpoint is pre -defined as follows  [Nelson et al.,2017 ]: 
• The relative difference of the TCS versus  placebo should be ‐15%, and  
• The upper bound of the 95% CI of the TCS relative difference versus  placebo should be 
‐10% 
In the European  study VO57.07 [Bergmann et al., 2014 ] conducted in 509 patients,  the analysis 
of the average TCS showed a placebo mean of 3.65 and a relative mean difference of ‐17% 
between groups with a 95% CI of [ ‐30% ; ‐3%]. The C oefficient of Variation (CV)  was of 67% 
in the placebo group and 77% in the active group.  
Based on this  95% CI (i.e., [‐30% ; ‐3%]) , an expected  relative difference versus  placebo of 
­20% was considered as a possible and reasonable value for the true relative difference between 
both groups . Besides, a  CV of 75% was assumed to account for a possible higher variability of 
the da ta in this international study ( i.e., North America, Europe, Israel and Russia).  
Thus, assuming  a two -sided nominal level of significance of 5%, a relative difference versus 
placebo of ‐20%, a placebo mean of 3.65, and a CV of 75%, simulations were performed based 
on 5,000  samples and show ed that 739 evaluable patients per treatment group  were sufficient 
to achieve a power of around 80% so as to fulfill  both requirements (estimated re lative 
difference versus placebo ≤ ‐15% and upper bound of the 95% C I ≤‐10%).  
Of note, with the same assumptions and  739 evaluable patients per treatment group, the power 
of detecting a significant difference between both groups is greater than 99%.    
Assuming a drop -out rate of 15% during the study, a total of 1,740  rando mized patients 
(870 patients per group ) will be required to ensure that 1,478  patients are included in the 
primary efficacy analysis. The screen failure rate is estimated at 50%, leading to a planned total 
number of screened patients of 3,4 80.

Determination of Study Populations for Analyses  
Analysis Sets  
• Safety Set:  
The Safety Set will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the 
investigational product (IP).  
All safety analyses will use the Safety Set.  
• Full Analysis Set  (FAS):  
In order to be as close as possible to the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) principle, the Full Analysis Set 
will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the IP and have at least 
one primary efficacy evaluation during the treatment p eriod (i.e., at least one day with a valid 
TCS during one of the evaluation periods ). 
The FAS will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy analys es (primary, secondary, 
exploratory and other analyses ). 
• Per Protocol Set (PPS):  
The Per Protocol Set wil l include all patients in the FAS who complied with the study protocol 
without any major protocol deviations and had at least 14 days with a valid TCS during the 
primary evaluation period.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be replicated in the PPS.  
The de finition of protocol deviations (minor or major) will be specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan ( SAP). The classification of the protocol deviations as minor or major will be 
performed during the Data Review Meeting (DRM) before unblinding of the data.   
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis : 
The primary variable , the average TCS,  will be summarized descriptively . The square root of 
the average TCS  will be analyzed in the FAS during the primary evaluation period using an 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatme nt group as main effect and pooled center, the 
square root of the baseline average TCS, age class  (adolescent, adult) , gender, asthma status 
(presence/absence) and sensitization status (mono -/poly -sensitized) as covariates.  
Patients in the FAS having no efficacy evaluation during the primary period (i.e., no valid 
assessment) will not be part of the primary analysis. They will be included in the sensitivity 
analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis with regard  to missing data. Sensitivity 
analyses will include Pattern -Mixture Models (PMMs) with reference -based imputation 
methods, a Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) for the four evaluation periods 
and an analysis of the average TCS during the primary per iod using the Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF) method.

The p rimary efficacy analysis will be repeated in the PPS as a supportive analysis.  
The average TCS will also be analyzed in the FAS during the primary evaluation period using 
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test (non -parametric method). This analysis will be provided as a 
supportive analysis to check the consistency of results.  
A point estimate and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the difference in means between the 
active treatment group and placebo  will be calculated (primary analysis, sensitivity and 
supportive analyses) . These results will also be expressed as relative difference (%) and relevant 
95% CI compared to the placebo group.  
Clinical Relevance of the Efficacy R esults  
As recommended by th e US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), t he clinical relevance of 
the results on the primary endpoint is pre -defined as follows  [Nelson et al.,2017 ]: 
• The relative difference of the TCS versus placebo should be -15%, and  
• The upper bound of the 95% confid ence interval of the TCS relative difference versus 
placebo should be -10% 
Based on historical data obtained with STG320 in study VO57.07 [Bergmann et al.,2014 ], it is 
expected that the baseline average Total Combined Score (TCS) will be close to 7. Thus, a 
clinically meaningful effect of 15% in a given patient with an initial TCS of 7 would correspond 
to an impr ovement of about 1 point (15% of 7 is 1.08). More specifically, this threshold may 
be illustrated using e.g., the two following clinical cases:  
• With an initial TCS of 7 and a constant RM intake, the patient will benefit from a 
symptom improvement of 1 poi nt corresponding to a change of one severity class in one 
symptom e.g., from “severe” to “moderate”  
• With an initial TCS of 7 and a stable symptom severity, the patient will experience a 
decrease of one step in RM intake e.g., s/he will stop the intranasal  corticosteroids (from 
step 2: intranasal corticosteroids with or without antihistamine to step 1: antihistamine) 
or s/he will not take rescue medication anymore (from step 1: antihistamine to no rescue 
medication)  
This clinical benefit is expected to last  all year round as HDM allergic rhinitis induces perennial 
symptoms.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses : 
Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the FAS.   
In order to control the overall type I error  and to draw robust conclusions with regard to the 
key secondary endpoints, a  step-down sequential closed testing procedure will be applied on 
six secondary endpoints which will be tested in the following order:  
• 1. Rhini tis Total Symptom Score (RTSS ) during the primary evaluation period  
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 24 of 123 
 
• 2. Overall score of Rhin oconjunctivitis  Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at the 
end of the treatment period  
• 3. Rhin oconjunctiv itis Total Symptom Score (R CTSS) during the primary evaluation 
period  
• 4. Blocked nose  symptom score during the primary evaluation period  
• 5. Proportion of Symptom -Controlled D ays ( PSCD, proportion of days with RTSS≤ 2 
and no rescue medication use) during the primary evaluation period  
• 6. Rescue Medication Score (RMS) during the primary evaluation  period  
The average RTSS, RMS, ASS, CSMS, TOSS , RCTSS  and each of the six average individual 
RSSs (calculated as the average of the non -missing daily scores) during the primary evaluation 
period will be analyzed similarly to the average TCS using the corre sponding baseline scores 
(except PPS analysis  and sensitivity analyses). They will be summarized descriptively during 
each evaluation period.  
The proportions of days with rescue medication intake will be summarized descriptively, 
overall and for each rescu e medication category, and analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test 
at each evaluation period.  
The PSCD 2-0 and PNCD  will be summarized descriptively and analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank-

4. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
4.1 Scientific Background  
Allergy is one of the most common diseases in the world. Untreated or inadequately treated Allergy 
Rhinitis (AR) can cause sleep disturbance, daytime fatigue and somnolence [Leger et al.,2006 ] as 
well as depressed mood, irritability, behavioral problems [Meltzer,2001 ; Hankin et al.,2010 ] or 
impaired social functioning [Meltzer,2001 ]. There are also significant indirect costs associated with 
this condition including absenteeism from work or school and decreased productivity when at work 
[Blaiss,2007 ]. 
Using a conservative estimate, AR occurs in over 500 million people around the world [Bousquet 
et al.,2008 ]. Sneezing, congestion, clear rhinorrhoea and nasal pruritus are the key symptoms 
characterizing the disease. It is estimated that AR affects up to 60 million people in the United 
States (US), and its prevalence is increasing.  Despite a reported prevalence ranging from 10 to 30% 
in adults and up to 40% in children [Warner et al.,2006 ], AR is frequently under -recognized, 
misdiagnosed, and ineffectively treated [Meltzer et al.,2012 ]. The prevalence peaks in childhood 
and adolescence and decreases in the elderly. It has been established that the patholophysiogical 
mechanisms of rhinitis contribute to the development of asthma in a large number of  patients 
[Rowe -Jones,1997 ]. The risk for AR patients in deve loping asthma is three times higher than 
among the general population (10% versus 3.6%), confirming the hypothesis that rhinitis is often 
the first step in the natural history of asthma [Rachelefsky,1999 ]. 
Allergens such as cat and dog dander, cockroach and house dust mite are associated with perennial 
rhinitis while allergies to grass, weeds, and tree  pollens are characterized by seasonal rhinitis 
symptoms.  
Mites consist of a large taxonomic subclass, named Acarina. Among them,  Dermatophagoides  
pteronyssinus  and Dermatophagoides farinae are the main species involved in AR in Europe and 
North America [Platts -Mills and Weck,1989 ].The most important habitat for Dermatophagoides  
mites is in bedding (mattress and bed clothes), where the food is supplied as human scales and 
where the temperature is ideal . Overstuffed furniture, carpets and unlaundered clothing  are also 
important habitats [Mosbech,1985 ]. 
Current treatment options are allergen avoidance, symptomatic therapy, and specific 
immunotherapy. Allergen avoidance is often virtually impossible. Symptomatic treatment s include 
antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, chromones and leukotriene modifiers. These treatments 
provide temporary relief from allergy symptoms but are not effective in all patients and do not have 
a disease -modi fying effect [Nathan,2007 ]. In addition, pharmacotherapy may be associated with 
significant side effects such as sedative and anticholinergic effects for antihistamines, dryness and 
epistaxis for intranasal corticosteroids and neuropsychiatric reactions for leukotriene modifiers 
[Byrne et al.,2012 ; Fernández -Caldas,2013 ]. 
Allergen immunotherapy is the only therapy available that act s on the main cause of the allergic 
reaction by  modifying or down -regulating the immune response to allergens.

Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 34 of 123 
 
Allergen -specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is the oldest route of administration used 
to desensitize patients and is still a recommended therapeutic option for subjects with AR [Cox et 
al.,2011 ]. However, despite its long use history, only 5% of the US population with AR, asthma, 
or both benefit from this treatment [Cox,2008 ]. Its use is limited by the risk of near -fatal or fatal 
anaphylaxis as well as the discomfort and inconvenience of frequent injections [Bernstein et 
al.,2004 ; Amin et al.,2006 ; Nelson,2007 ]. 
Allergen -specific sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an alternative to SCIT with similar efficacy 
[Canonica et al.,2009 ; Cox et al.,2011 ; Canonica et al.,2014 ]. The favorable safety profile of SLIT 
and its convenience are likely factors for the sub stantial and growing increase in its use 
[Nelson,2007 ; Cox and Jacobsen,2009 ]. The Allergi c Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) 
2008 Update [Bousquet et al.,2008 ] and its 2010 revision [Brozek et al.,2010 ] provide recent expert 
guidance  in this therapeutic area. These reviews indicate that SLIT may be used for the treatment 
of subjects with mite allergy.  In addition, recent Cochrane reviews [Radulovic et al.,2010 ; Lin et 
al.,2013 ] confirm that SLIT is a viable alternative to SCIT with a significantly lower risk profile 
and little difference in overall efficacy.  
STALLERGENES  is developing a sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) tablet of HDM allergen  
extracts (STG320 HDM sublingual tablets) containing standardized allergen extracts from both 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (D . pte) and Dermatophagoides farinae (D . far). The efficacy 
and safety of STG320 tablets at daily doses of 300IR and 500IR have been demonstrated in adults 
and adolescents with AR.  
 
The purpose of the present study  is to confirm the efficacy and safety of STG320 sublingual tablets 
at the daily dose of 300IR in adults and adolescents with HDM -associated AR.  
4.2 Investigational Product  
The Investigational Product  (IP) is STG320 HDM sublingual tablet containing extracts of 
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  (D. pte) and Dermatophagoides farinae  (D. far) [active 
substance].  
STG320 is  obtained by extracti ng, purifi ying, freeze -drying and sieving of the genuine allergen  
sources. These drug substances are obtained separately from both D. pte and D. far and then mixed 
together in a 50 :50 immunological activity ratio (expressed in IR). The mixture is processed by 
direct compression  to obtain the sublingual tablets of HDM allergen extracts.  
The allergen preparation potency unit used by STALLERGENES  is defined as Index of Reactivity 
or "IR" [Hrabina et al.,2007 ; Wahn et al.,2009 ]. The titer of an allergen extrac t corresponds to 100 
IR/mL when, in a skin prick test performed with the STALLERGENES  skin prick test device (i.e., 
the Stallerpoint®), in 30  subjects sensitized to the allergen in question, the extract produces a wheal 
measuring 7  mm in diameter (geometri c mean). Skin reactivity in these subjects is simultaneously 
demonstrated by a positive response to a prick -test with 9% codeine phosphate or 10 mg/mL 
histamine dihydrochloride.

The IP is further described in Section 8.1 “Study  Investigational Products ” and in the Investiga tor’s 
Brochure  (Version 10 dated 11 June 2014 ). 
4.3 Non-Clinical Studies  
Detailed information on the non -clinical experience with STG320 can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure . A summary of this information is provided below.  
4.3.1 Pharmacology  
Published animal  studies demonstrate the alleviation or prevention of type -I hypersensitivity 
reactions upon allergen re -challenge of sensitized animals following repeated administration of 
allergens.  To strengthen these experimental results and to extend them to the mite  extracts 
manufactured at STALLERGENES , freeze -dried extracts of D. pte/D. far were tested in a murine 
model of chronic HDM -induced asthma. The study results demonstrated that the freeze -dried 
extracts of D. pte/D.  far are efficacious as a sublingual immunotherapy vaccine in the murine 
model  [Study DS/ST/09/234  – refer to the STG 320 Investigator Brochure] . 
4.3.2 Pharmacokinetics  
No animal pharmacokinetics data have been generated with the mite extracts. The lack of relevance 
of pharmacokinetic data can be explained as follows:  
- By the sublingual -swallow route, the proteolytic digestion in t he gastrointestinal tract is 
assumed to be the predominant fate of mite extracts, as they consist mostly of proteins and 
glycoproteins. The extent of systemic absorption of the mite extracts is unknown but is 
assumed to be negligible.  
- Based on our knowledg e of the mechanism of action of SLIT , the pharmacological effect of 
the mite extracts included in  the tablets is not related to plasma allergen levels  but to the 
capture of allergens by dendritic cells within the sublingual mucosa and transport to draining  
lymph nodes.  
4.3.3 Toxicology  
Repeat -dose oral (gavage) and subcutaneous administration  of freeze -dried extracts of D. pte and 
D. far in rats were well tolerated. No evidence of treatment -related toxicity was noted after doses 
of up to 2,500  IR/kg/day administ ered for 26  weeks.  
4.4 Clinical Development  
STALLERGENES  is conducting a multinational clinical development program with STG320 for 
the treatment of HDM -associated AR. To date, seven clinical studies evaluating the sublingual 
tablet for this indication have been conducted: five by STALLERGENES  and two by Shionogi & 
Co., Ltd.

4.4.1 STALLERGENES  - Sponsored Studies  
Studies in Adults  
• Phase I Study VO36.04F in adults [aged 18 to 50  years ] 
This phase I, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled single -center study in 31 adults (18 ­50 
years old) with perennial AR caused by sensitization to house -dust mites  assessed the safety and 
tolerability of four STG320 dose regimens with 10 days of administration: two incremental dose 
regimens up to 500 IR and constant dose regimens at 500 IR or 300 IR . 
STG320  was generally well tolerated at doses up to 500 IR. It was concluded that a dose escalation 
period could reduce the incidence and s everity of application site reactions.  
• Phase II/III Study VO57.07 in adults [aged 18 to 50  years ] 
This natural field, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study was conducted 
in adults with HDM -related AR to assess the efficacy and safety of STG320 at the 300  IR and 500 
IR doses. The study included a 12 month treatment period (Year 1) and a 12  month treatment free 
follow -up period (Year 2). 509 patients were enrolled , 427 completed the first year , and 397 
completed the s econd year. Statistically significant differences between the 300 IR group and the 
500 IR group compared to placebo on the primary endpoint were demonstrated during the Year 1 
primary evaluation period. The difference between the two active treatment group s was not 
statistically significant. Efficacy was maintained during the treatment -free follow -up year (Year 
2). The overall safety profile of the two doses was favorable with no appreciable differences in 
tolerability between them. No anaphylaxis or autoim mune disorders were reported. No unexpected 
risk was identified  [Bergmann et al.,2014 ]. 
• Phase II Study VO67.10 Environmental Exposure Chamber in adults [aged 18 to 55  
years ] 
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, mu lti-center, dose ranging study, performed in 
an Environmental Exposure Chamber, was conducted in Canada in 355 adults  with HDM -related 
AR. It evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 100  IR, 300  IR and 500  IR administered 
once daily for 6 months. A dose effect was observed  on the primary efficacy endpoint.  The 
reduction in symptom  severity was limited with the 100  IR dose (19.8%), but larger with the 300  IR 
(28.8%) and the 500  IR doses (33.2%). The overall safety profile was consistent with  that observed 
in previous studies.  
Studies in Children and Adolescents  
• Phase III Study VO64.08 in children and adolescents [aged 5 to 17  years ] 
This natural field, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -cente r study was conducted 
in Europe in  children and adolescents with HDM -associated AR to assess the safety and efficacy 
of STG320 at the 300  IR dose. Overall, 471 patients (241 in the 300  IR group and 230 in the 
placebo group) were randomized.  
This study was initially designed to include 24 months of treatment (i.e., 12 months of treatment 
in Year 1  and 6 months of treatment in each of Year 2 and Year 3) and 22 months of treatment -free

follow -up. While all patients met the study inclusion criteria (i.e., clinical history, positive prick 
skin test, positive HDM -specific serum IgE, and the presence of symptoms at baseline), they 
reported minimal symptoms post -randomization. Therefore, the efficacy of the investigational 
product  could not be assessed. Accordingly, the Data Safety Monitoring Board of independent 
external experts recommended the early termination of the study “for futility”, before the patients 
started the second treatment period. These findings underscore the need for additional diagnostic 
criteria in future pediatric studies to ensure the enrollment of patients with HDM -driven AR.  
The safety profile of the 300 IR dose of STG320 in children and adolescents was consistent with 
that observed in previous studies in adults.  Patients with asthma showed a similar safety profile  as 
those without asthma . 
• Phase I Study VO73.13 in adolescents [aged 12 to 17  years ] 
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single -center study (Canada) assessed the 
safety and tolerability o f 3 dose -regimens, 500  IR, 1000  IR and 1500  IR of STG320 sublingual 
tablets evaluated over a treatment period of 10  consecutive days in 37 adolescents  with HDM -
associated AR . The three doses were well tolerated. The overall safety profile was consistent wi th 
that observed in previous studies with the 300  IR and 500  IR dose s in adults, adolescents  and 
children . 
4.4.2 Studies Conducted by STALLERGENES  Partner C ompany (Shionogi and Co., Ltd)  
• Phase I Study 1109D1711 in adults [aged 20 to 39  years ] 
This randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single -center study (Japan) assessed the safety 
of three doses (100  IR, 300 IR and 500 IR) of STG320 versus  placebo in 36 adults with HDM -
associated perennial allergic rhinitis treated for 14 days. All doses we re well tolerated.  
• Phase II/III Study 1207D1731 in adolescents and adults [aged 12 to 64  years ] 
This natural field, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -cente r (Japan) study was 
conducted in adolescents and adults with HDM -related AR to asse ss the efficacy and safety of 
STG320 at the dose s of 300 IR and 500 IR over a 12 month treatment period.  
968 patients (181 adolescents) were enrolled and 853 patients (159 adolescents) completed the 12 -
month treatment phase. Statistically significant differences between  both the 500  IR group and the 
300 IR group compared to placebo on the primary endpoint were demonstrated. A subgroup 
analysis in adolescents (age category: ≥12 to <18) showed statistically significant differences 
between both 500 IR and 300  IR compared to placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The safety profile was consistent with that obs erved in studies conducted in Europe and Canada.  
4.5 Study Rationale  
Up to 09 June 2015 , 1,571 patients (1,182 adults, 261 adolescents and 128 children) with HDM -
associated AR have been  exposed to STG320 ( doses from 100  IR to 1500  IR) in the rhinitis 
developm ent program.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 38 of 123 
 
Overall, the results of the natural field and environmental exposure chamber studies demonstrate 
that the 500  IR and 300  IR doses of STG320 are similarly efficacious in treating adults with HDM -
induced AR. 
A favorable safety and tolerability profile has been  observed for all tested doses. No deaths were 
reported. There were no reports of anaphylactic shock, anaphylaxis, or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) 
admission and no use of epinephrine. The most frequent adverse reactions were application site 
reactions such as oral pruritus and throat irritation. Most were of mild or moderate intensity and 
were mainly reported during the first weeks of treatment. Drug -related adverse events (AEs) 
leading to premature discontinuation were more frequent in active treatment groups compared to 
placebo.  
Based on the totality of the efficacy and safety data, the development of the 300  IR dose of STG320 
will be pursued .  
This randomized,  double -blind, placebo -controlled  study  is designed to  confirm  the efficacy and 
safety of the 300  IR dose of STG320 in adolescents and adults (12 -65 years of age) with HDM -
associated AR. Treatment will be administered daily for 12 months. Patients will be selected on 
the basis of a clinical history consistent with HD M-associated AR, positive skin prick test and the 
presence of HDM -specific serum IgE. To better enable the identification of patients whose 
symptoms are driven by HDM allergy, evidence of HDM -exposure  has been added as  an inclusion 
criterion.

5. STUDY  OBJECTIVES AND PURP OSE  
This study  is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of 12 months of treatment with 300 IR of 
STG320 sublingual tablets compared with placebo in adults and adolescents with house dust mite  
(HDM) -associated allergic rhinitis (AR).  
5.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this stud y is to  evaluate the efficacy of STG320 sublingual tablets at a 
daily dosage of 300  IR when administered for 12 months to adults and adolescents with HDM -
associated AR.  
The primary efficacy variable will be the average Total Combined Score ( TCS), calculated for each 
patient as the average of the non -missing daily TCSs during the primary evaluation period ( i.e., the 
last 4 weeks of treatment ). The daily TCS (scale 0 -15) is the sum of the patient ’s daily Rhinitis 
Total Symptom Score (RTSS , scale 0 -12) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS , scale 0 -3). 
5.2 Secondary Objectives  
5.2.1 Efficacy of STG320  during the Primary Evaluation P eriod  (Month 12)  
To assess the efficacy of STG320 sublingual tablets at the dosage of 300  IR as evaluated by the 
following secondary effi cacy variables during the primary evaluation period  
• Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS).  
• Rescue Medication Score (RMS)  
• Adjusted Symptom Score (ASS , scale 0 -12). This score is derived from the daily RTSSs, after 
adjustment for the patient's rescue medication use.  
• Combined Symptom and Medication Score (CSMS, scale 0 -6). The CSMS is derived from 
RTSS and RMS . 
• Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS , scale 0 -6). The TOSS is calculated as the sum of 
individual score s for itchy/red eyes and watery eyes .  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis Total Symptom Score  (RCTSS ). The RCTSS is calculated as the sum of 
the four rhinitis symptom scores and  the two ocular symptom scores . 
• Each of the six individual Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Scores (RSSs , each scored on a scale 
of 0-3): itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose , itchy/red eyes and watery eyes . 
• Rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication use, overall and by type of treatment.  
• Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) assessing the intensity of the allergic rhinitis  symptoms (ranging 
from 0 = absence of symptoms to 100 = very severe symptoms).

• RMS  
• ASS 
• CSMS  
• TOSS   
• RCTSS  
• RSSs  
• Rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication use, overall and by type of treatment  
• Overall assessment of allergic rhinitis symptoms by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  
5.2.3 Effect of STG320 at the End of the T reatment  
To assess the effect of STG 320 compared to placebo on other variables at the end of the treatment  
• Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment 
Questions: Allergy Specific (WPAI + CIQ: AS)  
• Immunological markers: D. pte- and D. far-specific serum  IgE a nd IgG 4 
5.3 Exploratory Objectives

5.4 Safety Objectives  
To assess the safety of 12 months of treatment with STG320  at the daily dose of 300  IR. The safety 
assessments include adverse events (AEs), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) (anaphylaxis, 
severe laryngopharyngeal disorders, autoimmune disorders  and eosinophilic esophagitis ), vital 
signs and routine safety laboratory tests.  
6. STUDY  DESIGN  
6.1 Type/Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase III study with two parallel arms to 
be conducted in patients with HDM -associated allergic rhinitis consisting of a 1 to 6 month 
screening  phase  (including  a run -in period  of 5 weeks ), a treatment phase of approximately 
12 months  and post -treatment follow -up phase of 2 weeks . 
Male or female patients aged 12 to 65 years (inclusive) with HDM -related allergic rhinitis for at 
least one year requiring regular intake of symptomatic treatment s will be randomized to one of two  
treatment groups.  
In addition to the patients’ history, t he diagnosis will be confirmed by the positivity of Skin Prick 
Test (SPT) with HDM allergen and the presence of HDM -specific IgE. An assessment of the HDM 
load in the patient’s residence collected dust will also be performed before randomization .  
Overall, each patient is to attend 10 visits. Visit s 1 will involve screening for eligibility. Visit 2 
will start the run -in phase. Visit 3 to Visit 9 will comprise the treatment phase and Visit 10 will 
involve the post -treatment follow -up phase.  
Screening Phase (Visit 1  and V isit 2 ) 
• Selection Visit  (Visit 1)  
At Visit 1, the first screen will be performed to assess patient’s eligibility for the study.  
• Run-in period (Visit 2)  
At Visit 2 , patients still meeting all of the  inclusion and none of  the exclusion criteria, except the 
criteria assess ed on the baseline TCS, will enter a single -blind placebo run -in period of 5 weeks. 
The selected period will be individualized based on the patient’s history of previous HDM -related 
rhinitis symptoms (i.e., the period during which the patient is reported to be the most symptomatic). 
During this period, patients will take 1  placebo tablet sublingually each day. Rescue medications 
as treatment for symptoms of allergic rhinitis to HDM  will be provided with instructions for their 
use. Patients will record their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and rescue medication use in an 
electronic diary (e -diary) daily and will assess  the intensity of the AR symptoms on a Visual 
Analogue Scale (VAS)  weekly  for 5  weeks . 
An average TCS  5 (scale 0 to 15 ) during  the four last weeks of the run -in period  will serve as  an 
ultimate inclusion criterion for the  select ion of  patients for randomization.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 42 of 123 
 
For those patients who meet this inclusion criterion, these 4  weeks will also serve as the baseline 
evaluation period.  
Treatment Phase (Visits 3 -9) 
At Visit 3, e ligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either  active treatment or placebo. The first 
dose of study treatment will be administered at the study site and t he patient will be monitored for 
at least 30  minutes  thereafter . Subsequent doses are to be taken at home, daily, at the same time in 
the morning , for a period of approximately 12 months  with a minimum of 10 months . Interim 
efficacy assessments will be per formed at Month 3, 6 , and 9 after randomization  (Visits 5 -7). The 
primary efficacy evaluation period (from Visit 8 to Visit 9) will be during the same 4 weeks of the 
year as those of the baseline evaluation period  or as close as possible to these weeks.  
A limited shortening of the 12-month treatment phase should be considered when necessary in 
patients who enter the study  in late  winter or spring  (from February to June), in order to adapt and 
to avoid possibly less favorable conditions for mite exposure in late winter/spring  and to prevent 
confounding symptoms due to pollens  in case of  early pollination  in the following year. The 
purpose of this relative flexibility in planning the treatment du ration for those patients is to ensure 
the primary efficacy evaluation is performed when  conditions  are optimal for such evaluation . 
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Phase (Visit 10)  
Patients will attend a follow -up visit, 2 weeks after the administration of their  last IP dose.  
6.2 Number of Patients  and Study  Sites  
It is planned to screen approximately 3,500  patients in order to randomize  1,740 (i.e., 870 patients 
randomized in each treatment group) . Approximately 150-190 centers from  the United States of 
America (USA), Canada , Europe , Israel and Russia are expected to participate .  
6.3 Measures to Minimize  Bias 
6.3.1 Randomization  
All patients will receive a screening number via an Interactive Web /Voice Response System 
(IVRS/IWRS ).  
A computer -generated randomization list with stratification by study site will be prepared by a 
different statistician from the biostatisticians in charge of the study data analyses.  
A copy of the complete randomization list will be provided to the IVRS/I WRS  responsible person 
and to the company contracted to package the investigational product .  
6.3.2 Blinding  
During the run -in period , patients will receive placebo tablets . All efforts are to be taken by study 
site personnel to not reveal to the patients the placebo nature of the tablets  and maintain the single 
blind . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 43 of 123 
 
After randomization and throughout the study treatment and post -treatment phases , the study is 
designed as a double -blind study. Therefore, during the treatment phase, patients, investigators and 
site staff , and all study staff will be blinded  as to treatment group assignment . The investigational 
products (i.e., active and placebo tablets) will be the same with r espect to appearance and taste. 
Labeling and packaging will also be identical.  
Under normal circumstances, the treatment blind must be maintained . In the case of medical 
emergency in which knowledge of the  treatment  allocation is considered by the Investig ator as 
critical in managing the patient ’s condition, the Investigator will utilize IVRS/IWRS  and use the 
unblinding functions . In case of technical issues  with the IVRS/IWRS system , the Investigator will 
contact either the responsible person from the Pharmacovigilance department  or the primary CRO  
designee  to unblind the patient .  
If the blind is broken, the date, the reason for breaking the blind, and the person doing so is to be 
recorded on the source document, and in the appropriate e -CRF page, and STALLERGENES  or 
its representative must be notified immediately.  
6.4 Study  Duration  
The total duration of the study for an individual patient will be between 14 an d 20 months, 
including a 1- to 6-month screening phase (including  a run -in period of 5 weeks ), a treatment phase  
of 12 months and a post -treatment follow -up phase  of 2 weeks.  
In total, 10 visits will be conducted: 2 screening visits, 1 randomization  visit,  6 regular follow -up 
visits ( Months  1, 3, 6, 9, 11 and 12) and 1 post -treatment visit  (Month 12.5).  
Evaluation periods  
The evaluation periods will be defined as follows:  
- Baseline evaluation period: last 4 weeks of the 5 -week run -in period   
- Interim evaluati on periods: 2 weeks every 3 months after randomization (i.e., Month 3, Month 
6 and Month 9 ) 
- Primary evaluation period: 4 weeks  prior to the end of the treatment period  
7. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF PATIENTS  
Before any study procedures are initiated for any patient in this study, approval of the  Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) or Ethic s Committee will have to be obtained , and written  informed consent, 
including signing of the informed consent/assent form , must be documented.

extracts at the dose of 100  IR or matching placebo ) and o ne maintenance phase treatment unit  (i.e., 
one box  containing 5 blister pack cards . Each blister pack card will contain 20 tablets of STG320 
HDM allergen extracts at the dose  of 300  IR or matching placebo) . 
At Visits 5 -7, each patient will receive one maintenance phase treatment unit  (i.e., one box  
containing 5 blister pack cards . Each blister pack card will contain 20 tablets of STG320 HDM 
allergen extracts at the dose  of 300  IR or matching placebo) . 
The call/connection to  IVRS/IWRS will be repeated prior to each dispensation of IP in order to 
obtain a treatment kit number.  
Patients will be treated for approximately 12 months.  The first dose (Visit 3 ) is to be taken in the 
presence of the Investigator  and t he patient observ ed for the next 30 minutes.

Subsequent doses are to be taken at home, daily, at approximately the same time in the morning. 
Tablets are to be taken in an empty mouth and t he patient instructed to leave the tablets under the 
tongue until complete disintegra tion before swallowing. The patient is not to eat or drink before 
the tablet is completely disintegrated . On Day 2, the two tablets which comprise the treatment dose 
are to be taken simultaneously.  
In the event IP is discontinued for more than 7  days, it is to be restarted under medical supervision 
at the dosage of last intake . 
8.1.6 Monitoring of Patient  Complianc e 
At each visit after drug is dispensed, the patients must return all unused investigational product as 
well as any empty boxes and blisters.  
Drug reconciliation must be done in the patient’s presence in order to obtain required explanations 
regarding any discrepancies in compliance with the dosing regimen.  
The number of tablets returned and the date they were returned must be recorded in the e -CRF and 
the IP Accountability Form . Explanations of non -compliance must also be recorded in the e ­CRF.  
Compliance with study  medication is defined as investigational product consumption by the patient 
greater than or equal to  80% of th at prescribed. In case of persistent non compliance, the  patient’s 
withdrawal from the study  should  be considered.  
8.1.7 Investigational Products (IP) Accountability  
The Investigator or the Pharmacist will receive blinded numbered treatments.  
A Drug Accountability Form will be supplied to the site and is to be kept up -to-date. On this form, 
the following information will be recorded: the treatment kit number allocated to the patient, the 
initials of the person who dispenses the IP to the patien t, the dates of dispensation  and return , and 
the number of returned  tablets.  The site monitor will check the supplies of the IP and will review 
the accountability records during monitoring visits and at the completion of the study.  
In case of interruption of investigational product intake (permanent or tempora ry) the stop date has 
to be documented in the e -CRF . For temporary interruptions, the  resume date must  also be 
recorded.  
Partially used treatment box es or blister cards  must  never  be used for another p atient.  
After completion of the study , all used (including empty containers) and unused IP boxes must be 
reconciled and returned to the subcontracted packaging company . 
8.2 Concomitant Treatments and Rescue Medications   
8.2.1 Concomitant Treatments  
An accurate record of all medications other than the IP must be kept in the clinic chart/patient’s 
medical record (source documentation) and in the e -CRF. This record should include the generic 
name of the drug, the dose, the date(s) of administration, and  the indication for use.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 51 of 123 
 
Patients will be instructed  to record all intake  of concomitant medications in the “Adverse Event 
and Concomitant Medication  Card .” 
The use of concomitant medication will be reviewed during the Data Review Meeting (DRM) prior 
to da tabase lock and unblinding to assess protocol deviation and their potential impact on study 
results.  
8.2.2 Rescue Medications  
Patients  will be supplied with antihistamines , intranasal corticosteroids, and oral corticosteroids as 
rescue medications. Beginning at Visit 2 and thereafter, as necessary through Visit 8, 
antihistamines and intranasal cort icosteroids will be provided to  patients for managing allergic 
rhinitis symptoms.  No other rescue medications should be taken by the patients without 
authorization of  the Investigator.  
If AR symptoms are not sufficiently  alleviated despite these treatment s, the Investigator will 
evaluate with the patient if systemic corticosteroid  is indicated and will prescribe this treatment.  
Management of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medications will follow  a stepwise regimen:  
Step 1 : Antihistamine  
Patients will be instructed to initiate treatment of AR symptoms with oral antihistamine  (e.g., 
cetirizine 10  mg, 1 tablet daily in the morning ). 
In cases where ocular allergic sympto ms are present (i.e., itchy/red eyes and /or watery eyes ) 
and the oral antihistamine is not sufficient to control the ocular symptoms, topical antihistamine 
by the ocular route can be added  (e.g., olopatadine 0.1% eye drops ).  
Note : Use of topical nasal ant ihistamines and decongestants (e.g., azelastine, phenyephrine, 
oxymetazoline) is not permitted during the study.  
Step 2 : Intranasal corticosteroid  
If the allergic rhinitis symptoms are not sufficiently alleviated by treatment with oral 
antihistamine  (step 1) , patients are to be instructed to initiate treatment with intranasal 
corticosteroid  (e.g.,  budesonide  aqueous nasal spray , 64 g/nostril  daily  in the morning , total 
of 128  g/day), with or without oral antihistamin e.  
In cases where ocular allergic symptoms are present , topical antihistamine by the ocular route 
may be continued. While a decrease in nasal symptoms may occur as soon as 12 hours after 
starting treatment, it may take several days  to reach the maximum effect . Therefore , it is 
recommended that treatment with intranasal corticosteroid  be maintained for a minimum of 
4 consecutive days and intermittent use of intranasal corticosteroid should be discouraged . 
Step 3 : Oral corticosteroid  
If the allergic rhinitis  symptoms are not sufficiently alleviated by intranasal corticosteroid ( step 
2), the patient should consult the Investigator  and treatment with  oral corticosteroid  should be 
considered : prednisolone  at a dose adapted to the patient s’ weight and to their symptom  
severity . Previously used intranasal corticosteroid with or without oral antihistamine will be

STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 52 of 123 
 
continued concomitantly with the step 3 treatment. The treatment with oral corticosteroid 
should  be gradually reduced and stopped after 5 to 10 day s and treatment with step 2  therapy 
(intranasal corticosteroid)  continued .  
In cases where ocular allergic symptoms are present , topical antihistamine by the ocular route 
may be continued.  
 
The patient ’s supply of rescue medication will be checked at each visit  and replenished, as needed . 
Apart from the management of AEs, no anti -allergy medication other than the rescue medication 
is to be taken by a patient  unless it has been agreed with the investigator and with 
STALLERGENES , as this will constitute a protocol deviation.  Any antihistamine or corticosteroid 
treatments, even those provided as rescue medication , taken for a  reason other than as treatment 
for allergic rhinitis symptoms due to HDM , is to  be reported in the e -CRF as concomitant 
medication.  
8.2.3 Epinephrine Auto -Injector  
8.2.3.1  Special Warnings and Precautions  
Treatment with allergen immunotherapy can cause life -threatening allergic reactions such as 
anaphylaxis and severe laryngopharyngeal edema that require treatment with epinephrine.  
Study participa tion may not be suitable for patients with certain medical conditions that may reduce 
the ability to survive a serious allergic reaction or increase the risk of adverse reactions after 
epinephrine administration. Examples of these medical conditions includ e but are not limited to: 
markedly compromised lung function (either chronic or acute), unstable angina, recent myocardial 
infarction, significant arrhythmia, and uncontrolled hypertension. In addition, study participation 
may not be suitable for patients who are taking medications that can potentiate or inhibit the effect 
of epinephrine. These medications includ e beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha -adrenergic blockers, 
ergot alkaloids, tricyclic antidepressants, levothyroxine sodium, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, 
cardiac glycosides, and diuretics.  
Adequate resuscitation equipment and facilities for managing severe allergic reactions must be 
available at each study site.  
Patients will be provided with a study site -specific contact phone number and be in structed to call 
at any time for questions about any adverse reactions they may experience.   
8.2.3.2  Safety and Emergency Procedures  
At Visit 3, patients will be instructed to recognize the signs and symptoms of a severe allergic 
reaction . They will be trained  on the proper use of emergency self -injection of epinephrine . Patients  
will receive a n epinephrine auto -injector to be used in case of a severe allergic reaction . Patients 
will be instructed to seek immediate medical care upon its  use. They are to discontinu e study 
therapy and contact the study site as soon as possible for further evaluation. The epinephrine auto -
injector  will be replaced as necessary.

9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
9.1 Patient  Identifier  
All patients who have signed a n Informed Consent Form (ICF) or  Assent Form  together with their 
parent(s)/legal representative in the case of adolescents, whether they are randomized i n this study  
or not, will receive a screening number allocated in ascending order of screening.  
9.2 Description of Procedures  
9.2.1 Informed Consent Form  
At Visit 1, a n Informed Consent Form (ICF)  has to be dated and signed by the patient (and 
parent(s)/legal repres entative in the case of adolescents) before any study procedure may be 
performed .  
If the patient is <16 year s old, an assent form will be used instead of the informed consent form  in 
addition to the ICF dated and signed by the parents. If the patient is aged between 16 and <18 years 
old, s/he may sign an ICF on her/his own, or sign an assent form in addition to the ICF signed by 
the parent(s) /legal representative , depending on the local regulations.  
The Investigator who informs the patient (and parent(s)/legal representative ) and obtains their 
written consent/assent has to also date and s ign the ICF/Assent form. A copy of the ICF /Assent 
form will be  given to the patient (and parent (s)/legal representative ) and the original is to be 
retained by the Investigator.  
9.2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria should be checked at Visit  1 and Visit 2 (run -in) and confirmed 
before randomization at Visit  3. To be rando mized in the study , a patient must  meet all the inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  
At the Investigator’s discretion a Nasal Provocation Test  for HDM may be performed to confirm 
the diagnosis of HDM -associated AR. The study  site’s standa rd practice  should be followed.  
9.2.3 Medical and Allergy History  
Medical history including  complete allergy history will be collected at Visit  1. 
9.2.4 Demographic Data, Height and Weight  
Information on gender, date of birth, ethnic origin, height and weight will be collected at Visit  1. 
9.2.5 Prior  and Concomitant Medication  
At Visit  1, AR and asthma medication s taken  within the six previous months will be recorded . 
During the study , any intake of medication will be reported by the Investigator in the medical 
source data and in the e -CRF. Information regarding drug name ( generic  name), total daily dose, 
route, start and end date or whether ongoing, and indication for use will be recorded.

9.2.6 Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
At Visit s 1 and 9, a physical examination w ill be conducted including  vital signs  (systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate),  and examination of the skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and nervous systems.  
At Visit s 2 through 8, and at Visit 10, a directed physical examination will be performed if judged 
necessary by the investigator based on symptoms and physical signs.  
9.2.7 Skin Prick Test  
At Visit 1, Skin Prick Test ing [Heinzerling et al.,2005 ; Heinzerling et al.,2009 ] will be performed 
using the following battery of aeroallergens: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus , Dermatophagoides 
farinae , cat, dog, cockroach , Aspergillus, Cladosporium , Parietaria, and Alternaria and other 
geographically relevant, potentially confounding aeroallergens  such as cypress, birch, grass, 
ragweed… as well as  positive ( histamine dihydrochloride)  and negative ( saline  diluent ) controls.  
SPT allergens used in this study will be provided by the Sponsor using locally approved extracts. 
Testing is to be  performed  according to the USPI/ Summary of Product Characteristics.  
For the HDM allergens, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus  and Dermatophagoides farinae,  a test 
will be considered positive when, 20 minutes after testing, the largest  wheal diameter is at least 
5 mm greater than that of the negative control . For the other allergens, a wheal diameter at least 
5 mm greater than the negative control  will be considered positive.  
The tests will be considered valid when the p ositive control induce s a wheal diameter of at least 
3 mm and negative control indu ces a wheal diameter l ess than 2  mm. In the event of  non valid 
controls or borderline result s, the SPT should be repeated.  
The outline of wheals (and, if present, pseudopods and satellites) will be traced with a sharp black 
felt pen. The real limits of th e wheal are confirmed  by palpation. Hypoallergenic transparent 
adhesive tape will be applied on the tracings and will be then transferred on the source document 
sheet . 
Wash -out periods for specific categories of medications are provided  in Section 8.2.4.1  “Prohibited 
Treatment s During the Screening Phase .” 
9.2.8 Spirometry  
At Visit 1, lung function testing will be performed according to  American Thoracic 
Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) Task Force: Standardization of Lung Function 
Testing [Miller et al.,2005 ] (see Appendix I ). The Forced Vital Capacity/Forced Expiratory Volume 
in one second ( FEV 1) maneuver will be performed three times and  the best of the value s will be 
retained. To be eligible for enrollment, the FEV 1 must be at least 80% of the predicted value. Ethnic 
corrective factors may be  used in accordance with the recommendations of the equipment  
manufacturer . 
At Visit 3 and Visit 9 , lung function testing will be repeated  only for asthmatic patients.

9.2.9 Classification  of Asthma Status  
At Visit 1 , the a sthma status (Yes or No)  of all patient s will be assessed.  
If present, a sthma will be classified according to the GINA Guidelines  (Global Initiative for 
Asthma – GINA 2014 – ref. Appendix II  and Appendix III ).  
Eligible asthmatic pati ents will be those with asthma, controlled by  treatment(s) consistent with 
GINA 2014 treatment Steps 1 or 2 [i.e., reliever treatment with as needed short acting β2-agonist  
with or without controller treatment  consisting of low dose inhaled corticosteroid ( 400 g of 
budesonide/day or equivalent dose of other corticosteroid) or leukotriene receptor antagonist or 
low dose theophylline ]. 
9.2.10  Blood sampling  
At Visits 1 and 9, b lood samples  (approximately 20  mL) will be drawn  at for:  
• Safety laborator y tests:  
Hematology (i.e., hemoglobin , hematocrit, red blood cells (RBC), platelets, white blood cells 
(WBC), differential count (neutrophils, basophils, eosin ophils, monocytes, lymphocytes)  
Biochemistry (i.e., sodium, potassium, chloride, creatinin e, glucose, bilirubin (direct, indirect, 
total), ASAT (SGOT), ALAT (SGPT), G amma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)  
• Immunological markers (IgE and IgG 4 specific for D. pte and D. far allergens)  
Blood safety laboratory tests an d measurement of immunological marker s will be performed by a 
subcontracted Central Laboratory. Study  sites will be provided with a separate laboratory manual 
and with laboratory kit material. The laboratory manual contains the sampling, handling and 
shipm ent procedures.  
• Serum and RNA banking  
A serum and RNA bank will be set up . Out of the total 20 mL of drawn blood, approximately 8  mL 
will be used for serum and RNA banking.  
Data  obtained from the serum and RNA banks will not be part of the clinical database. These banks 
will serve for complementary and exploratory immunological analyse s. 
Analyses will be carried out and/or coordinated by STALLERGENES .  
Wherever permitted by local  regulations , the study  sites will be provided with laboratory kit 
material and sampling, handling, and shipment procedures will be specified in the laboratory 
manual. The samples will be stored for a period of up to 10 years after completion of the Clinic al 
Study Report. The results will be provided in a separate report.   
9.2.11  Dust sampling  
In order to document exposure to HDM , dust will be collected by the patient at their residence. At

instructions  will be provided to the patients  (Appendi x IV). Patients will be asked to vacuum 
mattresses and bedding until the filter from the collector  is at least  ¼ full.  
The HDM allergen load will be measured centrally by a subcontracted laboratory .  
9.2.12  Pregnancy Test  
At Visit s 1 and 3, a urinary pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing 
potential.  
Female s are considered not to have childbearing poten tial prior to menarche, at least 2 years after 
menopause,  or if they have had a total hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or ovariectomy.  
Urine pregnancy tests will be provided by STALLERGENES . 
9.2.13  IVRS/IWRS  
Allocation of patients to treatment groups will proc eed through the use of an Interactive Voice 
Response System ( IVRS ) or Interactive Web Response System ( IWRS ). The site will be requested  
by the IVRS/IW RS to enter the protocol number, the Investigator site number and the screening 
number. The caller  will be provided with treatment kit number(s) . 
The call/connection to IVRS/IWRS will be repeated prior to each dispensation of IP. 
9.2.14  Dispensation and Use of the Electronic Diary  (e-diary ) 
At Visit 2, each patient will be provided with a n electronic diary (e -diary) and will be instructed 
by site staff as to how and when to score their allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (i.e.,  itchy 
nose, sneezing, runny nose, bl ocked nose, itchy/red eyes and watery eyes ) and record their use of 
rescue medication. Site staff  should emphasize to the patient the importance of the accurate and 
regular completion of the e -diary. Patients will be asked to bring the device to each visit . 
Symptom scoring and recording of rescue medication use are to be performed daily during the 
5­week run -in period, the two weeks prior to Visits 5, 6, and 7 (interim evaluation periods at 
Months 3, 6, and 9) and during the 4  weeks between Visits 8 and 9 (primary evaluation period, 
Month 12).  
 
The assessment will address symptom intensity over the previous 24  hours and is to be performed 
at the same time every morning after awakening, using the following 4 -point scale:  
0 = no symptom   
1 = mild symptom; symptom clearly present, but mini mal awareness; easily tolerated   
2 = moderate symptom ; definite awareness of s ymptom  that is bothersome but tolerable  
3 = severe symptom; symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with activiti es of daily 
living and/or sleeping

- Patients  will be supplied with antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, and oral corticosteroids 
as rescue medications. Beginning at Visit 2 and thereafter, as necessary through Visit 8, 
antihistamines and intranasal c orticosteroids will be provided to patients for managing allergic 
rhinitis symptoms. If AR symptoms are not sufficiently alleviated despite these treatments, the 
Investigator will evaluate with the patient if systemic corticosteroid is indicated and will 
prescribe this treatment. For a description of the stepwise treatment regimen Section  8.2.2  
“Rescue Medications .” Patients are to record their rescue medication use over the previous 
24 hours.  
- A Visual Analogue Scale  (VAS), comprising 101  pixels (0 -100), ranging from “absence of 
symptoms” (score = 0) to “very severe symptoms” (score = 100), will be completed by the 
patient weekly basis  (at the end of each week)  during the run -in period, the interim evaluation 
periods and the primary evaluation period . 
- The data from the e -diary device will be automatically transmitted to the study database. Patient 
compliance with data recording is to be monitored by the site sta ff via a dedicated web portal. 
In addition, an alert will be sent to the study center in case of patient’s non completion or non 
transmitted data.  
- At Visit 9, the site staff will collect the e -diary device and deactivate it.  
9.2.15  Standardized Rhinoconjunctivit is Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ (S)≥12)  
The RQLQ  was developed to evaluate the impact of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms  on quality of 
life [Juniper et al.,1999 ]. It is designed to evaluate the change in a patient's quality of life over 
some period of time.  The RQLQ(S) ≥12 was developed subsequently to enable the evalu ation of 
adolescents 12 -17 years of age in addition to adults. It consists of 28 questions, divided into seven 
domains as follows: Activities (3 questions), Sleep (3 questions), Non -nose/ eye symptoms (7 
questions), Practical problems (3 questions), Nasal s ymptoms (4 questions), Eye symptoms (4 
questions) and Emotional  (4 questions).  Patients are  asked to recall their experiences during the 
previous week and to give their responses on a 7 -point Likert scale  (lower being better) . 
In this study, t he self -admin istered questionnaire is to be completed by the patient at the study site 
at Visit 3 (before first dosing) and  Visit 9 . 
9.2.16  Global Rating of Change Questionnaire  
The global evaluation of the efficacy of study therapy relative to the allergic symptoms during th e 
baseline evaluation period is to be assess ed by the patient at Visit 9 .  
The following 15 -point Likert scale will be used  [Juniper et al.,1994 ]: 
Symptom improvement:  
1 = Almost the same, hardly any better at all 
2 = a little better  
3 = somewhat better

Impairment Questions (CIQ), Allergy Specific (AS) is a patient -reported quantitative assessment 
of the amount of absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced on -
the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus 
presenteeism) and regular daily activity impairment attributable to allergy (moderate -to-severe 
allergy symptoms).  
It is a 9 -item self -administered questionnaire asses sing the patient’s productivity and allergy -
induced activity impairment during the past seven days.  
This questionnaire will be completed by the patient at the study  site at Visit 3 (before first dosing) 
and at Visit 9 . 
9.2.18  EQ-5D-5L Generic Health -Related Qual ity of L ife 
The EQ -5D describes the patients’ health state using 5 dimensions, namely: 1. Mobility, 2. Self -
care, 3. Usual activities, 4. Pain/Discomfort and 5. Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension  is 
evaluated on a 5 -point scale : no problems / slight proble ms / moderate problems / severe problems 
/ extreme problems. The responses are then transformed into a single index by applying a formula 
that attaches weights to each of the response levels in each dimension. The patients also  assess the ir 
overall health on a VAS ranging from  0 (“the worst health you can imagine ”) to 100 ( “the best

10. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
10.1 Primary Efficacy Variable  
The primary efficacy variable will be the average Total Combined Score ( TCS). The average TCS 
is cal culated for each patient as the average of the non -missing daily TCSs. 
The daily TCS (scale 0 -15) is the sum of the patient ’s daily Rhinitis Total Symptom Score (RTSS , 
scale 0 -12) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS , scale 0 -3).  
The RTSS is defined as the sum of the four rhinitis symptom scores (i.e., itchy nose, sneezing, 
runny nose, and blocked nose ) evaluated daily by the patient. The patient assessment will address 
symptom  intensity o ver the previous 24  hours and will be perfo rmed  at the same time every 
morning, using a 4 -point scale (0 = no symptoms; 1 = mild symptoms (symptom clearly present, 
but minimal awareness; easily tolerated ), 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of symptom  
that is bothersome but tolerable ), 3 = s evere symptoms (symptom that is hard to tolerate; causes 
interference with activities of daily living and/or sleeping).  
If any of the four individual rhinitis symptoms for a given day is missing, then the RTSS for that 
day will be considered missing.  
The RMS is based on the assumptions that a n intranasal corticosteroid  is more effective than an 
antihistamine and an oral corticosteroid is more effective than a n intranasal corticosteroid , leading

to a derived ordinal scale: 0=absent, 1=oral associated or not  with topical (ocular drops) non -
sedative H1 antihistamine (H1A), 2= intranasal corticosteroids (INS)  with or without oral or topical 
(ocular drops) H1A , 3=oral corticosteroids with or without INS or oral or topical (ocular drops) 
H1A . 
If rescue medication data  for a g iven day are missing, then the RM S for that day will be considered 
missing . 
The average TCS will be calculated for each patient and each evaluation period as the average of 
the non -missing daily TCSs during the corresponding period.  
10.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The following variables will be calculated for each evaluation period (baseline, interim, primary):  
10.2.1  Rhinitis Total Symptom S core ( RTSS)  
The daily RTSS  ranges from 0 to 12.  The average RTSS is calculated for each patient as the  average 
of the non -missing daily RTSSs during the evaluation period s.  
10.2.2  Rescue Medication Score  (RMS)  
The Rescue Medication Score (RMS) rang es from 0 to 3. The average RMS is calculated for each 
patient as the average of the non -missing daily RMSs during t he evaluation period s. 
10.2.3  Adjusted Symptom Score (ASS)  
The Adjusted Symptom Score (ASS) rang es from 0 to 12. This score is derived from the daily 
RTSSs, after adjustment for the patient's rescue medication use. It is patient specific, and will take 
into account that patients are permitted to make use of any of the three categories of rescue 
medicat ion [Grouin et al.,2011 ]. 
The ASS is derived as follows:  
- ASS and RTSS are equal the first valid day: ASS 1 = RTSS 1. 
- If a patient did not take rescue medication at day d and the day before (d -1) then: 
ASS d = RTSS d. 
- If a patient took rescue medication at day d, the ASS d will equal the higher value between 
the RTSS at day d  and the ASS of the previous day.  
ASS d = max (RTSS d, ASS d-1) 
ASS d+1 = max (RTSS d+1, ASS d) 
Missing data management:  
- If the R TSS d is missing, the ASS d is missing  
- If the information on rescue medication intake is missing, then: ASS d = RTSS d  
- If a patient  takes rescue medication at day (d) and RTSS d-1 is missing then: ASS d = RTSS d

Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 72 of 123 
 
The patient  estimates the intensity of his/her rhinitis symptoms retrospectively over the previous 
24 hours.  When he/she takes a rescue medication like antihistamine or nasal corticosteroids, this 
rescue medication may impact the symptom score assessment on the day of intake and also on the 
following day. For oral corticosteroids, impact on symptoms probably las ts more than 24 hours and 
an adjustment for more than 2 consecutive days could be considered. However, by doing so, the 
adjustment may be overestimated.  
The average ASS is calculated for each patient as the average of the non -missing daily ASSs during 
the evaluation period s. 
10.2.4  Combined Symptom and  Medication Score ( CSMS )  
The CSMS is a score combining the patient’s daily RTSS and RMS , assuming equivalent 
importance of symptoms and medication scores  [Pfaar et al.,2014 ]. Since the RMS ranges from 0 
to 3 and the RTSS ranges from 0 to 12, the CSMS will be calculated by adding the RMS to the 
RTSS/4, in orde r to obtain com parable scales. Thus  
CSMS = RTSS/4 + RMS resulting in a daily CSMS ranging from  0 to 6. 
10.2.5  Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS)  
The Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) rang es from 0 to 6. TOSS is calculated as the sum of 
individual scores for itchy/red eyes and wa tery eyes ( each on a scale 0-3). The average TOSS is 
calculated for each patient as the average of the non -missing daily TOSSs during the evaluation 
period s.  
10.2.6  Rhin oconjunctiv itis Total Symptom S core ( RCTSS)  
The daily RCTSS ranges from 0 to 18 . RCTSS  is calculated as the sum of the four rhinitis  scores  
and the two ocular scores  (each on a scale 0 -3). The average R CTSS is calculated for each patient 
as the average of the non -missing daily R CTSSs during the evaluation period s.  
10.2.7  Six Individual Rhinoconju nctivitis Symptom Scores (RSSs)  
The severity of the six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms ( itchy nose, sneezing, runny nose, blocked 
nose, itchy/red eyes and watery eyes during the previous 24  hours will be scored using a 4 -point 
scale (0: Absence, 1: Mild, 2: Moderate, 3: Severe).  The average of each of the six individual RSSs 
is calculated for each patient as the average of the non -missing daily RSSs during the evaluation 
period s. 
10.2.8  Rhinoconjunctivitis Rescue Medication Usage 
The rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medication usage (yes/no) , overall and by type of treatment,  will be  
recorded on the e -diary during all the evaluation period s.

10.2.9  Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)  
At the end of each week of the evaluation periods, patients will assess the intensity of their allergic 
rhinitis symptoms using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) , ranging from “absence of symptoms” (score 
= 0) to “very severe symptoms” (score = 100)  [Jamison et al.,2002 ; Bousquet et al.,2009 ]. 
The average VAS is calculated for each patient as the average of the non -missing weekly VAS 
scores  during the evaluation period . 
10.2.10  Proportion of Symptom -Controlled Days (PSCD)  
The PSCD is defined for each patient during the evaluation periods as the proportion of days (%) 
in the  evaluation period where RTSS  ≤2 and no rescue medication is used (RMS=0), i.e. , PSCD 2­0. 
This variable  will be calculated for the baseline , interim and primary evaluation periods.   
10.2.11  Proportion of Not-Controlled Days (P NCD)  
The PNCD is  defined for each patient during the evaluation periods as the proportion of days (%) 
with: 
- At least one individual rhinitis symptom score = 2 and RMS>0, or  
- At least two individual rhinitis symptom scores = 2 whatever the RMS, or  
- At least o ne individual rhinitis symptom score = 3 whatever the RMS  
This variable  will be calculated for the baseline , interim and primary evaluation periods.  
10.2.12  Controlled patients (CP)  
Controlled patients are defined as follows:  
CP75 2-0: Patients with at le ast 75% of the days with RTSS  ≤2 and no rescue medication used 
(controlled for at least three quarters of the  days in the  evaluation period s). 
This variable  will be calculated for the baseline , interim and primary evaluation periods.  
10.2.13  Standardized Rhinoconjunct ivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ (S)≥12) scores  
The RQLQ (S)≥12 consists of 28 questions, divided into 7 domains (activities (3 items), sleep (3), 
non-nose/eye symptoms (7), practical problems (3), nasal symptoms (4), eye symptoms (4) and 
emotions (4)), each question being evaluated on a 7 -point Likert scale, from 0 to 6 (lower being 
better). All items are weighted equally. The score for each domain is the mean of the items in that 
domain (provided that all items of the domain are completed ), while the overall RQLQ (S)≥12 score 
is the mean of all items (provided that the 28 items are completed ). The RQLQ (S)≥12 will be used 
for both adult and adolescent patients.  
This quality of life variable  will be calculated at Visit 3 (before treatment) and Vi sit 9 (end of 
treatment period).

10.2.14  EQ-5D-5L Generic Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaire  
The EQ -5D-5L describes the patients’ health state using 5 questions assessing 5 dimensions, 
namely: 1.  Mobility, 2.  Self-care, 3.  Usual activities, 4.  Pain/Discomfort and 
5. Anxiety/Depression. Each question is evaluated on a 5 -point scale . The patients also  self-rate 
their overall health on a VAS ranging from  0 (“the worst health you can imagine ”) to 100 ( “the 
best health you can imagine ”). 
This quality of life variable  will be calculated at Visit 3 (before treatment) and Vi sit 9 (end of 
treatment period).  
10.2.15  Global Rating of Change  Score (GRCS)  
The GRCS measured on the Global Rating of Change questionnaire, is a global assessment of the 
treatment efficacy compared to the baseline evaluation period  on a 15 -point Likert scale .  
This variable will be assessed at Vi sit 9 (end of treatment period).  
10.3 Other Varia bles 
10.3.1  Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom 
Impairment Questions : Allergy Specific  (WPAI + CIQ : AS) 
The questionnaire is divided in 3 parts: work performance (4 questions), school performance 
(4 questions) and impact of allergic rhino -conjunctivitis on the daily activities (one question). 
Seven scores, expressed as percentages, will be calculated from the questions  at baseline (Visit 3) 
and at the end of the treatment  (Visit 9) . 
10.3.2  Immunological Markers (IgE and IgG 4) 
D. pte  and D. far  specific serum IgE and IgG 4 will be assayed at  Visit 1 (before treatment) and 
Visit 9 (after 12 months of treatment).  
10.4 Exploratory Variables  
10.4.1  Candidate Biomarkers  
The c andidate biomarkers to be assayed will be listed in a separate document . 
10.5 Baseline Characteristics  
The baseline characteristics are: gender, date of birth, ethnic origin, height, weight , start date of 
HDM -associated AR, asthma status , FEV 1 measurements , and Skin Prick Tests results.  
The following baseline variables wil l be derived/calculated:  
- Age, age class, Body Mass Index (BMI)  
- Duration of allergic rhinitis

- Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire scores plus Classroom questions  
- Baseline HDM exposure level asse ssed by the content of mite group 1 allergen per gram of 
dust in the sample collected at the patients’ residence. This variable will be categorized as:  
• HDM exposure level ≥2 μg of mite group 1 allergen per gram of dust  
• HDM exposure level <2 μg of mite grou p 1 allergen per gram of dust  
The baseline values will correspond to the last evaluation before the first IP intake  in the treatment 
period .  
10.6 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing the Efficacy Variables  
A one -year treatment period is considered  adequate for assess ing the efficacy of allergen 
immunotherapy  [Burks et al.,2013 ].Therefore, the  primary efficacy variable , the average TCS , will 
be assessed  at the end of the 12 months of treatment.  
For specific immunotherapy, onset of efficacy is not expected in the first weeks  of treatment. 
Therefore, in  this study , the first interim evaluation period for efficacy is at Month 3.  
The methods and timing for assessing and recording the efficacy variables are found in Section  9 
“Study Procedures ”. 
The analysis methods are found in Section  12 “Statistics” . 
11. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
11.1 Specifications of Safety Variables

The methods and timing for assessing and recording the safety variabl es are described in 
Section  3.6 “Flow Chart ” and Section 9.3 “Visit by Visit  Description ”. 
 
The analysis methods are described in Section  11.3 “Adverse Events ”. 
11.3 Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for recording all AEs experienced by the patient from the time the 
Informed Consent Form is signed until the patient is discharged from the study.  
At each visit, t he patient  will be given the opportunity to report AEs.  
A gener al prompt will also be given:  
“Did you notice anyt hing unusual about your health since your last visit?”  
In addition, the Investigator should review all patient  self-assessment tools  for information 
regarding AEs . 
11.3.1  Definitions  
11.3.1.1  Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject  administered a n investigational product  (IP) and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavo rable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered related to the IP. 
Signs or symptoms of the condition/disease for which the IP is being studied should be recorded  
as AEs only if their nature changes considerably or their frequency or intensity increases in a 
clinically significant manner as compared to the clinical profile known to the Investigator from the 
patient’s history or the baseline period . 
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered  as an AE rather than the procedure itself.  
The following guidelines and definitions should be used by the Investigator for the description of 
an AE when reporting information.  
Nature of the Adverse Event  
It should be preferably an overall diagnosis or syndrome, rather than individual symptoms or signs. 
The Investigator must report AEs using standard medical terminology. The same terms must be 
used in the source documentation and in the e -CRF. Any discrepancies between the patient’s own 
words on his/her own record (i.e. , “AE/Conc omitant  Medication ” card) and the corresponding 
medical terminology should be clarified in the source documentation.

Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 77 of 123 
 
Assessment of Severity of the Adverse Event  
Investigators must assess the severity of AE according to the following qualitative scale. The 
severity grade does not reflect the clinical seriousness of the event only the degree or extent of the 
affliction or o ccurrence (e.g. , severe nausea, mild seizure), and does not reflect the relationship to 
Investigational Product (IP).  
- Mild : The patient is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily tolerated 
and not interfering with his/her daily ac tivity.  
- Moderate : The patient experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce his/her 
daily activity.  
- Severe : Significant impairment for the patient who is unable to carry out his/her daily activit y. 
An AE reflecting  a change in severity grad e should be reported o n two separate lines with 
respective severity grade. The Investigator’s original description of the AE must be the same for 
the first and repeated AE, so that they are code d with the same dictionary term. The outcome date 
of the first  AE should be the same as the start date of the repeated AE, and the outcome of the first 
AE should be ticked for data management purpose, as resolved.  
Example:  
Adverse Event  Severity  Start Date  End Date  Outcome  
Headache  Mild  01-MAR -2012  03-MAR -2012  Resolved  
Headache  Moderate  03-MAR -2012  Ongoing  Not Resolved  
In the case of local side effects, the grade “severe” should be considered only when these local side 
effects lead to the perm anent discontinuation of the IP [Passalacqua et al.,2013 ]. 
Occurrence  
- Intermittent: An AE which occurs repeatedly with the same intensity with an inte rval of less 
than 24 hours between occurrences. There are intervals within the specified time period when 
the AE is not present.  
- Continuous:  The AE is present with the same intensity for the entire time period specified. 
There is no time at which the event  abates or is not present during the time period specified.  
Action taken with the Investigational Product following AE occurrence:  
- Not applicable : For AEs occurring before the IP is administered or occurring after the 
administration of the IP was stopped.  
- Dose not changed : IP dosing remained the same in spite of an AE being present.  
- Drug interrupted : IP usage is temporarily discontinued because of the AE, either because the 
patient chooses to interrupt the IP or the physician feels it is in the patient’s be st interest to 
temporarily discontinue the IP.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 78 of 123 
 
- Drug withdrawn : IP usage is permanently discontinued because of the AE, either because the 
patient chooses to discontinue the IP or the physician feels it is in the patient’s best interest to 
discontinue the I P. 
Other action taken following AE occurrence:  
Any other action taken in response to an AE is to be selected as:  
- None : No other action was taken for the AE.  
- Medication : The patient took a medication (either prescription or non-prescription) 
specifically for the AE.  
- Emergency visit  
- Therapeutic or diagnostic procedure : The patient used other therapeutic measures (for 
example, ice, heating pad, brace or cast) or the patient under went  a diagnostic procedure (for 
example, additio nal lab test or X -ray) for the AE.  
Outcome at the time of last observation  
- Resolved : The AE is no longer present at any severity grade - symptoms have completely 
abated or returned to baseline value in case of worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
- Resolve d with sequelae : The patient recovered from the event but retained pathological 
conditions resulting from the AE. 
- Not resolved : The AE has not resolved, and is still present either with the same severity grade 
(or has not returned to the baseline value in case of worsening of a pre -existing condition)  or is 
improv ing. 
- Fatal : The AE directly caused or contributed to the patient’s death. In this case a Serious 
Adverse Event ( SAE ) form must be completed.  
- Unknown : There is no information available on the outcom e of the AE.  
Assessment of Relationship to the Investigational Product  
Investigators must systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IP using the following 
definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment include, but may not be limited to , temporal 
relationship between the AE and IP, known adverse reactions, medical history, concomitant 
medication, course of the underlying disease, alternative etiology, etc.  
The relationship between the administration of IP and the occurrence of the AE is described as 
belonging to one of the two following categories:  
- Not suspected : The event is n ot suspected to be reasonably related to the IP and could not 
medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP. A reasonable alternative 
explanation  must be available.  
- Suspected : The event is  suspected to be reasonably related to the IP and could medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP.

11.3.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at 
any dose:  
- Results in death,  
- Is life -threatening*,  
- Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatients hospitalization**,  
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
- Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect,  
- Is otherwise considered as medically significant***.  
* Life -threatening refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at time of 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more 
severe.  
** The following hospita lizations may not be considered serious:  
- Hospitalization planned before entry into the clinical study,  
- Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition,  
- Consultation in an emergency ward, on outpatient basis and which do not result in ove rnight 
hospitalization (unless fulfilling one of the above criteria).  
*** Medically significant events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered as SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, th ey 
may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above (e.g. , an event such as bronchospasm that requires intensive treatment 
but does not result in hospitalization).  
Any suspected tr ansmission of an infectious agent via the IP is also considered a SAE.  
11.3.1.3  Pre-defined Adverse Event of Special Interest  
An Adverse Event of Special Interest (AESI) is a noteworthy event that requires careful 
monitoring. It could be serious or non -serious .  
Special attention should be paid to any symptoms evoking one the 4 following clinical pictures 
fulfilling the definition of an AESI:  
- Severe anaphylactic reactions,  
- Severe laryngo pharyngeal  disorders,  
- Autoimmune disorders , 
- Eosinophilic esophagitis . 
AESIs will  be identified and reviewed during the Data Review Meeting (DRM).

11.3.2  Reporting  
11.3.2.1  Reporting of AE  
All AEs will be actively sought for at each visit. Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs, 
whether spontaneously reported by the patient, discovered by I nvestigator questioning, or detected 
through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be reported on an ongoing basis 
in the e -CRF in the "Adverse events" section and followed as appropriate.  
If an AE is still present at the time the e -CRF is being locked, a follow -up report shall be provided 
later on. If no follow -up report is provided, the Investigator shall provide a justification.  
If a patient is withdrawn from treatment due to safety reasons, the patient should be followed until 
the e vent resolves or the patient’s condition has stabilized.  
For each AE, the Investigator should specify its nature, start date, time to onset between last IP 
intake and AE occurrence , duration (if less than 24 hours), stop date, occurrence, action(s) taken 
with IP, other(s) action(s) taken and outcome. The Invest igator should evaluate the event in terms 
of severity, relationship to IP, and seriousness.  
Specific guidance can be found in the e -CRF completion guidelines provided by the Sponsor or 
designee.  
All AEs occurring during the study (from signature of the In formed Consent Form/Assent Form to 
last visit) must be reported , even if no IP was taken.  
 
Medical conditions present at the initial study  visit and that do not worsen in severity or frequency 
during the study  are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions, and are NOT to be considered as 
AEs. 
11.3.2.2  Reporting of SAE and Serious AESI  
All SAEs  including serious  AESIs, as defined above, whether or not considered as related to IP, 
must be transmitted acc ording to the follow ing process:  
SAEs including  serious AESIs must be reported by the Investigator immediately (i.e. , within a 
maximum of 24 hours of occurrence or Investigator’s awareness) by fax or email (relevant contact 
name, fax number and email address can be found in t he Investigator Site File).  
The Investigator must duly complete the SAE form even if the data are incomplete or if it is obvious 
that more data will be needed to draw any conclusions. Reporting procedures and timelines are the 
same for any follow -up inform ation.  
Additional information (e.g. , lab data, hospital report) should be provided to the Sponsor or 
designee in a timely manner to ensure accurate follow -up of each case. SAEs and serious AESIs 
must be followed up until resolution or until stabilization. If needed, the Sponsor or designee may 
contact the Investigator to obtain further relevant information regarding a SAE or a serious AESI.  
All SAEs and serious AESIs occurring during the study (from signature of the Informed Consent 
Form/Assent Form to last  visit) must be reported even if no IP was taken.

After the end of the study, it is the Investigator’s obligation to report to the Sponsor any SAE of 
which he becomes aware and that he considers as possibly related to the IP, if the SAE occurs up 
to 30 day s after the last IP administration.  
SAE occurring after the study  
SAEs occurring after the study completion and considered related to the IP have to be reported 
directly to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., within a maximum of 24 hours of occurrence or 
Inves tigator’s awareness ). 
Sponsor fax number: +33 1 55 59 26 62 or email: pharmacovigilance@stallergenes.com  and copy 
to STALLERGENES  Clinical Project Manager.  
Safety reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators  
The Sponsor is responsible for complying with the applicable requirements related to adverse 
experiences by reporting to the appropriate Health Authorities, Ethics Committees and 
Investigators.  
The Investiga tor must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs involving patients to the Ethics Committees that approved the study . 
11.4 Unblinding  
Under normal circumstances, the treatment blind must be maintained . 
In the case of medical emergency in which knowledge of the  treatment  allocation is considered by 
the Investigator as critical in managing the patient ’s condition, the Investigator will utilize 
IVRS/IWRS  and use the unblinding functions . In case of technical issues  with the IVRS/IWRS 
system , the Investigator will contact either the responsible person from the Pharmacovigilance 
department  or primary CRO  designee  to unblind the patient . 
If the blind is broken, the date, the reason for breaking the blind, and person doing so is to be 
recorded on the source document, and in the appropriate e -CRF page, and STALLERGENES  or 
its representative must be notified immediately.  Once the randomization code has been broken, the 
particular patient’s data will no longer be considered eligible for the “ Per Protocol ” set efficacy 
analysis.  
However, when the unblinding was only performed by the Pharmacovigilance department for an 
adverse event declaration to the regulatory authorities,  and not shared with the investigators or 
study staff, then the patient’s data will still be considered as blinded . The patient’s data  will be 
valid for the “P er Protocol ” set efficacy analyses if the patient is otherwise valid.  
11.5 Overdose  
During the study , any daily intake superior to the dose specified in the protocol will be recorded  as 
a misuse . When the data are unblinded, a ny daily intake of at least 400 IR will be considered as a n 
overdose . 
Symptoms associated with a misuse  must be recorded as AEs.

11.6 Pregnancy  
A newly diagnosed pregnancy itself will not be considered as an AE unless it is suspected that the 
IP interacted with a contraceptive method or had some association with the occurrence of 
pregnancy.  
A cong enital anomaly, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillborn, neonatal death or birth defect 
as a pregnancy outcome is a SAE.  
Before study enrolment, female patients of childbearing potential must be advised of the 
importance of avoiding a pregnancy duri ng their study participation. Pregnancy should be avoided 
for the duration of the study so as to ensure that any possible risk to the embryo, fetus and baby be 
minimized.  All females of childbearing potential must be willing to undergo a urine pregnancy te st 
before any IP is administered . 
For all pregnancies confirmed after the first IP administration , the Investigator must complete a 
pregnancy notification form which must be transmitted according to the same process as described 
for SAE reporting. The Spon sor must be notified without delay. Patient must be withdrawn from 
the study. Investigators must actively follow -up, document and report on the outcome of all 
pregnancies, including prenat al and neonatal outcome, even after  the patients are withdrawn from 
the study . Infants will be followed for a minimum of 6  months. Protocol -required procedures for 
clinical study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed unless contra -indicated by the 
pregnancy. Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should  be considered if indicated.  
11.7 Management of Adverse Events and Patient Discontinuation from Study  
11.7.1  Adverse Event Necessitating Temporary Discontinuation of the IP  
In case of oral surgery, including dental extraction or any intervention affecting oral mucosa , IP 
administration should be stopped until complete healing.  
Whenever IP has to be discontinued temporarily, IP may be restarted at the dosage of last intake. 
Should the interruption period be longer than 7  days, it is recommended to restart the treatmen t 
under medical supervision, at the dosage of last intake.  
11.7.2  Patient Discontinuation from Study  
It is ultimately the Investigator’s decision as to whether or not to withdraw a patient from the study  
in case of an AE. 
In the occurrence of one of the following events, patients will be systematically discontinued from 
the study and the IP should be stopped:  
- an anaphylactic reaction  
- or a severe laryngopharyngeal reaction

- or eosinophilic esophagitis(*) confirmed by charact eristic findings on 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and histologic analysis of EGD biopsies .  
(*)Patients with symptoms suggestive of esophagitis will be assessed in accordance with Appendix 
VI “Management of Suspected Esopha gitis”.  
11.7.3  Management of Adverse Events  
Management of AEs is at the discretion of the Investigator.  
11.8 Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board Review  
An independent DSMB will be responsible for assuring that study patients are not exposed to 
unnecessary or unreasonable risks and that the study is being conducted according to high scientific 
and ethical standards. Specifically, the DSMB will:  
• assess the performance of the study with respect to patient recruitment, retention and 
follow -up, proto col adherence, and data quality and completeness, in order to ensure the 
likelihood of successful and timely study completion,  
• blindly assess the overall safety and re -assess the risk/benefit of the study on a regular 
basis.  
12. STATISTICS  
The statistical methods are summarized below and will be developed and finalized  prospectively 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  before unblinding . All analyses will be carried out using 
SAS® Version 9. 4. 
Unless otherwise specified, all variables will  be summarized descriptively by treatment group (and 
overall for initial characteristics only) as follows:  
• continuous variables will be summarized descriptively using summary statistics (number 
of subjects, number of missing values, mean, Standard Deviatio n [SD], 95% two -sided 
Confidence Interval [ CI] of the mean, minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, 
and maximum) . 
• categorical variables will be presented using absolute and relative frequencies and 95% CIs 
for each class of the studied parameter, where appropriate . 
For all analyses, the probability of a type I error will be set at 5% and the confidence level at 95% 
for CI. All inferential tests will be two -sided tests.  
 
In order to control the overall type I error  and to draw robust conclusions wi th regard to the key 
secondary endpoints, a  step-down sequential closed testing procedure will be applied on six  
secondary endpoints if the primary endpoint is statistically significant. The key secondary 
endpoints  will be tested in the following order:

• 1. Rhini tis Total Symptom Score (RTSS ) during the primary evaluation period  
• 2. Overall score of Rhin oconjunctivitis  Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at the end of 
the treatment period  
• 3. Rhin oconjunctiv itis Total Symptom Score (R CTSS) during the primary evaluation period  
• 4. Blocked nose  symptom score during the primary evaluation period  
• 5. Proportion of Symptom -Controlled D ays ( PSCD, proportion of days with RTSS≤ 2 and 
no rescue medication use) during the primary evaluation period  
• 6. Rescue Medicat ion Score (RMS) during the primary evaluation period  
12.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The primary endpoint is the average TCS defined, for each patient, as the average of the non -
missing daily TCSs over the last four weeks prior to the end of the treatment per iod. 
As recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), t he clinical relevance of the 
efficacy results on the primary endpoint is pre -defined as follows  [Nelson et al.,2017 ]: 
• The relative difference of the TCS versus  placebo should be ‐15%, and  
• The upper bound of the 95% CI of the TCS relative difference versus  placebo should be 
‐10% 
In the European study VO57.07 [Bergmann et al., 2014 ] conducted in 509 patients,  the analysis of 
the average TCS showed a placebo mea n of 3.65 and a relative mean difference of ‐17% between 
groups with a 95% CI of [ ‐30% ; ‐3%]. The CV was of 67% in the placebo group and 77% in the 
active group.  
Based on this  95% CI (i.e., [‐30% ; ‐3%]) , an expected  relative difference versus  placebo of ‐20% 
was considered as a possible and reasonable value for the true relative difference between both 
groups . Besides, a  CV of 75% was assumed to account for a possible higher variability of the data in 
this international study ( i.e., North America, Europe, Israel and Russia).  
Thus, assuming  a two -sided nominal level of significance of 5%, a relative difference versus 
placebo of ‐20%, a placebo mean of 3.65, and a CV of 75%, simulations were performed based on 
5,000  samples and show ed that 739 evaluable patients per treatment group  were sufficient to 
achieve a power of around 80% so as to fulfill  both requirements (estimated re lative difference 
versus placebo ≤‐15% and  upper bound of the 95% CI ≤‐10%).  
Of note, with the same assumptions and  739 evaluable patients per treatment group, the power of 
detecting a significant difference between both groups  is greater than 99%.   
Assuming a drop -out rate of 15% during the study, a total of 1,740  randomized patients  
(870 patients per group ) will be required to ensure that 1,478  patients are included in the primary 
efficacy analysis. The screen failure rate is estimated at 50%, leading to a planned total number of 
screened patients of 3,4 80.

12.2 Definition of Clinical  Relevance of the E fficacy Results  
As recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), the clinical relevance of the 
efficacy results on the primary endpoint is pre -defined as follows  [Nelson et al.,2017 ]: 
• The relative difference of the TCS versus  placebo should be ‐15%, and  
• The upper bound of the 95% CI of the TCS relative difference versus  placebo should be 
‐10% 
See Section  12.5.2  “Primary Efficacy Analysis ” for the definition of the relative difference and its 
95% CI.  
Based on his torical data obtained with STG320 in study VO57.07 [Bergmann et al.,2014 ], it is 
expected that the baseline average Total Combined Score (TCS) will be close to 7. Thus, a 
clinically meaningful effect of 15% in a given patient with an initial TCS of 7 would correspond 
to an improvement of about 1 point (15% of 7 is 1.08). More s pecifically, this threshold may be 
illustrated using e.g., the two following clinical cases:  
• With an initial TCS of 7 and a constant RM intake, the patient will benefit from a symptom 
improvement of 1 point corresponding to a change of one severity class in one symptom 
e.g., from “severe” to “moderate”  
• With an initial TCS of 7 and a stable symptom severity, the patient will experience a 
decrease of one step in RM intake e.g., s/he will stop the intranasal corticosteroids (from 
step 2: intranasal corticost eroids with or without antihistamine to step 1: antihistamine) or 
s/he will not take rescue medication anymore (from step 1: antihistamine to no rescue 
medication)  
This clinical benefit is expected to last all year round as HDM allergic rhinitis induces pe rennial 
symptoms.  
12.3 Determination of Study Population for Analysis  
Safety Set:  
The Safety Set will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the IP.  
All safety analyses will use the Safety Set.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS):  
In order to be as close as possible to the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) principle, the Full Analysis Set will 
include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the IP and have at least one 
primary efficacy evaluation during a treatment period, (i.e., at least on e day with a valid TCS during 
one of the evaluation periods ). 
The FAS will be the primary analysis set for all efficacy analys es (primary, secondary, exploratory 
and other analyses ). 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 86 of 123 
 
Per Protocol Set (PPS):  
The Per Protocol Set will include all patients in the FAS who complied with the study protocol 
without any major protocol deviations and had at least 14 days with a valid TCS during the primary 
evaluation period.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be repli cated in the PPS.  
The definition of protocol deviations (minor or major) will be specified in the SAP. The 
classification of the protocol deviations as minor or major will be performed during the Data 
Review Meeting (DRM) before unblinding of the data.  
12.4 Handling of Missing and Incomplete D ata 
Missing data will be handled according to the guideline on missing data in confirmatory trials 
(Guideline on Missing Data in Confirmatory Clinical Trials EMA/CPMP/EWP/1776/99 Rev.1, 
2010).  
If any of the individual rh inoconjunctivitis symptom scores or rescue medication data for a given 
day are missing, the TCS, RTSS, ASS, TOSS , RMS  including the missing score(s) for that day will 
be considered missing. Average scores will be calculated using the non -missing days in th e 
respective evaluation period.  
The proportion of valid TCS days during the primary period will be summarized by treatment group 
in the FAS in order to evaluate the extent of missing TCS data.  
In order to prevent missing data, patients who discontinued  the treatment before the first interim 
evaluation period (i.e. , before 3 months of treatment) will be asked to continue the study (without 
study treatment) until Visit 5 ( i.e., until the end of the first interim evaluation period ). Patients will 
be asked  to score their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and rescue medication use on the e -diary 
during the first interim evaluation period .  
In addition, different sensitivity analyses will be investigated and developed prospectively in the 
SAP, to assess the robustness of the primary analysis w ith regard to missing data. These  include 
but are not limited to the following:  
• Pattern -Mixture M odels  (PMMs)  with reference -based imputation methods using each interim 
evaluation period and the primary period as repeated measures . These multivariate models 
implem ent Missing N ot At Random  assumptions using multiple imputation s 
• Mixed Model with Repeated M easures ( MMRM ) with each interim evaluation period and the 
primary period as repeated measures. This multivariate model applies a missing at random 
assumption and is a direct likelihood method in which information from the observed data is 
used via the within -patie nt correlation structure to provide information about the unobserved 
data  
• Last Observation Carried F orward ( LOCF ) as a single imputation method that imputes the last 
measured outcome value for patients who either drop out or for whom the final outcome 
measurement is missing

12.5 Efficacy analyses  
12.5.1  Evaluation Periods  
Rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms and rescue medication use will be recorded daily on the e-diary  at 
the following periods:  
- baseline period (placebo run -in): last 4 weeks of the 5 -week run -in period  
- interim evaluation periods: 2 weeks every 3 months after randomization (i.e., Month 3, Month  6 
and Month 9 ), 
- primary period: 4 weeks prior to the end of the treatment period . 
12.5.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary variable , the average TCS, will be summariz ed descriptively . The square root of the 
average TCS  will be analyzed in the FAS during the primary evaluation period using an Analysis 
of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment group as main effect and pooled center, the square root 
of the baseline average TC S, age class (adolescent , adult), gender, asthma status (presence/absence) 
and sensitization status (mono -/poly -sensitized) as covariates.  
Patients in the FAS having no efficacy evaluation during the primary period (i.e., no valid 
assessment) will not be p art of the primary analysis . They will be included in the sensitivity 
analyses to assess the robustness of the primary analysis with regard to missing data.  
Due to the high number of cente rs, a pooli ng of the centers will be considered  to ensure a sufficient 
number of patients in each treatment group at each level of the covariate “pooled center”. The 
pooling will be performed during the DRM before unblinding of the data  and according to the 
geographic area.  
The LS means of square root -transformed a verage TCS will be assessed in each treatment group. 
The back -transformed LS means will be calculated in each treatment group.  The point estimate , 
i.e., the LS mean difference,  will be calculated from the back -transformed LS means . 
The corresponding relati ve LS mean difference (%)  will be derived as follows:  
Relative LS mean difference (%) = [(active LS mean  - placebo LS mean) / placebo LS mean] * 
100 
Both the 95% CI for the LS mean difference and the 95% CI for the relative LS mean difference 
(%), will be calculated using bootstrap method.  
 
Supportive analys es 
• The primary efficacy analysis will be repeated in the PPS.  
• The average TCS will be analyzed in the FAS during the primary evaluation period using 
a Wilcoxon rank -sum test (non-parametric method).

Sensitivity analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will include PMMs, a MMRM for the four evaluation periods and primary 
analysis of the average TCS during the primary evaluation period using LOCF method.  
Sensitivity analyses are described  in Section 12.4 “Handling of Missing and Incomplete D ata”. 
Summary statistics  
The average TCS during each evaluation period will be summarized descriptively and graphically 
by treatment group in the FAS.  
The average TCS during the primary evaluati on period will be summarized descriptively per 
treatment group by each level of each covariate.  The average TCS during the primary evaluation 
period will also be described:  
- in the PPS without imputation of missing data  
- in the FAS with imputation of missing data using LOCF method  
12.5.3  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted in the FAS.  
If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, the six  key secondary endpoints will be tested 
in the following order:  
• 1. Rhini tis Total Symptom Score (RTSS ) during the primary evaluation period  
• 2. Overall score of Rhin oconjunctivitis  Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) at the end of 
the treatment period  
• 3. Rhin oconjunctiv itis Total Symptom Score (R CTSS) during the primar y evaluation period  
• 4. Blocked nose  symptom score during the primary evaluation period  
• 5. Proportion of Symptom -Controlled D ays ( PSCD, proportion of days with RTSS≤ 2 and 
no rescue medication use) during the primary evaluation period  
• 6. Rescue Medication Sc ore (RMS) during the primary evaluation period  
The analysis of the non -ranked  secondary endpoints will be considered supportive and will 
contribute to document the consistency of the study results.  
 
The average  of RTSS, RMS, ASS, CSMS, TOSS , RCTSS  and each of the six average individual 
RSSs (calculated as the average of the non -missing daily scores) during the primary evaluation 
period will be analyzed similarly to the average TCS using the corresponding baseline scores 
(except PPS analysis  and sen sitivity analyses). They will be summarized descriptively during each 
evaluation period.

efficacy variable using the corresponding baseline scores (except PPS analysis  and sensitivity 
analyses).  
The EQ -5D-5L health profile (5 questions) and EQ -5D-5L VAS score will be summarized 
descri ptively.  
The GRCS  will be analyzed by means of a Cochran Mantel -Haenszel test (row mean score statistic) 
using pooled centers as a stratification variable. The proportions of improved patients will be 
compared between groups using a ² test or Fisher exact  test. 
12.6 Other Analyses  
The WPAI + CIQ: AS  scores will be summarized descriptively. Percentage of impairment for each 
score will be calculated and described.

presented as  voluntary and the  patient has to understand that s/he will be able to  stop, at any time, 
her/his  participation without any consequences  for her/his  future medical management  or 
treatment s. The patient and parent(s)/legal representative must be informed that the anonymity of 
her/his identity will be guaranteed , especially during the analy sis of the  patient’s  personal data. 
They will be  encouraged to ask any questions they may have  about the study  and they should  
receive relevant answers. They will receive complete written information on the study in the 
“Patient  Information Sheet”.  
The Investigator will take into consideration that the parent(s)/legal representative, since they bear 
the responsibility of the adolescent , might need more detailed and explicit information and hence 
more time , to consider the expected benefits and potential risks of the study .

13.2.2  Informed Consent / Assent  
All the participating patients will have to document their consent to participate in the study by 
signing and dating an informed consent form. Adolescents from the age of  16 years old are  
considered of appropriate  intellectual maturity and capable of giving their assent  to participate in 
the study and  they should personally sign and date the specifically designed assent form.  Younger 
patients will receive the information regarding the study,  adapted to the patient’s age, and their 
consent will be sought by the investigators. Adolescent parents/  legal representative  will have to 
sign the informed consent form.  
If the signature of a witness is required, the witness should sign and date the consent form , next to  
the patient ’s own signature . By signing the consent form, the witness testifies  that the relevant 
information regarding the study was accurately explained to and apparentl y understood by the 
patient and that the informed consent was freely given by the patient.  
All the  forms will also be dated and signed by the Investigator or the design ated person  who 
obtained the informed consent/assent according to local regulation s. Informed consent procedure 
will be documented  in the patient’s medical source data and in the e-CRF.  
The patient or/and parent(s)/legal representative will receive a copy of the corresponding form (s) 
and the original (s) will be filed in the Investigator’s Tri al File.  
The patient may withdraw his/her consent to his/her study  participation at any time , without any 
justification . 
A patient is considered as enrolled in the study  when he/she or/and his/her parent(s)/legal 
representative have signed the informed con sent/assent form. A n e-CRF must not be started, nor 
may any study  specific procedure be performed before having obtained his/her or/and 
parent(s)/legal representative written consent/assent. The Investigator will keep a patient screening 
log to document id entification of patients who were  screen ed for the study . 
If any new information that could influence the patient and/or parent(s)/legal representative 
decision to remain  in the study  becomes available, it will be communicated without delay to the 
patient or/and parent(s)/legal representative.  
13.3 Patient  Confidentiality  
Patient ’s identification and data confidentiality is to be strictly ensured  at any times.  
Personnel from the Sponsor (or its representative), from Regulatory Authorities and members of 
IRB/IEC  may inspect patient ’s medical records and e-CRFs for verification of accuracy of data and 
have to  comply with  strict medical secrecy and are forbidden  disclosing the patient's identity or 
any other patient’s personal information.  
13.4 Informing the General  Practitioner  
When legally required  or if considered  as necessary by the Investigator , and if the patient agrees, 
the Investigator will inform the patient’s regular physician of his/her participation in the study , by 
sending him/her a “letter to the GP” p repared by the Sponsor or the Investigator.

14. STUDY  MANAGEMENT AND ADMI NISTRATION  
14.1 Monitoring  
STALLERGENES  may subcontract  with a Contract Research Organization  (CRO) to perform  all 
monitoring responsibilities  for this clinical study. The CRO’s monitors will work in accordance 
with the defined monitoring SOPs and have the same rights and responsibilities as m onitors from 
STALLERGENES . Monitors will establish and maintain regular contact s between the investigator 
and STALLERGENES . 
The monit or will advise the Investigator regarding the practical conduct of the study  and assist 
him/her in working according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the regulatory 
requirements.  
The Investigator will allow the Sponsor or its representati ves to periodically monitor all e -CRFs 
and the corresponding source documents, at mutually convenient times during the study  and after 
it has been completed. The monitor will have direct access to these records. The monitoring visits 
provide the Sponsor or  its representatives with the opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study , 
to verify the accuracy and completeness of e -CRFs, to ensure that all protocol requirements, 
applicable local authority regulations and Investigator's obligations are being fu lfilled, and to 
resolve any inconsistencies in the study  records.  
14.2 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
The Investigator(s) and/or Institution(s) will permit study -related monitoring, audits by or on behalf 
of STALLERGENES , IRB /IEC  and regulatory inspecto r(s), and authorized direct access to source 
data/documents.  
Source documents are original records in which raw patient data are recorded. These may be: 
hospital / clinic / General Practitioner (GP) records, charts, diaries, X -rays, SPT and laboratory 
results, spirometry, ECG and other printouts, pharmacy records, care records, completed 
psychometric scales, diary cards, Quality of Life questionnaires, etc.  
Directly entered data in the e -diaries / e -CRF will be considered as source data . 
All source document s must be accurate, clear, unambiguous, and readily auditable. They should be 
generated by using a permanent mean s of recording ( e.g., ink, typing, prin ting, optical disc ). 
Hospital/Clinic/Medical files that are computer generated and stored on digital sup port media 
should be printable. The Investigator will sign and date the printouts when kept as data source. The 
Investigator will authorize the monitor to compare the content of the printouts and the data stored 
in the computer to ensure data consistency.  
The minimum requirements for medical source data include the identity of the patien t (and any 
study  related identifiers, treatment kit numbers, CRF numbers  if used ), the patient 's participation 
in the study  and identification of the study  (e.g., Study Code ), the date of obtaining signed informed 
consent/assent, the dates of the visits, the patient 's medical history, the experimental and 
concomitant treatments, AEs and SAEs and  any important relevant information . The source 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 96 of 123 
 
documents should also provide evid ence that inclusion/exclusion criteria were evaluated and met. 
Information recorded in the e-CRF must be fully consistent with entries in the source documents.  
14.3 Audit and Inspection  
The Investigator will permit study -related audits by auditors mandated by STALLERGENES , and 
inspections by domestic or foreign regulatory authorities, after reasonable notice. The main 
purposes of an audit or inspection are to confirm that the rights and well -being of the patients 
enrolled have been protected, and that all data r elevant for the evaluation of the IP have been 
processed and reported in compliance with the planned arrangements, GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements. The Investigator will provide direct access to all study  documents, source 
records and source dat a. If a regulatory inspection is announced, the Investigator will immediately 
inform STALLERGENES . 
14.4 Electronic Case Report Forms (e -CRFs)  
Electronic case report forms (e -CRFs) will be used for the study  and the study site staff will be 
trained on how to use  the e -CRFs and capture the data required by the protocol . The e -CRF is 
essentially a data electronic entry media and should not routinely constitute the original (or source) 
medical record.  
The Sponsor cannot interpret a blank answer as “NONE” or “N/A”, therefore, all fields must be 
completed.  
Data reported in the e -CRF should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies 
should be explained in these source documents.  
The Investigator must complete  an e-CRF for each patient  who signed an ICF.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the e -CRFs are kept up -to-date so that they 
always contain the latest observations on the patients enrolled. All supportive documentation 
submitted to the Sponsor in addition to the e -CRF, such as laboratory results or hospitalization 
records, must be clearly identified with the study  or protocol number, and study  patient  number. 
Any personal information, including the study patient’s name, must be removed or rendered 
illegible  to preserve patient confidentiality. The Investigator’s signature of the e -CRF will attest its 
accuracy and completeness. Study data will be transferred and stored in a clinical database 
maintained by the CRO.  Data recorded by patients in e -Diaries will a lso be stored in the same 
clinical database.  
14.5 Adherence to Protocol  
The Investigator/Institution should conduct the study  in compliance with the protocol approved by 
the Sponsor, the IRB/ IEC and, if required, by the regulatory authority(ies) The 
Investigato r/Institution and the Sponsor should sign the protocol to confirm this agreement.  
The Investigator should not deviate from the protocol. In medical emergencies, the Investigator 
will use his/her medical judgment and may withdraw the study  patient  from the study to prevent 
immediate hazard. Notification to the Sponsor, its representatives and , if required , the IRB/Ethics 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 97 of 123 
 
committee will be made regarding the type of emergency and the course of action taken. Significant 
and/or systematic changes in or deviatio ns from the protocol will ONLY be made as an amendment 
to the protocol and must be approved in writing by the Sponsor and the IRB /IEC  prior to being 
implemented. Unless the Sponsor has agreed to any such deviations or changes in writing, they 
cannot be imp lemented and the Sponsor will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability.  
Any significant protocol deviation will be documented and explained by the Investigator or the 
designated personnel.  
14.6 Termination of the Study   
Upon completion of the study , the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjunction with 
the Investigator, as appropriate:  
- transfer of all study  data to STALLERGENES or its representative,  
- data clarification and/or resolution,  
- accountability, reconciliation and arrangements for used and unused study  drugs,  
- accountability, reconciliation and arrangements for used and unused other supplies,  
- review of site study  records for completeness,  
- discussion/reminder on archiving responsibil ities, 
- discussion/reminder on  investigator’s responsibility in case of study audit or inspection .  
14.7 Stopping Rules for the study  
STALLERGENES  reserves the right to temporarily  suspend or prematurely discontinue this study  
at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety (including Data Safety Monitoring 
Board recommendation)  or ethical issues, severe non -compliance, recurrent non -compliance, or 
unsatisfactory enrolment with respect to quality or quantity.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, STALLERGENES  will promptly inform the 
Investigators/institutions, and the regulatory authority  (ies) of the termination or suspension and 
the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. The information will  be shared with the study  sites 
via a formal letter from the Sponsor that will also contain the procedure to manage the practical 
aspects regarding study patient s. 
The IRB s/IEC will be promptly informed and provided with the reason(s) for the termination o r 
suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). In addition, arrangements will 
be made for the management of all unused IP in accordance with procedures for the study.  
14.8 Investigator Site File  
The content of the study Investigator Si te File is structured in a manner that eases the filing, 
retrieval, and/or auditing of study -related documents. All documents will be filed according to 
Standard File Categories that identify specific aspects of the study . 
CONFIDENTIAL  
STALLERGENES  
Study # SL75.14  
Protocol version  7.0 – 05 October  2017  – Page 98 of 123 
 
14.9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
Data processing will be subcontracted by the sponsor to the designated CRO.  
e-CRF data will be entered in an electronic database using a clinical data management system 
(CDMS). Computerized edit -checks will be developed in addition to manual review to dete ct any 
discrepancies and to ensure consistency of the data. An electronic audit trail system will be used to 
track all data changes in the database subsequent to the first data entry. The SAS system will be 
used for the statistical analysis of the data. Re gular back -ups of the electronic data will be carried 
out. 
The data of patients who signed an informed consent /assent  and underwent any study specific 
procedures(s) before entering the treatment phase, will be entered in the e-CRF. In case of screen 
failur e before visit 2 , only data on demography, adverse events and reason for screen failure will 
be entered into the e -CRF and clinical database and should therefore be monitored and retrieved 
from the site.  
To ensure data quality a ll efforts will be made  to capture data as soon as they are available. Study 
sites and patients will be alerted in case data are not submitted in a timely manner.  
Sponsor will take advantage of using electronic devices ( e-diary , e-CRF) to have a centralized 
monitoring approach to enhance quality of study data as advocated  by National Guidances . 
Appropriate actions (e.g., feedback towards study staff in ca se of repeated inconsistencies ) will be 
undertaken if any missing data, inc onsistent data, outlier data and potential protocol deviations are 
identified during routine remote data review.  
14.10  Clinical Study  Report  
The Sponsor will prepare a clinical study report (CSR) according to the relevant ICH guidelines. 
The report will include a thorough description of the study , its conduct, efficacy and safety data , 
statistical analyses  and a discussion of the results  
The Principal Investigator will receive and review the CSR . He/she must give his/her comments 
within 30 days of receiving the CSR.  
In addition, he/she will sign the CSR for approval within 15  days of receipt of the revised version 
or a satisfactory reply to these comments.  
The CSR and the study data may not  be used  or communi cated by the investigators without prior  
written approval from  the Sponsor.  
14.11  Patient  Insurance  
The Sponsor will contract liability  insurance for the total duration of the study , covering the patient s 
with respect to the potential risks related to the study, carried out according to the protocol. In case 
of injury or disability related to the participation in the study , the patient  is to inform the 
investigator without delay.

14.12  Publication and Presentat ion Policy  
In signing the final protocol, the Investigator agrees to keep all information and results related to 
the study and the IP confidential. The confidentiality obligation also applies to all personnel 
involved at the investigational study center .  
No unpublished data given to the Investigator may be transmitted to a third party without written 
approval of the Sponsor.  
Publication and communication policy are addressed in the clinical study  agreement.  
14.13  Archiving and Data Retention  
At the end of the s tudy, t he Investigator will maintain adequate study records , including e - 
electronic copies  of e-CRF , medical records, laboratory reports, informed consent/assent 
documents, drug disposition records, safety reports, information regarding patient s who 
disco ntinued, and other relevant data.  
All records are to be retained by the Investigator/Institution until at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing application s in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development o f the investigational product. However t hese 
documents are to  be retained for a longer period if required by the national applicable regulatory 
requirement(s) or by an agreement with the sponsor (ICH -GCP Guideline -section 4.9.5).  
The Investigator will contact the Sponsor for authorization prior to the destruction of any study  
records or in the event of accidental loss or destruction of any study  records. The Investigator will 
also notify the Sponsor should he/she relocate or move the study  related files to a location other 
than that specified to the Sponsor.  
14.14  Allocation of Responsibilities  
The Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the study i n compliance with the protocol but can 
delegate any tasks to his/her research team. He/she remains responsible for selecting his/her staff 
and for coordinating, training and informing them about the protocol, study procedures and any 
possible amendments . 
The Investigator should maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom each significant 
study -related duty is delegated using an "authorized signatures" document including  name, 
function, signature, initials, start and end dates of participatio n in the study  conduct and type of 
delegated tasks.  
This list is to be kept current during the entire course of the study.

 Procedure for Collection of a Dust Sample using the DUSTREAM ® 
You have just attended Study SL75.14(*) Visit 3, and your study doctor (or designee) has provided you 
with a dust collection kit to perform the dust sampling at your residence.  It is important that you 
proceed to the dust sampling  as indicated below within the next  few days following this visi t. 
(*)  Sponsor: Stallergenes S.A.  
1. Insert the plastic filter into the DUSTREAM ® collector and attach the collector to the vacuum  
cleaner tube.  
 
 
2. If the collector alone does not fit the vacuum cleaner tube, attach the adapt or piece to the 
collector in the configuration that fits the vacuum tube firmly.  
 
 
 
 
3. Remove the bed sheets and pillowcases. Turn on the vacuum cleaner and vacuum the 
bedding (i.e., mattress, pillow(s), blanket). Remove the filter from the collector by pressing 
on the closed, bottom end of the filter. If the fil ter is ¼ full then sufficient  sample has been 
collected. If not, allow the vacuum to cool down and then repeat vacuuming until the filter is 
¼ full.  
 
4. Remove the filter containing the sufficient dust sample from the collector and place it in the 
small Ziploc bag provided in the Patient  Pack.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Fill in the date collection  label on the large Ziploc bag  and place the small Ziploc bag 
containing the dust sample into the large bag . 
 
6. Place the large Ziploc bag in the provided courier wrapper and book a pick -up throu gh the 
courier agent as indicated by your study doctor (or designee) to allow the sample to be 
picked up within 24 hours  after that the dust has been vacuumed.   
 
Please be prepared to give the following information: your contact details, including your 
nam e and telephone number. You will also need to provide details of the exact location, 
including building number or department name, from where the sample is to be collected.  DUSTREAM®

APPENDIX V: Skin Prick Test Procedure  
 
STALLERGENES SKIN PRI CK TEST  PROCEDURE  
Skin Prick Tests (SPTs) will be performed at screening (Visit  1) for D pteronyssinus , D. farinae  
and a battery including cat, dog, cockroach , Aspergillus, Clados porium, Parietaria  and Alternaria , 
and other geographically relevant potential ly confounding allergens  such as cypress, birch, grass, 
ragweed… as well as  positive (histamine dihydrochloride)  and negative (saline  diluent ) controls . 
Preparation for the Skin Prick Tests  
- Check that the SPT vials are arranged in the rack in the SAME ORDER as on the Case Report 
Form (CRF) page.  
- Preparation of the skin: clean an area of healthy skin at the interior site of the forearm, with a 
cotton swab impregnated with alco hol and allow to dry.  
- Identify the SITES on the two forearms with a pen, respecting  the same distance as displayed 
on the test sheet of the CRF, which facilitates recording of the test responses onto the results 
sheet.  
- For a good reading  of skin reactions,  it is advised to space the tests with a  minimum 3  cm. 
Skin Prick Tests procedure  
- The allergen vials will be ordered in the box in the same order  than the SPTs . 
- Apply one drop of each test solution on the appropriate marked locations respecting the same 
order as on the test sheet .  
- Stallerpoint® is a single -use needle. Each needle is used only once in order to eliminate false 
positive tests caused by previously tested solution. Prick the skin vertically, performing a slight 
twisting  movement  through each ex tract drop with a Stallerpoint® (a polymethacry late needle 
of 1.1 mm length) he ld by its superior third part which has an enlarged diameter. It is necessary 
each time to exert a regular and moderate pressure (a pressure can be considered as moderate 
when i t produces a skin depression between 2 and 5 mm from the bottom of the Stallerpoint®). 
Usually, a good execution of the test results in a print of the Stallerpoint® circumference.  
- For valid  interpretation of the SPTs , it is essential to perform the positive controls (histamine 
dihydrochloride) and negative control (saline  diluent ). 
- Sponge up the drops after 2  min for each prick without transferring a drop on another location, 
and by  changing cotton for each prick test site. 
- Record the time of the SPTs precisely on the results sheet: hours, minutes.

Collecting the wheals’ outlines  
- SPTs are read after 20 minutes. Record the time of the reading on the results sheet: hours, 
minutes.  
- Carefully clean the skin with alcohol to eliminate any trace of saline  diluent , which could 
interfere with pen tracings.  
- Use a very fi ne black pen to trace the outline of wheals  and any pseudopodes or satellites.  The 
real limits of the wheal are determined by palpation.  
- Hypoallergenic transparent adhesive tape (Blenderm ) is applied on the tracings to obtain 
imprints and is then transferred on the results sheet.

APPENDIX VI: Management of Suspected Esophagitis  
 
 
Management of Suspected Esophagitis  
SL75.14  
 
This procedure is designed to guide investigators in managing patients with symptoms suggestive 
of esophagitis during conduct of this study.  
1. Occurrence of symptoms consistent with esophagitis  
Throughout the study, patients will be asked to complete a d aily diary card to record information 
on adverse events and concomitant medication use. Diary cards are to be reviewed at each visit 
after the initiation of study therapy. A patient reporting onset of one or more symptoms suggestive 
of esophagitis (e.g., s evere or persistent dysphagia or chest pain) will be instructed to discontinue 
the study therapy and referred to a Gastroenterologist for evaluation.  
2. Evaluation by a Gastroenterologist  
- At the initial consultation, if the assessment of the Gastroenterologist is that further 
evaluation for EoE is warranted, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy will 
be performed. If the diagnosis of EoE is confirmed [Liacouras et al., 2011 ; Mieh lke, 2014 ], 
the patient will be withdrawn from the study and medical treatment provided. See protocol 
Section 7.4 “Patient Withdrawal”  and Section 9.3.11  “Early Termination Visit” . 
- If an alternate diagnosis is made, the cause of the symptoms will be treated as appropriate. 
Study therapy may be resumed at the discretion of the investigator.  
All medical  information, including the consultation report of the Gastroenterologist, results of the 
EGD, and tissue pathology reports are to be retrieved and communicated to the Sponsor for 
documentation  and review by the Data Safety Monitoring Board .

Outcome	data	for	each	stage	were	collected	during	baseline,	acquisition,	short-term,	and	long-term	retention.	The	study	was	approved	by	the	Institutional	Review	Board	at	both	Western	Carolina	University,	reference	number	949671-4,	and	Mission	Health	Systems,	reference	number	1124795-3.	Minimal	exertion	during	the	activity	was	the	only	potential	harm	for	this	study.	All	participants	provided	written	informed	consent	prior	to	data	collection.	There	were	no	outside	funding	sources.		Study	Participants	During	Phase	I,	participants	with	history	of	a	chronic	stroke	(>6	months)	and	ability	to	sit	statically	without	physical	assistance	were	eligible	for	the	study.	Individuals	with	severe	hemineglect	(star	cancellation	test	<44/54)	or	inability	to	follow	multistep	commands	were	excluded.	There	were	no	issues	with	these	criteria	during	the	first	phase,	so	the	same	criteria	were	used	to	recruit	participants	with	acute	stroke	in	an	inpatient	rehabilitation	setting	for	Phase	II.	Unfortunately,	some	qualified	participants	were	unable	to	complete	the	task	so	throughout	the	study	exclusion	criteria	was	modified	to	individuals	with	orthopedic	issues	that	limited	their	ability	to	weight	shift	including	severe	hip	or	back	pain,	individuals	with	other	neurologic	conditions	such	as	dementia,	and	individuals	with	contraversive	pushing.

During	Phase	I,	each	investigator	filled	one	of	three	roles	during	data	collection	for	the	entire	phase:	script	reading,	computer	management,	or	patient	guarding.	Lack	of	cross-training	created	difficulty	in	data	collection,	therefore	in	Phase	II	investigators	were	trained	for	all	roles.	Different	student	groups	conducted	each	phase	of	the	feasibility	study	and	were	trained	primarily	by	the	previous	student	group.	Inconsistencies	with	both	instruction	and	data	collection	persisted	suggesting	changes	in	investigator	training	are	necessary	prior	to	a	randomized	controlled	study.			Setting	Phase	I	was	conducted	with	individuals	with	a	chronic	stroke	in	two	different	outpatient	clinics.	Findings	from	this	phase	showed	no	significant	differences	between	the	focus	of	attention	groups.	These	findings	along	with	previous	findings	in	the	chronic	stroke	population	in	other	studies12,10,11	suggest	there	may	be	more	significant	differences	seen	in	those	with	acute	stroke.	Muckel	and	Merholz	were	able	to	show	differences	in	performance	in	focus	of	attention	in	those	with	acute	stroke	during	a	similar	weight	shifting	task.15	Based	on	these	findings,	Phase	II	was	conducted	in	the	inpatient	rehabilitation	setting.		Recruitment	and	retention		Twelve	adults	with	chronic	stroke	(mean	age	61.4	+	13.8	years;	6	months	to	13	years	post-unilateral	stroke)	with	good	trunk	control	(Function	in	Sitting	Test	mean	score	51	+	2.9/56)	were	recruited	for	Phase	I.	Recruitment	of	participants	was	primarily	from

Motion Unlimited Corporation California. 4362 Modoc Road Unit B Santa Barbara CA 93110.   3 outpatient	settings,	local	physical	therapy	clinics	or	physician	offices,	located	in	a	rural	area,	thus	the	sample	size	was	limited.	To	allow	for	recruitment	of	a	larger	sample	than	in	Phase	I,	Phase	II	was	conducted	in	an	inpatient	setting.	Participants	were	recruited	via	staff	physical	and	occupational	therapists	at	the	facility.	Twenty-six	adults	post-acute	stroke	(mean	age	61.8+17,	1-10	weeks	post	unilateral	stroke),	with	good	trunk	control	(Function	in	Sitting	Test	mean	score	51.3+4.4	out	of	56)	were	recruited.			Randomization	and	blinding	During	Phase	I,	stratified	randomization	was	used	based	on	gender.		Results	from	a	2013	study	showed	significant	differences	between	gender	during	focus	of	attention	trials	suggesting	the	potential	need	for	randomization	based	on	gender.18	Group	allocation	was	randomly	selected	for	the	first	male	and	first	female	participants.	Each	following	participant	was	alternately	placed	in	either	the	internal	or	external	focus	of	attention	group.	During	Phase	II,	gender-based	stratification	was	not	used,	to	explore	whether	the	intervention	groups	would	naturally	be	comparable	based	on	gender,	age,	BMI,	and	Function	in	Sitting	Test	scores.	Instead,	a	blocked	randomization	with	a	random	number	generator	(blocks	of	10)	was	used	to	determine	the	order	of	focus	group	allocation.	A	blinded	statistician	and	a	graduate	assistant	performed	the	random	number	generation	and	placed	the	group	assignments	into	separate	envelopes,	which	were	then	sealed.	Group	assignment	remained	in	sealed	envelopes	until	after	baseline	measurements	were	completed.	The	participants	and	statistician	were	blinded	for	both	phases	of	the	feasibility	study.		Procedures

Motion Unlimited Corporation California. 4362 Modoc Road Unit B Santa Barbara CA 93110.   4 During	Phase	I,	individuals	in	both	groups	sat	unsupported	on	a	hi-lo	mat	table	which	was	adjusted	so	participants	were	sitting	at	90	degrees	hip	and	knee	flexion	with	feet	shoulder	width	apart.	Tape	marks	were	used	to	mark	initial	set	up	ensuring	standardized	positioning	for	each	trial.	Following	baseline	trials,	all	participants	watched	the	same	instructional	video	describing	lateral	weight	shifting.	The	instructions	included	correct	mechanics	that	should	be	used	when	weight	shifting	laterally	with	focus	on	correct	form	needed	for	the	movement.		Testing	included	baseline,	acquisition,	short	term	retention	(5	minutes	later),	and	long-term	retention	(7-10	days	later).	Participants	performed	three	trials	of	seated	weight	shifting	to	each	side	at	all	timepoints.	During	acquisition,	the	internal	focus	group	was	instructed	to	“shift	your	weight	as	much	as	possible	towards	your	right	or	left	hip	without	using	your	arms”.	The	external	focus	group	sat	with	targets	one	arm	length	away	at	shoulder	height	and	were	instructed	to	“shift	your	body	weight	as	much	as	possible	towards	the	blue/orange	target	without	using	your	arms.”		During	baseline	and	retention	trials,	adults	were	instructed	to	“lean	as	far	as	you	can	to	the	right/left	without	using	your	arms.”		During	Phase	II,	the	protocol	was	similar	except	6	trials	were	performed	for	acquisition	to	potentially	improve	motor	learning,	which	was	not	significant	in	Phase	I	per	retention	data.	Other	changes	to	the	protocol	included	allowing	participants	to	move	their	feet	when	weight-shifting.		Instructions	were	also	revised.	The	external	focus	group	was	told	to	“move	your	shoulder	as	close	to	the	blue/orange	target	as	possible”,	while	the	internal	focus	group	was	told	to	“shift	your	body	weight	as	much	as	possible	towards	your	right/left	hip	without	using	your	arms.”	These	instructions	were	too	dissimilar	and	had

Motion Unlimited Corporation California. 4362 Modoc Road Unit B Santa Barbara CA 93110.   5 participants	thinking	about	different	body	areas,	shoulder	as	opposed	to	hip.	The	external	focus	instructions	were	also	mixed	since	the	shoulder	was	mentioned.		Outcome	measures		A	32X32	array	BodiTrak*	pressure	mat	with	an	18.125	in	x	18.125	in	sensing	area	(1,024	sensors)	was	used	to	measure	lateral	excursion	of	center	of	pressure	during	each	trial	for	both	phases.	The	pressure	mat	has	a	200	mmHg	calibration	range	and	up	to	150	Hz	sampling	frame	rate.	During	Phase	II,	a	9.5”	X	7.31”	X	0.37”	4th	generation	iPad†,	with	a	9.7-inch	retina	display,	was	used	to	record	videos	of	each	trial.	The	iPad	has	a	1080p	HD	video	and	1.2	MP	photo	camera	with	autofocus	and	a	2.4	aperture	with	video	stabilization.	From	this	footage,	shoulder	alignment	was	measured	during	seated	lateral	weight	shifting	using	the	Body	Align	Pro	app‡,	trademarked	on	Nov.	28,	2014.	Markers	were	placed	at	the	acromion	bilaterally.	Each	trial	was	recorded,	and	snap	shots	of	the	furthest	lateral	weight	shift	were	uploaded	into	the	software.	The	software	then	allowed	angles	to	be	drawn	using	a	line	from	acromion	to	acromion	compared	to	a	horizontal	plumb	line	(see	Figure	1).	This	measurement	was	used	to	evaluate	the	participants	ability	to	move	their	trunk	in	accordance	with	the	instructions	given,	keeping	their	shoulders	parallel	to	the	horizontal.	Validity	and	reliability	tests	are	currently	being	conducted	for	this	measurement	method.	Insert	Figure	1.		Data	analyses	To	summarize	participant	characteristics,	descriptive	data	included	means	and	standard	deviations	for	continuous	variables	and	counts	for	categorical	variables.	Percentages	were	reported	to	specify	whether	recruitment	and	retention	goals	were	met	based	on	power	analysis.	For	Phase	I,	a	2	(group)	X	4	(time)	repeated	measures	mixed	model	ANOVA	was

Motion Unlimited Corporation California. 4362 Modoc Road Unit B Santa Barbara CA 93110.   6 used	to	examine	the	whether	the	demonstration,	instructions,	and	set	up	differentiated	between	focus	of	attention	groups	at	the	different	timepoints	of	the	study.	Phase	II	utilized	both	a	2	(group)	X	3	(time)	and	2	(group)	X	4	(time)	mixed	model	ANOVA	to	analyze	the	relationship	of	focus	of	attention	on	performance	during	the	different	timepoints.	Data	including	long	term	retention	trials	were	examined	separately	due	to	high	attrition	rates.	If	the	sphericity	assumption	was	violated,	Huynh-Feldt	(H-F)	and	Greenhouse	Geisser	(G-G)	corrections	were	used	to	correct	the	degrees	of	freedom	to	report	F	values.	When	the	overall	model	was	significant,	the	post	hoc	pairwise	comparison	was	used,	with	a	Bonferroni	correction,	to	examine	differences	between	every	two	timepoints	in	each	group.	Adverse	events	would	be	counted	as	any	falls	or	health	issues	requiring	medical	attention	such	as	a	cardiac	event.

Protocol 011711IN, Spectrum 5 Study DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution 
Version 1.0 18JULY2018 Confidential Page 5 of 94 subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT .  
Duration of Treatment: 8-Week Run -in Period with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% 
and 3-month Treatment Period with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% 
Methodology : 
This is an open-label multi-center study. Subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT who  meet the 
eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a Washout Period, the duration of which is 
determined by their current topical IOP -lowering medication (s) if any. After completing the 
required Washout Period, subjects will return for Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run-in Period). 
Subjects who remain qualified will start a Run-in Period dosing with latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution 0.005% once daily in the evening in both eyes, and then return for Visit 3 (Week -4, 
midpoint of the Run-in Period) and Visit 4 (Baseline, Da y 1), to confirm ongoing eligibility.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 4 (Baseline, Da y 1), will enter the Treatment 
Period and will be treated with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002 % once daily in the evening 
in both eyes for 3 months. During the 3-month Treatment Period, three follow-up visits will be 
scheduled: Visit 5 (Week 2), Visit 6 (Week 6) and Visit 7 (Month 3 ). 
Approximately 150 subjects with POAG or OHT who meet all eligibility criteria are planned to 
enter the T reatment Period and be treated with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002%. 
Study Design  
 
 
This study will consist of a Screening Period which includes a Washout Period of up to 35 days 
(28 days + 7 days window) and an additional 8-W eek Latanoprost Run-in Period; followed by a 
3-month Open- Label Treatment Period with DE-117 0.002% ophthalmic solution. 
At Visit 1 (Screening ; start of the Washout Period [if applicable]), subjects will be screened 
against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be instructed to discontinue 
use of all IOP-lowering medications during the Washout Period as follows (up to +7 days as a 
window is allowed):  
 Miotics: 7 days 
 Oral/topical Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors (CAIs): 7 days 
 Alpha agonists: 14 days 
 Alpha/beta agonists: 14 days 

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 6 of 94  Alpha antagonists ( α1 blocker ): 28 days  
 Beta antagonists (β blocker, including αβ blockers ): 28 days  
 Prostaglandins Analogs (PGA): 28 days  
 Rho kinase inhibitor: 28 days  
 Combination drugs: The longest washout period of the individual component will be 
used.  
During the required washout period,  subjects who discontinue their c urrent treatment, may, if 
the investigator deems it necessary, be treated with a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topical 
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor ( CAI), e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one drop 
twice daily. Topical CAI treatment must be s topped at the latest 1 week before Visit 2  
(Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). An interim safety visit may be performed during the 
washout period , Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout  visit), if in the Investigator’s opinion, a 
subject’s IOP may be of concern.  If subjects are treated with a topical CAI during the washout 
period, Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout visit ) is recommended to be performed.  
Subjects who have not used an IOP -lowering medication for the last 28 days, will need a wait 
period of ≥ 1 day before Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). 
At Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ), continuing eligibility will be determined based 
on non -treated IOP : 
 IOP ≥  22 mmHg in at least one eye  
 IOP ≤ 34 mmHg  in both eyes at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 2, will begin the 8 -Week Run -in Period, dosing with 
one drop of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every  evening  at 20:00  (±60min)  in 
both eyes.  
Visit 3 will take place at Week -4 (midpoint of  the Run -in Period)  to check the following IOP 
criteria:  
 The same eye meeting criteria at Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run -in Period), must 
meet the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit  2 (Week -8, start of 
the Run -in Period)  of  ≤ 25% at all measurement time points  
 Visit 3 8:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 12:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 16:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes  of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 3  (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period ), will 
complete the remainder of the 8 -Week Run-in Period , continuing dosing  with one drop 
of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every  evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both 
eyes.  
Visit 4 ( Baseline , Day 1) will take place at the end of the Run-in Period  and is considered the 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 7 of 94 baseline for the analyses. The following criteria have to be met to initiate  the Treatment Period 
with DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% : 
 The same  eye meeting  criteria at Visit 3 (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period) 
must meet  the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit 2 ( Week -8, 
start of the Run -in Period ) of ≤ 15% at all measurement time point s 
 Visit  4 8:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP; 
 Visit 4 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP; 
 Visit 4 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 4  (Baseline, Day 1) , will be enrolled into study and 
begin the 3-month  Treatment Period , dosing with one drop  of DE-117 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002% every evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes . Follow -up visits will be 
scheduled at Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 6) and Month 3  (Visit 7) . 
IOP will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00 (±60 min)  at all visits except at Visit 1 
(Screening ) and Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit)  when one measur ement at any time will 
suffice . The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per eligibility criteria through Visit 4 
(Baseline, Day 1). If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye with the higher diurnal IOP 
(calculated as the average of IOP measu rements at  3 time points ) at Visit 4 (Baseline, Day 1) 
will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the same 
mean diurnal IOP, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
At the scheduled visits, query of  adverse events ( AEs), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  
and slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed before the first IOP measuremen t. 
Ophthalmoscopy (fundus examination) will be  performed after the last IOP measurement for 
the day. Additional  procedures are explained in Section  7.4. 
Pharmacogenomics/Genomics : 
Subjects who consent to the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics laboratory study will 
provide a blood sample for future  testing  after subject is enrolled and study drug, DE-117

the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics laboratory research study may be obtained at any visit prior to study 
exit. 
b. An interim safety visit may be performed during the  washout period  Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit) , if in 
the Investigator’s opinion a subject’s IOP may be of concern.  If subjects are treated with a topical CAI during 
the washout period, Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout visit) is recommended to be performed.  
c. The previous use of prostaglandin analogs should be confirmed by either subject’s medical records or subject 
history.  
d. A urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  
e. Refraction will be performed at the  screening visit. If more than 10 letters in BCVA are lost compared to the 
screening visit, then refraction should be performed again. BCVA examination will be completed before IOP 
measurement at 08:00  (±60 min) .  
f. Biomicroscopy examination must be complete d before IOP is measured at 08:00  (±60 min) . Aqueous flare and 
cell evaluation will be performed before fluorescein instillation.  
g. IOP measurements will be performed at 08:00, 1 2:00 and 16:00 (±60 min) at all visits except for Visit 1  
(Screening)  and Visit  1a (optional, mid-washout  visit).

Glaucoma represents a group of related diseases frequently associated with elevated IOP. When 
left untreated, glaucoma can lead to retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve  damage, resulting 
in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness 
worldwide . In 2013, the global prevalence of glaucoma for population aged 40 to 80 years was 
3.54%. The number of people (aged 40 to 80 years) with glaucoma worldwide was estimated to 
be 64.3 million, increasing to 76.0 million in 2020 and 111.8 million in 2040  (Tham et al., 2014 ). 
It affects one in two hundred people aged fifty or younger and one in ten over the age of eighty 
(Resnikoff et al., 2004 ). Similarly in Japan, glaucoma is the first leading cause of blindness and 
it’s prevalence is 5.0% (POAG 3.9%, PACG 0.6%, secondary glaucoma 0.5%) and OHT 0.8% in 
population over the age of forty (Iwase et al., 2004 ; Yamamoto et al., 2005 ). 
Although currently there is no cure for  open -angle glaucoma ( OAG), results from multiple 
studies, including the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) (AGIS_Investigators, 
2000 ), the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) (Kass et al., 2002 ), and the Early 
Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) (Leske et al., 2003 ), and Uni ted Kingdom Glaucoma 
Treatment Study (UKGTS) (Garway -Heath et al., 2015 ) have demonstrated that treating elevated 
IOP with topical ocular hypotensive agents is effective in delaying or preventing disease 
progression. The lowering of IOP is currently the only method for re ducing the risk of 
glaucomatous visual field loss and remains the primary goal of therapy.  
Several classes of ocular hypotensive medications exist today and are differentiated by their 
mechanism of action at the cellular/molecular level. These include miot ics, β -adrenergic receptor 
antagonists (β -blockers), CAIs, -adrenergic receptor agonists ( -agonists), and prostaglandin 
analogues (PGAs). The pharmacodynamic effect of these medications can differ substantially, as 
some affect aqueous humor production (β -blockers, -agonists, and CAIs) while others affect the 
outflow pathway (miotics, PGs, and -agonists). In general, PGAs are recommended as the first 
choice agent for most eyes with OHT  and OAG . However as disease progresses and maintaining 
target IOP bec omes difficult, more than one drug is needed to achieve optimum benefit and reach 
target IOP. Surgical interventions, including laser surgery, shunting of aqueous humor to an 
appropriate locale,  and filtering surgery,  are available options for treating insufficiently 
controlled IOP. In such instances pharmacotherapy may be continued as well.  
While adequate IOP -lowering can be achieved by currently available pharmacotherapies in some 
patients, not all patients are adequ ately treated and additional IOP -lowering may provide for 
further slowing of disease progression. In some patients , treatment with a single IOP -lowering 
compound is not sufficient to obtain optimal IOP control. Adjunctive or combination therapy 
using diffe rent classes of drugs is often employed in order to achieve additional IOP -lowering 
effects. Moreover, consistent lowering of IOP over a 24 hour period has not yet been fully 
realized. If achieved, this could also contribute to slowing of disease progressi on. Therefore, new 
pharmacologic agents with new mechanism of action are needed.  
Santen has develop ed an ophthalmic topical formulation of omidenepag isopropyl (UR -7385) for 
the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with OHT  or OAG . DE-117 is a pro -drug of  the 
pharmacologically active acid metabolite, UR -7276, a synthetic  non-prostanoid agonist of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) receptor, subtype 2 (EP2). PGE 2 has been shown to markedly reduce 
IOP when applied topically to human and animal eyes (Bito, 2001 ). PGE 2, its analogues and 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 24 of 94 receptor agonists are thought to mediate the IOP -lowering effect by relaxing the ciliary muscle 
and increasing outflow of aqueous humor through the uveo -scleral pathway (Yamaji et al., 2005 ). 
Very recently, Fuwa et al.,  demonstrated that DE -117 lowers the IOP through a novel 
meachnism of action : that is, th rough both conventional and uveoscleral outflows  (Fuwa et al., 
2017 ).Currently approved IOP - lowering medications such as latanoprost ( latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution, 0.005%; NDA 20 -597) lower IOP by enhancing uveoscleral outflow  only, 
but do so through effects on a receptor for PGF 2α. Unlike latanoprost and other approved 
prostaglandin F receptor (FP) agonists that are synthetic prostanoid analogues, DE -117 is a non -
prostanoid chemical compound.  
To date, Santen ha s completed seven clinical studies including t hree clinical studies ( 33-001,  
33-002, 33 -003) in the U.S. and four clinical studies ( 01171502 , 01171503 , 01171504 , 
01171506 ) in Japan  with DE -117 in healthy adult subjects, or subj ects with OAG or OHT to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety  of DE -117. DE-117 ophthalmic solution  0.002% appeared to be  
well tolerated and eff icacious in IOP lowering. As a result, it was chosen to advance into the 
phase III clinical development program in the US.  
Additional information on DE-117 ophthalmic solution , including the results of nonclinical and 
clinical  studies can be found in  the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The proposed study is an open -label , multi -center  study. The total duration of this study is 13 
months. The objective is to  investigat e the efficacy and safety  of DE-117 ophthalmic solution  
0.002%  in latanoprost low/non-responder  subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT .

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 27 of 94 During the required washout period,  subjects who discontinue their current treatment, may, if the 
investigator deems it necessary, be treated wi th a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topical 
Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor ( CAI), e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one drop 
twice daily. Topical CAI treatment must be stopped at the latest 1 week before Visit 2 (Week -8, 
start of the Run -in Per iod). An interim safety visit may be performed during the washout period  
Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit) if, in  the Investigator’s opinion, a subject’s IOP may be of 
concern.   If subjects are treated with a topical CAI during the washout period, Visit 1a (optional, 
mid-washout visit ) is recommended to be performed.  
Subjects who have not used an IOP -lowering medication for the last 28 days,  will need a wait 
period of ≥ 1 day before their Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). 
At Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ), continuing eligibility will be determined based 
on non -treated IOP :  
 IOP ≥22 mmHg in at least one eye and ≤34 mmHg in both eyes  at all measurement 
time points   
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 2, will begin the 8 -Week Run -in Period, dosing with 
one drop of latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every evening  at 20:00  (±60min)  in 
both eyes.  
Visit 3 will take place at Week -4 (midpoint  of the Run -in Period ), to check the following IOP 
criteria :  
 The same eye meeting criteria at Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run -in Period), must 
meet the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit 2  (Week -8, start of 
the Run -in Period)  of  ≤ 25% at all measurement time points  
 Visit 3 8:00  IOP should be  compared with Visit 2 8:00  IOP;  
 Visit 3 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes  of  ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualif ied at Visit 3  (Week -4, midpoint  of the Run -in Period) , will 
complete the remainder  of the 8 -Week Run-in Period , continuing dosing with one drop of 
latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005%  QD at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes .  
Visit 4 ( Baseline , Day 1) will take pla ce at the end of the Run-in Period  and is considered the 
baseline for the analyses. The following criteria have to be met to initiate  the Treatment Period 
with DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% : 
 The same  eye meeting  criteria at Visit 3 (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period) 
must meet the  following criteria: percent decrease of IOP from Visit 2 ( Week -8, start 
of the Run -in Period ) of ≤ 15% at all measurement time points  
o Visit  4 8:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP; 
o Visit 4 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP; 
o Visit 4 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 28 of 94 Subjects who are qualified at Visit 4  (Baseline, Day 1) , will be enrolled into study and begin  the 
3-month  Treatment Period , dosing with one  drop of DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% every 
evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes . Follow -up visits will be scheduled at Week 2 (Visit 5), 
Week 6 (Visit 6) and Month 3  (Visit 7) . 
IOP will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00 (± 60 min)  at all visits except at  Visit 1 
(Screening ) and Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit)  when one measurement at any time may 
suffice . The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per eligibility criteria through  Visit 4 
(Baseline, Day 1). If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye with the higher diurnal IOP 
(calculated as the average of IOP measurements at 3 time points ) at the end of the Run-in Period 
(Visit 4) will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the 
same mean diurnal IOP, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
At the scheduled visits, query of AEs, BCVA  and slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed 
before the first IOP measuremen t. Ophthalmoscopy (fundus examination) will be  performed after 
the last IOP measurement for the day. Additional  procedures are explained in Section  7.4. 
Pharmacogenomics/genomics : 
Subjects who consent to the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics laboratory study will provide 
a blood sample for future testing  after subject is enrolled and  study  drug, DE-117 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002% , dosing has begun . The purpose of this exploratory research is to identify 
possible genetic markers associated with the study medication(s) and/or ocular conditions.

 Progressive disease  
 Protocol deviation (e.g., not fulfilling eligibility criteria)  
 Pregnancy  
 Voluntary withdrawal by subject at any time for any reason  
 Lost to follow -up (e.g., no contact is possible)  
 Death  
 Other  
If DE-117 study drug administration is discontinued prior to last scheduled visit , Visit 7, the 
subject should be encouraged to continue  participat ing in all  remaining  follow -up study 
visits /procedures  on an observational basis.   
If subject participation is terminated prior to Visit 7,  then to the extent possible, all Visit 7 
procedures will be performed on the day of early termination  or at the ear liest opportunity 
possible . Subjects who are terminated from the study early will not be replaced.

11.1. Efficacy Parameter  
The IOP (mmHg) measured in the study eye (identified at the baseline visit) is the efficacy 
measure for this study. The IOP at each scheduled time point (08:00, 1 2:00 and 16:00  ±60 min ) 
will be evaluated at each post -baseline visit. Besides observed IOP measurements, change from 
baseline in IOP, and percent changes from baseline in IOP at each scheduled time point as well 
as the change from base line in mean diurnal IOP will also be derived  and evaluated.  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 50 of 94 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
12.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. An AE 
does not ne cessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication . For this study, the 
investigational products are DE -117 and latanoprost . Regardless of relationship to the study 
medication , an AE can be a clinically relevant unintended  sign (including an ab normal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease.   
Any significant change in a subject’s condition from the time that written informed consent  is 
obtained , regardless of causality, is to be considered an AE. A clinically significant worsening  in 
severity, intensity, or frequency of a pre -existing condition may indicate an AE.  
An elective surgical procedure scheduled or planned prior to study entry that does not require an 
overnight hospitalization is not considered an AE, and the underlying di agnosis for the procedure  
should be captured in the medical history as a pre -existing condition. The surgical procedure 
should also include the term “elective” in all reports. An elective or planned hospitalization must 
be reported as a  serious adverse eve nt (SAE ). 
The lack of efficacy of the study medication  for the condition being investigated is not 
considered an AE unless a clinically significant change is assessed by the Investigator.  
12.1.1.1.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact. Subjects should be asked 
using a general, non -direct question if there has been any change in their general health. Direct 
questioning and examination should then be performed as appropriate.  
Severity of the AE should be assess ed according to the following criteria:  
Mild:  No interference with the subject’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
Moderate:  Possible interference with the subject’s daily activities; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy req uired.  
Severe:  Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to 
definitions and reporting of serious adverse events  (SAEs) in Section  12.1.2 . 
An Investigator who is medically qualified must make the determination of relationship (related 
or not related) to the inv estigational product for each AE or SAE. When determining relationship 
to study medication, the Investigator will consider any investigational products that a subject 
could be exposed to in this clinical trial. The Investigator should decide whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the event, taking into account the 
following: a) evidence b) science -based rationale c) medical and clinical judgment d) 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 51 of 94 mechanisms of action e) biologic plausibility f) confounding risk factors (i.e., medical history, 
concomitant medications) g) temporal relationship h) dechallenge/rechallenge and i) lack of 
alternative explanation.  
 The event may be recorded as Related  to investigational product if:  
 There is a plausible temporal relationship betw een the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study medication  
 The AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study medication or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears  upon rechallenge  
 The AE cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical state, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant therapies  
 The AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product  
 Reporting the event as Not Related  to study medication may be cons idered if:  
 There is good evidence that the AE has an etiology other than the investigational 
product (e.g., pre -existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication)  
 The AE has no plausible temporal relationship t o administration of the 
investigational product (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study 
medication)  
12.1.1.2.  Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs, whether spontaneously reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will 
be recorded in th e subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE electronic case report 
form (eCRF). Each recorded AE will be described by its duration (represented in dates), affected 
eye(s) (if applicable), maximum severity of the AE, seriousness criteria, suspected  relationship to 
the study medication, actions taken with the study medication and the study participation, 
outcome of the AE, and any other attributable causes of the AE.  
Regardless of relationship to the clinical study, AEs that occur at any time after t he subject has 
provided written informed consent until subject withdrawal or the scheduled exit visit , must be 
recorded. To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Investigators should 
observe the following guidelines:  
 Whenever possible, use  recognized medical terms when recording.  Do not use 
colloquialisms and/or abbreviations.  
 If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component 
signs and symptoms and /or laboratory or test findings (e.g., record congestive hear t 
failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x -ray). 
However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or 
disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and 
severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event 
should be recorded as an individual AE).  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 52 of 94  If the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading component sign, symptom or 
test finding and describe the other clinically r elated findings in the narrative 
description of the case. A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such (e.g., 
record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in the 
clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed.  
AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by the 
primary cause. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most 
accurate clinical term.  If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the  
primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case. For 
example:  
The subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequently fainted and fell to 
the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.  
The primary AE in th is example is orthostatic hypotension. The fall, head trauma and 
neck pain should be described in the narrative description of the case.  
 For intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be 
recorded as the date the subject  first started to experience the event and resolution  
date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped.  Separate AEs for 
each event should not be recorded. For example, if a subject experienced headache on 
14SEP2015 lasting for three hours , then subsequently experienced intermittent 
episodes of headache every day for approximately 3 hours until 21 SEP2015, then the 
AE date of onset is 14 SEP2015 and the resolution date is 21 SEP2015.  
 For intermittent events , record the maximum severity of the individual events.  For 
example, if a subject complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the 
severity of each headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severity would be 
moderate . 
 For intermittent hospitalizations occurring for a primary AE  (e.g., in a subject with 
multiple sclerosis, commonly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in some 
cases leading to multiple hospital confinements), the subsequent hospitalizations 
should be described in the narrative description of the case.  
 If treatment was initiated, include the treatment and duration of the medication(s) in 
the eCRF.  
12.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
12.1.2.1.  Assessment of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if it fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 Death (i.e., the AE caused or led to death).  
 It was life threatening (i.e., immediately life -threatening).  
 It required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization.  
 It resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE resulted in a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions).  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 53 of 94  It resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject who 
was exposed to study therapy prior to conception or during pregnancy.  
 It is a medically significant event (s), which may include “sight -threatening events,” 
that may not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
12.1.2.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The SAE eCRF must be completed with as much information as is available within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event . 
To improve the quality and precision of acquired SAE data, Investigators should observe the 
following guidelines:  
 Death: Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported as the SAE.  
 Hospitalizations for Surgical or Diagnostic Procedures: The illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedu re 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action 
taken in response to the illness.  
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, Santen may request additional 
documentation, for example, copies of the ophthalmic and medical records as well as results of 
laboratory tests. If the subject was hospitalized, a copy of the discharge summary may be 
requested.  
12.1.2.3.  Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Santen (or designee) will provide the Principal Investigator with a  reporting cover letter and a 
masked expedited safety report for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. The Principal 
Investigator is responsible for receiving and reviewing expedited safety reports, submitting 
expedited safety reports to the IRB o r IEC, and maintaining copies of expedited safety reports in 
the study records.  
12.1.3.  Events of Special Interest  
The following are considered events of special interests ( ESIs ) and should be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF with as much information as available within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event:  
 Pregnancy:  
 There are no controlled data with the investigational product in human pregnancy. 
It is required that females of childbearing potential use effective contraception 
during the study  and recommended for 4 weeks  for female subjects  of 
childbearing potential  and 12 weeks for male subjects  capable of fathering 
children  after the completion of the study . Any pregnancy occurring during study 
treatment should be reported and the subject will be discontinued  from the study. 
The subject should be followed until the end of pregnancy or until the end of the 
study, whichever is longer.   
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 54 of 94  Medication administration errors  
 Study medication  administration errors determined to be significant by the 
Investigator will be re ported and evaluated as ESIs. Examples of study medication  
administration errors may include, but are not limited to: incorrect dose of study 
medication  and administration of study medication  from an incorrect kit. An AE 
does not necessarily need to have occurred to count as a study medication 
administration error. A medication administration error is an unintended failure in 
the process of treatment with a medicinal product that leads to, or has the 
potential to lead to harm of the subject.  
 Macular edema (including cystoid macular edema):  
 Macular edema has been reported in some patients during the DE -117 clinical 
trials. Any cases of macular edema (including cystoid macular edema ) should be 
reported in the ESI fo rm in eC RF, or in case the  electronic data capture ( EDC ) 
system is down, in the manual ESI form. Any cases of macular edema (including 
cystoid macular edema ) will need to be followed until the event is determined to 
be resolved, irreversible, chronic, stable, the subject withdraws consent, or no 
further information can be reasonably obtained as per Section  12.1.4 .   
12.1.4.  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All reported AEs  should be followed until resolution or until the subject’s participation in the 
study ends. Subjects with the following types of events should be followed by the Investigator 
until the event is determined to be resolved, irreversible, chronic, stable, the  subject withdraws 
consent, or no further information can be reasonably obtained.  
 On-going SAEs  issued after study medication  treatment  
 On-going ESIs, including pregnancy, medication errors resulting in AE’s, and 
macular edema/cystoid macular edema issued  after study medication  treatment  
 Early termination and withdrawal from the study due to study medication  related AEs  
In addition, on a case by case basis, Santen (or designee) may request follow up beyond the 
scheduled exit visit.  
The follow -up information on an individual SAE or AE (or ESI) will be entered into the eCRF 
prior to database lock. If the information requested by Santen is not part of the eCRF, or when 
database lock has already been completed, the site’s response to fol low-up requests should be 
emailed to globalPVAmericas@santen.com  or reported in writing and fax to +1 -415-276-5882 
(in the US).  
12.1.5.  Manual Back -Up Reporting Procedures  
This study is utilizing an EDC system for data entry. In the event that the EDC system is 
unavailable for electronic reporting, the manual back -up reporting procedures below should be 
followed.  
 Complete an AE Form, SAE Form, pregnancy Form, medication error Form, or ESI 
Form as appropriate . 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 55 of 94  Attach a cover sheet with your contact information and address to Santen (or its 
designee).  
 Email (preferred) or Fax the cover sheet and the completed form(s) to Santen (or its 
designee ) at globalPVAmericas@santen.com or fax number +1 -415-276-5882 (in the 
US). 
When the EDC system becomes available, the EDC sys tem should be updated with all 
previously reported information.  
12.2. Safety Parameters  
In addition to observed values, changes from baseline will be evaluated at relevant post baseline 
visits. For a safety outcome measure, the baseline value will be the last ob servation of that 
outcome measure prior to the first dose of study medication.  
12.2.1.  Ocular Assessments  
Ocular assessments include:  
 BCVA  
 Slit-lamp biomicroscopy findings: anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, lid 
hyperemia, lid edema, conjunctival hype remia, conjunctival chemosis, corneal 
edema, corneal staining, keratic precipitates, lens, anterior synechiae of iris, posterior 
synechiae of iris  
 Ophthalmoscopy variables: glaucomatous optic nerve  
 Iris color/eyelash/eyelid

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 57 of 94 14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section outlines topics related to the statistical methods used in the design and analysis of 
the study. A more detailed description of all the analyses and methods is provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.1. Interim Analysis  
There is no planned  interim an alysis for this study.  
14.2. Final Analysis  
The final analysis will be performed after all subjects completed  Month  3 (Visit  7). The  analysis 
will evaluate the  efficacy and safety of DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% once daily in 
latanoprost low/non-responder s.  
14.3. General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, unless otherwise noted, will include the number of subjects ( n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and frequency and 
percent age for categorical variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that qualifies per eligibility  criteria at Baseline ( Visit 4). 
If both eyes qualify, the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP at baseline  will be the study eye. 
If both eyes have the same mea n diurnal IOP at baseline, then the right eye will be designated as 
the study eye.  
The s tatistical testing will be conducted at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) and the 95% 
confidence  interval will be shown, unless specified otherwise .  No statistical testing will  be 
conducted for safety  measures.  
More details on the statistical methods will be described in  the SAP. 
14.3.1.  Sample Size  
Using one sample t -test with a significance level of 5%, a sample size of 150 will have 90% 
power to detect a mean diurnal IOP reduction  of 1.0mmHg  from baseline with a standard 
deviation of  3.5 mmHg, after taking into account of up to 12% dropouts.  
14.3.2.  Statistical Hypotheses and Level of Significance  
The primary endpoint  (the mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at Month  3) will be evaluated  
according to the following testing hypotheses:  
H0: µi = µj  
versus  
H1: µi ≠ µj  
where µi and µj  are the mean diurnal IOP at Baseline and Month 3, respectively.    
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 58 of 94 Paired t -test will be used to compare the difference  in diurnal IOP between  Baseline (Visit 4) and 
Month 3 (Visit 7).  The mean  difference in diurnal IOP will be reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals.   
14.4. Study Populations  
14.4.1.  Safety Population  
The Safety Population will include all subjects who signed informed consent , met the eligibility 
criteria at baseline , and received at least one dose of the study medication. The safety analysis 
will be performed on the Safety Population.  
14.4.2.  Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all Safety population who had at leas t one post -baseline 
IOP measurement. The efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS or a subset of the FAS.  
14.4.3.  Per-Protocol Set 
The Per -Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS, restricted to the subjects who fulfill the 
protocol in the terms of the eligibility, interventions, and outcome assessment. It will be the 
analysis population for some sensitivity analyses.  More details will be provided in the SAP.  
14.5. Handling of Missing Values  
The primary analysis of IOP will be based on observed cases. As a se nsitivity analysis, missing 
IOP data at Month 3 will be imputed by last observed post -baseline IOP. Sensitivity analyses 
using other imputation methods may be performed and detailed in the SAP.  
For medical events including AEs and medical history, complet ely or partially missing onset and 
resolution dates will be imputed in a conservative fashion. Same rules will be followed to impute 
the completely or partially missing start and end dates of non -study medications.  
Additional details on handling of missing  data will be provided in the SAP.  
14.6. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Age, sex, race, ethnicity, iris color, and baseline IOP will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics.  
Concurrent diseases will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA ). Subjects with any concurrent diseases will be tabulated by primary 
System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT)  specified in the MedDRA.  
Subjects using any prior medications that has been used for OAG or OHT within 28 days before 
Visit 1 ( Screening ) will be tabulated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) levels, and PT 
specified in the latest version of  World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO -
DDE, 2011 ).

14.7.1.  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at Month 3  (Visit 7) .  
The primary analysis will be performed on the FAS. Paired t -test will be used to compare the difference 
in diurnal IOP between  Baseline ( Visit 4 ) and Month 3  (Visit 7 ). The mean difference in diurnal IOP will 
be reported a long with the 95% confidence intervals.    
14.7.2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
14.7.2.1.  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  
 Percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 (Visit 7)  
 Change and percent change from baseline  (Visit 4)  in mean diurnal IOP at Week 2  
(Visit  5) and 6  (Visit 6)  
 Change and percent change from baseline in IOP for each post -baseline 
timepoint/visit  
 Having a mean diurnal IOP reduction ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%, or ≥ 30% from 
baseline  (Visit 4)  at Month 3 (Visit 7)  
 Having a mean diurnal IOP ≤ 18 mmHg at Month 3  (Visit 7)  
For change and percent change in mean diurnal IOP from baseline, d escriptive statistics  will be 
provided  includ ing the number of subjects ( n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum  and 
maximum . For binary secondary efficacy endpoint s, results will be tabulated using frequenc ies 
and percent ages. 
14.8. Safety Analyses  
All safety outcome measures will be summarized descriptively for the Safety Population. The 
safety outcome measures include AEs,  BCVA , slit-lamp biomicroscopy  findings, 
ophthalmoscopy variables , and iris color, eyelash, eyelid . 
AEs will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Subjects with any AEs will be tabulated by primary SOC and PT specified  in the 
MedDRA. Similarly, subjects with any ocular and non -ocular AEs will be tab ulated separately. 
AEs, ocular and non -ocular will also be summarized by relationship to study drug  and maximum 
severity. In addition, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuations will be summarized.  More 
details will be provided in  the SAP.  
Safety parameters  listed in Section  12.2.1  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics. 
Changes from baseline in these ocular safety parameters will also be summa rized.

The final study protocol and the final version of the informed consent form (ICF), for the main 
study and the ICF for the pharmaco genomics /genomics  study, and  other study related material, 
as appropriate, must be approved in writing by an IRB or IEC as appropriate. If an IRB or IEC 
does not approve the collection of blood  samples for optional future pharmacogen omics/genomic  
research, this will not affect the ap provals for conducting the main study.  The Principal 
Investigator must submit written IRB or IEC approval to Santen (or designee) before study 
initiation. Refer to Section 21.1, Appendix A  for a list of obligations of Investigators.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the 
protocol in accordance with local regula tions and guidelines. In addition, the IRB or IEC must 
approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study. The protocol must be re -approved 
by the IRB or IEC upon receipt of amendments.  
The Principal Investigator is also responsible for providi ng the IRB or IEC with progress reports 
and notifications of any reportable serious adverse drug reactions from the investigational 
product.  
17.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in compliance with IRB or IEC, and regulatory requirement s. This 
study will also be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidelines, International ICH 
guidelines, and  the Declaration of Helsinki.  
17.3. Written Informed Consent  
The Principal Investigator at each center will ensure that the subject is given fu ll and adequate 
oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and possible benefit of the 
study and participation in the collection of blood  samples for future pharmacogen omics/genomic  
research studies. If the subject  does not wish to provide a blood  sample for the biomarker 
research study that it will not affect the subject’s enrollment in this clinical trial. Subjects must 
also be notified that they are free to withdraw from either study at any time. Subjects should be 
given the op portunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. 
Before participating in any study -related activity, voluntary informed consent must be 
documented by the use of a written ICF approved by the IRB or IEC and signed and dated by the 
subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative at the time of consent. The original 
signed and dated ICF will be retained with the study records, and a copy of the signed ICF will 
be given to the subject or the subject’s legally authoriz ed representative. See Section 21.2,

The Principal Investigator will allow Santen (or designee), the governing IRB or IEC and 
applicable regulatory agencies to i nspect any aspect of the study, including all study records, 
eCRFs, and corresponding portions of the subject’s charts and medical records at any time 
during the study. The purpose of these inspections is to verify adherence to the protocol, 
completeness a nd accuracy of the eCRF data, and compliance with ICH -GCP guidelines and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
18.2. Retention of Records  
All records relating to the conduct of this study are to be retained by the Principal Investigator 
until notified by Santen (o r designee) that the records may be destroyed.  
18.2.1.  Source Documents  
The Principal Investigator must maintain detailed source documents on all study subjects who 
provide informed consent. Source documents include subject medical records, hospital charts, 
clinic  charts, medication dosing diaries, study files, as well as the results of diagnostic tests  
(e.g., visual field test printouts).  
The following minimum information should be entered into the subject’s medical record:  
 The date the subject entered the study and the subject number  
 The study protocol number and the name of Santen  
 The date that informed consent was obtained  
 Evidence that the subject meets study eligibility requirements (e.g., medical history, 
study procedures and/or evaluations)  
 The dates of al l study -related subject visits (scheduled and unscheduled)  
 Evidence that required procedures and/or evaluations were completed  
 Use of any concomitant medications  
 Documentation of study medication accountability  
 Occurrence and status of any AEs  
 The date the  subject exited the study and a notation as to whether the subject 
completed or terminated early from the study, including the reason for early 
termination  
18.2.2.  Source Data  
Source data is defined as all information in original records and certified copies of or iginal 
records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data should be accurate, legible, 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 65 of 94 contemporaneous, original, attributable, complete and consiste nt. Source data is documented in 
source documents which may be both electronic and on paper.  
The Investigator (s) should be aware about the location of the source data and consistent in 
recording them. The intended location should be clearly defined prior t o subject enrollment. One 
way of achieving this is to generate a source data location list. The source data location list will 
be prepared by the site and will be signed and dated by the Principal Investigator. The list will be 
filed in the Investigator ’s trial master file.  
18.2.3.  Data Collection  
The Principal Investigator  must maintain detailed records on all subjects who provide informed 
consent. Data for screened subjects will be entered into eCRFs. eCRFs should be completed 
within 3 business days of each subje ct visit as much as possible. Review of the eCRFs will be 
completed remotely by Santen (or designee). At designated intervals, a study monitor will 
perform Source Data Verification on site. During those visits, Santen (or designee) will monitor 
the subject  data recorded in the eCRF against source documents at the study site. Santen (or 
designee) will review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard system edits, and may use 
centralized monitoring evaluations, to detect errors in data collection. At the end of  the study, a 
copy of the completed eCRFs will be sent to the site to be maintained as study records.

documents.  
21.3.2. Pregnancy Test  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted using a commercially available t est kit at Visit 1 
(Screening), Visit 4 (Baseline , Day 1 ), and Visit 7 Study Exit/Early Termination for all females  
of childbearing potential. A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is post -
menopausal (at least 12 months since last men ses occurred), is without a uterus or without both 
ovaries, or has had a bilateral tubal ligation. To perform the pregnancy test, follow instructions 
provided by the manufacturer of the urine pregnancy test kit.  
21.3.3. Iris color , Eyelash, Eyelid  
Please take photographs of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes of each eye at Visit 4 (Baseline , Day 1 ), and

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 75 of 94 The photographs taken at Visit 4 (Baseline , Day 1 ) will be used to help the Investigator assess 
iris color (e.g., brown, yellow -brown, green -brown, g reen with slightly brown, green, blue/gray -
brown, blue/gray with slightly brown, blue/gray) and any changes from baseline (decreased/no 
change/increased) in iris color, eyelash es and eyelid s at Visit 7 (Month 3)  Study Exit/Early 
Termination.  For any changes from baseline in deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus (DUES), the 
response will be YES or NO.   
Each photograph will be labeled with subject number, OD or OS, and Visit number, and kept 
with the subject’s source document.  
21.3.3.1.  Iris Color  
The Investigator  will assess the iris color and any change (e.g., pigmentation) at Visit 7  (Month 
3) Study Exit/Early Termination using the photographs obtained at Visit 4 (Baseline , Day 1 ). 
21.3.3.2.  Eyelash  
The Investigator will assess eyelash change at Visit 7 (Month 3)  Study Ex it/Early Termination 
(e.g., length, thickness, pigmentation and number) using the photographs obtained at Visit 4 
(Baseline , Day 1 ). 
21.3.3.3.  Eyelid  
The Investigator will assess eyelid change at Visit 7 (Month 3)  Study Exit/Early Termination 
(e.g., pigmentation, ha ir growth and deepening of the upper eyelid sulcus ) using the photographs 
obtained at Visit 4 (Baseline , Day 1 ). For any changes from baseline in deepening of the upper 
eyelid sulcus (DUES), the response will be YES or NO.   
21.3.4.  Refraction  
Refraction will be performed for each eye at Visit 1  (Screening) . At Visits 2 to 7, if more than 10 
letters in BCVA  were lost compared to the screening visit, then refraction should be performed.  
21.3.5.  Best-Corrected Visual Acuity  
BCVA (Best -Corrected Visual Acuity ) will be measur ed for each eye prior to the 0 8:00 (±60 
min) IOP measurement at all visits except for Visit 1  (Screening ) and Visit 1a ( optional, mid-
washout visit) . For Visit 1  (Screening) and Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout visit) , BCVA will be 
performed prior to IOP measurement.  BCVA will be measured under normal room illumination 

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 76 of 94 using visual acuity chart (ETDRS chart) and the logMAR scoring will be recorded in the 
subject’s source document. If ETDRS chart is used, the following procedure should be followed.  
21.3.5.1.  ETDRS Visual Acuity Scoring  
The Examiner  records each letter identified correctly by circling the corresponding letter on an 
appropriate visual acuity worksheet. The Examiner  records a letter read incorrectly, or a letter for 
which the subject made no guess, by crossing the letter out with an “x” or a line. Each letter read 
incorrectly is scored as one point. The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as 
the Base logMAR line.  
The total number of letters that have an “x” or a line through them (letters read incorrectly or not 
at all) down to and including the Base logMAR line, and multiply the total number by 0.02. Add 
this value to the Base logMAR value to obtain the logMAR score.  
Example:  
Subject correctly reads 4 of  5 letters on the +0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the +0.1 line, and 
zero letters on the 0.0 line  
Base logMAR value = +0.1 (last line in which a letter was read correctly)  
Total number of letters missed = 4 (number of letters missed on the +0.2 line plus the number 
missed on the +0.1 line)  
LogMAR score = +0.1 + (4 x 0.02) = 0.18

21.3.7.  Intraocular Pressure  
IOP will be performed at each visit. At Visit 1  (Screening) and Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout 
visit) , IOP can be measured at any time. For Visit 2  to Visit 7 Study E xit/Early Termination, IOP 
measu rements will be scheduled for 0 8:00 (±60min ), 12:00 (±60min ) and 1 6:00 (±60min ). 
IOP will be measured using calibrated manual Goldmann applanation tonometer. Measurement 
will be performed preferably by the same Investigator  (operator) and the same authorized study 
staff member  (recorder) throughout the study.  Investigator (operator) who perform s the IOP 
measurement  must have  at least 2 years of experience in IOP measurement.  
The right eye is always tested first. At least two , and sometimes three, consecutive measurements 
are made to obtain a determination of IOP. Each IOP measurement and the clock time of IOP 
measurement will be recorded in the subject’s source document.  
A single measurement is made as follows:  
 The Investigat or adjusts the force on the tonometer dial to an initial setting 
corresponding to 10 mmHg. The slit-lamp  magnification is set at 10X. The light 
source is positioned at an angle of approximately 45º, and the aperture is maximally 
opened. A cobalt blue filte r is employed.  
 After instillation of a topical anesthetic, a fluorescein paper strip is placed near the 
lateral canthus in the lower conjunctival sac. Once the lacrimal fluid is sufficiently 
colored, the paper strip is removed. Alternatively, one drop of p remixed fluorescein 
and anesthetic (Fluress, Barnes Hind) may be instilled. The Investigator should use 
the same technique each time, be it a paper strip or a pre -mixed eye drop.  
 The subject and slit-lamp  are adjusted so that the subject’s head is firmly p ositioned 
on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning forward or straining. 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 80 of 94 Tight -fitting neckwear is loosened. The subject is asked to look straight ahead at a 
distant object or fixation target. If it is necessary to hold the eyelids op en, the 
Investigator holds the eyelids against the orbit rim, taking care not to apply any 
pressure to the globe. The subject is cautioned not to hold his breath.  
 The Investigator looks through the slit-lamp  and gently brings the tip of the prism into 
contact with the center of the cornea. The mires are well -focused, centered 
horizontally, and positioned vertically so that they are of equal circumference above 
and below the horizontal dividing line. If the mi res are narrower than approximately 
1/10 their diameter, additional fluorescein is instilled.  
 The Investigator adjusts the measuring drum until the inner borders of the two mires 
just touch each other or, if pulsation is present, until the mires separate a  given 
distance during systole and overlap the same distance during diastole.  
 The Investigator  removes the tip from the cornea, and the authorized study staff 
(recorder) records the reading on the dial, rounded to the next highest integer. For 
example, if the measurement indicated is between 16 and 17, then 17 is recorded as 
the measurement in the subject’s source document.  
 The Investigator  may also be the recorder instead of an authorized study staff  
member, if a study staff member was not assigned.  
 If cor neal astigmatism is greater than 3.0 D, the prism is rotated so that the red line 
corresponds to the orientation of the longer axis of the elliptical applanated area.  
The above procedure is then repeated for the same eye, and that second measurement is als o 
recorded in the subject’s source document.  
 If the two measurements differ by less than 3 mmHg, then the average of the two 
measurements becomes the recorded IOP. For example, if the two measurements are 
22 and 23, then 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.  
 How ever, if the two measurements differ by 3 mmHg or more, then a third 
measurement is made, and the median of the three measurements becomes the 
recorded IOP (the median is the middle measurement after ordering the 
measurements from low to high). For example , if the three measurements are 15, 19, 
and 16, then 16 is the final recorded IOP.  
The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.  
21.3.7.1.  Goldmann Applanation Tonometer Calibration  
It is mandatory for e very tonometer  used in the study  to be cal ibrated for accuracy before the 
first subject undergoes screening . Thereafter, the calibration must be checked monthly  until the 
last subject has exited the study. For calibration  checks, t he manufacturer’s instructions  should 
be followed . If the variation is within ±2 mmHg, the tonometer is considered adequately 
calibrated. However, if the variation exceeds this amount, the tonometer should be sent for repair 
and a different, adequately calibrated instrument should be used for IOP measure ment. The date 
of each calibration, along with the name and signature (or initials) of the person who performed 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 81 of 94 the calibration, will be documented. The tonometer calibration record will be retained as a part of 
the study record.  
21.3.8.  Pachymetry (C entral Cornea l Thickness ) 
The central corneal thickness (µm) of each eye using any pachymeter  including optical 
pachymeter, ultrasound pachymeter, OCT  (optical coherence tomography ) etc. will be measured  
and record ed after IOP measurement at Visit 1 (Screening) . Pachym etry should be performed 
after IOP measurement . The same pachymeter should be used during the course of the study.  
21.3.9.  Gonioscopy  
Gonioscopy will be performed to examine the angle of the anterior chamber after IOP 
measurement at Visit 1 (Screening), if it has not been performed within 3 months  (90 days) . The 
Shaffer scale will be used to rate the degree of angle closure.  
(0) = approximately 5 degrees or less, complete or partial closure  
(1) = approximately 10 degrees  
(2) = approximately 20 degrees  
(3) = approximately 30 degrees  
(4) = approximately 40 degrees or more  
21.3.10.  Visual Field  
Visual field examinations will be performed using a static or dynamic perimeter (Humphrey or 
Octopus) without pupil dilation  at Visit 1 (Screening), if this has not been performed  within 3 
months  (90 days)  or the previous visual field test(s) indicates low subject reliability (e.g., due to 
fixation losses, false positive errors, or false negative errors). Glaucomatous visual field loss will 
be evaluated by the Investigator as prese nce or absence (mean deviation, pattern SD, glaucoma 
hemifield test, and type of glaucomatous visual field loss).  
Visual field tests that, in the Investigator's opinion, indicate low subject reliability (e.g., due to 
fixation losses, false positive errors,  or false negative errors) should be excluded. A copy of the 
computer printout from the visual field test(s) will be attached to the subject’s source documents.  
21.3.11.  Ophthalmoscopy (Fundus) Examination  
The ophthalmoscopy (fundus) examination will be performed f or each eye at Visit 1  (Screening) , 
Visit 4 (Baseline, Day 1) , and Visit 7 Study Exit/Early Termination, and graded as described 
below. Ophthalmoscopy will be performed under dilation  at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 7 
Study Exit/Early Termination. P upil dilation must be p erform ed after all other ocular procedures 
have been completed.  Cup to disc ratio and abnormality in retina, macula, choroid, and vitreous 
will also be evaluated.  
Glaucomatous Optic Nerve Findings  
The optic nerve will be evaluated using a 4-point scale (0 -3 scale).  
None  (0) =  No damage  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 82 of 94 Mild  (1) =  Optic nerve damage, secondary to glaucoma including any rim loss 
(sloping or thinning)  
Moderate  (2) =  Optic nerve damage, including cupping to disc margin at one or more 
points  
Severe  (3) =  Optic  nerve damage, nearly total cupping, only nasal rim or less  present  
21.3.12.  Blood  Sample for Pharmacogen omics/genomics  Study  
For sites which elect to participate and for subjects who agree to provide a blood  sample, an 
exploratory biomarker laboratory research stu dy will be performed to evaluate the association of 
possible genetic biomarkers with the study drug(s) and/or ophthalmologic conditions. 
Approximately 10 mL of blood  will be collected for genetic analysis from the subject and stored 
in a refrigerator until  shipment. Please refer to the separate procedure  manual for sample 
handling, storage, and shipment. The samples will be coded to protect the participants’ private 
information. Nucleic acids will be extracted from blood  sample and stored in the repository for 
future pharmacogenomics/genomics studies performed by appropriate assay platforms such as 
PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), hybridization, and sequencing on the genes involved in the 
study drug(s) and/or ophthalmolog ic conditions. Individual subjects’ results from the research 
testing on their samples will not be communicated to them.  
Samples collected and stored, and relevant documents (the list of screening/registration of 
subjects only for documents to be retained by the medical institution) will be retained for the 
period agreed in the IC F. Upon completion of analyses or the retention period, they will be 
anonymized and dis carded . If the subject withdraws the consent, samples will be immediately 
disposed, and the a pplicable subject will be informed in writing.  
For any other matters not specified in the protocol, a written procedure will be defined 
separately.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION  
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE  
Latanoprost is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open -angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
The recommended dosage is  one drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening. If one dose is 
missed, treatment should continue with the next dose as normal.  
The dosage of latanoprost ophthalmic solution should not exceed once daily; the combined use of two or 
more prostagla ndins, or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost ophthalmic solution is not 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 86 of 94 recommended. It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once 
daily may decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect or cau se paradoxical elevations in IOP.  
Reduction of the IOP starts approximately 3 to 4 hours after administration and the maximum effect is 
reached after 8 to 12 hours.  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic dru g products 
to lower IOP. If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at 
least five (5) minutes apart. Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution, and may be r einserted 15 minutes after administration.  
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  
Sterile ophthalmic solution containing 50 mcg/mL latanoprost.  
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Known hypersensitivity to latanoprost, benzalkonium chloride, or any other ingredients in this produc t. 
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 Pigmentation  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues. The most 
frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris, periorbital tissue (eyelid), and 
eyelashes. Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost ophthalmic solution is 
administered.  
The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase 
in the number of melanocytes. After discontinu ation of latanoprost, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be 
permanent, while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be 
reversible in some patients. Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possib ility of 
increased pigmentation. Beyond 5 years the effects of increased pigmentation are not known [see Clinical 
Studies (14.2)] . 
Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years. Typically, the brown pigmentation 
around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the 
iris become more brownish. Neither nevi nor  freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment. While 
treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic solution can be continued in patients who develop noticeably 
increased iris pigmentation, these patients should be examined regularly [see Patient Counsel ing 
Information (17)] . 
5.2 Eyelash Changes  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye; these 
changes include increased length, thickness, pigmentation, the number of lashes or hairs, and misdirected 
growth of eyelashes. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [see 
Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 87 of 94 5.3 Intraocular Inflammation  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with a history of in traocular 
inflammation (iritis/uveitis) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular 
inflammation because inflammation may be exacerbated.  
5.4 Macular Edema  
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, has been reported during tr eatment with latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution. Latanoprost ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in aphakic patients, in 
pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for 
macular edema.  
5.5 Herpet ic Keratitis  
Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported during treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution. Latanoprost ophthalmic solution should be used with caution in patients with a history of 
herpetic keratitis. Latanoprost ophthal mic solution should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex 
keratitis because inflammation may be exacerbated.  
5.6 Bacterial Keratitis  
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple -dose containers of 
topical ophtha lmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in 
most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [see Patient 
Counseling Information (17)] . 
5.7 Use with Contact Lenses  
Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of latanoprost ophthalmic solution, and may 
be reinserted 15 minutes after administration.  
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The following adverse reactions were reported in postmarketing experience and are di scussed in greater 
detail in other sections of the label:  
 Iris pigmentation changes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]  
 Eyelid skin darkening [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] 
 Eyelash changes (increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and number of la shes) [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.2)]  
 Intraocular inflammation (iritis/uveitis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]  
 Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]  
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  
Because clinical tr ials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed 
in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug 
and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practic e. 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 88 of 94 Latanoprost ophthalmic solution was studied in three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. 
Patients received 50 mcg/mL latanoprost ophthalmic solution once daily or 5 mg/mL active -comparator 
(timolol) twice daily. The patient population s tudied had a mean age of 65±10 years. Seven percent of 
patients withdrew before the 6 -month endpoint.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience  
The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution in clinical practice. Because they are reported voluntarily f rom a population of unknown 
size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal 
relationship to drug exposure. The reactions, which have been chosen for inclusion due to either 
their seriousness, frequency of reportin g, possible causal connection to latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution, or a combination of these factors, include:  
Nervous System Disorders : Dizziness; headache; toxic epidermal necrolysis  
Eye Disorders : Eyelash and vellus hair changes of the eyelid (increased length, thickness, 
pigmentation, and number of eyelashes); keratitis; corneal edema and erosions; intraocular 
inflammation (iritis/uveitis); macular edema, including cystoid macular edema; trichiasi s; 
periorbital and lid changes resulting in deepening of the eyelid sulcus; iris cyst; eyelid skin 
darkening; localised skin reaction on the eyelids; conjunctivitis; pseudopemphigoid of the ocular 
conjunctiva  
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Asthma and exacerbation of asthma; dyspnea  
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders:  Pruritus  
Infections and Infestations : Herpes keratitis  
Cardiac Disorders : Angina; palpitations; angina unstable  
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Ches t pain  
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  
In vitro  studies have shown that precipitation occurs when eye drops containing thimerosal are 
mixed with latanoprost ophthalmic solution. If such drugs are used, they should be administered 
at least five (5) minutes apart.  
The c ombined use of two or more prostaglandins, or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution is not recommended. It has been shown that administration of these 
prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause 
paradoxical elevations in IOP.  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 90 of 94 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  
8.1 Pregnancy  
Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C.  
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. In rabbits, an incidence of 4 of 16 
dams had no viable fetus es at a dose that was approximately 80 times the maximum human dose, 
and the highest nonembryocidal dose in rabbits was approximately 15 times the maximum 
human dose.  
There are no adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women. Latanoprost ophthalm ic 
solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
to the fetus.  
8.3 Nursing Mothers  
It is not known whether this drug or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many 
drugs are excreted in hum an milk, caution should be exercised when latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution is administered to a nursing woman.  
8.4 Pediatric Use  
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.  
8.5 Geriatric Use  
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and 
younger patients.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
Intravenous infusion of up to 3 mcg/kg in healthy volunteers produced mean plasma 
concentrations 200 times higher than during clinical treatment and no adverse reactions w ere 
observed. Intravenous dosages of 5.5 to 10 mcg/kg caused abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, hot 
flushes, nausea, and sweating.  
If overdosage with latanoprost ophthalmic solution occurs, treatment should be symptomatic.

Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservativ e. The inactive ingredients are: sodium 
chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, 
and water for injection. One drop contains approximately 1.5 mcg of latanoprost.  
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Ac tion 
Latanoprost is a prostanoid selective FP receptor agonist that is believed to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP) by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor. Studies in animals and man suggest 
that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscler al outflow. Elevated IOP represents a 
major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the 
likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3 –4 hou rs after administration and maximum effect is 
reached after 8 –12 hours. IOP reduction is present for at least 24 hours.  
12.3 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to 
the acid form to become biologically active.  
Distribution  
The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 ± 0.02 L/kg. The acid of latanoprost can be measured 
in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour after local 
administration. Studies in man indicate that the peak concentration in the aqueous humor is 
reached about two hours after topical administration.  
Metabolism  

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 92 of 94 Latanoprost, an isopropyl ester prodrug, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the 
biologically active acid. The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is 
primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1,2 -dinor and 1,2,3,4 -tetranor metabolites via fatty acid 
β-oxidation.  
Excretion  
The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is r apid (t 1/2 = 17 min) after both 
intravenous and topical administration. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg. 
Following hepatic β -oxidation, the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys. 
Approximately 88% and 98% of the administered dos e are recovered in the urine after topical 
and intravenous dosing, respectively.  
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  
Latanoprost was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when administered by oral gavage at  
doses of up to 170 mcg/kg/day (approximately 2800 times the recommended maximum human 
dose) for up to 20 and 24 months, respectively.  
Latanoprost was not mutagenic in bacteria, in mouse lymphoma, or in mouse micronucleus tests. 
Chromosome aberrations were  observed in vitro  with human lymphocytes. Additional in vitro  
and in vivo  studies on unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative.  
Latanoprost has not been found to have any effect on male or female fertility in animal studies.  
14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
14.1 Elevated Baseline IOP  
Patients with mean baseline IOP of 24 – 25 mmHg who were treated for 6 months in multi -
center, randomized, controlled trials demonstrated 6 – 8 mmHg reductions in IOP. This IOP 
reduction with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% dosed once daily was equivalent to the 
effect of timolol 0.5% dosed twice daily.  
14.2 Progression of Increased Iris Pigmentation  
A 3-year open -label, prospective safety study with a 2 -year extension phase was conducted to 
evaluate the progression of increa sed iris pigmentation with continuous use of latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution once -daily as adjunctive therapy in 519 patients with open -angle glaucoma. 
The analysis was based on observed -cases population of the 380 patients who continued in the 
extension p hase.  
Results showed that the onset of noticeable increased iris pigmentation occurred within the first 
year of treatment for the majority of the patients who developed noticeable increased iris 
pigmentation. Patients continued to show signs of increasing iris pigmentation throughout the 
five years of the study. Observation of increased iris pigmentation did not affect the incidence, 
nature, or severity of adverse events (other than increased iris pigmentation) recorded in the 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 93 of 94 study. IOP reduction was simil ar regardless of the development of increased iris pigmentation 
during the study.  
16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution is a clear, isotonic, buffered, preserved colorless solution of 
latanoprost 0.005% (50 mcg/mL). It is sup plied as a 2.5 mL solution in a 5 mL clear low density 
polyethylene bottle with a clear polyethylene dropper tip, a turquoise high density polyethylene 
screw cap, and a tamper -evident clear low density polyethylene overcap.  
2.5 mL fill, 0.005% (50 mcg/mL):  Package of 1 bottle: NDC 59762 -0333 -2 
Storage: Protect from light. Store unopened bottle(s) under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 
46°F). During shipment to the patient, the bottle may be maintained at temperatures up to 40°C 
(104°F) for a period not ex ceeding 8 days. Once a bottle is opened for use, it may be stored at 
room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for 6 weeks.  
17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION  
Potential for Pigmentation  
Advise patients about the potential for increased brown pigmentation of the iris, which may be 
permanent. Inform patients about the possibility of eyelid skin darkening, which may be 
reversible after discontinuation of latanoprost ophthalmic solution [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)] . 
Potential for Eyelash Changes  
Inform patients of the possibility of eyelash and vellus hair changes in the treated eye during 
treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic solution. These changes may result in a disparity between 
eyes in length, thickness, pigmentation, number of eyelashes or vellus hairs, and/or direction of 
eyelash growth. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.  
Handling the Container  
Instruct patients to avoid allowing the tip of  the dispensing container to contact the eye or 
surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common 
bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of 
vision may result from usin g contaminated solutions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 
When to Seek Physician Advice  
Advise patients that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection) or 
have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particul arly conjunctivitis and eyelid 
reactions, they should immediately seek their physician's advice concerning the continued use of 
the multiple -dose container.  
Use with Contact Lenses  
Advise patients that latanoprost ophthalmic solution contains benzalkonium chloride, which may 
be absorbed by contact lenses. Contact lenses should be removed prior to administration of the 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 94 of 94 solution. Lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution.  
Use with Other Ophthalmic Drugs  
If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used, the drugs should be administered at least 
five (5) minutes apart.

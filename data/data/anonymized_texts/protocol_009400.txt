Title:  A Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Clinical Tri al to 
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Oral GKT137831 in Patients 
with Primary Biliary Cholangitis Receiving Ursodeoxycholic Acid 
and with Persistently Elevated Alkaline Phosphatase  
Study Overview:  This will be a double -blind, randomized, placebo -control led, 
multicenter, parallel group phase 2 trial assessing a 24-week  
period of treatment with oral GKT137831 administered in addition 
to standard of care medication (ursodeoxycholic acid; UDCA) in 
subjects with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).  
Subjects wil l be assessed for their eligibility during the screening 
period (Visit 1), which will last up to 4 weeks, until the 
baseline /Day 1 visit (Visit 2).  
Eligible subjects will be randomized to oral GKT137831 ( 400 mg 
once daily (OD) or 400 mg twice daily (BID) o r placebo, according 
to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, stratified at study entry by disease 
severity defined as baseline serum gamma glutamyl transferase  
(GGT ) < 2.5 x the upper normal limit (ULN) or ≥ 2.5 x the ULN.  
Subjects will self -administer orally 400 mg of GKT137831 OD or 
400 mg of GKT137831 BID or matching placebo for a total of 24 
weeks.  
Baseline assessments will be performed at baseline /Day 1 (Visit 
2). The 24 -week treatment period will include assessments after 
2 weeks of treatment (Visit 3), afte r 6 weeks of treatment (Visit 4), 
after 12 weeks of treatment (Visit 5), after 18 weeks of treatment 
(Visit 6) and after 24 weeks of treatment (End of Treatment/Visit 
7). Subjects will be followed up for 28 days after the end of 
treatment (Week 28/Visit 8) , totaling 6 post -baseline visits. 
Subjects who discontinue treatment before Week 24 will have an 
early termination visit (premature end of treatment visit).  
Pharmacokinetic samples will  be taken at Week 2, Week 12 and 
Week 18 . 
Subjects will be taking a st able dose of UDCA at enrollment and 
will continue their UDCA treatment at a stable dose (no changes

An Independent  Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will oversee the 
conduct of the study to ensure the safety of participati ng subjects. 
An interim analysis will be conducted when 80-90% of the 
planned number of subjects to be randomized in the study  have 
completed their Week 6 visit.  
Objectives:  
 Primary:  
To evaluate the efficacy of oral GKT137831 in comparison with 
placebo, in subjects with PBC receiving UDCA and with 
persistently elevated Alkaline Phosphatase ( ALP). 
Secondary:  
 To evaluate the safety of oral GKT137831 in comparison with 
placebo, in subjects with PBC.  
 To estimate the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
GKT1378 31 and explore any potential P harmacokinetics -
Pharmacodynamics (P K-PD) relationships in this subject 
population.  
 To explore any relation ship between genetic parameters and 
therapeutic responses in a subset of subjects.  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The perce nt change from baseline to Week 24 (Visit 7) in serum 
GGT . 
Secondary  Efficacy 
Endpoint s:  Absolute and percent change in serum GGT from baseline to 
each assessment.  
 Absolute change in Enhanced Liver Fibrosis ( ELF) score from 
baseline to Weeks 12 and 24.  
 Absolute and percent  change in serum ALP from baseline to 
each assessment.  
 Absolute and percent change in serum levels of high-
sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP ) and fibrinogen, from 
baseline to each assessment.  
 Absolute and percent change in serum A lanine 
Aminotransferase (A LT), Aspartate Aminotransferase (A ST), 
conjugated and total bilirubin, from baseline to each 
assessment .

AST to Platelet Ratio Index ( APRI ) scores, from b aseline to 
each asses sment  (FIB-4: age (years) x AST (IU/L)/(platelet 
count (109/L) x (ALT (IU/L)1⁄2, APRI: AST (IU/L)/ upper normal 
limit AST)x100/platelet count (109/L). 
 Absolute and percent change in liver stiffness as assessed by 
transient elastography (FibroScan® or simil ar technology ), 
from b aseline to Week 24, in patients with values at b aseline 
and Week 24.  
 Absolute and percent change in serum levels of collagen 
fragments indicative of collagen formation and degradation , 
from baseline  to Weeks 12 and 24.  
 Absolute and pe rcent change in Quality of Life (QoL), Fatigue 
and Pruritus scores based on the PBC -40 and Pruritus Visual 
Analogue Score (VAS), from baseline to Weeks 12 and 24.  
Eligibility Criteria  Eligibility assessments will be conducted at Screening (Visit 1). 
When confirming eligibility at baseline /Day 1 (Visit 2), not every 
eligibility assessment needs to be repeated i.e., confirmatory 
laboratory and diagnostic tests. Subjects with adverse events 
(AE) at baseline  may need to be withdrawn in accordance with 
the elig ibility and withdrawal criteria.

SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
2.1.1  Primary Biliary Cholangitis  
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is a liver disease 
caused by auto -immune (T -cell-mediated) attack on the small to medium intra -lobular bile ducts [1, 
2]. A continuous assault on the bile duct epithelial cells leads to their gradual destruction and 
eventual disappearance  (i.e., ductopenia) . Once immune -mediated bile duct injury has been 
established, the disease progresses due to chronic ch olestasis, secondary inflammation and fibrosis , 
and may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver failure [3, 4]. The reasons for the auto -immune attack are not 
well understood but may involve environmental triggers in genetically susceptible individuals.  
The repo rted prevalence of PBC ranges from 20 -400 cases per million of the population with some 
geographical differences [5, 6]. PBC is more common in women than men (9:1 ratio) and mostly 
diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60 years [7, 8].   
Up to 60% of patient s with PBC are asymptomatic at diagnosis and are detected through  
coincidental finding of abnormalities in liver biochemistry tests. The most common symptoms, where 
present, are fatigue and pruritus. Physical examination is often normal but, where present,  common 
findings are: skin hyperpigmentation, jaundice, excoriations, xanthomata, xanthelasmas and, rarely, 
hepatosplenomegaly [9, 10].  
Common laboratory test abnormalities in patients with PBC include: elevated ALP, anti -mitochondrial 
antibodies (AMA), an ti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), and hyperlipidemia. Other findings may include 
elevations in serum aminotransferases and bilirubin. Complications of PBC include cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma, metabolic bone disease, and malabsorption [11, 12].  
PBC is of ten associated (co -diagnosed) with other auto -immune disorders including: Sjogren 
syndrome, auto -immune thyroid disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis) and rheumatoid arthritis.  
Management of patients with PBC consists of treatment of the underlying disease and  management 
of its symptoms and complications, including: pruritus, xanthomata, hypercholesterolemia, vitamin 
deficiencies, anemia, malabsorption, osteoporosis, etc.  
PBC is a progressive disease in most patients. It eventually becomes irreversible, and the refore 
untreatable.  The only widely accepted treatment is UDCA. It is the only treatment recommended in 
guidelines issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 113 Although there i s currently no treatment for the autoimmune injury to biliary endothelial cells,  in 
recent years, novel therapies targeting cholestasis have  improved outcomes for many patients with 
PBC. UDCA  and more recently obeticholic acid (OCA)  have been  licensed by t he Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), for treatment of PBC   
UDCA is a synthetic secondary bile acid, given orally at a dose of 10 -15 mg/kg/day as first line 
treatment for PBC. The following mechanisms of action may be i nvolved in the beneficial therapeutic 
effects of UDCA in PBC and other cholestatic disorders : (a) increase in the hydrophilicity of 
circulating bile acids; (b) stimulation of hepatocellular and ductular secretions; (c) protection against 
cellular injury ca used by bile acids and cytokines; (d) some degree of immunomodulation and anti -
inflammatory effects. Currently, treatment with UDCA represents the global standard of care [2, 3], 
and can delay histologic progression [4–6] and improve long -term survival [7,  8]. However, UDCA is 
not a uniformly effective drug, there is little benefit to symptoms , and approximately 40% of PBC 
patients have a sub -optimal response to UDCA [13, 14].  Patients with an inadequate response to 
UDCA (assessed biochemically), or those n ot tolerating UDCA, progress to cirrhosis and liver failure 
leading to liver transplant or death. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need in PBC patients with 
inadequate response to UDCA.  
OCA  is another synthetic secondary bile acid which has only recent ly been approved by the FDA  
and EMA for treatment of PBC [15, 16]. OCA is indicated for the treatment of PBC in combination 
with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to 
tolerate UDCA. OCA is not yet in wide  clinical use. It has a similar mechanism of action as UDCA 
but has been shown to achieve further reductions in ALP levels in patients with inadequate  response 
to UDCA. This additional  anti-cholestatic effect was associated with a reduction in hepatocellul ar 
damage, as shown by decreases in AST and ALT levels. However, OCA treatment achieved only 
small reductions in these markers of hepatocellular injury which failed to normalize to below the 
upper limit of the normal reference range [ 17]. Over time, this s ustained hepatocellular injury likely 
contributes to progressive liver fibrosis and failure. Separately, OCA worsens the severity of pruritus, 
a key symptom of PBC which significantly impact s patients’ quality of life.  The currently available 
therapies mai nly target cholestasis. However, there is a need for well -tolerated therapies able to 
address additional components of the disease, including autoimmune injury to biliary endothelial 
cells, bile acid -mediated hepatocellular injury, and fibrogenesis [ 18, 19 ].  
2.1.2  GKT137 831 
GKT137831 is a small organic molecule of low molecular weight, a member of the pyrazolopyridine 
dione chemical class. It is a selective inhibitor of NOX 1 and 4 isoforms of the Nicotinamide Adenine 
Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH ) oxidase famil y of enzymes , and is the first drug in this class of 
NOX inhibitors to enter the clinic.  
The NADPH oxidase family (NOX) is a set of transmembrane proteins  [20]. NOX enzymes require 
the stable assembly of transmembrane and cytosolic subunits. Upon assembly  of a full enzymatic 
complex and activation by its substrates NADPH and molecular oxygen, NOX enzymes transport 
electrons through the cell membrane to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) . In turn, ROS

ROS can also cause other types of post -translational modification of proteins, and can target lipids 
and nucleic acids.  
When exaggerated in duration and/or magnitude, NOX activation  participate s in the pathoge nesis of 
a broad range of human diseases .  In particular, the NOX1 and NOX4 isoforms have been shown to 
play a key role in a broad range of infla mmatory and fibrotic disorders [21-25]. Importantly, recent 
studies have revealed that liver tissue expression of NOX1 and/or NOX4 is consistently elevated in 
patients with fibrotic liver diseases [ 26, 27 ]. 
GKT137831 is thus being investigated in several inflammatory and fibrotic disorders , including PBC, 
Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), Idiopathic Pulmonary Fi brosis (IPF), Diabetic Kidney Disease 
(DKD), Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) . It is also under investigation  in the developme nt of the fibrotic 
tumor stroma . 
In in vitro  studies in isolated cells, GKT137831 was shown to attenuate signaling evoked by a 
number of l igands known to induce and/or drive the fibrogenic process in multiple fibrogenic 
pathways , including TGF -β1, PDGF, TLR4, hedgehog and angiotensin II  [26]. As a result , 
GKT137831 markedly reduced the induction of markers of myofibroblast activation , includ ing αSMA, 
fibronectin, and pro -collagen I  [28, 29 ]. 
These direct anti -fibrogenic effects translate in to anti-fibrotic activity in multiple in vivo  models of liver 
fibrosis. Specifically, GKT137831 attenuated the development of liver fibrosis induced by 
experimental cholestasis (in the bile duct ligation and MDR2 -/-, mouse models). GKT137831 also 
prevented liver fibrosis in models of NASH (in the STAM and fast food diet models  [29]). GKT137831 
also prevented liver fibrosis in models of NASH (in the STAM and fast food diet models [27, 30 ]) and 
in toxic hepatitis (in CCL4 -induced liver injury [ 28]). Reduced in vivo  fibrogenesis was associated 
with a marked reduction in markers of myofibroblast activation.  
In addition, GKT137831 has shown potent anti -inflammator y effects in a number of biological 
settings , including metabolic and cholestatic liver injury. Specifically, GKT137831 prevented the 
induction of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines in CCL4 -induced liver injury and fast 
food diet -induced NASH [ 27]. These effects on innate immunity resulted in a profound reduction of 
macrophage infiltration. Available data suggests that these anti -inflammatory effects are mediated 
through reduced activation of multiple pathways , including TLR4 and NF -B [21]. In these studies, 
reduced liver inflammation was associated with a reduction in plasma levels of liver transaminases.  
GKT137831 was evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes and kidney disease. Because this patient 
population has a high prevalenc e of the metabolic syndrome and non -alcoholic fatty liver disease, 
the trial assessed markers of liver injury and inflammation. GKT137831 achieved statistically 
significant reductions in GGT  and hsCRP . 
These extensive pre -clinical studies and initial clini cal results suggest that GKT137831 has the 
potential to alleviate hepatocellular injury and prevent progressive liver fibrosis.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 113 2.1.3  Choice of Endpoints  
The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of GKT137831 on liver injury and 
inflammation, and  on fibrogenesis. While plasma ALP is a reasonably well -validated surrogate 
endpoint of outcomes for anti -cholestatic drugs, there are no validated surrogate endpoints for anti -
inflammatory and anti -fibrotic drugs. Accordingly, the primary and secondary ef ficacy endpoints have 
been selected to provide proof of concept for the therapeutic value of GKT137831 , and to 
characterize its initial efficacy profile.  
2.1.3.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
GGT was selected as the primary efficacy endpoint because it is consistently  elevated in PBC 
patients, correlates with disease severity, can respond quickly to therapeutic interventions, and is 
likely to be modulated by GKT137831 through anti -inflammatory and redox mechanisms. In 
cholestatic disease, elevated GGT reflects inflamma tory and cholestatic injury to bile ducts and 
hepatic parenchymal structures. GGT is expressed in biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes, and is 
elevated in multiple biliary and non -biliary liver disorders , including PBC, PSC, NASH, ALD, and 
hepatitis B and C. GGT correlates with the severity of liver fibrosis across a broad range of fibrotic 
liver disorders [31-37]. As a result, GGT has been included in the Fi broSure/FibroTest score, a non -
invasive marker of liver fibrosis [ 38]. Importantly, GGT responds  rapidly (i.e. within weeks) to the 
administration of UDCA, OCA, fibrates, or a modified FGF -19 [17, 39 ]. 
GGT is involved in hepatic redox homeostasis and is a marker of oxidative stress [ 40-42]. So, in 
addition to cholestatic and inflammatory injury, oxid ative stress can also participate in the induction 
of GGT expression in PBC patients. Accordingly, GKT137831 has the potential to reduce GGT 
levels through anti -inflammatory and redox mechanisms in cholangiocytes and hepatocytes. While 
not directly relevan t to PBC, the statistically significant reduction in GGT achieved with GKT137831 
in patients with DKD  supports this assumption. Of note, GGT levels predict renal and all -cause 
mortality in DKD patients [ 43, 44 ].  
In summary, while GGT is not a validated su rrogate endpoint of outcome in PBC, it is a clinically 
relevant efficacy endpoint that is well suited to demonstrate the ph armacodynamic activity of 
GKT137 831, and together with supportive secondary endpoints, inform dose -response relationships.  
2.1.3.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Related to Fibrosis  
The evaluation of the anti -fibrotic activity of GKT137831 is an important objective of the trial. Patients 
with inadequate response to UDCA undergo accelerated liver fibrosis [ 45]. It is therefore critical to 
develop novel therapies able to directly target fibrogenesis. GKT137831 has shown profound anti -
fibrotic activity in multiple models of fibrotic liver diseases. It was not only effective in models of 
NASH, where hepatic stellate cells are the main source of activa ted myofibroblasts, it was also 
effective in cholestatic models such as MDR2 -/- mice where portal fibroblasts are the source of 
activated myofibroblasts.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 113 The effect of GKT137831 on liver fibrosis will be explored through the evaluation of direct non -
invasi ve markers of fibrogenesis. These markers include the ELF score and a panel of collagen 
fragments. In addition, liver stiffness will be evaluated by transient elastography (performed at 
centers where FibroScan™ or similar equipment is available). Finally, indirect markers of fibrosis, 
such as FIB -4 and APRI, will be also assessed [ 46]. 
A growing body of evidence supports the use of the ELF score to evaluate anti -fibrotic therapies. 
The ELF score is a direct marker of fibrogenesis; its components (HA, TIMP -1, and PIIINP) have a 
direct role in the fibrogenic process [ 47-56]. The ELF score correlates well with the presence and 
severity of liver fibrosis in several fibrotic liver diseases , including hepatitis C, hepatitis B, NASH, 
PBC, autoimmune hepatitis, alco hol liver disease and others [ 57-62]. Furthermore, the ELF score 
accurately predicts disease progression in PBC, NASH, and h epatitis C, as shown by the correlation 
between the baseline ELF sco re and the occurrence of liver -related events (LREs) during foll ow up. 
Initial clinical results suggest  the ELF test has the ability to detect the effect of therapeutic 
interventions in several fibrotic liver diseases , including PBC [ 19, 46, 57, 58 ]. In PBC patients, event -
free survival was significantly lower in those  with high baseline ELF. Each 1 - point increase in ELF 
was associated with a 3 -fold increase in future complications [ 57]. Similar data was obtained in 
patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, where patients stratified by the ELF score tertiles 
exhibi ted significantly different transplant -free survival (P < 0.001), with higher scores associated 
with shorter survival, further confirmed in the validation set stratified by ELF Test tertiles (P= 0.003). 
In addition, the ELF Test distinguished between mild and severe disease as defined by clinical 
outcome (transplantation or death) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81.  
The ELF test has received the CE and has been extensively validated and reference values have 
been published [ 57, 63, 64]. Accordingly,  treatment guidelines issues by NICE and EASL –EASD –
EASO recommend the use of the ELF test to detect the presence of liver fibrosis and to monitor 
therapeutic responses.  
Despite these encouraging developments, further work is required to validate the ELF s core as 
surrogate endpoint of outcome in PBC. In particular, it is still unclear  that ELF score reductions 
achieved by specific therapeutic interventions do predict improvements in clinical outcomes.  
Importantly however, available data suggest that the ELF  score will be elevated in the target patient 
population. In a comparable patient population, the ELF score suggested that most patients had 
moderate -to-severe liver fibrosis [Hirschfield, 2016]. This data is consistent with results obtained in a 
similar p atient population in the OCA phase 3 trial [ 17]. In this trial, all patients had some degree of 
liver fibrosis, and over 50% of patients had at least septal fibrosis (OCA, FDA medical review). 
Therefore, the ELF score is well suited for the evaluation of a nti-fibrotic effects in this trial.

Markers of hepatocellular injury such as AST or ALT are only modestly elevated in PBC patients , 
and have shown inconsistent responses to OCA. Accordingly, th ey were not selected as primary 
efficacy endpoints. Nevertheless, these markers, together with CK -18 and total and conjugated 
bilirubin will provide supportive information about drug effects on hepatocellular injury. In preclinical 
models of cholestatic an d metabolic liver diseases, GKT137831 achieved marked reductions in liver 
function tests and reduced hepatocyte apoptosis.  
2.1.3.4  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Related to Immunological 
Processes and Inflammation  
GKT137831 has shown consistent anti -inflammatory eff ects in preclinical studies. In patients with 
type 2 diabetes, GKT137831 achieved a significant reduction in hsCRP (an acute phase protein 
produced in the liver), and tended to reduce plasma levels of serum amyloid protein A and IL -6. 
Accordingly, changes in hsCRP, fibrinogen, and IL -6 will be evaluated to assess the anti -
inflammatory effect of GKT137831.  
The role of NOX enzymes in the underlying immunological process is unknown. Nevertheless, it is 
suggested that NOX1 and NOX4 play a role in some of the im munologica l pathways underlying 
PBC. Accordingly, changes in serum IgM, I L-4, IL-12, IL -17A, and interferon γ will be assessed.  
2.1.4  Summary of Non -Clinical Studies with GKT137831  
A broad range of in vitro  and in vivo  pharmacology studies have been conducted to support the use 
of GKT137831 in several indications. Detailed summaries for all studies are given in the current 
Investigator’s brochure  (IB). GKT137831 selectively inhibits human isolated NOX4 (IC 50 0.147 µM) 
and NOX1 (IC 50 0.214 µM) but is considerably less active at inhibiting isolated human NOX2 (IC 50 
3.44 µM), NOX3 (IC 50 3.44 µM) and NOX5 (IC 50 0.457 µM). This selectivity against NOX2 means 
GKT137831 does not compromise phagocyte function. Moreover, GKT137831 was inactive against 
the non -NADPH oxidase flavoprotein xanthine oxidase, and inhibited glucose oxidase with an IC 50 of 
5.7µM, indicating selective inhibition of ROS generation via the NADPH oxidase pathway. 
Meanwhile , GKT137831 reduced DPPH with an IC 50 of 20µM, suggesting GKT137831 is a weak 
electron donor, and may therefore possess  weak antioxidant activity. Investi gation of potential 
effects against a broad range of receptors and enzymes confirmed that GKT137831 demonstrated 
no significant off -target activity , except for significant inhibition of human recombinant 15 -
lipoxygenase -2. However, a review of available  literature did not detect  a safety concern.  
Similarly, a literature review on the effect of gene deletion of NOX isoforms indicated that no basal 
phenotype has been associated with NOX1 or NOX4 gene deletion in mice. Specifically, there are 
no reported defec ts in fertility, embryonic development, life span, animal behavior or breeding. 
These observations did not identify potential safety concerns related to inhibition of NOX1 and/or 
NOX4.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 113 Overall , there are no observations from the available literature to ind icate safety concerns 
associated with chronic pharmacological inhibition of NOX1, NOX4 and NOX5.  
Safety pharmacology studies demonstrated that there were no effects on general activity, behavior 
or respiratory parameters at doses up to 1000 mg/kg of GKT137 831 when administered orally. 
Minimal effects on hERG currents were recorded with a reduction of ~20% at 300 µM with 
GKT137831 or major active metabolite GKT138184. In addition , GKT137831 was found to be a 
weak inhibitor (IC50 = 78.8 µM) of the cardiac IKs  channel , while the metabolite, GKT138184 has no 
activity on this channel at 100 µM. GKT137831 and GKT138184 have no significant inhibitory activity 
on the IKr cardiac ion channel at 300 µM and no activity on INa and ICa channels at 100 µM.  
Overall, review  of the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) data from the safety pharmacology and toxicology 
studies did not provide sufficient information that GKT137831 could prolong QTc or QTCF in a way 
that indicated a definite risk to humans.  
The non -clinical PK and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of GKT137831 
have been investigated in vivo  in the mouse, hamster, rat and dog, and in animal and human in vitro  
preparations. GKT137831 is a rapidly and extensively orally absorbed compound. In rats and dogs i t 
has moderately low clearance and a volume of distribution approximately similar to that of 
extracellular fluid and elimination predominates in feces rather than urine.   
Significant amounts of the major phase 1 active metabolite GKT138184 have been quant ified in 
animal plasma after oral dosing. The phase  1 metabolism of GKT137831 is likely to be mediated 
mainly by CYP3A4, and GKT137831 showed the potential to inhibit and induce CYP3A4 in vitro . A 
human drug interaction study indicated that GKT137831 is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 although the 
modest increase in the exposure of midazolam and its metabolites upon repeat dosing of 
GKT137831 may be due to a combination of mechanisms. Initial in vitro  studies indicated that 
GKT137831 was a potent inhibitor of Bile Salt Export Pump ( BSEP ). Because BSEP inhibitors have 
the potential to cause cholestatic liver injury, the effects of GKT137831 on bile acid levels were 
investigated in the clinical drug interaction study. GKT137831 administered for 10 days at 300 mg 
BID had no effect on bile acid concentration. Furthermore, GKT137831 did not cause hepatocellular 
injury in toxicology studies. Because of these discrepant in vitro  and in vivo  results, the in vitro  BSEP 
assay was repeated and did not confirm the initial dat a. It is therefore likely that GKT137831 is not a 
potent inhibitor of BSEP. Other in vitro transporter studies indicate that there is no requirement for 
additional testing prior to further phase 2 studies.  
GKT137831 has undergone a comprehensive toxicology  testing programme which has 
demonstrated that there is no genotoxicity liability with either the parent or the active metabolites. In 
chronic studies in both rat and dog the potential toxicity of GKT137831 following up to 6 months of 
daily oral dosing was  explored. The no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) in rats was 
established at 1000  mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested  and findings included minimal or slight 
decreases in red blood cells and slight increases in platelets, modest increases in total pla sma 
bilirubin and a small increase above control in the incidence of foamy macrophages in the lung 
which was of minimal severity grading. No such difference between treated and control animals was

effects were thus not considered of toxicological significance.  
The dog was the most sensitive species and the NOAEL was established at 150 mg/kg/day in the 26 
week study. Treatment related effects in the dog studies  were confined to ECG changes, effects on 
thyroid hormones, and effects on hematology parameters/bone marrow. Changes in liver function 
tests observed were generally considered to be of minimal severity and reversible and led to no liver 
pathologies and ar e consequently not considered to be of toxicological relevance. In the 28 Day 
study, QTc(F) prolongation was observed in high dose dogs (1000 mg/kg) and there was a single 
animal with an AV -block. The QTc prolongation was observed at both measurement times  (Day 1 
and Day 23) but the increase at the Day 23 reading was limited and seemed to affect only 2/6 
treated high dose animals. Although there were no such ECG alterations observed in the 13 Week 
study, measurements in high dose dogs taken at Week 1 and 4 of the 26 Week study (animals still 
on 500 mg/kg/day) showed QTc (VdeW) increases of up to 20 msec. There were no QTc 
prolongation observed after the dose reduction to 300 mg/kg/day at week 13 and 26. The absence of 
any clear treatment -related ECG alterati ons at both the NOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day and the HTD 
(Highest Tolerated Dose) of 300 mg/kg/day in the 26 Week dog study and in already conducted 
clinical trials suggest that any such liability will not compromise subject safety in early stage clinical 
studie s. Effects on bone marrow were seen at 500  mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested in the 26 
week study and in one animal resulted in a severe non regenerative anemia which lead to 
euthanasia. Effects were restricted to the erythroid lineage and were preceded b y a marked 
reduction in reticulocytes indicating the potential to monitor any potential effect in the clinic.  
Reproductive toxicology studies have been performed in rats and rabbits. No treatment -related 
embryo -fetal findings in any dose group were seen in  rats at doses of up to 1000  mg/kg/day. The 
NOAEL for maternal toxicity was established at 1000  mg/kg/day and for embryo -fetal toxicity was 
300 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, GKT137831 -related maternal mortality and severe effects on food 
consumption and body weig ht were seen at 1000 mg/kg/day, but there was no evidence of embryo -
fetal toxicity at any dose level. The NOAEL for maternal and embryo -fetal toxicity was considered to 
be 300 mg/kg/day.  
Overall, this body of non -clinical data suggests that NOX1/4 inhibiti on with GKT137831 may 
represent an attractive therapeutic strategy for a broad range of fibrotic disorders.  
2.1.5  Summary of Clinical Studies with GKT137831  
2.1.5.1  Healthy Volunteers Program  
A total of four phase 1 studies have been completed in healthy male subjects.   The program was 
designed to examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending doses of 
GKT137831, the potential for drug interactions using the CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam, as 
well as the relative bioavailability of micronized and unmicronized GKT137831 and the potential 
interactions with food.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 113 In the phase 1 program, a total of 105 male subjects were exposed to GKT137831, and ranged with 
age from 18 to 49 years. Doses of GKT137831 ranged between 10 mg and 1800 mg and for up 10 
successive days in the repeating dose study. The overall safety results indicate good systemic and 
local tolerability of single or repeated doses of GKT137831 . 
Overall subjects exposed to GKT137831 had a low incidence of AEs.  Most reported AEs were mild 
in intensity , self-limiting and considered to be  unrelated to GKT137831. The most frequently reported 
AEs were occurrences of nonspecific headache related events. Other reported AEs were mainly mild 
common infections unrelated to GKT137831. There were no de aths or serious adverse events 
(SAEs) reported during the course of these studies. There were no changes in vital sign s, ECG, 
hematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis associated with GKT137831. Thyroid hormones were 
specifically investigated in a multi ple ascending dose study. All mean values remained within the 
normal range, and changes compared to baseline showed no trend over time suggestive of a 
relationship with GKT137831.  
The pharmacokinetics of GKT137831 were con sistent in all phase 1 studies.  Exposure to 
GKT137831, measured by mean AUC and C max, whether after single or repeat administration, 
increased in a broadly dose proportional manner or less than dose proportional manner. No 
increased exposure was seen upon single administration of doses hi gher than 900 mg. After a single 
dose of 300 mg in either the fasted state or with a non -high fat meal, the mean AUC 0-t ranged from 
24,100 to 38,000 ng.h/mL.   Administration of micronized or unmicronized drug substance did not 
appear to have any not able im pact on plasma exposure.  Administration with food appeared to 
reduce inter -subject variability in exposure, and administration with a high -fat meal increased the 
mean AUC of GKT137831 by approximately 25% . No reduction in mean exposure was seen upon 
repeat  dosing either at daily doses of 100 -900 mg or twice -daily doses of 300 -400 mg. A slight 
accumulation in AUC 0-t was measured between the first and last doses upon twice daily dosing, 
consistent with the increased dosing frequency.  
2.1.5.2  Phase 2 Program  
A multice nter double blind randomized phase 2 study has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of GKT137831 in the treatment of DKD  and persistent albuminuria. A total 136 subjects 
were randomized in the study. In the GKT137831 arm, 68 subjects received  100 mg BID for 6 weeks 
followed by 200  mg BID for a further 6 weeks, representing over 15.22 subject years in GKT137831 
exposure.  
The trial did not meet its primary endpoint. At the end of the treatment period, no difference could be 
detected between GKT1 37831 and placebo in the changes of albuminuria level from baseline. 
GKT137831 did not appear to affect other measures of renal function and injury, including serum 
creatinine, eGFR, and urine MCP -1. Reasons for the lack of efficacy on the primary endpoint  may 
include the short treatment period and/or under -dosing during the first half of the trial (see Section 
2.2).

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 113 Nevertheless, the trial met several predefined secondary endpoints, indicating that GKT137831 is 
pharmacodynamica lly active in humans. Specifically, s ubjects receiving GKT137831 had a 
statistically significant reduction in GGT and hsCRP levels, two markers which predict mortality in 
patients with DKD . Furthermore, s ubjects receiving GKT137831 also showed a robust tre nd for 
lower levels of serum amyloid protein  A, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 , and triglyceride 
levels, compared to subjects receiving placebo. These changes are potentially related to a systemic 
anti-inflammatory effect, and/or reduced severity o f non -alcoholic fatty liver disease in these subjects 
with type 2 diabetes and excess body weight.  Trends toward reduced neuropathic pain and erectile 
dysfunction were observed but did not reach statistical significance.  
In this phase 2 study, GKT137831 wa s well tolerated. The reporting rate of AEs was low with fewer 
than 50% of subjects reporting AE s during the course of the study. In GKT137831 -treated subjects, 
most Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs ) were self -limiting, mild in severity, not 
treatm ent-related and resolved rapidly. The most commonly reported AEs were events related to 
respiratory tract infections. Other reported events were single occurrences experienced by 1 or 2 
GKT137831 subjects. There was no evidence of dose -related increase in the occurrence of TEAEs. 
The only notable safety finding was a statistically significant, albeit slight and non -clinically significant 
(~2.5 mm Hg) increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). A trend for a marginal (~3 mm Hg) 
increase in systolic blood pre ssure (SBP) was also observed, but did not reach statistical 
significance. Finally safety signals related to findings made in previous toxicology studies were not 
confirmed. In particular, there were no safety signals related to thyroid function, liver fun ction, bone 
marrow function, or cardiac conduction. No bone marrow toxicity, cardiac toxicity, liver toxicity, or 
renal toxicity was observed.  
Upon review of all available safety data, the evaluation of GKT137831 at doses up to 200  mg BID in 
68 subjects wi th DKD  indicated a good tolerability and safety profile of GKT137831 compared with 
placebo.  
2.2 Rationale  
The proposed doses of 400  mg OD and 400  mg BID were selected to achieve target plasma 
exposure levels in a majority of study subjects. The plasma exposur e target was defined according 
to the exposure achieved in mice by the maximally effective dose. There is considerable experience 
with GKT137831 in animal models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. Over 35 peer -reviewed 
manuscript s have been published to date, with an average impact factor >9. In these studies, and as 
presented in the IB, dose of 20 to 30 mg/kg achieve d maximal efficacy. This was particularly well 
demonstrated in the OVE26 and Akita models of DKD , or in a model of acute CCL4 -induced liv er 
injury. However, in some instances, trends for higher efficacy were observed at higher doses. For 
instance, 60 mg/kg tended to be more effective than 5 and 20  mg/kg in the STAM models of non -
alcoholic steatohepatitis, and in the MDR2-/- model of cholest atic liver injury and fibrosis. In t he bile 
duct ligation model, 60  mg/kg was as effective as 120 mg/kg. Altogether, this data indicates that the 
maximally effective doses range from 20 to 60 mg/kg in murine models.

exposure estimates were based on a population PK model developed based on the PK data 
obtained in the completed phase 2 trial, and compared against single dose exposure l evels in mice.

These exposure estimates indicate that more than 90% of subjects allocated to the 400  mg OD dose 
are predicted to have plasma exposure levels above the average exposure achi eved in mice by the 
20 mg/kg dose (i.e. the less conservative target exposure level). A majority of subjects allocated to 
the 400  mg BID dose are predicted to have plasma exposure levels above the average exposure 
achieved in mice by the 60  mg/kg dose (i.e . the more conservative target exposure levels). In 
addition, the 2 proposed doses should achieve plasma concentrations above 5xIC 50 (200 ng/mL) for 
the full dosing interval. As shown in the rat q uantitative whole -body autoradiography study, high 
levels of  radiolabeled drug-related material were observed in liver tissue where it achieves 
concentrations that are 3 -5 times higher than in other organs , such as kidney or lung. This tissue 
distribution pattern and elimination route matches the target organ in PB C patients. Based on 
recently reported trials , which applied very similar eligibility criteria, the subjects enrolled in this trial 
will mainly have  mild PBC. Nevertheless, the impact of potential hepatic drug accumulation will be 
assessed by careful monit oring of liver function tests and drug concentration in plasma.   
The proposed dosing regimens are supported by the available non -clinical and clinical data. D oses 
up to 1800  mg were tested in the single ascending dose phase 1  study. Subsequently, doses of up 
to 900  mg/day were tested in the multiple ascending dose study. In these studies conducted in 
healthy subjects, GKT137831 was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities and n o safety signals 
were detected.  
In the completed  phase 2 trial in DKD patients , 100 mg BID was evaluated over the first  6 weeks , 
and 200 mg BID was evaluated over the following 6 weeks. The safety profile of GKT13783 was 
again very favorable. Subjects  receiving GKT137831 reported a lower incidence of AEs compared to 
subject s receivi ng placebo. This reduction (in the range of 40% for TEAEs) was especially marke d 
for moderate to severe TEAEs. In addition, a low number of serious adverse events were reported in 
subject s receiving GKT137831 (3 SAEs) or placebo (7 SAEs). No safety signals  were identified in

GKT137831 has not been shown to increase blood pressure in toxicology studies or in healthy 
subjects . Therefore, these findings may be du e to chance , or specific to patients with DKD. 
Meanwhile , the toxicology signals identified in  rat and dog toxicology studies  were not observed in 
human . In particular, GKT137831 did not cause consistent changes in ECG parameters, liver 
function tests, thy roid function tests, and hematology parameters. Overall, these results indicated 
that GKT137831 is very well tolerated when administered orally for up to 12 weeks at doses up to 
400 mg/day. In our opinion, the combined safety data obtained in human subject s support  the 
evaluation of GKT137831 at higher doses and for longer treatment durations.  
Specifically, the combined non -clinical and clinical data support the two doses proposed for this trial. 
The 4 00 mg OD dose corresponds to the daily dose evaluated d uring the  second 6-week period in 
the completed p hase 2 study. As indicated above, t his dosing regimen was very well tolerated in the 
study population, which consisted of type 2 diabetics presenting with multiple diabetic complications 
and concomitant medi cations. Considering the very good safety profile of GKT137831 in this 
susceptible population, the 400  mg BID was selected to explore a higher dose range whil e 
maintaining adequate safet y margins based on animal data. Specifically, t he dose of 400  mg BID i s 
estimated to provide a safety margin of 2. 1 and 3.2 for AUC and C max, respectively  (see Table 2).

We anticipate a low enrollment  rate for this trial, with a total enrollment  period of around 7-8 months. 
Considering the number of treatment arms, the exposure of subject s to the top dose will accrue at a  
slow pace (an average of approximately 3-5 subjects will be randomized to the 400  mg BID dose 
every month). We expect even slower  incremental exposure during the early stages of the trial 
conduct due to the progressive activation of investigational centers. Careful moni toring of study 
subjects, as well as periodical review of safety data by the trial Safety Monitoring Board will ensure 
the safety of participating subjects. Of note, study subjects will be monitored more frequently in the 
early phase of the trial, with vis it intervals of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and subsequently 6 weeks.  
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
As summarized above, GKT137831 has been extensively investigated in pre -clinical studies as well 
as in four studies in healthy volunteers and one study in subject s with Type 2 diabetes. GKT137831

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 113 was well tolerated when administered for up to 12 weeks at a dose of up to 200  mg BID. No safety 
signal or dose -limiting toxicities were identified in these studies. In particular, safety signals identified 
in toxicology studie s were not detected. Specifically,  there was no detectable drug effect on thyroid 
function, bone marrow function, liver function tests, or cardiac conduction . The careful extension of 
the treatment duration (i.e. 24 weeks) and dose increase to 400  mg BID  are supported by the 
favorable safety data obtained in previous clinical studies.  As a general precaution, however, 
appropriate safety endpoints have been built into this study for frequent monitoring (see Section 3). 
In additio n, a SMB  will carefully review  the emerging study data on a regular basis in order to detect 
any safety signals early and take appropriate action  according to the SMB charter.   
Nevertheless, specific risks related to the subject  population exist. GKT137831  caused minor 
elevations of total bilirubin in dog toxicology studies. These changes were transient and reversible, 
and were not associated with biochemical or pathological evidence of hepatocellular injury. The 
underlying cause for these changes has not b een identified, and may involve competition for , or 
inhibition of , UGT enzymes which are responsible for the glucuronide conjugation . In phase 1 and 
phase 2 trials, GKT137831 did not cause elevations in total bilirubin.  Nevertheless, this study will 
evalua te a higher dose over a longer treatment period, and drug accumulation in liver tissue is 
anticipated in PBC patients. Accordingly, the incidence of drug-induced liver injury ( DILI) will be 
carefully monitored  as outlined in Section 6.3.1 . 
In addition, a  case of non -regenerative anemia was observed in the 26 week dog toxicology study.  
Accordingly, hematological parameters were carefully monitored in subsequent  phase 1 and phase 2 
studies.  No safety signal related hematological p arameters were detected in these trials.  
Nevertheless, hematological parameters will be carefully monitored as described in Section 6.3.2 . 
While NOX1/4 inhibition represents an attractive therapeutic strategy in patients with P BC, actual 
therapeutic benefits in PBC patients remain to be demonstrated.

This will be a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parall el group phase 2 trial 
assessing a 24 -week period of treatment with oral GKT137831 administered in addition to standard 
of care medication (UDCA) in subjects with PBC.  
Subjects will be assessed for their eligibility during the screening period (Visit 1), w hich will last up to 
4 weeks, until the baseline /Day 1 visit (Visit 2) . 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to oral GKT137831 ( 400 mg OD or 400  mg BID) or placebo, 
according to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio , stratified at study entry by disease severity def ined as 
baseline serum GGT  < 2.5 x the ULN or ≥  2.5 x ULN.  
Subjects will self -administer orally 400 mg OD or 400 mg BID of GKT137831 or matching placebo 
for a total of 24 weeks.  
Baseline assessments will be performed at baseline /Day 1 (Visit 2). The 24 -week treatment period 
will include assessments after 2 weeks of treatment (Visit 3), after 6 weeks of treatment (Visit 4), 
after 12 weeks of treatment (Visit 5), after 18 weeks of treatment (Visit 6) and after 24 weeks of 
treatment (End of Treatment/Visit 7) . Subjects will be followed up for 28 days after the end of 
treatment (Week 28/Visit 8), totaling 6 post -baseline visits. Subjects who discontinue treatment 
before Week 24 will have an Early Termination visit (premature end of treatment).  
Pharmacokinetic  samples will be taken at Week 2, Week 12  and Week 18  (see Section 8.2.2  for the 
sampling time points).  
Subjects will be taking a stable dose of UDCA at enrollment and will continue their UDCA treatment 
at a stable dose (no chang es at all) during the treatment period.  
A Safety Monitoring Board  will oversee the conduct of the study to ensure the safety of participating 
subject s (see Section 9.7 for more details ). An interim analysis will be conducted when 80-90% of 
the planned number of subjects to be randomized in the study  have completed their Week 6 visit  
(see Section 10.3).

5.4 Contraception   
Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of contraception to 
prevent pregnancy for 4 weeks before randomization an d must agree to continue strict contraception 
for 90 days after the last administration of IMP.  
For the purposes of this trial, women of child  bearing potential (WOCBP) are defined as “All female 
subjects after puberty unless they are post -menopausal (defined as amenorrhea for 12 months with 
documented date of last monthly period) or are surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal occlusion).” For 
female subjects aged < 55 who are considered post -menopausal and who are not on concomitant 
estrogen replacement therapy, confirmation of postmenopausal status will be required with follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) test results in the postmenopausal range for age at Screening (Visit 1).  
Highly effective contraception is defined as methods which can achieve a failu re rate of less than 1% 
per year when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include: combined (estrogen + 
progestogen) hormonal contraception (oral/intravaginal/transdermal); progestogen -only hormonal 
contraception (oral/injectable/implantable); in trauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing 
system (IUS); vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP 
study subject and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical 
succes s); or sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse from 4 weeks 
before randomization until 90 days after the last administration of IMP and only if this is the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject).  
WOCBP must have a nega tive serum pregnancy test at Screening (Visit 1) and a negative urine 
pregnancy test at baseline /Day 1 (Visit 2) before dosing.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 113 Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to use a condom and 
require their partner to use an additional form of adequate contraception as approved by the 
Investigator, such as an established form of hormonal contraceptive, a diaphragm or cervical/vault 
cap, IUD, or sponge with spermicide. This requirement begins at the time of informed cons ent and 
ends 90 days after last administration of IMP. Male study participants must also not donate sperm 
from baseline until 90 days after last administration of IMP.  
5.5 Strategies for Recruitment, Retention  and to Improve Adherence to 
Protocol  
Sites will be  selected based on their access to the PBC population. Several strategies may be 
implemented as enhancements to support subject identification and recruitment, including 
advertising through patient advocacy groups/networks, on Orphanet and other health -related social 
networks and early engagement with Key Opinion Leaders in each country to provide PBC expertise 
as well as physicians actively treating patients in the selected countries to encourage potential 
referrals.  
Genkyotex’s designated Clinical Researc h Organization (CRO), Cmed, will provide ongoing 
management of enrollment by regular review of site performance. Upon indication a site may benefit 
from further support, the site and the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will partner to re -examin e 
the curr ent recruitment strategy.  
5.6 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
5.6.1  Randomization Procedures  
This will be a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, multicenter, parallel group phase 2 trial. 
Approximately  100 subjects will be randomized and allocated to placeb o or one of the 2 active 
treatment arms, according to a 1:1:1 randomization ratio, stratified at study entry by disease severity 
defined as baseline serum GGT  < 2.5 x ULN or ≥ 2.5 x ULN).  Accordingly, approximately 33-34 
subjects will be allocated to each of the 3 treatment arms.   
A master reproducible randomization list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Cmed 
accounting for block  size and stratification. The  IWRS will assign a unique randomization number in 
ascending, sequential order (with associated treatment arm) to the subject, based on the pre -
determined randomization schedule. The system will assign the pre -determined blocks of 
randomization numbers for each stratification level to ensure similarly balanced treatment groups. 
Assignment will be in sequential order within blocks and stratification level. The investigator will enter 
the randomization number in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
5.6.2  Blinding  Procedures  
This is a double -blind study: the Sponsor, subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the 
assessments and data reviewers and statisticians will remain blinded to the identity of the study 
treatments.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 113 The identity of the study treatments will be concealed by the use of IMPs which are all identical in 
packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance and odor.  
Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential, and will be accessible only to authorized 
personnel (e.g., unblinde d pharmacist or authorized designee), until unblinding of the trial as 
described in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP). 
Unblinding will only occur for the following reasons:  
  Subject  emergencies (see Section 5.6.3 ) 
 Scheduled and unscheduled safety reviews by the SMB  (see Section 9.7) 
 At the time of the interim analysis (see Section 10.3) 
 At the conclusion of the study.  
5.6.3  Emergency Breaking o f Assigned Treatment Code  
If an emergency unblinding becomes necessary, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor prior to unblinding, if possible, unless identification of the IMP is required for emergency 
therapeutic measures. The result  of the code break should not be revealed to the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor. Unblinding will be performed through the IWRS. The Investigator will access the IWRS to 
access the subject’s treatment code. The Investigator may always, for urgent safety reasons, b reak 
the blind at any time during the conduct of the study. If the blind is broken, the date, time and reason 
must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF and any associated AE report.  
The unblinded treatment code must not be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.6.4  Reasons for W ithdrawal  
Subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice to their medical care, and that they are not obliged to state their reasons. Any withdrawal 
must be fully documented in the eCRF, and sho uld be followed up by the Investigator.  
The Investigator may withdraw a subject at any time if this is considered to be in the subject’s best 
interest.  
A subject MUST be withdrawn for the following reasons:  
 Pregnancy or breast feeding.  
 A change in UDCA dos e during the treatment period.  
 Confir med or suspected  DILI, as defined in Section 6.3.1 . 
 Confirmed or suspected liver decompensation, defined as hepatic encephalopathy, 
gastrointestinal tract bleeding due to esophageal varices,  or ascites .

Section 6.3.2 . 
 Grade 3 severity AE recurring or not resolving after a pre -defined interruption and resumption of 
IMP (see Sect ion 6.3). 
 Any Grade 4 severity AE.  
 Subject’s withdrawal of consent.  
The subject MAY be also discontinued for the following reasons:  
 Protocol violations, including non -compliance and loss to follow -up. 
 Safety reasons . 
 Administra tive reasons.  
 Other: the subject  was withdrawn for a reason other than those listed above, such as termination 
of the study by the Sponsor (see Section 5.6.6 ). 
A subject will be considered to have completed the study when he/she completes the final 
assessment visit of the follow -up period, i.e., Week 28 (Visit 8).   
5.6.5  Handling of Withdrawals  
If the IMP is prematurely discontinued  (i.e., before Week 24) , the primary reason for discontinuation 
must be recorded in the  appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts must be made to complete 
and report the observati ons as thoroughly as possible. A premature end of treatment  evaluation 
should be performed  following the subject ’s withdrawal as described in Section 7.5, and recorded in 
the early termination eCRF page.  A final follow -up visit should be performed within 4 weeks 
following the early termination visit , as described in Section 7.4.  
If a subject fails to r eturn for follow -up, attempts should be made to contact the subject to ensure the 
reason for not returning is not an AE. Likewise, if a subject decides to discontinue from the study, an 
attempt should be made to establish that the true reason is not an AE (bearing in mind subjects are 
not obliged to state their reasons). For subjects considered lost to follow -up, the eCRF must be 
completed up to the last visit performed.  
Ongoing AEs should be followed up in accordance with the procedures described in Sectio n 9.2.4 . 
Subjects who discontinue early will not be replaced.  
5.6.6  Termination of Study  
This study may be terminated at any time by the Sponsor because of safety concerns, ethical 
issues; plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the IMP or serious and/or 
continued non -compliance with the protocol.

6.3 Criteria for Study Treatment Modification or Discontinuation  
AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE  grading system. If an AE is not listed in  the CTCAE , the 
Investigator will use a similar 4 -point scale (Grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe and 4 = life 
threatening), as described in 9.2.1.1 . 
In case of a Grade 1 or 2 severity AE, the subject will be treat ed as deemed appropriate by the 
Investigator, and treatment with the IMP should be continued as scheduled.  
In case of a Grade 3 severity AE, administration of the IMP must be interrupted until the severity of 
the event has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 and then resumed at 100% of the initial dose and schedule. 
Treatment withheld due to a Grade 3 severity AE will not be made up later. If a Grade 3 severity AE 
does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 24 hours of IMP interruption, or if a Grade 3 seve rity AE recurs 
after resumption of IMP, the subject  must be permanently discontinued from treatment  (see Section 
5.6.4 ). 
In case of any Grade 4 severity AE, administration of the IMP must be permanently discontinued.

6.3.1  In case of Confirmed or Suspected D rug Induced Liver Injury  
In case of any of the following events:  
 Grade ≥ 2 severity liver-related AE , or 
 Grade ≥ 3 severity  ALT or AST  (i.e. ≥ 5x ULN) , or 
 Grade ≥ 2 severity  total bilirubin  (i.e. ≥ 1.5x ULN) , or 
 Grade ≥ 2 severity INR (i.e. ≥ 1.5x ULN)   
The investigator will instruct the subject  to interrupt IMP administratio n and to return to the study 
center within 2-3 days to perform a re -test and to undergo additional investigations ( i.e. close 
monitoring  as described in Appendix F) to assess for potential DILI. In case of confirmed or 
suspected DILI  as assessed by the inv estigator , IMP administration must  be permanently  
discontinued,  in particular in the following cases : 
 Re-test ALT and /or AST values ≥ 3 x baseline and greater than the ULN associated with new 
onset total bilirubin  ≥ 2 x ULN or INR  ≥ 1.5. 
If subjects  live in a remote area, they can be tested locally and the results communicated to the 
investigator site promptly.  
In case of non-confirmed  DILI, IMP administration  will be resumed in accordance with the  protocol  
and subject will remain under close monitoring as deemed necessary by the investigator . 
Any confirmed or suspected DILI event will be closely monitored by the investigator and  report ed to 
Sponsor following the same procedure as for SAEs, as described in  Section 9.5. 
Withdrawals will be handled as described in Section 5.6.5 . 
6.3.2  In case of Anemia  
In case of grade ≥ 2 severity anemia, the Investigator will instruct the subject to interrupt IMP 
administration and to return to the study center within 7 days to perform a re -test of absolute 
reticulocyte count . 
If the re -test value is below 50% of basel ine, and/or if an alternative cause for the anemia cannot be 
documented , treatment will not be resumed. IMP administration will be resumed only if the re -test 
value for the absolute reticulocyte count is ≥ 50% of the baseline value  and an alternative cause  for 
the anemia can be documented . The subject will continue to be closely monitored until 
normalization, i.e. return to baseline values.

6.3.3  In case of Drug Induced Hypoth yroidism  
In case of TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L , the Investigator will instruct the subject to interrupt IMP administration 
and to return to the study center within 2-3 days to perform a re -test of TSH and measure free T4 . 
If the re -test value is ≥ 10 mIU/L and the subject presents with signs  and symptoms consistent with 
hypothyroidism or if overt biological hypothyroidism is confirmed (i.e. TSH ≥ 10 mIU/L and reduced 
free T4), treatment will not be resumed.  If drug induced hypothyroidism is not confirmed, IMP 
administration will be resumed as  per protocol. The subject will continue to be closely monitored until 
normalization, i.e. return to baseline values.  
Withdrawals will be handled as described in Section 5.6.5 . 
6.4 Accountability Procedures for the Study Treatment( s) 
Records will be maintained of the delivery of IMP to the study centers, the inventory at the study 
centers, the allocation to, use of, and return by each subject to the study center, and the return to the 
Sponsor.  
These records will include dates, quant ities, batch numbers, expiry dates and the unique code 
numbers assigned to the IMP and to the study subjects. No subject diary is planned.  
The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the records adequately document that the subjects 
are provided the doses specified in the protocol and all IMP received from the Sponsor is reconciled.  
6.5 Subject  Compliance  
The assigned IMP, dosage, timing and mode of administration may not be changed, except as 
described in Section  6.3. Any dep artures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF.  
IMP accountability and subject compliance will be documented throughout the study using study -
specific IMP dispensing and return record forms.  
Subjects will be asked to return all used IMP , including empty and partially used containers. IMP will 
be dispensed at baseline /Day 1 (Visit 2),  Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 6 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5) and 
Week 18 (Visit 6) . At Week 2 (Visit 3), Week 6 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5), Week 18 (Visit 6) and 
Week 24 (Visit 7), the unused IMP dispensed to the subject at the previous visit will be returned to 
the Investigator. The Investigator will determine compliance by capsule count per bottle and batch 
number. Subjects exhibiting non -compliance as assessed by c apsule counts will be counseled on 
the importance of good compliance to the study dosing regimen. Drug non -compliance is defined as 
taking less than 80% or more than 120% of IMP during the double -blind treatment period.

6.6.1  Required Concomitant Medications  
Subjects must be taking UDCA for at least 6 months and be on a stable dose (defined as no 
changes) for at least 3 month s prior to the first Screening visit (Visit 1). All efforts should be made to 
keep the dose of UDCA stabl e during the treatment period. Changes in UDCA dose during the 
treatment period will lead to the early discontinuation of the study subject.  
6.6.2  Prohibited Medications  
Note: these are not exhaustive lists. The FDA and other agencies maintain current lists, whi ch can 
be referred to via their websites. Furthermore, these lists will evolve as new drugs come to market 
and more is learned about the pharmacology of GKT137831 and other medications. Therefore, they 
should be regarded as a minimum set of excluded and pr e-cautioned concomitant medications.  
The following medications are prohibited within 3 months of Screening (Visit 1) and during the 
double -blind treatment period:  
a) OCA , budesonide and other systemic corticosteroids, colchicine, mycophenolate mofetil, 
azathi oprine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, feno fibrates and other fibrates, 
valproate, isoniazid, and nitrofurantoin . 
b) Any biologic agent within 12 weeks or 5 half -lives prior to Screening (Visit 1), whichever is 
longer . In the case of rituximab,  use within 168 days (24 weeks) of Screening or no recovery 
(level < 20% of pre -rituximab levels or below lower level of normal, whichever is lower) of 
CD19 -positive B lymphocytes if the last dose of rituximab has been more than 24 weeks 
prior to Screening .  
c) Patients taking the following medications which are OAT1 and OAT3 substrates are not 
allowed on the study because of the underlying conditions these medications are used to 
treat:  methotrexate, probenecid, aminohippurate, cephradine, cidofovir, adefovir , oseltamivir, 
acyclovir, ganciclovir, benzylpenicillin, cefaclor, ceftizoxime, bumetanide, famotidine,

fluvastatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cobimetinib, selexipag, ambri sentan, grazoprevir, 
technetium tc 99m mebrofenin, and parachlorophenol.  Should these drugs become 
necessary d uring the treatment period, t he treating physician should make all efforts to use  
alternative  drugs . However, where it is not feasible or desirabl e to change to an alternative , 
the subject  must be monitored closely for occurrence of adverse events possibly related to 
drug accumulation as well as clinical effects of increased exposure , and consider ation must 
be given to  reducing the dose.  
*Only equin e estrogen derivatives are prohibited. Synthetic estradiol is allowed.  
In addition, the following medications are prohibited during the double -blind treatment period:

PBC. It is designed for self -completion and takes a pproximately 45 minutes to complete.   
Pruritus VAS  
Pruritus will be self -assessed by the subject using a Pruritus VAS (see Appendix D) at baseline /Day 
1 (Visit 2) , Week 12 (Visit 5) and Week 24 (Visit 7). To capture the intensity of itching within the 24 
hours  preceding these visits , subjects  are to be asked to write a number from 0 to 10 below the 
horizontal scale , with no decimal.  Subjects should not mark a cross on the actual horizontal line, nor 
should the line be measured to obtain a value.

All PD samples are to be collected pre -dose and in fasting condition.  These sample collections  are 
not opt ional for the subject , meaning that blood samples must be collected for all subjects and 
defined time points. The actual testing analysis of the collected samples is optional . 
Venous blood samples ( 4 mL at each sampling time point) will be collected for ma rkers of 
inflammation and liver injury (hsCRP, fibrinogen) at baseline/Day 1 (Visit 2), and Weeks 2, 6, 12, 18 , 
24 and 28 (Visits 3 – 8). 
Venous blood samples ( 4 mL at each sampling time point) will be collected for optional analysis of

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 113 9 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
9.1 Safety Parameters  
The safety of GKT137831 will be assesse d through the recording, reporting and analyzing of 
baseline medical conditions, AEs, general physical ex amination, laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECGs, and 
vital signs data. The timing and frequency of safety assessments are described in Section 8.  
9.2 Adverse Events  
9.2.1  Definition  of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal 
laboratory findings, or disease that emerges or worsens relative to baseline during a  clinical study 
with an IMP, regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered.  
Unchanged/stable pre -existing, chronic medical conditions present at baseline, or those medical 
conditions related to the underlying disease whose chan ges during the study that are consistent with 
natural disease progression are NOT considered as AEs and should not be recorded in the AE 
pages of the eCRF unless a worsening has occurred.   
9.2.1.1  Severity of Adverse Events  
AEs will be graded according to the CTCA E v4 grading system . The CTCAE v4 grading criteria must 
be used when available for an AE. Only when CTCAE v4 grading criteria are not available for a 
specific AE, will the Investigator assess the severity of the AE based on the following definitions:   
 Grad e 1 (mild): the subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily 
tolerated.  
 Grade 2 (moderate): the subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce his 
or her usual level of activity.  
 Grade 3 (severe): the subject is unable to carry out usual activities due to significant impairment 
of functioning.  
 Grade 4 (life -threatening): the subject’s life is at risk from the event.  
9.2.1.2  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator will determine  whether or not, in his/her opinion,  the AEs are related to the IMP 
according to the following definitions:  
 Unrelated: due to extraneous causes and does not meet criteria listed under unlikely, possible or 
probable.

Protocol Date: 24 July 2018  Author: Cmed Clinical Services  
 
MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 113  Unlikely (or improbable): relationship not likely according to present knowl edge. Does not follow 
a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. May have been produced by the subject’s 
clinical state or by environmental factors or other therapies administered.  
 Possible: follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrati on: possibility that the AE 
may have been caused by the IMP but may also have been produced by the subject’s clinical 
state or by environmental factors or other therapies administered.  
 Probable: clear -cut temporal association with improvement on cessation of IMP or reduction in 
dose.  Reappears upon re -challenge. Follows a known pattern of response to IMP. 
9.2.1.3  Abnormal Laboratory Values/and Other Objective 
Measurements  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements such as vital signs and ECGs, 
should NOT routinely be captured and reported as AEs as they will be collected and analyzed  
separately in the eCRF.  However, abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements 
which  (i) meet the criteria for a SAE  (see Section 9.3.1 ), or (ii) result in discontinuation of the IMP or 
in treatment being withheld (see Sections 5.6.4  and 6.3, respectively ), or (iii) require medical 
intervention should be captured and reported in the AE pages of the eCRF.  
If reporting an abnormal laboratory finding in the AE pages of the eCRF, a clinical diagnosis should 
be recorded rather than the abnormal value itself, if available (for example “anemia” rather than 
“decreased RBC coun t” or “hemoglobin = 10.5 g/dl”).  
9.2.2  Eliciting Adverse Events  
AEs will be obtained by the Investigator at scheduled or unscheduled study visits, following physical 
examination, based on information spontaneously provided by the subject and/or through 
questioni ng. 
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the initial questions at 
all evaluation points during the study. For example:  
 How have you felt since your last visit?  
 Have you had any health problems since you were here last ? 
In the case that a subject was seen by a health care professional other than the Investigator (e.g., at 
a different institution) concerning an AE, every effort should be made by the Investigator to contact 
the treating physician in a timely manner in ord er to obtain all necessary information and report the 
event appropriately.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 113 9.2.3  Recording Adverse Events  
As quality and precision of acquired AE data is of key importance, the Investigator should use the 
AE definitions provided in above sections and observe the  following guidelines when completing the 
AE pages of the eCRF:  
 Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather than 
colloquialisms (for example, ‘influenza’ rather than ‘flu’), and abbreviations should be avoided.  
 AEs sho uld be described using a specific clinical diagnosis rather than component signs or 
symptoms, if this is available (for example, ‘congestive heart failure’ rather than ‘ dyspnea, rales 
and cyanosis’). However, signs and symptoms considered unrelated to an i dentified disease or 
syndrome should be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF.  
 AEs occurring secondary to other events (e .g., sequelae or complications) should be id entified 
by the primary cause. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents  the most accurate 
clinical term to record in the AE pages of the eCRF.  
Additional guidance can be found in the eCRF completion conventions provided by the Sponsor.  
For the purposes of this study, any detrimental change in the subject’ s condition, after si gning the 
informed consent form (ICF) and up to completion of the 28 -day follow -up period after the last 
administration of IMP , should be considered an AE.  AEs should be followed -up in accordance with 
the procedures described in Section 9.2.4 .  
9.2.4  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The primary objective of the post -treatment period is to check for any withdrawal and/or residual 
effects of GKT137831 which manifest after disconti nuation of IMP administration. Reporting of AEs 
during the pos t-treatment period is defined as follows:  
 All AEs which occur within 28 days from the last administration of IMP will be recorded in the AE 
pages of the eCRF as defined above.  
 All ongoing AEs considered at least possibly related to the IMP will be followed  until resolution or 
until the Investigator assesses them as ‘chronic’ or ‘stable’.  
 If the Investigator becomes aware of a SAE, including death, after  the 28 days post -treatment 
period and the SAE is  considered by the Investigator to be at least possibly r elated to the IMP, it  
will be reported to the designated CRO safety group in accordance with Section 9.3.2 . 
Taking the above post -treatment safety surveillance reporting requirements into account, AE follow -
up information data will be recorded in the AE pages of the eCRF up until Last Subject Last Visit.  
After Last Subject Last Visit and prior to database lock, the status of all outstanding ongoing AEs will 
be checked and any up -to-date change made in the eCRF. At that stage, as  considered appropriate 
by the Sponsor, follow -up information will continue to be requested from the Investigator on specific

related details will not be recor ded in the eCRF beyond database lock.  
9.3 Serious Adverse Events  
9.3.1  Definition  of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as an AE which meets one of the following criteria:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event).  
 An event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
Note: In general, hospitalization signifies that a person has been detained (usually overnight) at a 
hospital or emergency ward for observati on and/or treatment. Emergency room visits which do not 
result in admission to the hospital should be evaluated for one of the other serious outcomes (e.g., 
life-threatening; required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage; other serious, 
medically important event.  
 Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Note: The term significant disability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions, i.e., the AE resulted in a sign ificant, persistent or permanent change, 
impairment, damage or disruption in the subject’s body function/structure, physical activities and/or 
quality of life.  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 Any other important medical event that may not result i n death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the above criteria . An AE of severe intensity might not 
necessarily be considered serious. For  example, persistent nausea for several hours may be 
considered severe, but not a SAE. Conversely , a stroke result ing in only a limited degree of disability 
may be considered mild , but would be a SAE.  
All SAEs will be:  
 Recorded in the eCRF from the time of  signed informed consent until 28 days after the last dose 
of IMP, regardless of suspected relationship to IMP.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 113  Recorded on the appropriate SAE Report Form and reported in accordance with the procedures 
described in Section 9.3.2 . 
 Followed until resolution, stabilization or until determined to be chronic by the Investigator.  
 Reviewed and evaluated by the Investigator.  
9.3.2  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAE occurring in a subject who has signed the informed consent and until 28 days after the last 
administration of IMP must be reported by the Investigator to the designated CRO safety group 
(Cmed) within 24 hours of first awareness  even if the SAE does not appear to be associated with 
the IMP. Any SAEs experie nced after this period should be reported to the designated CRO 
designee safety group if the investigator has assessed that the SAE is reasonably related to IMP 
administration.  
Information about the SAE (either initial or follow -up) should be collected an d recorded on the paper 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form. A causality assessment must be provided at the tim e of 
reporting.  The form should be completed in English and signed and dated by the investigator.  
SAEs should be reported by emailing or faxing a copy of the SAE R eport form plus other relevant 
information to the designated CRO safety group. The SAE may be reported by telephone; however, 
this should be followed up within 24 hours with a copy of the SAE Report form. Additionally, it may 
be necessary for the designated CRO safety group to communicate with the Investigator if additional 
information is required.   
During both business and non -business hours, the email address, telephone and fax numbers listed 
below should be used to notify the designated  CRO safety group:

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 70 of 113 All additional follow -up eval uations must be reported within 24 hours to the designated CRO safety 
group. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization or the Investigator determines the event 
to be chronic.  
The Sponsor is responsible for complying with applicable regulat ory reporting requirements for SAEs 
and, where necessary,  for ensuring the relevant authorities  are notified (see Section 9.4). The 
Investigator will ensure the appropriate IRB s/IECs are notified of t he SAE in accordance with I CH 
GCP and local regulatory requirements.   
9.4 Regulatory Reporting of Serious, Unexpected, Adverse Reactions  
(SUSAR s) 
Following notification from the Investigator, the Sponsor and/or it’s designee (CRO) will report events 
which are both serious and unexpected  (not previously described in the reference safety information 
in the approved IB) and that are associated with the IMP to the FDA, EMA, other concerned 
Regulatory Authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators within the required timelines as specified in 21 
Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR) Part 312.32, EU Directive 2001/20/EC, the European 
Commission’s “Detailed guidance on the collection, verification, and presentation of adverse 
event/reaction reports arising from clinical trials on medicinal products for hum an use” (CT -3, June 
2011), ICH GCP Guidelines and other applicable national regulatory requirements. Typically, fatal 
and life -threatening events must be reported within 7 calendar days and all other SAEs must be 
notified in within 15 calendar days. All se rious events designated as not related to the IMP, will be 
reported to the concerned Regulatory Authorities, and IRB/IECs at least annually in a summary 
format.  
Additionally, events may occur during a clinical trial which do not fall within the definition  of a SUSAR 
and thus are not subject to the reporting requirements for  SUSARs, even though they may be 
relevant in terms of subject  safety. Examples are new events related to the conduct of a trial or the 
development of an  IMP likely to affect the safety o f subject s such as:  
 A SAE which could be associated with the trial procedures and which could modify the conduct 
of the trial.  
 A significant hazard to the subject population such as lack of efficacy of an IMP used for the 
treatment of a life -threatening d isease.  
 A major safety finding from a newly completed animal study (such as carcinogenicity).  
 A temporary halt of a trial for safety reasons if the trial is conducted with the same IMP in another 
country by the same Sponsor, recommendations of the SMB, if any, where relevant for the safety 
of subjects.  
These events/observations are not to be reported as SUSARs, but they might require other action, 
such as urgent safety measures and their notification, substantial amendments, or early termination 
of the tria l, and shall be reported in accordance with applicable local regulations and guidelines.

If a study subject , who has been exposed to the IMP , presents signs or symptoms of DILI, a close 
monitoring must be initiated and documented  by the investigator . The IMP must be discontinued  until 
re-testing is performed, additional investigations completed and a diag nosis  made. If DILI is 
confirmed or suspected by the investigator, the investigator will complete an Expedited Liver 
Assessment R eport form (ELAR) and submit it to Sponsor in the same timelines as a SAE  (see 
Section 9.3.2 . The ELAR form must be completed and forwarded via email or facsimile to the 
designated CRO safety group using the email address or fa x number listed in Section 9.3.2  within 24 
hours of the Inve stigator becoming aware of the confirmed or suspected DILI event .  
9.6 Pregnancy  
If a female study subject who has been exposed to the IMP becomes pregnant, the course and  
outcome of the pregnancy should be monitored and documented. The IMP must be discontinued. If 
a female partner of a male study subject who has been exposed to the IMP becomes pregnant, and 
the subject provides this information, then the pregnancy will be documented, based on information 
provided by the subject. Any pregnancy (either female study participants or female partners of male 
study participants) must be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of th e birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Consent to report information regarding 
pregnancy outcome should be obtained from the female partners of male study participants.  The 
study treatment must be discontinued for pregnant participants.  
Although pregnancy itself is not considered as a n AE, all pregnancies occurring inadvertently during 
the study pre -treatment,  treatm ent and post -treatment period must be reported in the same timelines 
as a SAE,  but by using the Clinica l Trial Pregnancy Report Form. The form must be completed and 
forwarded via email or facsimile to the designated CRO safety group using the email a ddress or fax 
number listed in S ection 9.3.2  within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy .  
If the outcome or course of t he pregnancy involves a SAE (e.g. , a congenital anomaly) then the  SAE 
form should  be completed in addition to the updated Clinica l Trial Pregna ncy Report Form. 
Spontaneous abortions and congenital birth defects s hould always be reported as SAEs  (see 
Section  9.3). 
9.7 Safety Monitoring Board  
In order to ensure subject  safety, a n independent  SMB will conduct periodic, sched uled and 
unscheduled  reviews of subject  data while the study is in progress. The role and responsibilities of 
the SMB will be outlined in detail in a separate SMB charter.  
The predefined triggers, scope, and process for unscheduled SMB meetings will be out lined in the 
SMB charter. Briefly, at any time , the SMB, Study Director or Sponsor may request an unschedule d 
SMB review of the study data based on concern for subject safety. In addition, unscheduled SMB

threatening condition, or a permanent interruption of IMP administration due to DILI or anemia . 
The SMB will receive outputs of the unblinded eCRF and laboratory data, and adjudicate on  subject  
status changes and d osing decisions (where appropriate). The data will include, but is  not limited to, 
demographics, subject  enrolment, baseline characteristics, AE data, SAE data  (by severity and 
causality), laboratory data including PK, dose adjustments, protocol  adherence,  and subject  
withdrawals. The SMB will evaluate the progress of the study, assess  data quality and timeliness, 
participant recruitment, accrual and retention, and participant risk  versus benefit. In addition the SMB 
will monitor external factors relevant t o the study . For example , scientific and therapeutic 
developments which  may affect participant safety or ethical  status. Based on the observed benefits 
or adverse effects, the SMB will make  recommendations to the Sponsor concerning continuation, 
terminatio n or modifications of the  study.

10.1 Study Hypotheses  
The testing assumption for the primary endpoint, for each dose separately vs placebo, is:  
P G P G AP G P G
HH
 
  
2 12 1 0
or         :  , :
 
Where:  
2 1,G G
 Mean percent change from baseline in  serum GGT  after 24 weeks in the active 
GKT137831 group.   
P
 Mean percent change from baseline in serum GGT after 24 weeks in the Placebo group.   
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in efficacy between the two doses o f GKT137831 
and placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
A sample size of 3 4 randomized and treated subjects within each treatment group with an overall 
sample size of 102 subjects will have 80% power t o detect a 28% difference in the means of the 
percent change from baseline in serum GGT . A Wilcoxon Mann -Whitney test has been used for the 
sample size estimate because this represents the worst -case scenario with regards to statistical 
power. A standard d eviation of 30 for the active GKT137831 group  and a standard deviation of 40 
for the placebo group  have been assumed based on a recent phase 3 clinical trial of OCA [ 65].  
An overall two -sided Type I error of 5% has been considered for the sample size esti mate. The 
Hochberg method will be used to adjust the alpha level for multiple comparisons , therefore the first 
dose level comparison at the final analysis will be tested against an alpha level of 0.04695 and the 
second dose level will be tested against an alpha level of 0.023475. The alpha level of 0.023475 has 
been used for the sample size calculation.  
The sample size calculation assumes all subject s, including withdrawals will be included in the 
analysis. Hence there has been no adjustment for dropouts.  
10.3 Planned  Interim Analyses  
An interim analysis is planned once 80-90% of the planned number of subjects to be randomized in 
the study  have completed their Week 6 visit. The primary efficacy endpoint for the interim analysis is 
the percent  change from baselin e to the Week 6 visit  in serum  GGT. Only data collected for these

randomized into the interim analysis  cohort , will be included in the interim analysis. The  purpose of 
the interim analysis is to support decision making with regards to the further development of 
GKT137831. It is not intended to amend the study protocol or stop the trial due to futility o r 
overwhelming efficacy.   
In addition to the analysis of the percent  change from baseline to Week 6 in serum GGT, t he interim 
analysis will include supportive analyses of the absolute change from baseline to Week 6 in serum 
GGT, as well as absolute and percent change from baseline to Week 6 in serum levels of ALP, 
hsCRP , fibrinogen , ALT, AST, conjugated and total bilirubin , as well as the absolute and percent 
change in the APRI and FIB -4 scores . The specific contents of the interim analysis will be 
documented in the SAP.   
The interim analysis will be conducted b y the unblinded SMB statistician , who has no involvement 
with study conduct. The interim analysis outputs will be communicated to  the SMB  and to  a 
predefined disclosure committee , to aid decision -making with regards to the further development of 
GKT137831.  However , to maintain the integrity of the trial data , no unblinding information for 
individual subjects will be shared outside of the SMB . Detailed communication flow will be outlined in 
the SMB charter and SAP.  
In addition to the interim analysis descri bed above a SMB will oversee the safety of the participating 
subjects as described in Section 9.7. 
10.4 Analysis Methods  
10.4.1  Analysis Populations  
The Intent -To-Treat (ITT)  population will include all randomized subjects who receive at l east one 
dose of IMP or placebo. The ITT population will be analyzed by the randomized treatment and will 
be used as the primary population for all analyses of efficacy.  
The Safety  population will be used for the analysis of all safety data and will includ e all subjects who 
received at least one dose of IMP  or placebo , irrespective of whether they were randomized. The 
Safety population will be analyzed by the treatment received.  
The Per Protocol (PP)  population will be a subset of the ITT population and wi ll include all subjects 
without a major protocol deviation. Protocol deviations will be defined with the classification of 
subjects excluded from analysis populations prior to unblinding at end of study.   
The PP population will be analyzed by the randomiz ed treatment. This population will be for 
supportive analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints  where deemed relevant .  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized by treatment group. All protocol deviations deemed 
important even if not lead ing to subject exclusion from the PP population will be listed.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 of 113 10.4.3  Statistic al Methodology   
10.4.3.1  Demography and Disease History  
Demography variables and key baseline disease characteristic variables such as baseline ALP, 
baseline UDCA dose and time since diagnosis will be s ummarized by treatment group using the ITT 
population.  
10.4.3.2  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The mean of all assessments, including repeat assessments, prior to first dose will be considered as 
the baseline value for the analysis.   
Due to the small sample size the pr imary analysis will be conducted using a stepwise approach. The 
percent change from baseline to Week 24 in serum GGT will be analyzed using an Analysis of 
Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and disease severity as fixed effects, and baseline GGT as a 
conti nuous covariate. If the normality assumption for the analysis is not met then the percent change 
from baseline in GGT at Week 24 will be analyzed non -parametrically through a stratified Wilcoxon 
Mann -Whitney (van Elteren) test. The normality assumption wil l be assessed through the 
examination of diagnostic residual plots. Further details and assumption checking will be provided in 
the SAP.   
The difference between each dose of GKT137831 and placebo will be calculated, along with 95% 
and 97.5% confidence int ervals of the difference (to account for Hochberg adjustment).  
The primary analysis will be performed using the ITT population and a sensitivity analysis will be 
done using the PP population. If the Wilcoxon Mann -Whitney test is used, a subgroup analysis f or 
disease severity will also be performed.  
10.4.3.3  Second Efficacy Analysis  
Any analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints should be interpreted with care. The study has not 
been powered for the interpretation of these endpoints. Inferential statistical analys es performed on 
the secondary endpoints are included to aid interpretation and should not be considered as an 
alternative to the primary analysis for determining efficacy. All analyses will be performed using the 
ITT population. Sensitivity analyses using the PP population may also be performed  on secondary 
endpoin ts; these will be specified in  the SAP.  
The difference in the percent change from baseline in serum GGT between each dose level of  
GKT137831 and placebo will be estimated for all scheduled visits using a repeated measures 
analysis of covariance model with treatment, visit and disease severity as fixed effects, the baseline 
value as a continuous covariate and the interaction effect between treatment and visit. Should the 
repeated measures analysis n ot converge or the normality assumption fail, data from each visit will 
be compared individually using the same method as the primary analysis .

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 113 Descriptive summary statistics by treatment group and visit wil l be presented for the change from 
baseline and absolute values of ELF score . The difference in the change from baseline in ELF score 
between each dose level of GKT137831 and placebo will be estimated for all scheduled visits using 
the same methodology as for serum GGT.  
Serum ALP will be summarized in t he same way and analyzed using the same methodology as for  
serum GGT.  
In addition the proportion of subjects achieving a 15, 20, 30, and 40% reduction in serum ALP will be 
tabulated.  
Summary statistics will also be presented for the percent change from ba seline, change from 
baseline and absolute values for all continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. The change from 
baseline in liver function tests other than ALP may also be analyzed in an exploratory manner using 
the same statistical methodology as for th e serum GGT.    
With regard to the PBC -40, analysis is by domain, with the scoring explained in the coded -PBC-40. 
Data should be considered by domain rather than in terms of a cumulative PBC -40 score. If data are 
missing from a domain (typically missed or d uplicated answers) the whole domain should be 
discarded if <50% of items are completed. If >50% of responses are present then the median value 
for the completed items in the domain should be ascribed to the missing item.  
The number and percentage of subje cts belonging to each group for categorical efficacy endpoints 
will be presented by visit and treatment group. Such endpoints include but are not limited to, 
responders to the Paris I, Toronto I, Toronto II, Toronto III, Toronto IV, Mayo II, and Barcelona 
disease prognostic risk criteria for PBC.  
All descriptive statistics will be presented overall, by treatment severity and by any other appropriate 
subgroups as defined in the SAP provided sufficient subject numbers are available within each 
subgroup level,  within each treatment group.  
10.4.3.4  Safety  
All analyses of safety endpoints will be analyzed using the safety population.  
Adverse Events:  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE will be summarized by treatment group 
as per the following criter ia, both overall and by system organ class and preferred term:

TEAEs will be defined as AEs that start on or after the date of the first dose of IMP. In addition, 
summaries of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE by system organ class, 
preferred term and maximum severity will be produced as per the following criteria:  
 TEAE s;  
 Related TEAEs . 
Clinical Laboratory Tests:  
The number and per centage of abnormal biochemical (including TSH), hematological and urinalysis 
laboratory results will be presented by treatment group, laboratory parameter, planned visit and 
severity, where applicable. For dipstick parameters with a categorical response a ny positive results 
will be considered abnormal. The CTCAE  criteria will be used to determine severity. Shift tables for 
the change from baseline  to each planned visit will also be presented. In addition descriptive 
summary statistics will be produced for all biochemical (including TSH) and hematological lab 
parameters which are not considered efficacy endpoints. For the calculation of summary statistics all 
laboratory results will be converted to SI units. Differential counts will be presented both as abso lute 
values and as percentages of white blood cells.    
Prior and Concomitant Medications:  
The number and percentage of subjects taking a medication will be summarized by treatment group, 
anatomical therapeutic chemical level 2 and preferred term. Summarie s will be produced for any 
medications started prior to first dose (and ongoing at baseline) and medications started on or after 
the date of first dose.  
Vital Signs and Body Weight:  
Pulse rate, SBP, DBP and body weight will be summarized using descriptiv e statistics by treatment 
group and planned visit.  
Both the absolute values and the change from baseline will be considered.  
12-lead ECG:  
Heart rate, QT interval (both uncorrected and corrected using Bazett's and Fredericia's formulas), 
will be summarized  using descriptive statistics by treatment group and planned visit.  
Both the absolute values and the change from baseline will be considered.

Potential e ffect of GKT137831  on arterial blood pressure and its clinical rele vance will be evaluated. 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure values will be examined together with temporally associated 
blood pressure related events  including adverse events and serious adverse events,  changes in 
study drug administration  and other rel ated changes in concomitant medications. Medical history 
and other possible contributing risk factors will also be assessed. Results will be presented by 
treatment group and planned visit.  
10.4.3.5  Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentrations of GKT137831 and its main ph ase 1 metabolite GKT138184 will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by dose level  and planned visit . Any plasma concentrations 
below the limit of quantification will be considered as 0 for the calculation of the summary statistics. 
The actual sampli ng time will be presented in listings . Pre-dose samples collected post dose will 
automatically be flagged for exclusion in the summary statistics.  
10.4.3.6  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic A nalysis  
Samples will be analyzed to determine plasma drug concentrations an d thus to aid investigation of 
any PK/PD relationship with PD and/or efficacy endpoints, and optionally for the relationships 
between plasma drug concentrations and pharmacogenomics data.  
A population PK model describing the plasma concentrations of GKT137 831 and GKT138184 will be 
developed using non -linear mixed -effects modelling. Relationships between drug concentrations/ 
exposure measures and selected PD and/or therapeutic efficacy endpoints in the same subject will 
be graphically explored and formal PK/ PD (exposure -response) analyses may be performed. A 
separate Modeling and Simulation Analysis Plan (MSAP) for the PK/PD modeling describing the 
general approach to be taken will be finalized prior to database lock. The actual execution of any 
PK/PD modelin g will depend upon the data, and full details of this will be provided in a separate 
report, which will be appended to the clinical study report  (CSR) . 
10.4.3.7  Missing Data/ Outliers /Dropout Considerations  
For the primary analysis all subjects will be included with  missing data imputed using method MAR 
(missing at random) or MNAR (missing not at random), as appropriate. This same approach will be 
used regardless of whether an ANCOVA or Wilcoxon Mann -Whitney test is used to analyze the 
primary endpoint. More details,  including sensitivity analyses, will be provided in the SAP. The 
complete case approach will be used for the analysis of categorical variables using a worst -case 
imputation strategy. For all other analyses and summaries no imputation will be performed.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 86 of 113 Collected samples may be transferred for analysis to the Sponsor, or to other laboratories working 
for the  Sponsor.  
Biological samples will be stored for the time established by regulatory requirements or destroyed 
after the final clinical study report has been finalized if storage is not required. There might be a new 
request for these samples to be used for purposes related to the QA of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol, in which case they will be used for this purpose. This may include the 
assessment of the quality of current tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the 
development  of new test methods for the markers described in this protocol, as well as making sure 
that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably.  
If study results suggest that further investigations using stored biological samples are warranted,  
these tests might be carried out on an exploratory basis. In addition, biological samples may be used 
by the Sponsor or their research partners for further research that is not related to the disease or the 
product under study. This testing will be done o n anonymized samples (meaning that any 
identification linking the subject to the sample is destroyed). Subjects will be asked to sign an 
additional, separate consent form for this optional testing and refusal of consent will not affect their 
possibility of  participating in the study.  
13.7 Insurance  
The Sponsor has established an insurance policy for the total anticipated duration of the study, 
covering the subjects with respect to the risks involved in taking part in this study in accordance with 
this protocol. In the case of injury or disability deriving from participation in the study, subjects are 
requested to inform the Investigator or his/her staff responsible for the study at the institution without 
delay.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 87 of 113 14 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
The Investigator i s responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility and timeliness of 
the source data. Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the 
supervision of the Investigator.  
The Sponsor and/or its designee, Cmed, will provide guidance to investigators on recording trial data 
in the eCRF.  
14.1 Data Capture Methods  
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, safety assessments and outcome measures) 
will be entered by the site staff into a 21 CFR Part 11 -compliant data capture system provided by 
Cmed. Clinical laboratory data will be entered by a central laboratory, with reports provided 
electronically to the sites for their records and to Cmed for loading into the database. The data 
capture system includes  password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify data appear ing inconsistent, incomplete or inaccurate.  
CRO personnel will be responsible for training of investigator -designated site staff on the correct use 
of the EDC system. Authorized study staff will only be given access once they have received 
training.  
Subjects will be provided with separate paper -based PBC -40 questionnaires and pruritus VAS at 
baseline /Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 24 (Visits 2, 5 and 7, respect ively). Authorized site staff will then 
enter the responses provided in the eCRF with the original questionnaires being retained as part of 
the source documents.  
14.2 Study Site Responsibilities  
All data requested on the eCRF must be recorded. Data will be tran scribed by authorized personnel 
at the study site from the source documents into the eCRF for enrolled subjects. All information on 
the eCRF must be traceable to these source documents. All electronic entries (including any 
changes or updates) will be trac eable through the system. Only the Principal Investigator or 
authorized staff may enter or modify data in the database using their unique password and User 
Identification. The Investigator must certify that the data entered in the eCRFs are complete and 
accurate by electronically signing the eCRF.  
14.3 Data Management Responsibilities  
The Cmed Data and Analytics department will serve as the Statistical and Data Management Center 
for this study and will be responsible for data management, quality review, analysis  and reporting of 
the study data.

MASOP006/F1; Template Version 2.0 12FEB2015  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88 of 113 Data management staff at the CRO will review the data in the eCRFs according to their internal 
SOP s and systematically validate the data using appropriate electronic checks in addition to relevant 
manual checks. For any er rors identified in the data, the CRO will generate a formal query to be 
addressed by the investigational site staff within the EDC system.  
For classification purposes, concomitant medications, AEs and medical history entered into the 
eCRF will be coded usi ng relevant medication and medical term dictionaries. These will be specified 
in the study -specific Data Management Plan.  
14.4 Study Records Retention  
After the trial is completed, the investigator will receive a CD -ROM with the eCRFs of the subject 
data for th e site for archiving at the investigational study site. No records will be destroyed without 
the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the 
investigator when these documents no longer need to be ret ained.  
14.5 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Manual of 
Procedures requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the 
investigator, or the study site staff. As a re sult of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed 
by the site and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations within 5 
working days of identification of the protocol dev iation, or within 5 working days of the scheduled 
protocol -required activity. All major deviations must be promptly reported to Cmed and the Sponsor .  
All deviations from the protocol must be addressed in study subject source documents. A completed 
copy of  the Protocol Deviation Form must be maintained in the regulatory file, as well as in the 
subject’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent to the local IRB/IEC per their 
guidelines. The Investigator and his/her staff are responsible for knowing and adhering to their 
IRB/IEC requirements.

1. Day 1 (Visit 2 ) is also considered baseline  of the 24-week double -blind treatment period (except for the determination of the primary endpoint wh ere the mean of Screening  
(Visit 1 ) and Day 1 values will be defined as baseline ). 
2. Eligibility to enter the double -blind treatment period will be determined during Visits 1  and 2. Not every eligibility assessment  need s to be repeated  at Visit 2  i.e., confi rmatory 
laboratory and diagnostic tests. Subjects with AEs at baseline  may need to be withdrawn in accordance with the eligibility and withdrawal criteria . 
3. At Screening (Visit 1 ), a serum pregnancy test will be performed.  At all subsequent visits  includin g baseline (Visit 2) , urine pregnancy tests will be performed.  
4. For the Baseline visit and all subsequent visits, subjects must remain fasted overnight from 10 pm and bring their morning do se to the clinic. Pre -dose samples will be 
collected and subjects wi ll receive a breakfast meal. Subjects will then self –administer the morning dose up to 30 minutes after eating their  meal . Post dose samples will be 
collected as described.   
5. Post-dose, 12-lead ECG is to be performed around T max, (i.e. 1 to 4 hours post do se). 
6. A complete physical examination wi ll be performed during the S creening visit (Visit 1) and at the follow -up (Visit 8).  On all other visits a symptoms -directed physical 
examination will be performed.  
7. Prior medication will be recorded at S creening only . 
8. The IMP will be orally self -administered BID, once in the morning and once in the evening with meals or up to 30 minutes after eating a meal .

APPENDIX F : CLOSE OBSERVATION PR OCEDURES  
1. Interrupt the inves tigational agent admi nistration  
2. Repeat liver biochemistries and additional testing within 24 -72 hours 
3. Monitor patient twice or thrice a week until liver biochemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, and coagulation profile [INR]) resolve, stabilize or return  to within 
baseline values  
4. Monitor liver biochemistries once a week if abnormalities stabilize and the patient is 
asymptomatic  
5. Obtain a detail ed history for symptoms assessment:   appearance or worsening of clinical 
symptoms of hepatitis (fatigue, nausea, v omiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, 
fever, rash or eosinophilia). If a patient is symptomatic, the drug must be discontinued 
immediately and a potential DILI evaluation must be performed.  
6. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior o r concomitant diseases;  
7. Obtain a history for concomitant medications, acetaminophen, dietary supplements, herbal 
remedies, other over the counter medications, recreational drug use, and special diets   
8. If possible quantify the alcohol consumption to assess for alcoholic hepatitis  
9. Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
10. If INR is also elevated, a trial of intravenous vitamin K administration may be considered, 
especially in cholestatic patients.  
  
Follow -Up Procedures for patient(s) who  meet  potential DILI evaluation criteria : 
1. Viral hepatitis serology including:  
a. Hepatitis A IgM antibody;  
b. Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM);  
c. Hepatitis C RNA;  
d. Hepatitis E IgM antibody.   
e. Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;  
f. Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing); however IgM antibodies must be sent out asap   
g. Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, obtained within 12 hours of last dose. 
Record the date/tim e of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of 
study treatment prior to blood sample draw on the CRF. If the date or time of the last 
dose is unclear, provide the participant’s best approximation.   
h. Serum Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) an d lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  
i. Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin >2xULN  
j. Assess for peripheral eosinophilia  
k. Assess for hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease  
  
The following are required for patients who meet the stopping criteria f or both ALT and total bilirubin 
OR experiences clinical symptoms of hepatitis:  
1. Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, Type 1 anti -liver kidney microsomal 
antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma globulins).

disease, alpha -1 anti -trypsin deficiency)  
3. Serum acetaminophen levels OR serum acetaminophen adducts by HPLC assay (quantifies 
potential acetaminophen contribution to liver injury in participants with definite or likely 
acetaminophen use in the preceding week).  
4. Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver 
disease.  
5. A Liver Biopsy  
  
Treatment with investigational agent could be re -initiated if these abnormalities stabilize, return to 
pre-trial baseline or normalize and a causative agent was found.   
Investigational agent must be discontinued and patient must be followed until the clinical and 
laboratory abnormalities stabilize or normalize  if the following criteria are met:  
1. If close monitoring of a patient is not possible.  
2. In presence of total bilirubin elevation (>2 x ULN or >1.5 x baseline); with any degree of 
aminotransferase elevation; AND if there is appearance of symptoms i.e., fatigu e, nausea, 
vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).   
3. If any degree of total bilirubin, ALT, or AST elevation recurs following re -challenge with study 
drug.

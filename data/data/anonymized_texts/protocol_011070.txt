Phase II
Primary Objective:
To assess the safety and efficacy of repeated intravitreal injections of RBM- 007 (2.0 mg/eye) 
given as monotherapy and RBM-007 (2.0 mg/eye) in combination with Eylea® in subjects with 
wet age -related macular degeneration (AMD) compared with Eylea® alone.
Seco ndary Objective:
To evaluate durability of effect for RBM -007 in subjects with exudative age- related macular 
degeneration. 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
  5  o f  7 8              Confidential  Methodology:
This is a multicenter, active -controlled, double masked study assessing the safety, efficacy 
and durability of four monthly intravitreal (IVT) injections  of RBM-007 monotherapy, 
and four monthly RBM -007 injections in combination with Eylea® dosed at every other month, 
compared to Eylea® monotherapy dosed at every other month in approximately eighty- one 
subjects with exudat ive age-related macular  degeneration (AMD).
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Baseline will be randomized to receive 
treatment for up to t hree months in the study eye.  
Approximately eighty -one subjects with  exudative age-related macular  degen eration 
(AMD) will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either:
xArm 1: Sham + RBM-007 Injectable Solution (2.0 mg/eye)
xArm 2: RBM-007 Injectable Solution (2.0 mg/eye) + Eylea®
xArm 3: Sham + Eylea®
The primary endpoint of the study is at one month post the last injection in all treatment 
arms, with safety evaluation  through add itional two months  post the last injection.
For eligibility, subjects age 55 years or older must be diagnosed with active exudative 
AMD in the study eye, for which previous standard treatment with intravitreal anti-
vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF) agents has demonstrated incomplete 
resolution of exudation, as assessed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography 
(SD- OCT). Other inclusion criteria are: Early Treatment of Di abetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS ) best- corrected visual acuity (BCV A) of 7 8 to 24 letters ( ≤20/32 and ≥20/320 
Snellen vision equivalent); presence of macular edema or subretinal fluid on SD -OCT; 
absence of central atrophy or retinal epithelial tear in the fovea or any condition preventing 
V A improvement in the study eye.
Eligible subjects who are enrolled in the study will be seen for at least 7 visits that include a 
Screening Visit (Visit 0), Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 1), and Week 1 -20 (Visit 2-7).
Subjects are eligible for rescue with Eylea® or other treatment at the discretion of investigator 
anytime during the study except for those visits with Eylea® injection as per protocol, if one of 
the following rescue criteria is met .
Rescue Criteria:
xBCVA decrease of > 10 letters AND cen tral subfield thickness (CST) increase of > 50 
μm from the last visit
xThe discretion of investigator
Number of Subjects (planned):
Approximately 81 subjects with wet AMD will be enrolled at approximately 15 sites.
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
  6  o f  7 8              Confidential  Duration of the Study:
The total study p eriod for each subject will include a screening period (up to 28- days), then a 
treatment and follow up period (up to 20 weeks).
Masking:
This is a double -masked study, with subjects and examiners including the Principal 
Investigator (PI) masked to the treatment regimen. However, the designated injecting physician 
(not the PI) will not be masked to the treatment regimen.
The designated Safety Review Team (SRT) will review the safety data periodically to 
determine if the safety and tolerability of the doses are acceptable. In the event of a serious adverse event the SRT may decide to unmask the treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in 
developed countries. AMD is characterized by extracellular matrix deposits, known as drusen, 
accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane. In exudative or wet AMD unwanted blood vessels grow into the macula which leads to hemorrhage and subretinal fluid. In addition, retinal pigment epithelial detachment, retinal tears, fibrovascular scarring and vitreous hemorrhage may occur. The aberrant growth of leaky vessels is the result of local inflammatory responses leading to disruption of the balance of cytokines that control angiogenesis 
(Lim et al., 2008)
Angiogenesis is a complex and coordinated process of the growth and sprouting of new blood 
vessels from pre-existing vasculature. Although several angiogenic factors have been identified, VEGF family proteins, their receptors and intracellular signaling molecules appear to be the key mediators of angiogenesis (Kane et al., 2008) .
Approximately 1.2 million persons in the United States are estimated to have neovascular AMD and 970 000 to have geographic atrophy; >8 million have at least large drusen in 1 eye and 3.6 million of these have bilateral large drusen. These prevalence figures are expected to increase by approximately 50% ( Chew et al, 2012; Friedman et al, 2004 ). From the initial stage of dry AMD, 
characterized by lipofuscin deposits under the retina known as drusen, 10% are at risk for severe, acute loss of central vision due to the onset of wet AMD, characterized by the growth of abnormal 
CNV in the macula, which leads to subretinal bleeding, fluid exudation, and fibrotic scar 
formation. Over 200,000 new patients each year in the U.S. develop wet AMD ( Ferris, et al, 1984 ).
Current FDA-approved therapies for AMD are pegaptanib (Macugen
®), ranibizumab (Lucentis®) 
and aflibercept (Eylea®). All of these molecules act against the same target: vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF). VEGF, a potent endothelial cell mitogen and vascular permeability factor, is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD. Treatments with anti-VEGF drugs, 
which are delivered by frequent intravitreal injections, have shown dramatic visual benefits for 
AMD patients ( Brown et al, 2006; Heier et al, 2012; Martin et al, 2012 ). However, there are some 
critical limitations; in formal clinical trials, despite consistent monthly treatment, 23% of eyes treated monthly with ranibizumab proceeded to vision worse than 20/200, and 20% to 40% fail to resolve macular fluid even after 2 years of therapy ( Brown et al, 2006; Heier et al, 2 012). 
Furthermore, in the “real-world” setting, patients receive intravitreal injections at much lower 
frequency than the established protocols, so that on average, long-term visual outcomes in AMD 
treatment are poor ( Rofagha et al, 2013; Maguire et al, 2016 ). Factors associated with poor vision 
outcomes, in addition to persistent exudation, include macular atrophy and submacular fibrotic scar formation. Thus, there is a need for additive or alternative therapy to anti-VEGF treatments for wet AMD.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both angiogenesis 
and fibrosis in retinal diseases ( Schultz and Grant, 1991; Vinding, 1990 ). FGF comprises a family 
of 22 members, including FGF2, having many biological activities ( Bikfalvi et al., 1997 ). FGF2 
promotes growth of vascular endothelial cells and tubular structure formation ( Strutz et al, 2002 ), 
and stimulates both VEGF production and scar formation in retina. 
RBM-007 injectable solution is a novel oligonucleotide-based aptamer having potent anti-FGF2 
activity ( Jin et al, 2016 ) and anti-VEGF-expression activity ( Belgore et al, 2003 ). In the rat and  
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
 1 7  o f  7 8              Confidential  mouse models of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, it showed activity after intravitreal 
injection at doses as low as 5 μg/eye ( Matsuda et al., 2019 ). In the laser-induced choroidal 
neovascularization (CNV) fibrosis model in rats, it showed activity after intravitreal injection at 
doses as low as 15 μg/eye ( Matsuda et al., 2019 ). It is hypothesized to have potential effects in the 
treatment of wet AMD because of these activities. Thus, the Sponsor plans to evaluate the safety and bioactivity of RBM-007 Injectable Solution as an intravitreal treatment for exudative AMD.
RIBOMIC has conducted a Phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalating, sequential cohort study 
assessing the safety, tolerability and bioactivity of a single IVT injection of RBM-007 injectable solution in the study eye of nine subjects with refractory wet AMD (Protocol RBM-007-001). 
Three dose levels of RBM-007 have been assessed in this Phase I/II study, 0.2 mg/eye, 1.0 mg/eye 
and 2.0 mg/eye. In this study (SUSHI), there were no reported SAEs. No dose-dependent events were reported and no safety concerns were identified at all investigated doses. Ocular AEs were reported in 3 subjects (33.3%). Most common AE was subconjunctival hemorrhage (2 subjects) and these were considered to be due to the injection procedure. Only one drug related AE was mild iritis that was resolved after one day of topical steroid eye drops.
RIBOMIC believes that the Phase I/II study results mentioned above, in addition to the results of 
the non-clinical studies, support the use of repeated IVT injections of the 2.0 mg concentrations of RBM-007 in humans in the Phase II clinical trial, namely TOFU (Protocol RBM-007-002).

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, active-controlled, double masked study assessing the safety, efficacy 
and durability of four monthly IVT injections  of RBM-007 monotherapy, and four monthly 
RBM-007 injections in combination with Eylea® dosed at every other month, compared to 
Eylea® monotherapy dosed at every other month in approximately eighty -one subjects with 
exudative AMD.
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Baseline will be randomized to receive treatment for up to three months in the study eye.  
Approximately eighty
-one subjects with  exudative AMD will be randomized in a 1:1:1ratio 
to either:
xArm 1: Sham + RBM-007 Injectable Solution (2.0 mg/eye) 
xArm 2: RBM-007 Injectable Solution (2.0 mg/eye) + Eylea®
xArm 3: Sham + Eylea®
For eligibility, subjects age 55 years or older must be diagnosed with active exudative AMD in 
the study eye, for which previous standard treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF agents has demonstrated incomplete resolution of exudation, as assessed by spectral domain optical 
coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Other inclusion criteria are: Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 78 to 24 letters ( ≤20/32 
and ≥20/320 Snellen vision equivalent); presence of macular edema or subretinal fluid on SD-
OCT; absence of central atrophy or retinal epithelial tear in the fovea or any condition 
preventing V A improvement in the study eye.
Eligible subjects who are enrolled in the study will be seen for at least 7 visits that include a 
Screening Visit (Visit 0), Baseline/Day 1 (Visit 1), and Weeks 1to20 (Visits 2-7).The Primary Analysis is planned when all subjects complete the Week 16 visit. The Follow-up Analysis is planned at Week 20 to assess the number of Eylea
® injections used for Rescue in addition to 
efficacy and safety data.
Subjects are eligible for rescue with Eylea® or other treatment at the discretion of investigator 
anytime during the study except for those visits with Eylea® injection as per protocol, if one of 
the following rescue criteria is met:
Rescue Criteria:
xBCVA decrease of > 10 letters AND central subfield thickness (CST) increase of > 50 μm
from the last visit.
xThe discretion of investigator.
If rescue is performed, the following assessments must be performed after the administration of Rescue treatment: (all ophthalmic procedures to be performed in the treated eye)
-Within 30 minutes following Rescue treatment 
 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002 Amendment 1   
 2 1  o f  7 8              Confidential  A wide range of animal toxicology studies were conducted with RBM-007 Injectable Solution by 
both systemic and ocular routes. Systemic toxicity was seen only with high doses far above those 
doses contemplated for ocular administration. The NOAEL in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) intravitreal monkey studies is 1 mg/eye. Using a volume of vitreous of 2.2 mL for monkey, this is 
a concentration of 0.45 mg/mL ( Atsumi et al, 2013 ). The intended human doses for the first in 
human study (RBM-007-001) are 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg per eye administered once. Considering a 
value of human vitreous to be 5.2 mL ( Panda-Jonas, 1994 ), these concentrations are 0.038, 0.19 
and 0.38 mg/mL for these clinical doses. Therefore, the NOAEL in monkey is 11-fold higher than the intended starting clinical dose and 1.1-fold higher than intended maximum human dose. The safety factor would have been even higher if the viscosity and injectable volume for RBM-007 
Injectable Solution in animals (monkey and rabbit) were not limiting parameters. Additionally, the 
current long-term ocular monkey study with monthly injection of RBM-007 at 1 mg/eye monotherapy and RBM-007 at 0.5 or 1 mg/eye in addition to Eylea
® at 2 mg/eye for up to five 
injections (by Week 20 of dosing as interim report) has not shown any treatment-related adverse effect. This study is still ongoing.
With regard to systemic exposure, the highest concentration of RBM-007 seen in plasma after 
single intravitreal dosing was 2,100 ng/mL at a dose of 1 mg/eye in monkey and 65.1 ng/mL at a dose of 0.5 mg/eye (injection to both eyes at a dose of 0.5 mg/eye, total 1 mg/body) in rabbit. Toxicokinetic evaluation in GLP systemic studies in monkey suggests that blood level at which toxicity might occur is 691,000 ng/mL. Thus, even without correcting for the body weight differences between animals and humans, the safety margin is 165–5,207 at the maximum dose of 
2.0 mg/eye for human. If the body weight for animals is taken into account (rabbit and monkey at 
3 kg and human at 70 kg.), the safety margin is 3,850–123,830. 
Thus, the Sponsor contends that the preclinical toxicology studies support the planned clinical 
studies.
Number of Subjects
Approximately 81 subjects (Arm 1: 27 subjects, Arm 2: 27 subjects, Arm 3: 27 subjects) with wet AMD will be enrolled at approximately 15 sites. The final number of subjects enrolled may be adjusted based on drop-out rate.
Treatment Assignment
RBM-007 (2.0 mg) and Eylea® will be administered by IVT injection in the study eye.
•RBM-007 injectable solution 2.0 mg (100 μL of 20 mg/mL)
•Eylea®2.0 mg (50 μL of 40 mg/mL)
Dose Adjustment Criteria

should be made with the safety of the subject as the primary consideration. Whenever possible, RIBOMIC should be notified before any prohibited medication or treatment is administered or if the permissibility of a specific medication or treatment is in question
9.2.2 Rescue Therapy
Rescue therapy is defined as IVT injection of Eylea® or other treatment at the discretion of 
investigator in the study eye. The rescue should be considered anytime during the study except 
for those visits with Eylea® injection as per protocol. Assessing Physician should determine the 
need for Rescue and refer the subject to the Injecting Physician to decide about what to use for Rescue. 
Eligibility criteria for Rescue are as follow:
xBCVA decrease of > 10 letters AND central subfield thickness (CST) increase of > 50 μm
from the last visit.
xThe discretion of investigator.
If rescue is performed, the following assessments must be performed after the administration of 
Rescue treatment: (all ophthalmic procedures to be performed in the treated eye)
-Within 30 minutes following Rescue treatment
oSlit-lamp biomicroscopy
oIndirect ophthalmoscopy

Treatment Compliance
In order to obtain efficacy and safety data, it is critical that the treatment regimen and visit schedule 
specified in this protocol are followed. The Clinical Investigator is required to administer the RBM-007 injection and Eylea
® and is responsible for scheduling the subject for follow-up visits 
as specified in the protocol. Study monitors will verify pertinent data to confirm the study is conducted according to the protocol.
Randomization and Masking
Two arms in the study will have Sham injection which is a mimic procedure of a real intravitreal injection but does not penetrate the eye. To keep masking of the clinical trial, investigator and authorized study staffs must follow the points below.
•The designated injecting physician and the designated injection staff must ensure any
information regarding clinical study drugs injection during the study is inaccessible to other
study staff.
•The designated injecting physician and the designated injection staff cannot perform any
assessments, examinations, or procedures for the study other than clinical study druginjection procedures and examinations post drug injections.
•Study staff not designated to study drug injections, including investigators, examiner andother clinical site staff, cannot participate in any procedures for clinical study drug injections
and examinations post drug injections.
In case of a medical emergency, the Principal Investigator or site staff may reveal the treatment 
information by unmasking to know which treatment the subject has received. The Principal Investigator should contact RIBOMIC, or RIBOMIC’s designee, before taking this measure, if there is sufficient time. RIBOMIC, or RIBOMIC’s designee, must be informed of all instances 
where the code is broken and of the reasons for such instances.
Additionally, the adverse event or serious adverse event for which study treatment was unmasked 
should be reported to RIBOMIC (see Section 12.1).

Eye preparation for Eylea® administration to be done as per Eylea® drug labeling.
<Investigational drug: RBM-007>
Prior to RBM-007 administration, the study eye should be prepared as follows:
1.Dilate pupil (1 % mydriacyl and 2.5 % phenylephrine or equivalent applied topically) 
approximately 10 minutes prior to injection.
2.Administer 1 eye drop of topical anesthetic (0.5 % proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic 
solution or an equivalent topical ophthalmic anesthetic).
3.Administer 10 % povidone iodine.
4.Use a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to remove excess fluid from the lower conjunctival sac.
5.Take 2 sterile cotton tipped applicators and thoroughly soak with 0.5 % proparacaine topical 
anesthetic eye drops or an equivalent topical ophthalmic anesthetic. Place the soaked 
applicators, side by side, gently but firmly on the conjunctival surface at the area of the 
entry site described below in Step 2 ( Section 10.7)  and hold in place for approximately 1

<Investigational drug: Sham>
Sham is injection that simulates RBM-007/Eylea® drug administration. Sham intravitreal 
injections will be administered to subjects according to the same dosing schedule and procedure 
as RBM-007/ Eylea® injections. However the Sham intravitreal injection procedure will only 
mimic RBM-007/Eylea® intravitreal injection in that the blunt end of an empty syringe is pressed 
against an anesthetized eye, instead of a needle attached to RBM-007/Eylea® syringe injected into 
the anesthetized eye. Therefore Step 3 and 4 of RBM-007 ( Section 10.7 ) and corresponding steps 
of Eylea® administration procedure will be skipped for the Sham injection.
To keep masking of the study, investigator and authorized staff must follow the points described 
in Section 9.4.
Study Drug Accountability
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that an inventory is conducted upon receipt 
of the clinical supplies. The temperature recorder from the shipment will be deactivated and 
authorized study staff will verify that the temperature was maintained at -20°C during transit. The 
clinical supplies shipment form should be completed, signed, and returned as directed. A copy must be maintained at the site for the Principal Investigator's records.
The Principal Investigator will keep a current record of the inventory, storage conditions and 
dispensing of all study drugs. This record will be made available to RIBOMIC (or designee) for accounting for all clinical supplies. Any significant discrepancy and/or deficiency must be 
recorded with an explanation.
All supplies sent to the Principal Investigator must be accounted for and in no case will study drugs 
be used in any unauthorized situation. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to ensure that any used and unused supplies are available to RIBOMIC (or designee) throughout the study.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
Adverse Events
12.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drug(s). An AE, therefore, can be an unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that 
has clinical significance and is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
In clinical studies, an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including Baseline or 
pre-treatment period, may be recorded as an AE even if no study drug has been administered.
Any significant adverse change in a subject’s condition from Baseline, regardless of causality, is 
to be considered an AE, unless the change is determined to be a continuation of a pre-existing 
condition that is documented in the subject’s medical history. However, a clinically significant 
worsening in severity, intensity, or frequency of a pre-existing condition may indicate an AE. In addition, all conditions that lead to hospitalizations, defined as an overnight hospital stay, are considered as AEs. This includes planned elective surgeries.
Lack of efficacy of the study drug(s) for the condition being investigated is not considered an AE 
unless a clinically significant change is assessed by the Clinical Investigator.  An elective surgical 
procedure scheduled or planned prior to study entry is not considered an AE if an overnight hospital stay is not required, and the underlying diagnosis for which surgery is to be performed 
should be captured in the medical history as a pre-existing condition. The surgical procedure 
should also include the term “elective” in all reports.
Assessment of Adverse Events
Clinical Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact. Subjects should be 
asked, using a general, non-direct question, if there has been any change in their general health. 
Direct questioning and examination should then be performed as appropriate.
Severity of the AE should be assessed according to the following criteria:
•Mild: No interference with the subject’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy
required
•Moderate: Possible interference with the subject’s daily activit ies; no or minimal medical
intervention/therapy required
•Severe: Considerable interference with the subj ect’s daily activities; medical 
intervention/therapy required
Regardless of severity, some AEs may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to definitions 
and reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) in Section 12.1.2.
A Clinical Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of the 
relationship of the study drug(s) to each AE (related or not related). The Clinical Investigator 
should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the  
 
   
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 4 6  o f  7 8              Confidential  RBM-007, Eylea® or the Sham injection could have caused the AE/SAE based on facts, evidence, 
scientific rationales, and clinical judgment. When assessing causality, the Clinical Investigator 
may consider the following information when determining the relationship to the study drug(s) for each AE: mechanism of action, biologic plausibility, confounding risk factors (i.e., medical history, 
concomitant medications), temporal relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge, and lack of alternative 
explanation. It should be specified if the AE is related to the injection procedure and not the study drug.
xThe AE may be recorded as Related to the study drug(s) if there is a plausible temporal 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study drug(s), and the AE 
cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical state, concurrent illness, or concomitant 
therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug(s),; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug(s),.
xReporting the AE as Not Related to study drug(s), may be considered if, for example, there 
is good evidence that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug(s) (e.g., pre-existing medical condition, underlying disease, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 
and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug(s) 
(e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after dose of study drug(s)).
Reporting Adverse Events
AEs, whether spontaneously reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will 
be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE eCRF. Each recorded AE 
will be described by its duration (i.e., start and end dates), frequency, severity, regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug(s), relation to injection procedure, location, actions taken and outcome.
AEs that occur after any subject has provided written informed consent, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related 
to the study, must be recorded. To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Clinical 
Investigators should observe the following guidelines:
xWhenever possible, use recognized medical terms when recording. Do not use colloquialisms and/or abbreviations.
xIf known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component signs and 
symptoms and /or laboratory or test findings (e.g., record congestive heart failure rather than 
dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x-ray). However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event should be recorded as an individual AE).
xIf the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading component sign, symptom or test finding and describe the other clinically related findings in the narrative description of the case. A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such
x(e.g., record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in the clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed. 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 4 7  o f  7 8              Confidential  xAEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by the primary 
cause. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most accurate clinical term. If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case. For example:
xThe subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequently fainted and fell to the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.
xThe primary AE in this example is orthostatic hypotension. The fall, head trauma and neck 
pain should be described in the narrative description of the case.
xFor intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be recorded 
as the date the subject first started to experience the event and resolution date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped. Separate AEs for each event should not be recorded. For example, if a subject experienced headache on 14SEP2015 lasting for three hours, then subsequently experienced intermittent episodes of headache every day for approximately 3 hours until 21SEP2015, then the AE date of onset is 14SEP2015 and the 
resolution date is 21SEP2015.
xFor intermittent events, record the maximum severity of the individual events. For example, 
if a subject complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the severity of each headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severity would be moderate.
xFor intermittent hospitalizations occurring for a primary AE (e.g., in a subject with multiple 
sclerosis, commonly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in some cases leading to 
multiple hospital confinements), the subsequent hospitalizations should be described in the narrative description of the case.
xIf treatment was initiated, include the treatment and duration of the medication(s) in the eCRF.
12.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
SAEs are defined as any findings that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. Any adverse event is considered a serious adverse event if it results in any of the following outcomes:
xDeath
xLife threatening:
A life-threatening event is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
xHospitalization, at the minimum an overnight stay
xA persistent or significant disability/incapacity
xA congenital anomaly/birth defect
xOther medically significant events:
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 4 8  o f  7 8              Confidential  Other medically significant events are events that may not result in death, be life- 
threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered a serious adverse drug 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.
xSight threatening event:
A sight-threatening event is any event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
permanently losing vision in either eye as a direct result of the event. It is defined as a loss of ≥ 30 letters or 6 lines of vision from Baseline.
Reporting Serious Adverse Events
A SAE eCRF must be completed with as much information available within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the event.
To improve the quality and precision of acquired SAE data, Clinical Investigators should observe 
the following guidelines:
x Death - Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported as a SAE.
x Hospitalizations for Surgical or Diagnostic Procedures - The illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure itself. The 
procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action taken in response to 
the illness.
When new significant information (including the outcome of the event) is obtained, the Clinical Investigator should enter the information directly into the eCRF within 24 hours or as soon as possible after knowledge of the information.
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, RIBOMIC may request additional 
documentation, for example, copies of the ophthalmic and medical record of the subject as well as results of laboratory tests. If the subject was hospitalized, the site should summarize the hospital discharge summary and provide to RIBOMIC upon request.
Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
RIBOMIC (or designee) will provide the Principal Investigator with a reporting cover letter and an anonymized MedWatch 3500A or CIOMs form as appropriate for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. The Principal Investigator is responsible for receiving and reviewing expedited safety reports, submitting expedited safety reports to the IRB or IEC, and maintaining copies of expedited safety reports in the study records.
12.1.3 Events of Special Interest
Events of Special Interest (ESIs) are events that may require special attention for the purposes of on-going patient safety review during this study. The following are considered ESIs and should be reported on the appropriate eCRF with as much information as available within 24 hours of

DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS
The Principal Investigator will allow representatives of RIBOMIC’s monitoring team (or 
designee), the governing institutional review board (IRB), the FDA, and other applicable 
regulatory agencies to inspect all study records, eCRFs, recruitment materials and corresponding portions of the subject’s medical records at regular intervals throughout the study. These inspections are for the purpose of verifying adherence to the protocol, completeness, and exactness of the data being entered onto the eCRF, and compliance with the FDA or other regulatory agency regulations.
Study Monitoring
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the study, RIBOMIC or a representative of RIBOMIC (or designee) will evaluate the investigational study site to:
•Determine the adequacy of the study facilities.
•Review with the Principal Investigator(s) and authorized study staff their responsibilities
with regard to protocol procedures adherence, and the responsibilities of RIBOMIC (ordesignee).
During the study, RIBOMIC (or designee) will have regular contact with the investigational site, 
for the following:
•Provide information and support to the Principal Investigator(s).
•Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.
•Assess adherence to the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).
•Perform investigational product accountability checks and quality control procedures.
•Ensure the on-going implementation of accurate data entry in the eCRF.
•Perform source data verification, including a comparison of the data in the eCRFs with the
subject’s medical records and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct
access to all original records for each subject (e.g., clinic charts).
•Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to RIBOMIC.
•Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs
have been forwarded to RIBOMIC and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been
forwarded to the IRB or IEC.
RIBOMIC (or designee) may remotely access the eCRFs at any time during the study for 
centralized monitoring. RIBOMIC (or designee) will be available between visits if authorized study staff needs study related information or support.

Appendix C - Declaration of Helsinki
  
WMA Declaration of Helsinki - Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 
Subjects 
 
Preamble
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research 
on identifiable human material and data.
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.
General Principles
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be 
evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and 
quality.
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights.
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must 
always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research 
subjects, even though they have given consent.
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international  
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 6 8  o f  7 8              Confidential  norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should 
reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the 
environment.
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients 
or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participation in research.
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their 
patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic 
or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the 
research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of 
participating in research must be ensured.
Risks, Burdens and Benefits 
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and 
burdens.
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment 
of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in 
comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the 
condition under investigation.
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless 
they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily 
managed.
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 6 9  o f  7 8              Confidential  When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive 
proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately 
stop the study.
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive 
to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non- 
vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted 
scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant 
sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. 
The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described and justified in a research protocol.
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include 
information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study.
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post-trial 
provisions.
Research Ethics Committees
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must 
provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval 
by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 0  o f  7 8              Confidential  confidentiality of their personal information.
Informed Consent
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical 
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or 
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits 
and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any 
other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse 
to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information.
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study.
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the 
research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent 
is able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that 
assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s 
dissent should be respected.
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent 
to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 1  o f  7 8              Confidential  authorized representative.
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship.
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.
Use of Placebo
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested 
against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable;
or
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be 
subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of not receiving the best 
proven intervention.
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.
Post-Trial Provisions
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post-trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified 
as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the 
informed consent process.
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject.
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to 
make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or 
otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of 
interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or 
other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 2  o f  7 8              Confidential  informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

Appendix D - Procedures for Examinations
21.4.1 Demographics/Eligibility, Medical/Surgical History and Concomitant 
Medication
Demographics/Eligibility, medical/surgical history and concomitant medication will be obtained through subject interviews at Screening (Day -28 to Day -1). Medical history and concomitant medications will be obtained through subject interviews at each visit.
 
21.4.2 Physical Examination
A full body systematic physical examination will be conducted during Visit 0/Screening (Day - 28 to Day -1). Clinical Investigator or an external internist will confirm subject’s overall condition noting any abnormalities by a review of the following systems: e.g., head, neck, thyroid, ears, nose, 
throat, mouth, tongue, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen, neurological and other. 
The Clinical Investigator will assess subject’s overall condition to determine qualification for 
study entry considering possible class effects of RBM-007. 
21.4.3 Vital Signs
Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured at Visit 0/Screening (Day - 28 to Day -1) using an automated or manual blood pressure monitor. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures will be recorded in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and heart rate will be recorded in beats per minute (bpm).
In accordance with the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, 
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 
(US_Dept_Health_and_Human_Services, 2004 ), the following measurement procedure will be 
used to measure vital signs:
xSubject should not smoke or ingest caffeine within the 30-minute period immediately before 
the measurement.
xSubject should be seated quietly in a chair with the back supported, feet on the floor, arm 
bared, and arm supported at heart level.
xBegin the measurement after at least 5 minutes of rest.
xTo ensure an accurate measurement, use an appropriately sized cuff. The cuff bladder should 
encircle at least 80 % of the arm. Many adults need a large cuff.
xTake two (2) systolic/diastolic pressure and heart rate measurements separated by at least 30 seconds. Record each measurement in the subject’s source document.
xIf the two pressure measurements differ by 5 mmHg or less, then the average of the two 
becomes the recorded pressure. For example, if the two measurements are 120/90 and 125/95, then 122.5/92.5 is the recorded systolic/diastolic pressure. 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 4  o f  7 8              Confidential  xIf the two pressure measurements differ by more than 5 mmHg, then a third reading 
measurement is made, and the average of the three becomes the recorded pressure. For 
example, if the three measurements are 115/90, 124/96, and 120/92, then 119.7/92.7 is the recorded systolic/diastolic pressure. The recorded blood pressure will be the average of the 
measurements.
xRecord the heart rate. For heart rate, the average of the two (or three, if performed) 
measurements obtained becomes the recorded heart rate.
21.4.4 Urine pregnancy test
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted before IVT injection at Screening Visit, Visit 1 and 
Visit 7 for all females of childbearing potential. A female is considered of childbearing potential 
unless she is postmenopausal (at least 24 months since last menses occurred), has had her uterus and/or both ovaries removed, or has had a bilateral tubal ligation. To obtain the pregnancy test, 
the subject should follow instructions provided by the manufacturer of the urine pregnancy test 
kit.
 
21.4.5 Best Corrected Visual Acuity
ETDRS chart will be used to examine and record BCVA at each study visit.
21.4.6 External Ocular Examination
External ocular examination will be done evaluating lid and lashes as normal and abnormal with notes if abnormal.
21.4.7 Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be used to examine eye structures at each study visit. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed prior to the (first) injection and then again within 30 minutes 
after the (second) injection on the Visit 1 (Day1), 3 (W4), 4 (W8) and 5 (W12). This will be also 
applied for the post IVT injection of Rescue treatment. The conjunctiva, cornea, and lens will be observed with the slit-lamp beam approximately 0.3 mm in width and 1.0 mm in length. Conjunctiva, Sclera and Cornea will be described as normal / abnormal with notes if abnormal.
  
Lens 
The lens will be noted as normal/abnormal, phakic, aphakic, or pseudophakic. Phakic lens will be graded for cataract as nuclear, posterior subcapsular, and cortical as described below:
None (0) = No lens discoloration nor opacificationMild (1) = Yellow lens discoloration or small lens opacity (axial or peripheral) 
Moderate (2) = Amber lens discoloration or medium lens opacity (axial or peripheral) 
Severe (3) = Brunescent lens discoloration or complete lens opacification (no red reflex)
Anterior chamber cells and flare will be observed with a 1.0 mm in width and 1.0 mm in length 
slit beam and graded using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) scale (Sun 
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 5  o f  7 8              Confidential  Working, 2005) . The iris and the pupil will be evaluated for the presence of clinically significant 
abnormalities.

Anterior Chamber Flare 
(0) = None
(1) = Fain
(2) = Moderate (iris/lens details clear)(3) = Marked (iris/lens details hazy)
(4) = Intense (fibrin/plastic aqueous)
 
Iris 
The iris will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant abnormalities, and 
graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality 
present). A description of any clinically significant abnormalities will be noted.
 
Pupil 
The pupil will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant abnormalities, and 
graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality 
present). A description of any clinically significant abnormalities will be noted.
21.4.8 Intraocular Pressure
IOP will be measured by applanation tonometry at each study visit. Procedures in each visit are 
described in Section 7.5.2 .
RBM-007 Injectable Solution Protocol RBM-007-002   
 7 6  o f  7 8              Confidential  For Rescue IVT injection, IOP will be measured as follows: 
-IOP will be measured at 40 (±10) minutes post-injection.
-If post-injection IOP is > 21 mmHg after eye massage and/or aqueous tap performed per
investigator discretion, IOP measurement will be repeated at 60 (±10) minutes post-
injection.
-If post-injection IOP at 60 (±10) minutes is > 21 mmHg after eye massage and/oraqueous tap performed per investigator discretion, IOP measurement will be repeated at90 (±10) minutes post-injection.
-If there is an increase of ≥ 10 mmHg at 90 (±10) minutes post-injection compared to
Baseline IOP, the subject should be prescribed a topical IOP-lowering medication until heor she returns for follow- up per the Clinical Investigator’s discretion (an unsche duled
visit may apply).
-On the other hand, a subject with IOP measurement of > 21 mmHg will be managedaccording to the discretion of the Clinical Investigator.
-TheIOP increase of ≥  10 mmHg from Baseline AND IOP measurement of > 21 mmHg
will be reported as an AE.
•Aqueous tap can be performed at any time per the Clinical Investigator`s discretion fortreatment or prevention of increasing in the IOP.
The applanation tonometer must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject undergoes 
screening, and periodically until the last subject has exited the study. For checking calibration, 
follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
The following IOP measurement procedure is in accordance with the procedure used in the Ocular 
Hypertension Treatment Study (Gordon et al., 2001 ) at each visit:
At least two, and sometimes three, consecutive measurements are made to obtain a determination of intraocular pressure. Each IOP measurement should be recorded in the subject’s source document and in the eCRFs.
•If the two measurements differ by 2 mmHg or less, then the average of the two
measurements becomes the recorded IOP. For example, if the two measurements are 22 and23, then 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.
•However, if the two measurements differ by 3 mmHg or more, then a third measurement ismade, and the median of the three measurements becomes the recorded IOP (the median isthe middle measurement after arraying the measurements from low to high). For example,
if the three measurements are 15, 19, and 16, then 16 is the final recorded IOP.
•The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.

Indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed for each eye at each visit under pharmacological pupil 
dilation.
Indirect ophthalmoscopy will be used to examine the retina at each study visit. Indirect 
ophthalmoscopy will be performed prior to the (first) injection and then again within 30 minutes after the (second) injections on the Visit 1 (Day1),  Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8) and Visit 5 (Week 12). Areas to be assessed include cup to disc ratio, peripheral retina, macula, choroid, and vitreous. This will be also applied for the post IVT injection of Rescue treatment.
 
Cup/Disc Ratio
The cup/disc ratio will be determined by the examiner and recorded using two decimal places 
(e.g., 0.80).
  
Retina, Macula and Choroid
The retina, macula and choroid will be evaluated for the presence of any clinically significant 
abnormalities, and graded as either normal (within normal limits) or abnormal (clinically significant abnormality present). A description of any abnormalities will be noted.
Vitreous
The following National Eye Institute Grading Scheme will be used to measure vitreous haze 
and opacification (Nussenblatt et al., 1985) .
Vitreous Haze Scale

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 5 of 131 1 Ethical considerations  
Multiple candidate HIV vaccines will need to be studied simultaneously in 
different populations around the world before a successful HIV preventive 
vaccine is found. It is critical that universally accepted ethical guidelines are 
followed at all sites involved in the conduct of these clinical trials. The HIV 
Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) has addressed ethical concerns in the following 
ways:  
• HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base 
necessary to find a preven tive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically 
rigorous and valid, and in accordance with International Council for 
Harmonisation  of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human 
Use (ICH)  and/or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
• HVTN sc ientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies underlying 
major codes (1-3), declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to 
human subjects research into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical 
trials.  
• HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed to substantive 
community input —into the planning, co nduct, and follow -up of its research —
to help ensure that locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study 
populations are met. Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by 
DAIDS and supported at all HVTN research sites to ensure community inpu t.  
• HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to 
reduce HIV risk. Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are 
provided counseling on notifying their partners and about HIV infection 
according to local guidelines. S taff members will also counsel them about 
reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to others.  
• Participants who become HIV -infected during the trial are referred to medical 
practitioners to manage their HIV infection and to identify potential clinical 
trials  they may want to join.  If a program  for antiretroviral therapy  (ART ) 
provision  is not available at a site and ART is needed, a privately established 
fund will be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent possible.  
• The HVTN provides trainin g so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the privacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the fullest exte nt possible, their privacy 
protected. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
• Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by scientists 
who are not involved in the conduct of the trials under consideration.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 6 of 131 • HVTN trials are r eviewed by local and national regulatory bodies and are 
conducted in compliance with all applicable national and local regulations.  
• The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both 
study participants and their local communities. For example, HVTN protocols 
provide enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, 
as well as counseling, guidanc e, and assistance with any social impacts that 
may result from research participation. HVTN protocols also include careful 
medical review of each research participant’s health conditions and reactions 
to study products while in the study.  
• HVTN research ai ms to benefit local communities by directly addressing the 
health and HIV prevention needs of those communities and by strengthening 
the capacity of the communities through training, support, shared knowledge, 
and equipment. Researchers involved in HVTN tr ials are able to conduct other 
critical research in their local research settings.  
• The HVTN values the role of in -country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) , 
Ethics Committees (ECs) , and other Regulatory Entities (REs)  as custodians 
responsible for ensurin g the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 7 of 131 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other US federal regulations 
require IRBs/ECs /REs  to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial 
and continuing review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following section highlights how 
this protocol addresses each of th ese research requirements. Each HVTN 
Investigator welcomes IRB/EC /RE questions or concerns regarding these research 
requirements.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are 
minimized.  
This protocol mi nimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly 
informing participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the 
researcher in recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood 
draw limits; (c) performing dire ct observation of participants postvaccination and 
collecting information regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) 
having staff properly trained in administering study procedures that may cause 
physical harm or psychological distress, s uch as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV 
testing and counseling and HIV risk reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk 
reduction counseling and checking on contraception use (for persons assigned 
female at birth ); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reaso nable risk/benefit balance  
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56.111(a) 2 : Risks to subjects are 
reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and 
the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to 
result.  
In all public he alth research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess 
because the benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be 
in treatment protocols, where a study participant may be ill and may have 
exhausted all conventional treatme nt options. However, this protocol is designed 
to minimize the risks to participants while maximizing the potential value of the 
knowledge it is designed to generate.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 8 of 131 2.3 Equitable participant  selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject se lection is 
equitable  
This protocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to 
follow in admitting participants into the protocol. Participants are selected 
because of these criteria and not because of positions of vulnerability or p rivilege. 
Investigators are required to maintain screening and enrollment logs to document 
volunteers who screened into and out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 and 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 and 5: Info rmed 
consent is sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s 
legally authorized representative as required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 
21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately documented as 
required by 45 CFR 46. 117 and 21 CFR 50.27  
The protocol  specifies that informed consent must be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial (see Section 9.1). Eac h 
site is provided training in informed consent by the HVTN as part of its entering 
the HVTN. The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in 
addition to chart notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 a nd 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 6: There is adequate 
provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of 
subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section 11). Safety is 
monitored daily by HVTN Core and routinely by the HVTN 123  Protocol Safety 
Review Team (PSRT ). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) 
periodically reviews s tudy data.  
2.6 Protect privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate 
provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the 
confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual’s right to be free from unaut horized or 
unreasonable intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to 
individually identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy” concerns 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 9 of 131 research participants or potential research participants as individuals whereas the 
term “confidentiality” is used to refer to the treatment of information about those 
individuals. This protocol respects the privacy of participants by informing them 
about who will have access to their personal information and study data (see  
Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is protected by assigning unique 
identifiers in place of the participant’s name on study data and specimens. In the 
United States, research participants in HVTN protocols are protected by a 
Certificate of Confidentiality from the US  National Institutes of Health  (NIH), 
which can prevent disclosure of study participation even when that information is 
requested by subpoena. Participants  are told of the use and limits of the certificate 
in the study consent form. In  addition, each staff member at each study site in this 
protocol signs an Agreement on  Confidentiality and Use of Data and Specimens  
with the HVTN . In some cases, a comparable confidentiality agreement process 
may be acceptable. E ach study site participating in the protocol is required to have 
a standard operating procedure on how the staff members will protect the 
confidentiality of study participants.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 14 of 131 4 Background  
4.1 Rationale for trial concept  
An effective vaccine against HIV -1 infection remains an elusive goal (4) and will 
likely need to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses  in order to 
both redu ce acquisition and control post infection viremia (5, 6) . To date, only 
four vaccine concepts have been tested in field trials (7-12) and only one vaccine 
regimen has shown efficacy in preventing HIV -1 infection (12). In RV144, an  
ALVAC env/gag/PR prime at 0, 1, 3, 6 months  with an AIDSVAX B/E gp120 
Env boost at 3 and 6 months was found to have mode st overall vaccine efficacy  of 
31% in the modified intention -to-treat cohort (12). Subsequent detailed analyses  
of potential correlates of protection and risk found that Env -specific binding IgG 
antibodies directed against the V1V2 region were found to positively correlate 
with protection (13), although protection peaked soon after vaccination and then 
waned over several years (14). 
The successful use of a protein boost following a heterologous priming vaccine in 
RV144 has renewed interest in development of Env proteins as a component of 
future HIV -1 vaccine regimens. Howe ver, the field has been hampered by 
difficulties in manufacturing Env proteins, as well as uncertainty in the choice of 
immunogens (15). It is, therefore, quite likely that multiple different Env proteins 
will need to be tested in an iterative fashion, potentially both alone and as part of 
prime -boost comb inations (16). 
Furthermore, designing a vaccine regimen which can lead to induction of broadly 
neutralizing antibodies ( bnAb s) has been a significant challenge for the field (17-
19). Results thus far have m ostly been limited to activity against easily -
neutralized Tier 1 viruses (for example, HVTN 073E (20) and HVTN 083 (21)) 
although some activity against more representative Tier 2 viruses was seen in 
HVTN 205 (22). Amongst the reasons why eliciting bnAb s has proven  such a 
challenge  include the trimeric conformational structure of Env, molecular 
mimicry of host antigens by conserved viral epitopes, as well as the atyp ical B 
cell maturation pathways  and complex somatic mutations in immunoglobulin  
variable domains  which may be required (23-26). If frequent and sequential 
immunization with serial Env proteins is necessary to direct B cell somatic 
mutation toward bnAb  production in a step -wise fashion (27, 28) , a hypothesis 
being tested in HVTN 115, then a very large number of Env proteins will need to 
be synthesized and tested in phase 1 studies in the near future.  
One approach to shortening the  product development timeline could be the use of 
transiently transfected cell lines (29) to produce Env proteins (30). In contrast 
with the current practice of developing stably transfected cell lines in order to 
produce sufficient quantities of clinical -grade product (31), use of transiently 
transfected cell lines could reduce the time required by at least several mont hs 
(32). This would allow novel immunogens to enter phase 1 testing more quickly,

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 15 of 131 choose candidate regimens for efficacy trials (16). First, however, we propose that 
Env proteins produced by transiently transfected cell lines be tested in vivo to 
demonstrate that they have comparable safety and immunogenicity to Env 
proteins pr oduced by stably transfected cell lines.  
This study will use a clade C HIV -1 gp120 envelope protein (CH505TF gp120) 
adjuvanted with GLA -SE as the immunogen. This protein, produced via stably 
transfected cells, with GLA -SE, is also being tested in HVTN 115  (see Section  
4.9.1 ). CH505TF gp120 produced by transient transfection has not yet been tested 
in a clinical trial, and therefore, this will serve as the first -in-human study for the 
protein produced by this method. The use of a gp120 Env has several potential 
advantages: 1) immunogenicity is rel ated to binding affinity to B -cell receptors  
(BCRs)  on the responding B cells (33, 34) ; 2) gp120 Env binds with high affinity 
to the germline unmutated common ancestor (UCA) antibody of the CH103 -like 
bnAb  linea ge and binds with high affinities to other bnAb  lineage intermediates; 
and 3) the exclusion of gp41 avoids stimulating non -neutralizing antibody 
responses to gp41 epitopes. This trial will allow direct comparison of an Env 
protein produced by two different  methodologies and has the potential to greatly 
accelerate HIV -1 vaccine development.  
4.2 Stable CH505TF gp120  
The Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI) developed the transmitted/founder 
CH505 Env (CH505TF gp120) vaccine in collaboration with NIAID as part of the 
B cell lineage approach to develop bnAb s (27, 2 8). CH505TF gp120 is a 
recombinant HIV -1 gp120 clade C Env protein with an N -terminal deletion that 
facilitates production by decreasing protein dimer formation and increasing 
production yield  (35). This envelope sequence was derived from an African clade 
C transmitted founder virus CH505 -infected individual  (36). The Stable 
CH505TF gp120 was produced via stable transfection of a CHO -DG44 cell line 
and is also being tested in HVTN 115  (see Section 4.9.1 ). The Stable CH505TF 
gp120 will be mixed with GLA -SE (glucopyranosyl lipid A in a stable emulsion 
[oil-in-water emulsion containing  squalene ]) manufactured  by the Infectious 
Disease Research Institute (IDRI).  
4.3 Transient CH505TF gp120  
The Transient CH505TF gp120  amino acid (aa) sequence is identical to the Stab le 
CH505TF gp120. Transient transfection was achieved by electroporation with 
post-transfection scale up of suspension cultures to a bioreactor. CHO -DG44 cells 
did not recover from the transient transfection procedure as well as CHO -S cells; 
therefore, CHO -S cells were chosen to produce the Transient gp120. The 
purification process was similar to the stably expressed protein . As with the 
Stable CH505TF, t he Transient  CH505TF gp120  will be mixed with GLA -SE 
manufactured  by IDRI .

CH505TF gp120  
Bulk drug substance (BDS) batches of both Stable and Transient CH505TF gp120 
proteins produced from  CHO cells were purified by KBI Biopharma using 
multimodal and ion -exchange chromatography . The two products were compared 
by a series of biochemical and biophysical assays. Both forms (stable and 
transient) of CH505TF gp120 were monomeric by size exclusion chromatography  
(SEC)  analysis ( Figure 4-1) and showed similar migration on SDS -PAGE that 
was consistent with that of a 120kDa protein band ( Figure 4-2). Neither form of  
CH505TF gp120 showed any detectable proteolytically cleaved fragme nt by 
SDS-PAGE under reducing or non -reducing condition s, and no clearly distinct 
fragment was detected by W estern Blot analysis.

Healthcare) column confirms  monomeric gp120 proteins with elution volume s (Ve) of 12.01 
and 12.07 mL for transient and stable respectively.  Both forms of gp120 proteins were ab out 
99% monomeric .

The monodispersity of the two protein forms was also assessed by dynamic light 
scattering ( Figure 4-3), which showed a complete absence of dimer or higher 
order oligomers. Not unlike the stable line produced CH505TF gp120, the 
transiently produced CH505TF gp120 gave a  differential scanning ca lorimetry  
(DSC ) thermal melting profile ( Figure 4-4) with two resolved transition T m 
(melting temperature) peaks (Tm 1/Tm 2 = 57.2/64.0 and 57.4/64.8oC for transient 
and stable respectively), indicating that both forms of the proteins adopted a 
similar folded state.

Figure 4-4 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC ) show s a similar  unfolding profile with 
similar on -set and Tm values for stable and transient CH505TF gp120.  
The antigenic signature of the transient gp120 was ident ical to its stable protein 
counterpart, with both gp120 proteins binding to each UCA, the intermediate IA3 
as well as to the mature CH106 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of the CD4 binding 
site (CD4 -BS) bnAb lineage  (data not shown) . No difference was observed i n the 
affinities of either UCA (K d = 489.5 and 491.4  nM for transient and stable 
respectively) or CH106 (K d = 9.7 and 9.7  nM for transient and stable respectively) 
binding to the two protein forms ( Table 4-1). The relative proportion of bnAb 
CH106 -reactive fraction present in both stable and transient preparations when 
measured by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC) analysis (stoichiometry n 
values) was similar  (~ 60% active) (Figure 4-5). The closeness in values of 
CH106 affinities and enthalpy changes ( ∆H) indicated that the binding of both the 
stable lin e produced and the transiently produced CH505TF gp120 follows a 
similar thermodynamic mechanism when binding to the CD4 -BS bnAb. Thus , 
CH505TF gp120 produced by transient transfection was comparable to the 
CH505TF  gp120 protein produced by stably transfect ed cells  with respect to its 
biochemical/biophysical properties as well as its antigenicity for binding to 
CH013 lineage antibodies.

4.5 Trial design rationale  
This is a double -blind, randomized clinical trial , which will compare the safety 
and immunogenicity of a CH505TF gp120 produced via stably transfected cell 
lines compared with production via transiently transfected cell line . Fifteen 
healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adults will be enrolled into each group, vaccinated at 
months 0, 2, and 6, and followed for a total of 12 months. The design of this 
comparative study is intended to allow rapid assessment of the comparability of 
the Env  proteins in terms of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity. It is likely 
that antibody responses to the Env proteins will peak after the 3rd injection given 
at month 6. Assessments of h umoral immune responses are planned at earl y, peak, 
plateau, and la te time points by analyzing binding to a panel of Env antigens using 
the binding antibody multiplex assay (BAMA). From an immunogenicity 
perspective, this study design will allow us to assess both magnitude and breadth 
of humoral immune responses as well as  understand in detail the kinetics of the 
antibody responses.  

HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 21 of 131 The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate whether immunization with 
Env protein produced by transiently transfected cells is as safe and immunogenic 
as immunization with Env produced by stably transfected cells. While past 
vaccine trials of Env proteins  (Envs)  have used Envs made by stable transfection, 
much of the early animal research is performed using Envs produced by transient 
transfection. Envs made by both approaches have been s afe and immunogenic in 
animal studies, and are analytically similar (Section 4.4), but HIV Envs made by 
transient transfection have not yet been tested in clinical trials. By directly 
comparing CH505TF gp120 produced by transiently transfected cells with 
CH505TF gp120 pro duced by stably transfected cells this study has the potential 
to enable future clinical trials with novel Env immunogens to launch much faster.  
4.5.1  Dose (amount and number)  
Both the CH505TF gp120 produced by transiently transfected cells and the 
CH505TF gp120 produced by stably transfected cells will be given at a fixed dose 
of 100 mcg per injection. In HVTN 115 Part A, the Stable CH505TF gp120 will 
be tested at 20 mcg, 100 m cg, and 400 mcg to determine the optimal dose for Part 
B. The 100 mcg dose of CH505TF gp120 was chosen for this study as it is likely 
to be in the linear range in terms of antibody responses. The TLR4 agonist  GLA -
SE adjuvant will be admixed with all protei ns. The total dose of GL A-SE will be 
10 mcg (lipid A) at all time points. The 10 mcg dose of GLA -SE was selected 
based upon preclinical studies demonstrating safety  (rabbits) and immunogenicity 
(guinea pigs and rhesus macaques) of the Stable CH505TF gp120 +  GLA -SE 
vaccine (see Sections  4.7 and 4.8) and the established safety p rofile of the GLA -
SE adjuvant in human clinical trials (see Section 4.9.2 ). Furthermore, the 10 mcg 
dose of GLA -SE is being  used in HVTN 115  (see Section 4.9.1 ). All injections 
will be administered IM by needle and syringe.  
4.5.2  Schedule  
Vaccinations will occur at months 0, 2, and 6.  These immunization intervals were 
chosen based on prior studies with different Env proteins and are likely to lead to 
high peak antibody titers and high humoral response rates after the third 
vaccination. In previous trials with adjuvanted protein vaccines, peak 
immunogenicity has been observed after 3  doses of the protein, while a prolonged 
rest period between the 2nd and 3rd vaccinations is thought to enhance antibody 
maturation.  
4.6 Plans for future product development and testing  
The Stable CH505TF gp120 vaccine is a component of the regimen being teste d 
in HVTN 115, which represents the first clinical trial of administration of 
sequential Env proteins in an attempt to elicit CD4 -binding site (CD4 -BS) bnAb s. 
HVTN 115 is likely to be the first of a series of iterative clinical trials to optimize 
induction  of bnAb s. The overarching goal of this study is to demonstrate whether 
Env protein production by transiently transfected cells is as safe and

4.7.1  Preclinical toxicology study of Stable CH505TF gp120  in rabbits   
A toxicity s tudy with Stable CH505TF gp120 in New Zealand White ( NZW) 
rabbits was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) . 
Seven biweekly IM injections of 400 mcg CH505TF gp120 with 20  mcg GLA -SE 
adjuvant coadministered with or without a 4 mg DNA , or 20 mcg GLA -SE alone , 
to NZW rabbits for 13  weeks were well tolerated. Test article -related changes in 
dermal scores, clinical pathology parameters, and microscopic injection site 
findings were resolved/partially resolved and/or trending toward recovery by t he 
recovery necropsy, and none of the test article -related changes were deemed 
adverse. A more detailed description of the toxicity study can be found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure  (IB). 
4.7.2  Preclinical toxicology study of Transient CH505TF gp120   
Toxicity st udies with Transient CH505TF gp120 Env have not been done. As the 
amino acid sequence is identical between the Transient and Stable CH505TF 
gp120 Env proteins, a significant difference in toxicity  is not expected . 
In July 2017, a Briefing Package was sent to the FDA, in which results from 
release testing, biophysical and biochemical characterization, and antigenicity 
studies of Stable CH505TF  and Transient CH505TF gp120 proteins were 
summarized. Results from these preclinical tests indicated that the two pr oteins 
were similar with respect to release testing and physicochemical characterization. 
Both proteins demonstrated the expected binding to CH103 lineage antibodies 
that target the CD4 binding site; showing weak affinity binding to UCA and 
higher affinity  binding to both an intermediate lineage antibody (IA3.2) and the 
mature CH106 bnAb. In addition, a subset of preclinical safety and 
immunogenicity studies conducted with the Stable CH505TF variant were 
presented in support of the clinical safety experienc e with this gp120 protein. 
DAIDS proposed that  the combination of the physico chemical data and clinical 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 23 of 131 safety data presented are sufficient and an additional GLP toxicology study of the 
Transient CH505TF would not provide additional useful information on the safety 
of the Transient CH505TF gp120 protein, and was not being planned. In addition, 
clinical safety data from the ongoing study of the stably produced CH505 TF 
protein will be available prior to the initiation of the comparative study described 
here.  The FDA concurred that no additional toxicology studies or pre -IND were 
required.

The CH505TF gp120 used in the initial an imal studies (guinea pig 501 and NHP

CH505TF gp120 has a different glycosylation profile than that of the CHO -
produced protein used for the rabbit toxicology study , mouse immunogenic ity, 
and for the nonhuman primate (NHP ) dose response study (NHP 106).  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 24 of 131 4.8.1  Immunogenicity of CH505 -derived gp120 envelopes with GLA -SE in 
guinea pigs  
In a guine a pig study, the GLA -SE adjuvant was necessary for optimal immune 
responses to gp120 at all doses (Figure 4-6).  
 
Figure 4-6 GLA -SE enhanced immunogenicity of CH505TF gp120 protein in guinea pigs.  
Binding antibodies from guinea pigs immunized with varying doses of CH505TF gp120 and varying 
amounts of GLA-SE were measured by enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA). The data 
were used to calculate the log -transformed area under the curve (AUC) as shown on the y -axis. 
CH505TF gp120 was immunogenic at all doses. Groups 1, 5 and 9 received no GLA -SE and had 
significantly less anti -gp120 antibodies than the groups with 5 mcg (Groups 2, 6 and 10), 10 mcg 
(Groups 3, 7, and 11) or 25 mcg (Groups 4, 8, and 12) of GLA -SE. Moreover, there was no 
difference between the three GLA -SE doses (statistical analysis not shown) . 
4.8.2  Immunogenicity of CH505 -derived gp120 Envelopes , study NHP 79 
The EnvSeq -1 immunogens consist of four gp120 proteins derived from CH505: 
CH505TF, CH505w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100 . These proteins were  
administered to 3 groups of four rhesus macaques (NHP 79) with the GLA -SE 
adjuvant : 1) CH505TF Env gp120 alone; 2)  the Envs given in a sequential 
regimen (CH505TF, CH50 5w53, CH505w78, and CH505w100); and 3) an 
additive -immunization regimen consisting of CH505TF gp120 in combination 
with the evolved Env variants (CH505TF, then CH505TF + CH505w53, then 
CH505TF + CH505w5 3 + CH505w78, then CH505TF + CH505w53 + 
CH505w78 + CH505w100).  These Envs were research grade products made by 
transient transfection of 293 cells and have different glycosylation profiles than 
the CHO -produced CH505TF gp120s to be used in this clinical tr ial. This study 
demonstrates the proof of concept of using sequential Env variants in NHPs.  
The CH505 gp120 Env derivatives (including CH505TF) were found to be 
immunogenic ( Table 4-4). An important readout in this study was differential 
binding to the CD4 -BS of the envelope protein. This assay detects antibodies 
which bind  to wild type CH505 Env gp120 but not to CH505 with a deletion of 
isoleucine at aa position 371  (CH505 Env IΔ371 gp120),  indicating CD4 -BS

79 study suggest  that triggering of UCAs of lineages capable of binding HIV 
Envs with wild typ e sequences without further evolution into bnAb s can occur . In 
this study of 12 monkeys, 11/12 monkeys had differential binding antibodies 
isolated but overall the Env differential binding antibodies were subdominant and 
comprised only about  15% of the tot al activity  of the antibody response, which is 
consistent with development of bnAb s in HIV -infected individuals.  
Table 4-4 CH505 Env gp120 derivatives are immunogenic in rhesus macaques.  Plasma was 
screened fo r neutralization of HIV -1 isolates via the TZM -bl assay. ID 50 positivity cutoff was ≥20 or

generate an ID 50 value.  
 
4.8.3  Immunogenicity of Stable CH505TF gp120 , study NHP 106  
A dose ranging study was performed in rhesus macaques using 5 to 600 mcg of 
Env CH505TF gp120  (produced by stably transfected CHO -DG44 cells)  along 
with 25 mcg GLA -SE with each dose administered 5 times. Immunogenicity was 
demonstrated at all dose levels and no adverse reactions were observed. Env 
binding antibody (Figure 4-7) and CD4 -BS antibody (Figure 4-8) levels were 
determined and the CH505 TF gp120 was found to be immunogenic after 2 
immunizations.  All dose levels gave similar binding responses.  When we assessed

4.8.4  Immunogenicity of Stable CH505TF gp120 and Transient CH505 TF 
gp120 in Balb/C mice , study 04   
Immune responses fr om the Transient and Stable CH505TF gp120 vaccine s were 
evaluated in a preclinical immunogenicity study conducted by the Barton Haynes 
Laboratory at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). The immunogenicity of 
each vaccine was evaluated in female BALB/c mice after 2 or 3 IM 
immunizations with the respective protein adjuvanted with 5 mcg of GLA -SE per 
mouse dose. Six groups of 7 female BALB/c mice were immunized every 2 
weeks for a total of 3 immunizations with each respective vaccine. Pre -bleeds/ser a 
were  taken 2 weeks prior to and on the day of immunization 1 (day 0). Post bleeds 
were collected 1 week after each immunization.  
The immunogenicity of each form of recombinant gp120 was evaluated by 
ELISA for the ability of vaccine to induce serum antibodies t o bind recombinant 
Env gp120 ( Figure 4-10 and Figure 4-11) (36). The vaccine -induced antibodies’ 
ability to block the binding of the CD4 binding site neutralizing antibody to 
recombinant gp120  was also evaluated  by ELIS A using methods described in 
reference  (35). Groups were compared by Exact Wilcoxon test (also called 
Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney) with the Benjamini -Hochberg (1995) correction for 
multiple testing  (see Figure 4-12 and Figure 4-13).

Figure 4-10 The binding of serum antibody to coating antigen CH505 gp120 reference 
produced in 293F cells  
Figure 4-10A shows the binding of serum antibodies induced by the Stable 
CH505TF (blue circle s) and the Transient CH505TF (red squares) to a reference 
coating antigen CH505 gp120, produ ced in 293F cells. The data show equivalent 
binding of antibodies induced by either vaccine to the reference gp120, with a 
slight trend of better binding with 10 an d 25 mcg doses after the second 
immunization by serum antibodies induced by the Transient CH505TF Env. 
However, this difference was not statistically significant. Figure 4-10B shows the 
same analysis after the third immunization and again showed no difference in the 
binding of the antibodies induced by the two proteins.  
Figure 4-11 shows the time course of serum antibody binding to the indicated 
coating Env protein listed over each graph of antibodies induced by the highest 
dose (25 mcg) of Stable CH505TF gp120 Env (blu e dots) or Transient CH505TF 
gp120 Env (red squares). Binding of immune serum to Stable CH505TF is shown 
in Panel A and binding to Transient CH505TF is shown in Panel B. The 
engineered resurfaced core 3 (RSC3) protein was used to detect antibodies 
antigeni cally related to CD4 -binding site binding, and results are shown in Panel 
C (37). Panel D shows binding to the heterologous gp120 YU2. YU2 gp120 is 
CD4 -binding site knock -out mutant lacking variable regions V1, V2, and V3 and 
truncated at the N - and C -terminal regions; binding to YU2 g p120 indicates serum 
antibodies directed to the gp120 scaffold (37). Panel E displays binding to the 
CH505TF V2 peptide 
(GMKNCSFNITTELRDKREKKNALFYKLDIVQLDGNSSQYRLIN). Lastly, 
Panel F demonstrates binding to CH505 V3 peptide 
(TRPNNKTRTSIRIGPGQAFYATGQVIGDIREAY). These data show that the 
binding profile of antibodies induced by either the stable cell line gp120 or the 
transiently transfected -produced gp120 was near identical. With the data in Panels 
A, B, D and F, there was a slight but statistically non -significant trend to the 
transiently  transfected -produced material to be better as an immunogen.

generated by vaccination with either Stable CH505 (blue dots) or Transient 
CH5050 gp120 (red squares). Data show that afte r the second immunization 
(Figure 4-12A), there was a significant improvement in blocking of sCD4 binding 
to gp120 with transiently transfected Env -immunized serum co mpared to stable 
cell line -produced gp120 -immunized serum. A similar difference was seen after 
the second immunization for ability of serum to block the binding of the broadly 
neutralizing antibody (bnAb) CH106 to Env gp120 ( Figure 4-12B). 
Figure 4-13 shows the time course of blocking in the sCD4 blocking assay (Pan el 
A) and the CH106 blocking assay (Panel B) and shows slight (not statistically 
significant) trend of increased blocking by the transient gp120 -induced antibodies 
after the second immunization but no difference in blocking after the 3rd 
immunization.  
The immunogenicity of each form of the recombinant gp120 was near identical in 
all performed assays. The Transient CH505TF gp120 induced slightly better CD4 
binding site antibodies than the Stable CH505TF. Thus, the two proteins were 
highly comparable in their  immunogenicity in BALB/c mice, as measured by 
Env-reactive antibodies, with a trend toward higher induction of CD4 binding site 
targeted antibodies by Transient produced gp120.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 31 of 131 4.9 Clinical studies  
4.9.1  Clinical studies of Stable CH505TF gp120  vaccine  
The Stable CH505TF gp120 is being evaluated  in HVTN 115. In the dose ranging 
portion of that clinical t rial (HVTN 115 Part A) safety and immunogenicity data 
will be collected to inform the protein dose for the second part of that study. 
HVTN 115 Part A reached full enrollment with 42 participants in May 2018. As 
of June 25, 2018, there has been one case of grade 3 erythema/induration  with 
grade 2 cellulitis  after the second vaccination. All other reactogenicity events 
have been mild -moderate  and vaccinations have been well tolerated .  
There is extensive clinical trial experience with other gp120 Env proteins 
evaluated either alone or in combination with various prime or boost regimens. 
The AIDS Vaccine Evaluation Group (AVEG) conducted an analysis of safety 
data from over 15 clinical tri als of gp120 and gp160 proteins administered to over 
500 individuals demonstrating that overall, HIV Env proteins at doses up to 640 
mcg were well tolerated. The majority of the local and systemic reactions were 
deemed associated with the adjuvant componen ts of the vaccine rather than the 
Env proteins themselves  (38). 
A monovalent subtype B and bivalent subtype B/E (CRF01_AE) recombinant 
gp120 HIV -1 vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) was evaluated in an efficacy study 
conducted in over 2500 injection drug users in Thailand. A total of 600 mcg o f 
AIDSVAX B/E was administered with alum as an adjuvant. The most commonly 
reported adverse event (AE) was tenderness at the injection site (71% of vaccine 
recipients versus 66% of placebo recipients), which did not increase with 
subsequent injections. The re were no differences between vaccine and placebo 
recipients with respect to the number of serious AEs (SAE s) (39). 
The RV144 study evaluated the same gp120 vaccine in a heterologous prime -
boost vaccination regimen consisting of a recombinant canarypox vector 
expressing gag, PR,  and env (ALVAC -HIV; vCP1521) followed by the gp120 
protein boost. Over 8000 participants received multiple combined doses of 600 
mcg of gp120 in combination with ALVAC -HIV (12). Local and systemic 
reactogenicity noted after the gp120 protein (AID SVAX B/E) was mostly mild 
with very few SAEs reported  (40). 
Prior clinical experience comparing various doses of gp120 and gp160 Env 
proteins has not iden tified significant differences in the safety profile when the 
protein dose was altered and adjuvant dose remained constant. For example, in a 
study evaluating AIDSVAX B/E gp120 at 100 mcg ( N=31), 300 mcg ( N=31) and 
600 mcg ( N=30) of the protein adjuvanted with alum, the majority (80%) of 
participants reported at least one reactogenicity event, most commonly injection 
site pain/tenderness, but all of the reactogenicity symptoms were mild to moderate 
and self -limited. Furthermore , although there were fewer reactogenicity events at 
the 100 mcg dose, the safety profile in the 300 mcg and 600 mcg groups was 
similar  (41). A study of recombinant gp160 VaxSyn formulated with an alum 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 32 of 131 adjuvant compared two doses of 160 mcg (N=20) and 640 mcg (N=21) of the 
protein administered as 4 injections over a 12 month period. Local reactogenicity 
(injection site erythema/indurati on) was frequent but self -limited, last ed less than 
48 hours, and the frequency of local reactogenicity was similar between the two 
dose groups. There were no significant differences in severe local or systemic 
reactions between the dose groups. Importantl y, there were no significant 
differences in laboratory abnormalities (hepatic, hematologic and renal function) 
between the two different protein doses  (42). 
Taken together, the combined data from the large numbers of trial participants in 
these studies demonstrate that gp120 re combinant protein vaccines administered 
in combined doses of up to 600 mcg are immunogenic and well tolerated. There 
has been one recent case of anaphylaxis deemed related to the vaccine. There 
were no other unusual or serious vaccine -associated AEs report ed. 
4.9.2  Clinical studies of the GLA -SE adjuvant and protein combinations  
GLA -SE is  a synthetic TLR4 agonist formulated in a stable nano -emulsion of 
squalene oil and promotes a strong Th 1-type immune response  to vaccine  
antigens  (43, 44) . Although the Transient CH505TF gp120 protein in combination 
with GLA -SE has not  been evaluated in huma ns to date , as summarized in Section  
4.9.1 , the Stable CH505TF gp120 is under evaluation in HVTN 115. In addition, 
there is considerable clinical trial experience w ith the GLA -SE adjuvant in 
combination with other antigens. These data are  summarized below and in Table 
4-5 and Table 4-6. Over 1100 individuals have received at least one dose of the 
GLA -SE adjuvant at doses ranging from 0.5 to 20 mcg with no significant safety 
concerns identified to date. Please see the IB for additional details of the clinical 
trials performed with GLA -SE.  
Five studies have included  the 10 mcg dose of the GLA -SE adj uvant proposed for 
this study. The first was an open -label  phase 1 clinical trial conducted  in Brazil 
with a Schistosoma mansoni  antigen (Sm14 ) (45). Twenty healthy males received 
3 IM doses of 50 mcg Sm14 + 10 mcg GLA -SE at one -month intervals. The 
vaccine was safe and generally well tolerated with no SAEs or Grade 4 AEs  (45). 
Injection site pain was commonly reported ( 80%, 50%, and 41% after the first, 
second, and third dose, respectively) , but generally mild and self -limited . There 
were no abnormalities in physical exams, serum chemistries, and hematology 
values that were considered related to study vaccine.  Humoral and CD4+ T cell 
responses to Sm14 were reported (45). 
The second  clinical trial using the 10 mcg dose of GLA -SE is a recently 
completed  phase  1, open -label evaluation of the safety, tolerabil ity, and 
immunogenicity of a Leishmania vaccine (LEISH -F3) in combination with SLA -
SE (second generation glucopyranosyl  lipid A in stable oil -in-water emulsion) 
adjuvant compared to LEISH -F3 with GLA -SE in healthy adults ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
Protocol IDRI -LVVPX -117). The SLA -SE adjuvant is a next generation TLR4 
adjuvant formulation. Thirty -nine participants were randomized to 4 arms: high 
dose LEISH -F3 (20 mcg) and low dose SLA -SE (5 mcg); high dose LEISH -F3 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 33 of 131 and h igh dose GLA -SE adjuvant (10 mcg); low dose LEISH -F3 (5 mcg) and high 
dose GLA -SE adjuvant (10 mcg); and high dose LEISH -F3 and high dose SLA -
SE adjuvant (10 mcg). Partici pants received 3 injections at one -month intervals.  
This study is complete. The LEISH -F3 + GLA -SE and LEISH -F3 + SLA -SE 
vaccines were safe and well tolerated in adult subjects. No deaths, no dose -
limiting toxicities (DLTs), no Grade 3 or 4 AEs, no SAEs, and no AESIs occurred 
during the study. All study injection reactions were Grade 1 or G rade 2. The most 
frequently reported reactions were injection site tenderness/pain and fatigue.  
Three other clinical trials are evaluating GLA -SE in oncology. Two ongoing trials 
are investigating GLA -SE alone as an immunotherapy and one trial tested GLA -
SE in combination with a prostate cancer antigen. No data are currently available 
from these trials . 
Clinical experience with GLA -SE as an adjuvant for other vaccines at doses 
ranging from 1 mcg to 5 mcg suggests that it is safe and well -tolerated. Treanor et 
al. tested an avian influenza hemagglutinin (H5) subunit vaccine at a range of 
doses with and wit hout a fixed dose of GLA -SE (1 mcg) and reported mild to 
moderate injection site pain and/or tenderness in 50–70% of H5 + GLA -SE 
recipients, with myalgias and headaches reported by a minority (25 -27%) of 
vaccinees. No other safety findings were noted and t he GLA -SE adjuvant 
substantially increased the immunogenicity of the vaccine (46). 
A recent phase 1 clinical trial of a res piratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in 
older adults ( ≥ 60 years of age) found that a combination of the RSV fusion (F) 
protein at three different doses with 2.5 mcg of GLA -SE was safe, well -tolerated, 
and immunogenic. Compared with unadjuvanted vaccine,  GLA -SE increased 
local reactogenicity, with 40-65% of subjects reporting mild-to-moderate, self -
limited  injection site pain and/or tenderness  (47). No other safety concerns were 
reported . Immune responses were F protein  dose-dependent, and  the adjuvant 
enhanced  both humoral and cellular immune respon ses (47). A follow -up study 
using a higher do se of F protein and three doses of GLA -SE has been completed  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). The vaccine was safe, tolerable, and immunogenic and the data 
supported the selection of 120 mcg F protein /5 mcg of GLA -SE for further 
evaluation (48). 
GLA -SE was also found to be safe and well -tolerated at doses of 2 mcg and 5 
mcg in a phase 1 trial of LEISH -F3 given three times at one month intervals  (49). 
Injection site pain and/or tend erness was quite common (90 -100%) with fatigue 
noted by 40 -60% of vaccinees receiving the adjuvanted product versus 33% of 
subjects who received unadjuvanted vaccine (49). The unadjuvanted LEISH -F3 
was essentially non -immunogenic while antibody and cytokine responses were 
noted in vaccinees in  both dose groups of GLA -SE (49). 
GLA -SE at a 5 m cg dose has also been tested together with protein antigens in 
several other clinical trials which are included in Table 4-5 and Table 4-6.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 40 of 131 6 Statistical considerations  
6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment w ill target enrolling 30 healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants 
aged 18 to 50 years . 
6.1.1  Sample size calculations for safety  
The goal of the safety evaluation for this study is to identify safety concerns 
associated with product administration. The ability of the study to detect SAEs  
(Table 6-1) can be expressed by the true event rate above which at least 1 SAE 
would likely be observed and the true event rate below which no events would 
likely be observed. Specifically, for each vaccine arm of the study (n = 15), there 
is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 
15% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the  true rate is 
0.5% or less. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials from December 2000 
through April 2014 , about 4% of participants who received placebos experienced 
an SAE.   
Probabilities of observing 0, 1 or more, and 2 or more events among arms of size 
15 are presented in Table 6-1 for a range of possible true AE rates. These 
calculations provide a more complete picture of the sensitivity of this study design 
to iden tify potential safety problems with the vaccine.  
Table 6-1 Probability of observing 0 events, 1 or more events, and 2 or more events, among 
arms of size 15, for different true event rates  
True event rate (%)  Pr(0/1 5) Pr(1+/1 5) Pr(2+/1 5) 
0.5 0.928  0.072  0.003  
1 0.860  0.140  0.010  
4 0.542  0.458  0.119  
10 0.206  0.794  0.451  
15 0.087  0.913  0.681  
20 0.035  0.965  0.833  
30 0.005  0.995  0.965  
40 0.000  1.000  0.995  
An alternative way of describing the statistical properties of the study design is in 
terms of the 95% confidence interval  (CI) for the true rate of an AE based on the 
observed data. Table 6-2 shows t he 2-sided 95% CIs for the probability of an 
event based on a particular observed rate. Calculations are done  using the score 
test method (50). If none of the 3 0 participants receiving a vaccine regimen 
experience a safety event, the 95% 2 -sided upper confidence bound for the true 
rate of such events in the to tal vaccinated population (n = 30) is 11.4 %. For eac h 
individual vaccine arm (n = 15 ), the 2 -sided upper confiden ce bound for this rate 
is 20.4 %.

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity  
Binding antibodies will be measured by geometric mean fluorescence intensity 
(FI) for homologous proteins . We will test the null hypothesis that the geometric 
mean FI in the transient arm is less than 1/4 of the geometric mean FI in the stable 
arm. The power to reject this null hypothesis depends on the variability of the 
binding antibodies measurements and s ample sizes. Based on HVTN 505 data, the 
standard deviation of the natural log of geometric mean FI  at the dilutions 
optimized for immune correlates analyses, which maximize the proportion of 
samples within the linear range of the dilution -response curve, is around 1.4.  
Table 6-3 lists the power under a range of standard deviations, non -inferiority 
margins, and sample sizes.  
The power study assumes that log e(geometric mean FI for a panel of Envs ) is 
normally distributed and has the same spread in both arms. We will form a 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in log e(FI)s between the transient arm and 
the stable arm and compare the lower confidence interval to log e(1/4) . Under the 
parameters of the proposed study, the estimated power to rejec t the null 
hypothesis ranges from 0.86 to 0.63 for standard deviation ranging from 1.2 to 
1.6.

deviation: spread of log e (FI); n: sample size for each arm.  The alpha level is set  at 0.05 for a two-
sided test.  
 

HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 1 2, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 42 of 131 6.2 Randomization  
A participant’s randomization assignment  will be computer -generated and 
provided to the HVTN CRS pharmacist through a Web -based randomization 
system. At each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for 
dispensing study products is charged with maintaining security of the treatment 
assignments  (except in emergency situations as specified in the HVTN MOP).  
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to 
participant treatment arm assignments. Study product assignments are accessible 
to those HVTN CRS pharmacists, DAIDS protocol pharmacists and contract 
monitors, and SD MC staff who are required to know this information in order to 
ensure proper trial conduct. Any discussion of study product assignment between 
pharmacy staff and any other HVTN CRS staff is prohibited. The HVTN SMB 
members also are unblinded to treatment a ssignment in order to conduct review of 
trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant will 
be told he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her 
treatment assignment.  
In some cases, the CRS, PSRT, or study s ponsor may believe unblinding of the 
site PI and participant would be appropriate to facilitate the clinical management 
of an AE or SAE. The HVTN Unblinding MOP specifies procedures for 
emergency unblinding, and for ea rly unblinding for medical reasons.   
6.4 Statistical analys es 
This section describes the final study analys es, unblinded as to treatment arm 
assignment. All safety data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according 
to the initial randomization assignme nt regardless of how many vaccinations they 
received. In the rare instance that a participant receives the wrong treatment at a 
specific vaccination time, the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to 
analyze the participant’s safety data. A nalys es are modified intent -to-treat in that 
individuals who are randomized but not enrolled do not contribute data and hence 
are excluded. Because of blinding and the brief length of time between 
randomization and enrollment —typically no more than 4 working da ys—very 
few such individuals are expected.  The primary and secondary analys es of 
immunogenicity  data are per -protocol in that only individuals who receive the 
expected vaccinations within the expected visit window contribute data.  
Analyses for primary endp oints will be performed using SAS and R. All other 
descriptive and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, 
StatXact, or R statistical software.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 43 of 131 6.4.1  Analysis variables  
The analysis variables consist of baseline participant characteristic s, safety, and 
immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment arms will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concur rent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants 
will have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety 
data.  
6.4.3.1  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of 
reactogenicity sign or sym ptom will be tabulated by severity and treatment arm 
and the percentages displayed graphically by arm. For a given sign or symptom, 
each participant’s reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum 
severity for all injection visits. In addition, to the individual types of events, the 
maximum severity of local pain or tenderness, induration or erythema, and of 
systemic symptoms will be calculated. Wilcoxon  tests will be used to test for 
differences in severity between arms.  
6.4.3.2  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be su mmarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred 
terms. Tables will show by treatment arm the number and percentage of 
participants experiencing an AE within a System Organ Class or within preferred 
term category by severity or by relationship to stu dy product. For the calculations 
in these tables, a participant with multiple AEs within a category will be counted 
once under the maximum severity or the strongest recorded causal relationship to 
study product. Formal statistical testing comparing arms is  not planned since 
interpretation of differences must rely heavily upon clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) 
Safety Office will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to 
study pr oduct, time between onset and last vaccination, and number of 
vaccinations received.  
6.4.3.3  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study earl y will be tabulated by reason and treatment arm.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 44 of 131 6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
6.4.4.1  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints  analyses will be limited 
to participants who received all scheduled injections per protocol. Assay results 
that are unreliable, from specimens collected outside of the visit window, or from 
HIV-infected participants postinfection are excluded. Since the exact date of HIV 
infection is unknown, any assay data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an 
infected participan t’s last seronegative sample and thereafter may be excluded. If 
an HIV -infected participant does not have a seronegative sample postenrollment, 
then all data from that participant may be excluded from the analysis.  
Discrete categorical assay endpoints (eg,  response rates) will be analyzed by 
tabulating the frequency of positive response for each assay by antigen and 
treatment arm at each timepoint for which an assessment is performed. Crude 
response rates and difference between treatment arms will be presen ted with their 
corresponding 95% CI estimates calculated using the score test method (50). 
For quantitative assay data, graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions 
by antigen, treatment arm, and timepoint will be made. For all primary and 
secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots of estimated reverse 
cumu lative distribution curves will be used for graphical display of all of the 
study arms.  
Mean or median (if normality assumption severely violated) assay readouts will 
be compared between arms and bootstrap CIs will be estimated.  
More sophisticated analys es employing repeated measures methodology (for 
example, linear mixed models  or marginal mean models fit by generalized 
estimating equations) may be utilized to incorporate immune responses over 
several timepoints and to test for differences over time . 
6.4.4.2  Multivariate display of immunogenicity endpoints  
Data visualization techniques may be used to explore the relationship among 
immunogenicity readouts. The  set of readouts may be based on the set of primary 
endpoints, or on immunogenicity endpoints that also  include secondary or 
exploratory endpoints. To understand the relationship between pairs of readouts, 
scatter plots may be used when the number of readouts is small or for a larger 
number of readouts, a heatmap showing the degree of correlation between an y 
two pairs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and associated ‘b iplots’ of the 
scores and loadings are particularly useful to understand associations between 
readouts, especially when readouts are correlated  (51). PCA is a method to reduce 
the dimensionality of the number of readouts to a smaller set of values (principal 
components) that are normalized linear combinations of the readouts in such a 
way that the first principal component accounts for the most variability in the data 
and subsequent components, while maximizing variability, are uncorrelated with 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 45 of 131 each other. A ‘biplot’ displays the first and second principal component scores 
and principal component loadings. The x -axis is the  value from the first principal 
component and the y -axis is the second principal component, where each axis 
label includes the percentage of variation in the total set of readouts captured by 
the principal component. The top axis is the first principal com ponent loadings 
and the right axis is the second principal component loadings. An arrow is drawn 
for each immunogenicity readout (eg , Env-specific CD4+ T cell  polyfunctionality 
score, Env-specific CD8 + T cell  total magnitude) from the origin to the point 
defined by its first two principal component loadings. The length of the arrow 
represents the amount of total variation of the set of readouts captured by the 
given readout. The direction of an arrow conveys the extent to which the variation 
of a readout is  in the direction of the first or second principal component. The 
angle between two arrows conveys information about the correlation of the two 
readouts, with a zero degree angle denoting perfect correlation and a 90 degree 
angle denoting no correlation. E ach arrow on the biplot is labeled by the 
immunogenicity readout it represents. A biplot is annotated with key meta -
information such as the treatment arm (most common application) or a 
demographic category. Depending on the application, K -means clustering and 
hierarchical clustering may also be applied for multivariate graphical display of 
immunogenicity readouts.  
6.4.4.3  Analysis of multiplexed immunoassay data  
Two approaches will be considered to evaluate the magnitude and breadth of 
these responses. First, M-B curves maybe employed to display individual - and 
group -level response breadth as a function of magnitude. Two choices are to 
compare the M -B curves among vaccine arms, as follows: a non -parametric 
Wilcoxon rank sum test on the subject -specific area -under-the M -B curve (AUC -
MB) or a Kolmogorov -Smirnov type test on the 2 group -average M -B curves. 
Simulations can be used to obtain 2 -sided p -values for the latter test.  Second, a 
weighted -average score -like variable may be constructed to account for the 
correlations between analytes as an integrate magnitude of responses to multiple 
analytes. Similar group comparison methods described in the first approach may 
be adopted. Details of either approach will be described in the SAP.  
6.4.4.4  Analysis of neutralization mag nitude -breadth curves  
The area -under -the-magnitude -breadth curve (AUC -MB) to the panel of isolates 
will be computed for each participant with evaluable neutralization data, as 
described in  Huang et al. (52). Methods for comparing AUC -MB are similar to 
those described in  Section  6.4.4.3 . 
6.4.4.5  Analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response as measured by the ICS 
assay 
The analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell response rates as measured by the ICS 
assay will be evaluated and compared as described under the general approach. 
For each T -cell subset, the positivity call for each peptide pool  will include  a 
multiple comparison  adjustment for the number of peptide pools used in the 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 46 of 131 assay.  In general, the Mixture Models for Single -cell Assays (MIMOSA) 
statistical framework  (53) and/or the Fisher’s exact test -based p ositivity criteria 
will be used. Details of the positivity criteria will be discussed in the SAP. The 
magnitude of marginal response will be analyzed as described for quantitative  
data in the general approach section. For each T -cell subset, graphs will be  used to 
display the background -subtracted magnitudes for each participant by protein, 
treatment arm and timepoint. When 3 or more cytokines are being measured by 
the ICS assay, the polyfunctionality of ICS responses may also be analyzed as an 
exploratory endpoint. Besides descriptive plots of the magnitude of polyfunctional 
responses, the COMPASS ( Com binatorial Polyfunctionality a nalysis of Antigen -
Specific T -cell Subsets ) statistical framework  (54) may also be used to perform 
joint modelling of multiple T -cell subsets of different cytokine combinations. For 
example, the functionality score (FS) and the polyfunctionality score (PFS) may 
be used to summarize the multi -parameter ICS respon ses.  
6.4.5  Analyses and data sharing prior to end of scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should 
not compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety 
or immunogenic ity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses 
by treatment assignment require careful consideration and should be made 
available on a need to know basis in accordance with Section  6.4.5.1 . Interim 
blinded safety and immunogenicity data should not be shared outside of the SMB, 
HVTN 123  PSRT, the protocol team leadership, the HVTN Executive 
Management Team, the study product developer, and the study sponsor and/or its 
designee(s) for their regulatory reporting unless approved by the protocol 
leadership and the HVTN leadership . 
6.4.5.1  Safety  analyses  
During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every 4 months for review by the SMB. Ad hoc safety reports may 
also be prepared for SMB review at the request of the HVTN 123  PSRT. Refer to 
the process described in the  HVTN Unblinding MOP for any requests for 
unblinded safety data prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.

Participants will be healthy, HIV  uninfected (sero negative) adults who 
comprehend the purpose of the study and have provided written informed consent. 
Volunteers will be recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. F inal 
eligibility determination will depend on  information available at the time of 
enrollment, including  results of screening laboratory tests, medical history, 
physical examinations, and answers to self -administered and/or interview 
questions.  
Investigat ors should always use good clinical judgment in considering a 
volunteer’s overall fitness for trial participation. Some volunteers may not be 
appropriate for enrollment even if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Medical, psychiatric, occupational,  or other conditions may make evaluation of 
safety and/or immunogenicity difficult, and some volunteers may be poor 
candidates for retention.

7.3 Participant depa rture from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the study product 
administration  schedule. Pause rules for the trial are described in Section  11.3. 
7.3.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be 
delayed. The factors to be considered in such a decision include but are no t 
limited to the following:  
• Within 45 days prior to any study injection   
▪ Receipt of b lood products or immunoglobulin  
• Within 30  days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of l ive attenuated vaccines  
▪ Receipt of a llergy treatment with antigen injections  
• Withi n 14 days prior to any study injection  
▪ Receipt of any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines (eg, 
pneumococcal)  
• Prevaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask 
assessment of vaccine reaction.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 54 of 131 Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified 
in the HVTN 123  Study Specific Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who 
plan to receive lic ensed vaccines  or allergy treatments should be counseled to 
schedule receipt of these substances, when possible, outside the intervals 
indicated above. The effects of these substances on safety and immunogenicity 
assessments and their interactions with stu dy vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if 
circumstances allow, these substances should also be avoided in the 2 week  
interval between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 week  
postvaccination follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination sche dule 
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. 
If a participant misses a vaccination and the visit window period for the 
vaccination has passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should 
be asked to con tinue study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination 
schedule with the next vaccination unless there are circumstances that require 
further delay or permanent discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 
7.3.3 ).  
7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain ci rcumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be 
permanently discontinued. Specific events that will result in stopping a 
participant’s vaccination schedule include:  
• Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare 
excepti ons allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with 
the unanimous consent of the HVTN 123  PSRT)  
• Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system 
or for which continued vaccin ations and/or blood draws may pose additional 
risk), including but not limited to the following:  
▪ Pregnancy (regardless of outcome)  
▪ HIV infection  
▪ Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, lab abnormality, or 
AE that is subsequently considered to  be related to vaccination  
▪ Any grade 3 lab abnormality that is subsequently considered to be related 
to vaccination  
▪ Other grade 3 clinical AE that is subsequently considered to be related to 
vaccination with the exception of fever, vomiting, and subjective  local and 
systemic symptoms. For grade 3 injection site erythema and/or induration, 
upon review, the PSRT may allow continuation of vaccination  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 55 of 131 ▪ SAE that is subsequently considered to be related to vaccination  
▪ Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity  reaction associated with 
study vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 123  PSRT is required 
prior to subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity 
reaction associated with study vaccination  
• Investigator dete rmination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, 
for repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions)  
Participants discontinuing study product for reasons other than HIV infection  
should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the s tudy and strongly 
encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol -related procedures per 
the protocol for the remainder of the trial, unless  medically contraindicated  (See 
HVTN 123 SSP) . 
Participants diagnosed with HIV infection during the study  should be encouraged 
to participate in follow -up visits as indicated in Section 9.13 
7.3.4  Participant termination from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an indivi dual participant may be terminated from 
participation in this study. Specific events that will result in early termination 
include:  
• Participant refuses further participation,  
• Participant relocates and remote follow -up or transfer to another HVTN CRS 
is not  possible,  
• HVTN CRS determines that the participant is lost to follow -up, or 
• Investigator decides, in consultation with Protocol Team leadership, to 
terminate participation (eg, if participant exhibits inappropriate behavior 
toward clinic staff).  
• Any condi tion where termination from the study is required by applicable  
regulations.

HVTN 123, Version 1 .0 / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 59 of 131 Any administrator of study product will be blinded to the individual participant's 
treatment assignm ent.  
When preparing a dose in a syringe and administering the dose, consideration 
should be given to the volume of solution in the needle before and after the dose 
is administered. Particularly, if the needle used to withdraw the product is 
replaced prior  to vaccine administration, consideration should be given to 
conserving the full dose of product. The pharmacy and clinic staff members are 
encouraged to work together to administer the dose specified in the protocol.  
Group 1 (T1):  
100 mcg of Stable CH505T F gp120 admixed with 10 mcg of GLA -SE, to be

Months 0, 2, and 6.  
8.5 Acquisition of study products  
Stable CH505 TF gp120 , Transient CH505 TF gp120 , and GLA -SE will be 
provided by DAIDS.  Sodium Chloride for injection, 0.9% USP will not be 
provided through the  protocol and must be obtained by the site.  
Once an HVTN CRS is protocol registered, the pharmacist can obtain study 
products from the NIAID Clinical Research Products Management Center 
(CRPMC) by following the ordering procedures outlined  in Pharmacy Guid elines 
and Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.  
8.6 Pharmacy records  
The HVTN CRS pharmacist is required to maintain complete records of all study 
products. The pharmacist of record is responsible for maintaining randomization 
codes and randomization confirmation notices for each participant in a secure 
manner.  
8.7 Final disposition of study products  
For US clinical  research sites, a ll unused study products must be returned to the 
CRPMC after the study is completed or terminated unless otherw ise instructed by 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018

Instructions for DAIDS Clinical Trials Networks.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 61 of 131 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedule of clinical procedures is shown in Appendix F  . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully 
understand what will and may happen to them while participating in a research 
study.  The HVTN in formed consent form documents that a participant (1) has 
been informed about the potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, 
and (2) is willing to participate in an HVTN study. Informed consent 
encompasses all written or verbal study info rmation HVTN CRS staff provide to 
the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff will obtain informed 
consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent process continues throughout the study. Key study co ncepts 
should be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be 
documented. At each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the 
procedures and requirements for that visit and for the remaining visits. 
Additionally, if any  new information is learned that might affect the participants ’ 
decisions to stay in the trial, this information will be shared with trial participants. 
If necessary, participants will be asked to sign revised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ  recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting. For example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen 
people before they come to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants must 
sign a screening or protocol -specific consent befo re any procedures are performed 
to determine eligibility. HVTN CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening 
materials to their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  for human subjects protection 
review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registrat ion Manual, an RE is “Any 
group other than the local IRB/EC responsible for reviewing and/or approving a 
clinical research protocol and site -specific informed consent forms  prior to 
implementation at a site.” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requiremen ts of 
their applicable REs.  
9.1.1  Screening consent form  
Without a general screening consent, screening for a specific study cannot take 
place until the site receives protocol registration from the DAIDS RSC Protocol 
Registration Office . 
Some HVTN CRSs have appr oval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  to 
use a general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV 
vaccine trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can continually screen potential 
participants and, when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 62 of 131 enrollment consent.  Sites conducting general screening or prescreening approved 
by their IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may use the results from this screening to 
determine eligibility for this protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the 
time periods specified in the  eligibility criteria.  
9.1.2  Protocol -specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used and all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. 
A sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is located in  
Appendix A . A separate sample consent form for other uses of specimens is 
located in  Appendix C . 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developing a protocol -specific consent 
form (s) for local use, based on the sample protocol -specific consent form s in 
Appendix A  and Appendix C . The consent form (s) must be developed in 
accordance with requirements of the following : 
• CRS’s IRB/EC  and any applicable RE s, 
• CRS’s institution, and  
• Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 
21 CFR, Part 50, and in the ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -
specific consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, 
issues of cultural competence, local language considerations, and the level of 
understandability.  
The sample informed c onsent form s include instructions throughout the document 
for developing specific content.  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the 
current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.  
9.1.3  Assessment of Understandin g 
Study staff are responsible for ensuring that participants fully understand the 
study before enrolling them. This process involves reviewing the informed 
consent form with the participant, allowing time for the participant to reflect on 
the procedures an d issues presented, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant ’s 
understanding of key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must 
complete the Assessment of Understanding before enrollment. Staff may provide 
assistance in reading and understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 63 of 131 Participants must verbalize understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. 
This process and the participant ’s understanding of the key co ncepts should be 
recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE  may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the 
Assessment of Understanding. The consent process (including the use of the 
Assessment of Understanding) should be explained thoro ughly to the IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE , whose recommendations should be followed.  
9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits, up to and 
including before vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion crit eria must 
be assessed within 56 days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the 
eligibility criteria (or below in this section).  
After the appropriate informed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, 
the following procedures are performe d: 
• Medical history, documented in the case history record  
• Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection  
• Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and 
clinical assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and thr oat; neck; lymph nodes; 
heart; chest; abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin  
• Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topical products, 
alternative/complementa ry medicines (eg, herbal and health food 
supplements), recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots  
• Laboratory tests including:  
▪ Screening HIV test,  
▪ HBsAg,  
▪ Anti-HCV antibodies,  
▪ CBC with differential and platelets,  
▪ Chemistry panel (ALT, AST, alkaline  phosphatase, and creatinine),  
▪ Urine dipstick (as described in Section  9.8), and 
▪ Urine or serum pregnancy test (participants who were assigned female  sex 
at birth )  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 64 of 131 • Syphilis test  
• Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NIH Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 
2001 (available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-
053.html ) 
• Behavio ral risk assessment  
• Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ’s current 
guidelines or other local guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as 
described in Section  9.6 
• Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may 
not be enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception 
and pregnancy status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of 
pregnancy prevention includes advising a participant who was assigned  
female sex at birth and who reports no current sexual activity that could lead 
to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to begin ad equate birth 
control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the participant 
becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant becoming 
pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN study  
If a participant screens for  an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does 
not join that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the 
screening for this protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant 
consent, the participant has signed a consent f orm to begin screening for this 
study, and the tests were conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria ( see Section s 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.3 Enrollment and vaccination visits  
Enrollment is simultaneous with first vaccination. The HVTN CRS requests the 
randomization assignment  via a Web -based randomization system. In general, t he 
time interval between randomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working 
days. However, c ircumstances may require a participant’s enrollment visit to be 
changed. This may exceed the 4 -day randomiza tion time limit.  
At all vaccination visits, the following procedures are performed before 
vaccination:  
• Abbreviated physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a 
symptom -directed evaluation by history and/or appropriate physical exam 
based on participant self -reported symptoms or complaints;  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018

Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list , and if results 
indicate that vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered 
(see Section s 8.3 and 8.4). 
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for 
observation. An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of 30 minutes 
after injection, with an acceptable range of 25 -60 minutes. Before leaving the 
clinic, the  participant is given the Participant Diary  and is instructed on how to 
complete it. The site will make arrangements to be in contact with the participant 
during the reactogenicity period (as described in Section  9.9). 
The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These 
procedures may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
• Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section  9.6);  
• Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section  9.2 and 9.7); and  
• Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask participant 
about  the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced 
any new social impacts as a result of the trial participation).

9.5 AESI  health contact  
CRS staff will contact study participants 18 months after enrollment to collect the 
information listed below. Clinic visits will only be required if HIV confirmatory 
testing is necessary ( see Section  9.6.1 ); however, a clinic visit may be arranged 
for other reasons.  
• Confirmation of vital status; if deceased, attempt to learn cause and date of 
death;

is provided in  Appendix H . AESI are reported regardless of relationship to 
study product(s);  
▪ New diagnosis of HIV infection; and  
▪ Pregnancies and outcomes, including congenital anomalies/birth defects.  
All such events will be recorded, and AEs will be assessed for relationship to 
study product(s).   
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 68 of 131 9.5.1  Interim contacts  
CRSs may report safety information obtained at a contact other than the annual 
contact. These contacts are reported as interim visits.  
9.6 HIV co unseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC ’s guidelines or 
other local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be 
performed in accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm following 
enrol lment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV 
infection and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive 
due to the vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV antibody 
testin g outside of the HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during 
study participation and/or during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study participants of the likelihood 
of routine HIV t esting being offered or performed outside the study CRS at 
emergency rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more 
likely due to the CDC ’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, as well 
as policy changes in many countries to  make HIV testing more frequent and 
routine. CRS staff should inform participants of their right to opt out of HIV 
testing outside the study site. CRS staff should inform study participants if local 
and/or state policies and regulations permit medical prov iders to perform HIV 
testing without first informing patients. If this is the case, then CRS staff should 
advise study participants that they may decline testing preemptively. CRS staff 
should also inform participants if positive results must  be reported to local public 
health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of the need to 
maintain study blinding by getting HIV testing only at the study CRS. CRS staff 
should provide participants with CRS contact information and should en courage 
participants to ask medical providers to contact the CRS. The CRS can verify that 
the participant is in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the 
study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as being HIV -infected during screeni ng are not 
enrolled. Potential and enrolled participants identified as being HIV-infected will 
be referred for medical treatment, counseling, and management of the HIV 
infection. Participants who are found to be  HIV-infected after enrollment will not 
recei ve any additional study product but will continue to be followed in the study 
for safety assessments. These individuals may also be referred to appropriate 
ongoing clinical trials or observational studies.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 69 of 131 9.6.1  Distinguishing intercurrent HIV infection from vac cine-induced 
positive serology  
The study product may elicit an antibody response to HIV proteins. Therefore, 
vaccine -induced positive serology may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection f rom vaccine -
induced positive serology. These precautionary measures include:  
• Participants will have physical examinations at visits specified in Appendix F . 
Signs or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness 
consistent with HIV -1 infection, or probable HIV exposure would prompt a 
diagnostic workup per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute 
Infection Testing to determine HIV infection . 
• HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study 
(see Appendix F ). The Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic 
laboratory) will follo w the HVTN HIV testing algorithm  (see Study Specific 
Procedures (SSP) ), which is able to distinguish vaccine -induced antibody 
responses from actual HIV infections.  
• All participants can receive HIV -1 diagnostic testing from the site following 
their last sc heduled visit until they are told that they did not receive an HIV 
vaccine or that they do not have vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
• All participants who received vaccine product and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as meas ured by the standard anti -
HIV antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be offered 
poststudy HIV -1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing 
algorithm) periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated 
(approximately every 6 months)  unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer 
the standard test in clinical settings .  
9.6.2  VISP registry  
Experimental HIV vaccines may induce antibody production to HIV antigens, 
producing reactive results on commercially available  HIV test kits. This is called 
“vaccine -induced seropositivity” (VISP) (see Section 9.6.1 ). In order to provide 
poststudy HIV testing to distinguis h between VISP and HIV infection, and to 
mitigate potential social harms resulting from VISP in HIV vaccine recipients 
who are not infected with HIV, the HVTN has created a VISP registry. Following 
study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff  to verify that an individual 
has received an HIV vaccine, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Information in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry 
exists to support provision o f post study testing and counseling servic es to HIV 
vaccine recipients.  The registry contains the names of all study participants, 
unless they request that their names be removed.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 70 of 131 9.7 Contraception status  
Contraception status is assessed and documented at every scheduled clinic visit 
for a participant  who was assigned  female sex at birth and who is sexually active 
in a way that could cause that participant to become pregnant. Prior to enrollment 
and throughout the study, staff will ask participants to verbally confirm their use 
of adequate contraceptiv e methods. A participant who was assigned  female sex at 
birth and is sexually active in a way that could cause that participant to become 
pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the importance of 
using contraception and should be refe rred to specific counseling, information, 
and advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in Section  
7.1). This reminder shoul d be documented in the participant ’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including having reached menopause (no menses for 1 
year) or having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal 
ligation —must be documented in the participant ’s study  record.  
9.8 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is 
performed on urine obtained by clean catch.  
If the screening dipstick is tran siently abnormal due to menses or infection, 
document this issue in the participant ’s source documentation. For infection, 
provide appropriate treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the 
dipstick and, if within the eligibility limits specif ied in the protocol, the 
participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be deferred if a participant is menstruating, but 
should be performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnormal due 
to a participant ’s menstrual period, docume nt in the comment section of the case 
report form (CRF) and repeat the dipstick once the participant is no longer 
menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is not required.  
9.9 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed befor e and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicity symptoms 
are followed until resolution and graded according to the Division of AIDS 
(DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse Events , 
Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017, except as noted in Section  11.2.2 . 
The reactogenicity assessment period is 7 full days following each vaccination per 
the assessment schedule shown in Table 9-1. Participants are instructed to record 
symptoms using a Participa nt Diary . Contacts between the participant and the site 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 71 of 131 staff should take place at least once between 1 -3 days postvaccination . In general, 
a participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is 
seen by a clinician within 48 hours  after onset, unless the reaction is improving 
and/or has completely resolved. Clinic staff will follow new or unresolved 
reactoge nicity symptoms present at day 7  to resolution.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of 
assessment in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of 
systemic and local symptoms, and vaccine -related lesions. Events not listed on a 
CRF, or with an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period (day of 
vaccination and 7 full days after), or those meeting SAE/ AEs requiring expedited 
reporting to DAIDS criteria, are recorded on an adverse experience log form.

9.9.1  Assessment of syste mic and local symptoms  
Systemic symptoms include increased body temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, 
myalgia, headache, chills, arthralgia, and nausea. Local symptoms include pain 
and/or tenderness at the injection site. The daily maximum severity reached for 
each symptom during the assessment period is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by oral or infrared thermometry . All temperatures 
must be measured by non -axillary thermometry. This includes temperatures taken 
in the clinic, as well as temperatures  taken by participants during the 
reactogenicity period.  
Temperature is  reported in degrees Celsius. If temperature is measured in 
Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be documented in the participant ’s 
chart note. A measurement is taken once daily  during the assessment period and 
should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
9.9.2  Assessment of injection site  
Typical injection site reactions are erythema/ redness and induration/swelling. The 
maximum diameter  for all injection site reactions are r ecorded.  
All injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Reactions with 
diameters  greater than 5 cm are followed daily; otherwise, the frequency of 
follow -up is based on clinician judgment.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 72 of 131 9.10 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are def ined in HVTN 123  SSP. For a visit not performed within 
the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the missed visit is one 
that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN CRS staff should 
attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of  HIV testing, 
these procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if 
clinically indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by the 
study staff. Blood samples for immunogenicity assays are not typically collect ed 
at interim visits.  
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section  7.3.2  and Section  
7.3.3  for resolution.  
9.11 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff should consider if the 
following assessments are appropriate: a final physical examinat ion, clinical 
laboratory tests (including urine dipstick, CBC with differential  and platelets , and 
chemistry panel), pregnancy testing, social impact assessment, and HIV test.  For 
participants who have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, see Section 9.13 
9.12 Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study, no more 
injections of study product will be given, but remaining  visits and study 
procedures should be completed unless medically contraindicated  or applicable  
regulations require termination from the study. If the participant terminates from 
the study prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should make every effort to 
keep in touch with the participant in order to ascertain the pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes will be reported.  
9.13 HIV infection during the study  
If a participant becomes HIV -infected during the course of the study, no 
additional study product will be admin istered. Participants will be encouraged to 
continue scheduled study visits for up to 6 months following their last study 
product administration. Follow -up duration for participants diagnosed with HIV 
infection may be adjusted in consultation with the CRS investigator and the 
HVTN 123 PSRT (eg, to avoid interference with participant initiation of HIV 
treatment). At post -infection follow -up visits, only specimens required for 
protocol -specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 73 of 131 collected; in addition, some clinic procedures may be modified or discontinued 
(see Appendix E  and Appendix F ). 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 74 of 131 10 Laboratory  
10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN 123 Site Lab Instructions  and SSP provide further guidelines for 
operational issues concerning the clinical and processing laboratories. These 
document s include guidelines for general specimen collection, special 
considerations for phlebotomy , specimen labeling , whole blood processing,  HIV 
screening/diagnostic testing,  and general screening and safety testing.  
Tube types for blood collection are specified in Appendix E . For tests performed 
locall y, the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood collection tubes may be redirected to another 
laboratory or may require study -specific processing techniques. In these cases, 
laboratory special instructions will be post ed on the protocol -specific section of 
the HVTN website.  
Of note, all assays described below are performed as research assays to evaluate 
the ability of the vaccine to induce immune responses in the context of the 
participants’ genetic background, and are not approved for use in medical care. 
Results from these assays are not made available to participants or medical 
professionals to guide treatment decisions.  
10.2 Total blood volume  
Required blood volumes per visit are shown in Appendix E . Not shown is any 
additional blood volume that would be required if a safety lab needs to be 
repeated, or if a serum pregnancy test needs to be performed. The additional 
blood volume wo uld likely be minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each 
participant will not exceed 500 mL in any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
10.3 Immunogenicity timepoint s 
The immunogenicity timepoint s in this study occur : 2 week s after the 2nd 
vaccination visit , 2 week s after the 3rd vaccination visit , 3 months  after the 3rd 
vaccination visit , and 6 months  after the 3rd vaccination visit. Endpoint assays for 
humoral and cellular responses are performed on samples collected from 
participants at the immunogenicity timepoin ts and may be performed on samples 
collected at baseline. Depending on the initial results , assays for humoral and 
cellular responses may be performed on samples collected from participants at 
other timepoints; the schedule is shown in Appendix E . 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 75 of 131 10.4 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.4.1  Flow cytometry : ICS 
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+ T -cell responses 
following stimulation of  peripheral blood mononu clear cells ( PBMCs ) with 
synthetic HIV peptides that span the proteins  encoded by the vaccine . ICS 
parameters will include cytokines such as  interferon ( IFN)-γ, interleukin ( IL)-2, 
and tumor necrosis factor (T NF)-α, and may include other cytokines  (such as  
cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses ) to identify T cells of specific 
functionality . Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ T cells responding to 
a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, or functional 
markers may also be analyzed.  
10.4.2  Flow cytometry: antigen -specific B cell phenotyping assay  
Antigen -specific B cells induced by vaccination will be identified and 
characterized using fluorescently -labeled recombinant proteins in combination 
with a flow cytometry phenotypi ng panel. In particular, HIV Env -reactive B cells 
will be enumerated and may be further characterized for expression of memory, 
activation, inhibitory or other markers of interest . B cells may also be sorted for 
further analysis by BCR  sequencin g or gene e xpression analysis.  B cells may 
instead be cultured for detection of and functional testing of secreted antibodies 
by ELISA or microneutralization assays, and/or BCR sequencing.  
10.4.3  BCR repertoire analysis  
Single or bulk populations of naïve or memory B cells,  or plasmablasts, may be 
sorted for any combination of BCR sequencing, gene expression analysis, or 
functional antibody testing by microneutralization or binding assays.  
10.5 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.5.1  Binding antibody multiplex assay  (BAMA)  
HIV-1–specific total binding IgG antibodies to CH505TF gp120 and a panel of 
heterologous gp120s will be assessed on serum samples from study participants 
taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s and baseline.  In addition, HIV -1–
specific total binding IgA antibodies and b inding to IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3, and IgG4) may also be assessed.  Specimens from other timepoints may also 
be assayed based on the results of the initial assay.   
10.5.2  Neutralizing antibody  (nAb)  assay  
HIV-1–specific nAb assays will be performed on serum samples from study 
participants taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint s. Specimens from the 
baseline and other timepoints may also be analyzed at the discretion of the HVTN 
HVTN 12 3, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 76 of 131 Laboratory Program, which may be continge nt on the results of the primary 
immunogenicity timepoint s. The TZM -bl assay will test neutralization of the 
vaccine strains (CH505TF, CH505.w4.3 ) and a single highly  neutralization -
sensitive Tier 1 virus as a positive control. The global panel and/or clad e-specific 
panels may be used to assess Tier 2 neutralization  (55, 56) . 
10.5.3  Antibody avidity  
Antibody avidity will be measured using BAMA with the addition of a 
dissociation step to calculate the avidity index or by surface plasmon resonance 
assay.   
10.6 Genotyping  
Molecular human leukocyte antigen (HLA) t yping may be performed on enrolled 
participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at baseline, initially on 
specimens from participants who demonstrate vaccine -induced T -cell responses at 
postvaccination timepoints. Other participants (including control r ecipients) may 
be HLA -typed to support future studies of immunological interest at the discretion 
of the HVTN Laboratory Program. Other genes , including those  associated with 
immune responses (eg, immunoglobulin or T -cell receptor genes) or HIV -1 
disease p rogression  may also be assessed .  
10.7 Lab assay algorithm  
The Lab Assay Algorithm lists assays to characterize cellular, humoral, and innate 
immune responses as well as host genetics that may be conducted to determine 
endpoints in HVTN vaccine trials.  The type  of assay(s) employed will be 
dependent on the response obtained by the primary immunog enicity assays at 
relevant time points.  Please note that the Lab Assay Algorithm will be updated 
periodically to include new assays.  
10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be us ed for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved 
samples may be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and 
validation of existing or newly developed me thods.   
10.9 Specimen storage and o ther use of specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a 
participant requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by IRB/EC, or RE.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 77 of 131 Other use of specimens is defined as studies not covered by  the protocol  or the 
informed consent form  for the main study  (see Appendix A ). 
This research may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and oth er 
diseases. This could include genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. 
This research is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed 
consent form, or as otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other research  on 
specim ens (“other use”) will occur only after review and approval by the HVTN, 
the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the specimens, and the CRS’s 
IRBs/ECs/REs if required.  
As part of consenting for the study, participants document their initial decision to 
allow or not allow their specimens to be used in other research, and they may 
change their decision at any time. The participant’s initial decision about other 
use of their specimens, and any later change to that decision, is recorded by their 
CRS in a Web -based tool that documents their current decisions for other use of 
their specimens. The HVTN will only allow other research to be done on 
specimens from participants who allow such use.  
CRSs must notify HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local gov ernmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on specimen storage or 
other use of specimens.  
10.10  Biohazard containment  
As the transmission of HIV and other blood -borne pathogens can occur through 
contact with contaminated needles, blood, a nd blood products, appropriate 
precautions will be employed by all personnel in the drawing of blood and 
shipping and handling of all specimens for this study, as currently recommended 
by the CDC and the NIH or other applicable agencies.  
All dangerous goods materials, including Biological Substances, Category A or 
Category B, must be transported according to instructions detailed in the 
International Air Transport Association Dangerous Goods Regulations.

The roles and responsibilities of the SDMC in relation to safety monitoring 
include:  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2 018 
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 79 of 131 • Maintaining a central database management system for HVTN clinical data;  
• Providin g reports of clinical data to appropriate groups such as the HVTN 123  
PSRT and HVTN SMB (see Section 11.1.2); 
11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
• Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause and 
HVTN 123  PSRT AE review criteria (see Section  11.3); 
• Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses or planned holds 
are instituted and lifted (see Section 11.3); 
• Querying HVTN CRSs for additional information regarding reported clinical 
data; and  
• Providing support to the HVTN 123  PSRT.  
11.2 Safety reporting  
11.2.1  Submission of safety forms to SDMC  
Site staff must submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, adverse experience, 
urinalysis, local lab results, and concomitant medications) before the end of the 
next business day , excluding federal or bank holidays . The forms should not be 
held in anticipation  of additional information at a later date. If additional 
information is received at a later date, the forms should be updated and 
resubmitted  before the end of the next business day after receiving the new 
information.  For the case of a longer site holida y closure, site staff must submit 
the data by the end of the 5th day (local time) after receiving the information even 
if this day is a holiday.  
For example: If the site becomes aware of an AE on Thursday (Day 0), the site 
must submit the data by the end of the next business day, on Friday. If there is a 
longer site holiday closure, then this AE must be reported no later than the end of 
the fifth day, Monday (Day 4). If Monday is a holiday as well, all safety forms 
still need to be submitted by the end of Monday (Day 4).  
11.2.2  AE reporting  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant 
administered a study product/procedure(s) and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational study 
product/procedure(s), whether or not related to the investigational study 
product/procedure(s).  All AEs are graded according to the Division of AIDS  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 80 of 131 (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adul t and Pediatric Adverse Events , 
Corrected Version 2.1, July 2017 , available on the RSC website at 
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -adverse -event -grading -
tables , except : 
• Unintentional  Weight Loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is 
considered to be potentially deleterious to the participant’s health  (see HVTN 
123 Study Specific Procedures ); 
• Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling 
will not consider interference with usual social and functional activities such 
that: 
• Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter OR 6.25 to < 25 cm2 surface area;  
• Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 25 to < 100 cm2 surface area;  
• Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 100 cm2 surface area OR Ulceration OR 
Secondary infection OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;  
• Grade 4 is:  Potentially l ife-threatening consequences (eg , absc ess, exfoliative 
dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue);  
During the main study period (see Section 3) all AEs are reported to the SDMC 
on the appr opriate CRF. Clinic staff should evaluate every AE to determine if (1) 
the AE meets the requirements for expedited reporting to DAIDS ( see Section  
11.2.3 ) and (2) if the AE meets the criteria for a prompt AE review ( see Section  
11.3). 
After the main study period , report the subset of AEs bulle ted in Section 9.5 until 
the AESI health contact (see Section 3) is complete . 
Sites are expected to notify HVTN clini cal safety staff of any serious safety 
concern requiring their attention ( Table 11-1). Telephone numbers and email 
addresses are found on the protocol home page on th e HVTN Members’ site 
(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn 123). Concerns requiring immediate 
attention should be communicated by calling the clinical  safety phone.  
In the case of email notification, clinical safety staff will reply during working 
hours (local time) to confirm that the email has been received and reviewed. If 
email service is not available, the CRS should notify clinical safety staff of the 
event by telephone, then submit CRFs.  
In addition, site investigators are required to submit AE inf ormation in accordance 
with IRB/EC and any applicable RE  requirements.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 81 of 131 11.2.3  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AEs are 
outlined in Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedite d Reporting of 
Adverse Events  to DAIDS  (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC 
website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/manual -expedited -
reporting -adverse -events -daids . The SAE Reporting Category will be used for this 
study.  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Experience  Reporting System (DAERS) must 
be used for expedited AE (EAE) reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system 
outages or technical difficulties, EAE reports may be submitted via the DAIDS 
EAE Form.  This form is availab le on the DAIDS RSC website at 
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/paper -eae-reporting . 
For questions about DAERS, please contact  CRMSsupport@niaid.nih.gov  or 
from withi n the DAERS application itself.  
For questions about EAE reporting, please  contact the DAIDS RSC Safety Office 
at (DAIDSRSCSafetyOffice@tech -res.com) . 
The study products for which expedited reporting are required are :  
• Stable CH505TF HIV gp120 with GLA -SE 
• Transient CH505TF HIV gp120 with GLA -SE 
While the participant is in the main study reporting period ( see Section 3), the 
SAE Reporting Category will be used.   
After completion of  the main study period through completion of the AESI health 
contact (see Section  3) the SUSAR Reporting Category will be used . 
After the participant has completed the AESI  health contact and is off study, sites 
must report SUSARS if the study site staff becomes aware of the events on a 
passive basis (eg, from publicly available information).  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Reports).  However, because safety is  a primary study endpoint, the study 
sponsor Medical Officer will not routinely be unblinded to study treatment 
assignment when there is an assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the study 
product(s); and the safety report will be sent to the FDA based on the blinded 
attribution assessment.  
In some cases,  the PSRT or CRS may believe unblinding of the site PI and 
participant would be appropriate to facilitate the clinical management of an AE or 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 82 of 131 SAE. The HVTN MOP specifies procedures for emergency unblindi ng, and for 
early unblinding for medical reasons.  
11.3 Safety pause and prompt PSRT AE review  
When a trial is placed on safety pause, all enrollment and vaccination with the 
product related to the event that triggered the pause will be held until further 
notic e. The AEs that will lead to a safety pause or prompt HVTN 123  PSRT AE 
review are summarized in Table 11-1. Vaccinations may be suspended for safety 
concerns other than those described in the table, or before pause rules are met, if, 
in the judgment of the HVTN 123  PSRT, participant safety may be threatened. 
Criteria for an individual participant’s departure from the schedule of vaccinations 
are listed in Section  7.3.

b Does not include the following Grade 3 subjective reactogenicity symptoms :injection site pain, tenderness, 
fatigue/malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, headac he, nausea  (unless IV rehydration required ). 
For all safety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 123  PSRT, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS 
Regulatory Affairs Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safet y and Pharmacovigilance Team 
(SPT), and participating HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety pause is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 123  PSRT reviews safety data and decides 
whether the  pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is 
appropriate, consulting the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core  notifies the 
participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS 
RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision regarding resumpt ion or discontinuation of 
study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 123  PSRT assessment, DAIDS RAB 
notifies the FDA as needed.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 83 of 131 If an immediate HVTN 123  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 123  PSRT AE 
review is triggered, HVTN Core  notifies the HVTN 123  PSRT as soon as possible 
during working hours ( local time )—or, if the information was received during off 
hours, by the m orning of the next workday. If a prompt HVTN 123  PSRT AE 
review cannot be completed within 72 hours of notification (excluding weekends 
and US federal holidays), an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit  to its IRB/EC and any applicable RE 
protocol -related safety information (such as IND safety reports, notification of 
vaccine holds due to the pause rules, unanticipated problem s involving risks to 
participants or others, and notification of othe r unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs 
must also follow all applicable RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed routinely by the HVTN 123  PSRT (see 
Section 11.4.2 ). 
11.4 Review of cumulative safety data  
Routine safety review occurs at the start of enrollment and then throughout the 
study.  
Reviews proceed from a standardized set of protocol -specific safety  data reports. 
These reports are produced by the SDMC and include queries to the HVTN CRSs. 
Events are tracked by internal reports until resolution.  
11.4.1  Daily review  
Blinded daily safety reviews are routinely conducted by HVTN Core for events 
requiring expedi ted reporting to DAIDS, and events that meet safety pause criteria 
or prompt HVTN 123  PSRT AE review criteria.  
11.4.2  Weekly review  
During the injection phase of the trial, the HVTN 123  PSRT review s clinical 
safety reports on a weekly basis and conduct s calls to review the data as 
appropriate. After the injections and the final 2 -week safety visits are completed, 
less frequent reporting and safety reviews may be conducted at the discretion of 
the HVTN 123  PSRT. HVTN Core  reviews reports of clinical and laboratory 
AEs. Events identified during the review that are considered questionable, 
inconsistent, or unexplained are referred to the HVTN CRS clinic coordinator for 
verification.  
11.5 Study termination  
This study may be terminated early by the determination of the HVTN 123  PSRT, 
a pertinent national regulatory authority, NIH, Office for Human Research

HVTN 123, Versi on 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 86 of 131 12.1 Social impacts  
Participants in this study risk experiencing discrimination or other persona l 
problems, resulting from  the study participation itself or from the development of 
VISP. The HVTN CRS is obliged to provide advocacy for and assistance to 
participants regarding these negative social impacts associated with the vaccine 
trial. If HVTN CRS  staff have questions regarding ways to assist a participant 
dealing with a social impact, a designated NIAID or HVTN Core representative 
can be contacted.  
Social harms are tabulated by the SDMC and are subjected to descriptive analysis. 
The goal is to re duce their incidence and enhance the ability of study staff to 
mitigate them when possible.  
Summary tables of social impact events will be generated weekly, and made 
available for review by the protocol chairs, protocol team leader, and the 
designated NIAI D representative . 
12.2 Emergency communication with study participants  
As in all clinical research, this study may generate a need to reach participants 
quickly to avoid imminent harm, or to report study findings that may otherwise 
concern their health or welfa re.  
When such communication is needed, the CRS will request that its IRB/EC and 
any applicable RE  expedite review of the message. If this review cannot be 
completed in a timeframe consistent with the urgency of the required 
communication, the site can contact the participant  without IRB/EC approval if 
such communication is necessary to avoid imminent harm to the study participant.  
The CRS must notify the IRB/EC and any applicable RE  of the matter as soon as 
possible.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this consent form or 
ask someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to 
sign or make your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will 
ask you questions to see if we have explained everythi ng clearly. You can also 
ask us questions about the study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research 
study is to answer scientific questions.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]  are doing a 
study to test HIV vaccines . HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
About 30 people will take part in this study at multiple sites. The researcher in 
charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert nam e of site PI] . The US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) is paying for the study.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
• Are the study vaccines  safe to give to people?  
• Are people able to take the study vaccines  without becoming too 
uncomf ortable?  
• How do people’s immune systems respond to the study vaccines ? (Your 
immune system protects you from disease.)  
• Does a small  difference in the way the 2 vaccines were made  change how 
people’ s immune systems respond?   
2. The study vaccines  cannot give y ou HIV.  
The study vaccines are  not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study 
vaccines  to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give HIV to someone 
else. 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 99 of 131 3. We do not know if the study vaccines  will decrease, increase, or not change 
your risk  of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Site: Any change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org.  You can remove the box around the text.  
Several studies have tested whethe r HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting 
HIV from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to 
have the same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one 
study, people who got the vaccine seemed to have a lower  risk of getting HIV 
than people who did not get the vaccine. In studies with a different vaccine, some 
people who got the vaccine had a higher  risk of getting HIV than people who did 
not get the vaccine.  
This study differs from the studies in which people who got the vaccine had a 
higher or lower risk of getting HIV. We can tell you about the differences.  
We do not know whether the vaccines  in this study will affect your risk of getting 
HIV from another p erson. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very 
important to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you 
how to avoid HIV.  
4. These  study vaccines are  experimental.  
The study vaccines are  protein vaccines called Stable C H505TF gp120 and 
Transient CH505TF gp120. From here on, we will call them  gp120S and gp120T 
study vaccines . They are  experimental HIV vaccines . That means we do not 
know if the vaccines  will be safe to use in people, or if they will work to prevent 
HIV inf ection. These vaccines are  used only in research studies.  
For both vaccines, first DNA is used in a lab to tell cells how to make the protein. 
The gp120S  vaccine was made by having the DNA that makes the protein become 
a part of the DNA of the cell. For th e gp120T  vaccine, the DNA that makes the 
protein was put into the cells, but did not become a part of the cell’s DNA. In both 
cases, after the protein is made, it is separated from the cells and purified into a 
vaccine.  
The vaccines were developed by the D ivision of AIDS (DAIDS) at the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH). The vaccines have man -made pieces of protein that 
look like part of the protein found in HIV. Your body’s immune system might 
learn to recognize these proteins and prepare itself to fight HIV. This is called an 
immune response.  
The vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance added to the 
vaccine to  help the immune system respond better. The adjuvant in this study is 
called GLA -SE. GLA -SE was made by Infectious Disease Re search Institute 
(Seattle, Washington, USA ). 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 100 of 131 The gp120S  and gp120 T vaccines are very similar  protein  vaccines  made in the 
laboratory in two slightly different ways.  
The gp120S  study vaccine has been tested in animals and it did not cause any 
health concerns . Anim al testing may not always tell u s what will happen with 
humans. It has been  given to about 42 people in another study that is ongoing  and 
has not caused serious health problems.  If we learn anything fro m that study that 
might affect your part icipation in this study , we will tell you.  
The gp120 T study vaccine has not been given to people before. Similar vaccines 
to those being used in this study have been given to thousands of people and have 
not cause d serious health problems .  
General risks o f vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, 
dizziness, and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or 
itching where you got the injection. Most people can still do their planned 
activit ies after getting a vaccine. Rarely, people have side effects that limit their 
normal activities or make them go to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or trouble 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you 
have ever had a bad reaction to any injection or vaccine.  
Very rarely, a vaccine causes an autoimmune disease in a person, or makes an 
autoimmune disease worse. An autoimmune disease happens when your immune 
system  attacks your own body, instead of attacking an infection.  
Risks of the study vaccines : 
This section lists the side effects we know about. There may be others that we 
don’t yet know about, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn about any 
new side eff ects. 
The gp120S vaccine with the GLA -SE adjuvant has been given to a small number 
of people in a study  that is still going on . The most common complaints have been  
pain or tenderness where they got the injection . One person had a skin infection 
where they  got the injection . It did not affect that person’s daily routine. That 
person took some medicine and it got better within 5 days.  
The gp120T  study vaccine has not been given to people before.  
The adjuvant, GLA -SE, has also been tested in over 900 people  with vaccines for 
other diseases. The most common complaints were pain and tenderness where 
they got the injection and feeling tired.

HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 101 of 131 Joining the study  
5. It is completely up to you whether or not to join the study.  
Take your time in deciding. If it helps, talk to people you trust, such as your 
doctor, friends or family. If you decide not to join this study, or if you leave it 
after you have joined, your other care at this clinic and the benefits or rights you 
would normally have will not be affected.  
If you  join this study, you may not be allowed to join other HIV vaccine or HIV 
prevention studies now or in the future. You cannot be in this study while you are 
in another study where you get a study product. Being in more than one study 
may not be safe.  
Also during the study, you should not donate blood or tissue.  
If you choose not to join this study, you may be able to join another study.  
Site: Remove item 6 if you use a separate screening consent that covers these 
procedures.  
6. If you want to join the study, we will screen you to see if you are eligible.  
Screening involves a physical exam, HIV test and health history. A physical exam 
may include, but is not li mited to:  
• Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
• Looking in your mouth and throat  
• Listening to your heart and lungs  
• Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood and urine tests. These tests tell us about some aspects of 
your health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We 
will also test you for: Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and syphilis . We will ask you about 
medications you are taking. We will ask you about behaviors that might put you 
at risk for gett ing HIV. If you were assigned  female  sex at birth , we will test you 
for pregnancy.  
We will review the screening results with you. The screening results may show 
you are not eligible to join the study, even if you want to.  
Site: adapt the following sectio n so it is applicable to the care available at your site . 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 102 of 131 7. If we find that you have a health problem during screening or during the 
study, we will tell you about the care that we can give here for free.  
For the care that we cannot give, we will explain how we will help you get care 
elsewhere. For health problems that are unrelated to the study, we will not pay for 
care.  
8. If you were assigned  female sex at birth and could become pregnant, you 
must agree to use birth control to join this study.  
Site: If you wan t to include Appendix B, Approved birth control methods (for sample 
informed consent form), in this consent form, paste it below and delete paragraph 
below.  
You should not become pregnant during the study because we do not know how 
the study vaccines  could  affect the developing baby. You must agree to use 
effective birth control from 21 days  before your first injection until 3 months after 
your last study injection. We  will talk to you about effective  birth control  
methods.  They are listed  on a handout  that we will give to you.  
Being in the study  
If you meet the study requirements and want to join, here is what will happen:  
9. You will come to the clinic for scheduled visits about [#] times over 
[Insert period of time] . 
Site: Insert number of visits and range of visit lengths. (There is site -specific variation 
in screening protocols and in the number of possible follow -up visits between 
protocol -mandated visits.)  
Visits can last from [#] to [#] hours.  
You may have to come for more visits if you have a lab or health issue.  
We may contact you after the main study ends (for example, to tell you about the 
study results).  
10. We will give you [Site: Insert compensa tion]  for each study visit you 
complete.  
This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert text]  
Site: Insert any costs to participants (eg, birth control costs for female participants 
who could become pregnant).  
US sites: Include the following paragraph . You can remove the box around the text.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 103 of 131 Payments you receive for being in the study may be taxable. We may need to ask 
you for your Social Security number for tax reasons.  
You do not have to pay anything to be in this study.  
11. We will give you either the gp120S study vaccine or the gp120T  study 
vaccine .  
Half the people in this study wil l get the gp120S study vaccine and half will get 
the gp120T  study vaccine . We will compare the results.  
Whether you get the gp120 S or gp120 T study vaccine  is completely random, like 
flipping a coin.  
We have no say in whether you get the gp120S or gp120 T study vaccine . We will 
not know which one you are getting, and neither will you. Only the pharmacist at 
this clinic will have this information w hile the study is going on.  
You will have to wait until everyone completes their final study visits to find out 
whether you got the gp120S or gp120 T study vaccine . This could be several 
years. But, if you have a serious medical problem and need to know wh at you got 
before the end of the study, we can tell you.  
12. We will give you the study products on a schedule.  
You will be in one of 2 groups. You will get 3  injections during the study in your  
upper arm.  
 Injection Schedule  
Group  First 
injection  2 month 
later 6months 
later 
1 gp120S  gp120S  gp120S  
2 gp120T  gp120T  gp120T  
You will have to wait in the clinic for about a half hour after each injection to see 
if there are any problems. Then for that night and for 7 more days, you will need 
to keep track of how you are feeling and if you have any symptoms. Within 3 
days of each injection, we will also ask you how you are doing. Contact the clinic 
staff if you have any issues or concerns after getting an injection. If you have a 
problem, we will continue to ch eck on you until it goes away.  
13. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
• Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to 
avoid getting HIV  
• Do physical exams  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 104 of 131 • Do pregnancy tests if you were assigned  female  sex at birth  
• Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking  
• Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from 
being in the study  
• Take urine and blood samples.  
When we take blood, the amount will depend on th e lab tests we need to do. It 
will be some amount between 10 mL and 275 mL ( 2 teaspoon s to a little over  1 
cup). Your body will make new blood to replace the blood we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate 
blood in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the 
example for cultural relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix D , Table of procedures (for informed consent form) in this 
section or distribute it as a separate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. 
You are not required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures 
and tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the results 
are important to your health, we will tell you.  
14. We will  counsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual 
behavior, alcohol, and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your 
risk of getting HIV low.  
15. The HVTN will test your samples t o see how your immune system responds 
to the study products.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by the HVTN 
for this study, which are located in the United States. In rare cases, some of your 
samples may be sent to labs approved  by the HVTN in other countries for 
research related to this study.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. 
Your genes are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look 
and how your body works. The d ifferences in people’s genes can help explain 
why some people get a disease while others do not. The genetic testing will only 
involve some of your genes, not all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
will study only the genes related to the immune system and HIV and those that 
affect how people get HIV.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 105 of 131 If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the 
virus found in your samples. The researchers will use this information to learn 
more about HIV and the study product(s) .  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
These tests done on your samples are for research purposes, not to check your 
health. The labs will not give the results to you or this clinic because their tests 
are not approved for use in making health care decisions. These labs are only 
approved to do research tests.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue 
to store them.

16. When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use 
them in other studies and share them with other researchers.  
The HVTN cal ls these samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your 
extra samples to be used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your 
decision at the end of this form. If you have any questions, please ask . 
Do I have to agree? No. You are free  to say yes or no, or to change your mind 
after you sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we 
have. Your decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative 
consequences here.   
Where are the samples store d? Extra samples are stored in a secure central place 
called a repository. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the 
United States.  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra 
samples will be stored. [Site:  Revise the previous sentence to insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, 
there is no plan to share any money with you. The researcher is not likely to ever 
know who you are.  
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or you r doctor. 
They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being done for 
research purposes.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 1 2, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 106 of 131 Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share 
your samples with HVTN or other researchers. Once we share your samples and  
information, we may not be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher 
wants to use your samples and information, their research plan must be approved 
by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by your institution’s 
IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs protect the 
rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan i s approved, the 
HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers? The samples and 
information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will not be part of the 
information. However, so me information that we share may be personal, such as 
your race, ethnicity, sex, health information from the study, and HIV status. We 
may share information about the study product you received and how your body 
responded to the study product.  
What kind o f studies might be done with my extra samples and information? The 
studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from you r samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them .  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researche rs 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researchers may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it , but your name and other personal information will not be included . 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk of this is very small.  There may be other unknown risks.  
Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra sa mples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your extra 
samples and information  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018

may do this even if you want to stay in the study and even if you were 
scheduled for more injections.  
This may happen if:  
• you do not follow instructions,  
• we think that staying in the study might harm you,  
• you enroll in a different research study where you get another study product, 
or 
• the study  is stopped for any reason.  
If we stop your injections, we may ask you to stay in the study to complete other

19. We will stop your injections if you become pregnant.  
We will encourage you to stay in the study if you choose. We will discuss your 
study options with you.  
If you leave the study while you are still pregnant, we will contact you after your 
due date to ask some questions about your pregnancy and delivery.  
20. If you get infected with HIV during the study, we will stop your injections, 
take fewer samples, and help you get care and support.  
We will encourage you to stay in the study for up to 6 months if you choose. We 
will discuss your study options with you. We will counsel you about your HIV 
infection and about telling your partner(s).  We will tell you where you can get 
support and medical care.  Site: Modify the following sentence as appropriate.  We 
will not provide or pay for any of your HIV care directly.  
Other Risks  
21. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describe s the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may 
also be unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn anything 
new that may affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood 
and giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, 
soreness, redness, swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage 
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 110 of 131 or infection wh ere you got the injection. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell 
count (anemia), making you feel tired.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discrimina tion because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may 
worry, get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk 
and treat you unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study 
took too much time  away from work, or because their employer thought they had 
HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause the 
body to make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make 
antibodies to HIV because you re ceived HIV study vaccines . The study vaccines 
may cause you to test positive on some types of HIV antibody tests, even if you 
are not infected with HIV. This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). 
VISP means that after you get the study vaccines , a routine HIV test done outside 
this clinic may say you have HIV, even if you don’t. For this reason, you should 
plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic during the study. Our tests can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a positive result  that is caused by the 
study vaccines . 
If you have a positive test result caused by the study vaccines  at any time, we can 
arrange free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will  test positive due to the study  vaccines . If you receive a 
positive HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will 
refer you for follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some 
time later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV 
tests come into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more 
information.  
Site: M odify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you are 
infected with HIV even if you are not, you could face discrimination and other 
problems. For example, in some countries, you could be denied medical or dental 
care, employment, insura nce, a visa, or entry into the military. If you do have a 
positive HIV antibody test caused by the study vaccines , you will not be able to 
donate blood or organs. Your family and friends may treat you differently. We 
will give you a brochure that tells you  more about testing HIV positive because of 
an HIV vaccine, and how you can avoid some of these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if 
the antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happen s with 
other vaccines, like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a 
danger to the baby, and they go away over time. For most babies antibodies from 
the mother last for about six months.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 111 of 131 You should always tell the delivery staff if you h ave VISP. However, you may 
still be tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your 
test is positive and the delivery staff believes you have an HIV infection, your 
baby may be started on antiretroviral treatment when it is not n eeded. If this 
happens, we can arrange for you and the baby to have a test that can tell the 
difference between true HIV infection and a VISP result. If you or the baby 
continue to have VISP, we can arrange this testing for free for as long as it is 
needed . 
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex 
and using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results 
could make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test r esults show that 
you are infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and 
we will try to help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk  
is very low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to 
someone who should not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, 
stress, and embarrassment. We can tell you more about how we will protect your 
personal informati on if you would like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
It is unlikely, but the genetic tests done on your samples could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or 
other problems. However, it is almost  impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.  
US sites, include the following paragraph  In the very unlikely event that your 
genetic information b ecomes linked to your name, a federal law called the 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect you.  GINA 
keeps health insurance companies and employers from seeing results of genetic 
testing when deciding about giving you health insura nce or offering you work. 
GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by companies that sell 
life, disability or long -term care insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccines  will increase, decrease, or not change your 
risk of  becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we 
do not know how the study [vaccine(s)]  might affect your HIV infection or how 
long it takes to develop AIDS.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 112 of 131 We do not know if getting these  study vaccines  will affect how you respond to 
any future approved HIV vaccine. Currently, no HIV vaccine has been approved 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines  will affect a pregnant participant or a 
developing baby.  
Benefits  
22. The study may not ben efit you.  
We do not expect the study vaccines to benefit you in any wa y. However, being in 
the study might still help you in some ways. The counseling that you get as part of 
the study may help you avoid getting HIV. The lab tests and physical exams that 
you get while in this study might detect health problems you don’t yet know 
about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the 
study vaccines  later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any 
money with you .  
Your rights and responsibilities  
23. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list 
these in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give  you a 
copy of it.  
Leaving the study  
24. Tell us if you decide to leave the study.  
You are free to leave the study at any time and for any reason. Your care at this 
clinic and your legal rights will not be affected, but it is important for you to let us 
know.   
We will ask you to come back to the clinic one last time for a physical exam, and 
we may ask to take some blood and urine samples . We will also ask about any 
personal problems or benefits you have experienced from being in the study. We 
believe these ste ps are important to protecting your health, but it is up to you 
whether to complete them.  
Injuries

we can give here. For the care that we cannot provide, we will explain how we 
will help you get care elsewhere.  
If you become sick or injured in this study, th ere is a process to decide  if it is 
related to the study products  and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related 
injury. There are funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain 
conditions are met.   
The HVTN has limited funds to p ay medical costs that it determines are 
reasonable.  (Sites: insert locale - appropriate medical insurance language in the 
following sentence)  If the injury is not study related, then you and your health 
insurance will be responsible for  treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by 
being in an HIV vaccine study. Or you might lose wages because you cannot go 
to work. However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if 
they are study rel ated.  
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If 
you wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to review the decision. You 
always have the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied.  
Health contact visit   
26. After your clinic visits end, we will contact you 18 months after your first 
injection.  
We will contact you by phone, email, or text message  [Site: Modify mode of 
contact as appropriate; consult IRB/EC if necessary]  18 months after your first 
injection  to ask questions about your health. If you prefer to answer these 
questions in person, you can come to the clinic to do this.  
If we have any concerns about your health, we may need to have more contact 
with you. You are also welcome to contact us at any ti me if you have concerns 
about your health related to being in the study.  
If we ask you to come to the clinic, we will give you

will ask you to come back to the clinic for another HIV test. We will draw about 
15 mL (1 tablespoon) of blood. We may ask you to come back more than once for 
this testing.  
Because we will want to contact you after the main study , please tell us if your 
contact information changes, if you are moving away, or if you do not want us to 
contact you anymore.  
You can tell us at any time that you don’t want us to contact you after the main

Site: Any change to the following boxed text requires approval from HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs at vtn.core.reg@hvtn.org . You can remove the box around the text . 
You should not become pregnant during the study because we do not know how 
the study vaccines  could affect the developing baby.  
You must agree to use effective birth control from 21 days  before your  first 
injection  until 3 months  after your last study injection.   
Effective birth control means using any of the following methods every time you 
have sex:  
• Birth control drugs that prevent pregnancy —given by pills, shots, patches, 
vaginal rings, or inserts under the skin;  
• Male or female condoms, with or without  a cream or gel that kills sperm;  
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with a cream or gel that kills sperm;  
• Intrauterine device (IUD); or  
• Any other contraceptive method approved by the researchers.  
You do not have to use birth control if:  
• You are only having sex with a partner or partners who have had a vasectomy. 
(We will ask you some questions to confirm that the vasectomy was 
successful.);  
• You have reached menopause, with no menstrual periods for one year;  
• You have had a hysterectomy (your uterus removed);  
• You have had your ovaries removed;  
• You have a tubal ligation (your “tubes tied”) or confirmed successful 
placement of a product that blocks the fallopian tubes;  
• You are having sex only with a partner (s) assigned female sex at birth ; 
• You only have oral sex; or,  
• You are sexually abstinent (no sex at all).  
Remember: If you are having sex, male and female condoms  are the only birth 
control methods that also provide protection against  HIV and other sexually 
transmitted infections . 
If you join the study, we will test  you for pregnancy at some visits, including 
before each study injection .

When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to use them 
in other studies and share them with other researchers. The HVTN calls these 
samples “extra samples”. The HVTN will only allow your extra samples to be 
used in other studies if you agree to this. You will mark your decision at the end 
of this form. If you have any questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to say yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . 
At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision 
will not affect your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure central place called a repo sitory. Your 
samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the United States.  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: Revise the 
previous sentence to insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on 
the use of your samples. If this happens, there is no plan to share any money with 
you. The researcher is not  likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or 
your doctor. They are not part of your medical record. The studies are only being 
done for research purposes.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 119 of 131 6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with HVTN or other researchers. 
Once we share your samples  and information , we may not be able to get them 
back.  
7. How do other  researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, their research plan 
must be approved by the HVTN. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board 
(IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: If review by your 
institution’s IRB/EC/RE is also required, insert a sentence stating this.]  IRBs/ECs 
protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’ s location.  
8. What information is shared with HVTN or other researchers?  
The samples and information will be labeled with a code number. Your name will 
not be part of the information. However, some information that we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, 
and HIV status.  We may share information about the study product you received 
and how your body responded to the study product.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and  other 
diseases.  
Researchers may also do genetic testing on your samples.  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of 
them over time, so that they can continue to do research with them . 
If you agree, your samples could al so be used for genome wide studies. In these 
studies, researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers 
compare the genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that 
could help them understand diseases. The researche rs may put the information 
from the genome -wide studies into a protected database so that other researchers 
can access it , but your name and other personal information will not be included . 
Usually, no one would be able to look at your genome and link it t o you as a 
person. However, if another database exists that also has information on your 
genome and your name, someone might be able to compare the databases and 
identify you. If others found out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. 
The risk  of this is very small.  There may be other unknown risks.  
HVTN 123, Version 1.0  / December 12, 2018  
HVTN123_v1 -0_FINAL  / Page 120 of 131 10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
It is unlikely, but t he genetic test s done on your samples  could show you may be 
at risk for certain diseases. If others found out, it could lead to discrimin ation or 
other problems. However, it is almost impossible for you or others to know your 
test results from the genetic testing. The results are not part of your study records 
and are not given to you.   
US sites, include the following paragraph  
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your 
name, a federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps health insurance companies and 
employers from seeing results of genetic testin g when deciding about giving you 
health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you against 
discrimination by companies that sell life, disability or long -term care insurance.   
11. Who will have access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
• Researchers who use your extra  samples and information for other research  
• Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your  extra  
samples and information  
• Any regulatory agency that r eviews clinical trials,  
• The researcher’s IRB or EC 
• The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of 
any new studies that use your extra samples and information may be published. 
No publication will use your name or identify you personally.

2HVTN Laboratories include Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Seattle, Washington, USA); Duke University Medical Center (Durham, 
North Carolina, USA).  
3Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits up to and including day 0 prior to vaccination.  
4Local labs may assign appropriate alternative tube types for locally performed tests.  
5Chemistry panels a re defined in Section 9.2 (pre-enrollment) and section 9.4 (postenroll ment).  
6Immunogenicity assays will be performed at M0, M2.5, M6.5, M9, and M12. Based on the number of responders observed at these t imepoints, lab 
assays may be performed on participants for humoral and cellular responses at other timepoints.  
7Genotyping  may be performed on enrolled participants using cryopreserved PBMC collected at baseline, initially in participants who demon strate 
vaccine -induced T -cell responses at postvaccination timepoints.  
8 For a participant who was born female (ie, assigned femal e sex at birth), pregnancy test must be performed on urine or blood specimens within 24 
hours of vaccination with negative results received prior to vaccination. Persons who have undergone total hysterectomy or bi lateral oophorectomy 
(verified by medical r ecords), are not required to undergo pregnancy testing.  
9At an early termination visit for a withdrawn or terminated participant who is not HIV -infected (see Section 9.11), blood should be drawn for HIV 
diagnostic testing, as shown for visit 9 above.  If a participant has a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, do not collect blood for HIV diagnostic 
testing  (see Section 9.13). 
10And microscopy if needed.  
11 For participants with confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection, only specimens required for protocol -specified safety laboratory tests, urinalysis and 
pregnancy tests will be collected . 
y = SST blood collected for binding Ab assay, neutralizing Ab assay and serum storage will also cover specimen needs for the Ab avidity assay; no 
separate blood draw is needed.  
z = 5 x 1mL aliquots of ACD plasma will be harvested for storage during PBMC processing; no separate blood draw is needed.

Appendix E , urinalysis, and urine pregnancy test s will be collected per the protocol schedule.  
7 For a participant who was assigned female sex at birth, pregnancy test must be performed on urine or blood 
specimens within 24 hours of vaccination with negative results received prior to vaccination. Pregna ncy test to 
determine eligibility may be performed at screening, but must also be done on Day 0 prior to vaccination. 
Persons who have undergone total hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (verified by medical records), are 
not required to undergo pregnan cy testing.  
8 Not applicable to HIV -infected participants.  
9 Blood draws required at vaccination visits must be performed prior to vaccination; however, it is not necessary 
to have results prior to vaccination, except for results of a urine or serum pregna ncy test, if indicated.  
10 Reactogenicity assessments performed daily for at least 7 days postvaccination (see Section  9.9). 
11 Specimens indicated for Day 0 may be obtained within the 14 days prior to vaccination, except for a

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 3 Notification: Possible Adaptations of Trial Protocol During the COVID-19 Pandemic
The aim of the ARGX-113-1904 trial is to investigate a new subcutaneous (SC) treatment option 
for patients with pemphigus. This SC treatment consists of efgartigimod coformulated with 
recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) (called efgartigimod PH20 SC) and could 
offer clinically significant benefits to pemphigus patients.
The sponsor (argenx BV) has performed a critical assessment of the use of efgartigimod during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Following careful evaluation, the risk/benefit profile of efgartigimod 
has not changed in the context of this pandemic. This decision was made based on 
efgartigimod’s mechanism of action, the safety data generated to date, and provisions made in all 
clinical trials with efgartigimod for safety reporting and withholding treatment upon evidence of 
infection. This assessment will be reviewed regularly to consider new information about the 
pandemic and the ongoing, continuous assessment of adverse events reported during argenx BV 
clinical trials. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, it may not be possible to perform all assessments as planned 
for this trial (see Schedule of Activities [SoA] in Section 1.3). 
In order to provide participants with pemphigus the opportunity to continue the trial during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, an appendix with possible adaptations to the ARGX-113-1904 trial has 
been developed. This appendix describes a minimum number of assessments required to 
guarantee the safety and wellbeing of participants during the trial, to secure the collection of the 
critical parameters for analysis, and the possibility of efgartigimod administration in the 
participant’s home. This appendix is included in Section 10.14  (Appendix 14) of this protocol.

Section and name Description of change Brief rationale
Section 1.1. Synopsis The following text was revised: 
“Approximately 213 participants with PV or PF will be 
randomized as follows: 
Approximately 183 participants with PV will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod PH20 
SC or placebo, respectively. The target number of 
Japanese participants with PV is 9 (included in the 
183 participants globally) . Among the Japanese 
participants with PV, the randomization ratio will also 
be 2:1 to receive efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo, 
respectively.  
 Up to approximately 30 participants with PF may be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod PH20 
SC or placebo, respectively. The target range for the 
number of Japanese participants with PF is 1 to 3 
(included in the 24 30 participants globally). Among 
the Japanese participants with PF, the randomization 
ratio will also be 2:1 to receive efgartigimod PH20 SC 
or placebo, respectively.” Revised for accuracy and

visits  at least once every 4 weeks (before and after CR) 
and at the time of CR .”Revised for accuracy 
Section 5.1. Inclusion 
Criteria Inclusion criterion 5A.i was revised: 
“Male participants must agree to use an acceptable 
method of contraception (as described in Appendix 5, 
Section  10.5.2.2) and not donate sperm from signing the 
ICF until the end last dose  of the study IMP .” Adjusted to align with the 
current guidance for 
efgartigimod on sperm 
donation 
Section 8. Trial 
Assessments and 
Procedures Because the sponsor can review the eligibility of 
participants but the decision to randomize a participant is 
up to the investigator, the following sentence has been 
updated:  
“At screening, all eligibility assessments should be 
performed after obtaining informed consent. All 
screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed, 
and confirmed by the sponsor’s designated CRO and 
medical monitor before enrollment to confirm that 
potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. 
Pseudonymized source documents confirming the 
diagnosis (histology, DIF, and IIF or ELISA) may be 
sent for this eligibility confirmation. The investigator 
will maintain a screening log to record details of all 
participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.” Correction

will receive an alert if a participant’s results are outside 
of the normal range. In addition, it has been clarified that 
PK, PD, immunogenicity, albumin, total protein, and 
exploratory research data (where applicable) will also 
remain blinded until database lock. The following 
footnote has therefore been added in Table 7 and 
Table 17:  
“PK, PD, immunogenicity, albumin, and total protein 
data will not be reported to the site. A system will be 
implemented that will alert the investigator of out-of-
range albumin and total protein values, to allow for 
appropriate safety follow-up.”

Section 10.6. 
Administrative Structure The legal entity of the laboratory used for the analysis of 
PK and ADA changed from LGC to DDS. Administrative update 
Throughout Clarifications have been added to specify the aspects of

1.1. Synopsis 
Protocol Title: 
A Randomized, Double-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, 
and Tolerability of Efgartigimod PH20 SC in Adult Patients With Pemphigus (Vulgaris or 
Foliaceus) (ADDRESS)
Short Title:
Not applicable. 
Indication: 
Pemphigus  
Trial Sites/Countries:
This is a global, multicenter trial
Target Population: 
Adult patients with moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF)
Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
Efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection on day 1 and day 8 
at a dose of mg, followed by weekly SC administrations of 1000 mg until complete 
remission on minimal therapy (CRmin).  
Comparator, Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
Participants will also be administered placebo with the same regimen. 
Rationale: 
In the previous trial ARGX-113-1701, a phase 2, open-label, proof-of-concept trial in mild-to-
moderate PV and PF, efgartigimod was found to rapidly decrease the serum levels of pathogenic 
anti-desmoglein (Dsg)-1 antibodies for PV and PF and anti-Dsg-3 antibodies for PV. Decreases 
in these autoantibodies were associated with clinical improvement and reduction in disease 
activity and progression, as shown by results on the Pemphigus Disease Area Index (PDAI) 
scoring system. Efgartigimod was found to have a fast onset of action in that disease control 
(DC), defined as the absence of new lesions and the start of healing of established lesions, was 
achieved in 24 out of 31 participants (77.4%) within 4 weeks. Weekly or biweekly efgartigimod 
administration with an add-on therapy of stable low doses of oral prednisone 
(0.25–0.5 mg/kg/day) resulted in complete clinical remission (CR), defined as the absence of 
new lesions and complete healing of established lesions, in a majority of these participants in 2 
to 13 weeks. 
The mainstays of therapy in PV are systemic corticosteroids and rituximab. Corticosteroids 
rapidly affect PV symptoms (3–4 weeks), but must be administered at high daily doses (eg, oral 
prednisone 1–1.5 mg/kg) to attain effectiveness. At such high doses, the well-known cumulative 
toxicities common to corticosteroid treatment occur frequently; using short courses at the lowest

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 18 possible dosage, by tapering gradually while keeping the disease in remission, is the therapeutic 
goal. Recently, rituximab has been approved in adults with moderate to severe PV. When 
administered as an adjunctive treatment to a short course of prednisone, rituximab was shown to 
induce a higher rate of remission after 1 or 2 years and a longer duration of remission than 
prednisone alone. However, administration of intravenous (IV) rituximab frequently results in 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and adverse events (AEs), which may be of late onset. The late 
onset of action of rituximab is well-documented in the literature: in a meta-analysis reviewing 
30 studies, DC was achieved by a mean of 7 to 8 weeks and CRmin by a mean of 6.5 months.1 
Consequently, an innovative drug is needed for the treatment of PV and PF that has a fast onset 
of action (eg, early DC, CR within weeks), a strong prednisone sparing effect (CR at tapered 
prednisone dose), and a favorable safety profile.  
This trial intends to demonstrate that efgartigimod PH20 SC with an add-on therapy of low doses 
of oral prednisone is a possible treatment modality for PV and PF, the administration of which 
will lead to early disease remission at minimal prednisone dose. The efficacy, safety, patient 
outcome measures, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of efgartigimod PH20 SC will be evaluated in participants with PV or 
PF.

and participants are fit to start prednisone treatment at 0.5 mg/kg qd at baseline. Note: 
conventional immunosuppressants and dapsone must be discontinued before baseline. 
The trial comprises a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period of up to 30 weeks, 
and an 8-week follow-up period for participants who do not enroll into the open-label extension 
(OLE) trial ARGX-113-1905. 
After confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo, as follows: 
Efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered by SC injection on day 1 and day 8 at a 
dose of mg, followed by weekly administrations of 1000 mg until CRmin is 
observed. Efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered at on-site visits until CR, with 
a minimum of 6 weekly on-site visits (W1 to W6). After achieving CR, efgartigimod 
PH20 SC will be administered at on-site visits or at home by a nurse until CRmin is 
achieved.

Randomization will be stratified by disease status (experiencing flare and newly diagnosed), 
disease severity (PDAI activity scor(<77.5 
will comprise a maximum of 30% of the overall trial population.  
All participants, regardless of treatment assignment, will concomitantly receive oral prednisone 
(or equivalent such as prednisolone) at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg qd. Except for oral 
prednisone (or equivalent), no other systemic therapies (eg, immunosuppressants, intravenous 
immunoglobulin [IVIg]), immunoadsorption, anti-CD20 biologics) will be permitted during the 
trial.  
Participants will visit the clinic weekly until CR and for a minimum of 6 on-site visits, 
V1(BL)/W1 to W6, to receive investigational medicinal product (IMP) and to be evaluated for 
disease activity and disease outcome. After CR, IMP will be administered weekly at on-site or 
home visits by a nurse until CRmin. At any post-baseline visit before DC is achieved, the 
prednisone dose will be adjusted by incrementing dosage according to clinical judgment, with 
the recommendation to increase by 1 or more steps (refer to Table 3 ) in case of disease 
progression or insufficient clinical change. To facilitate common judgments among investigators, 
recommendations for assessment of disease progression and insufficient clinical change are:  
 Disease progression: increase of at least 5 in PDAI activity score compared to 
baseline score, observed at any post-baseline visit before DC 
 Insufficient clinical change: absence of DC after 3 to 4 weeks of the participant being 
treated at the starting baseline prednisone (or equivalent) dose or after 3 to 4 weeks of 
any new incremented dose of prednisone 
The recommendations of the prednisone dose escalation are: 
 Stepwise escalation of daily prednisone dose by 1 or more steps according to clinical 
judgment in case of disease progression. 
 Adjustment by incrementing dosage by 1 step in case of insufficient clinical change. 
 Possible further escalation from the previous step by 1 or more steps, according to 
clinical judgment and under the same recommendation as above. 
 Maximum escalation to 1.5 mg/kg qd for 3 weeks.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 22 If, after a minimum of 3 weeks of oral prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg qd, DC is not attained, then the 
participant will be considered a treatment failure. 
For participants achieving DC with a daily prednisone dose of 0.5 mg/kg, prednisone will be 
maintained at 0.5 mg/kg qd until CR and 2 weeks thereafter, or until end of consolidation (EoC, 
defined as the time at which no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 2 weeks and 
approximately 80% of lesions have healed) and 4 weeks thereafter, after which tapering will be 
initiated. For participants achieving DC with an escalated prednisone dose (ie, >0.5 mg/kg qd), 
the prednisone dose will be maintained until 2 weeks after achieving DC, then tapering will be 
performed according to the following stepwise procedure: dose reductions by 0.25 mg/kg qd 
(according to Table 3 ) every 2 weeks until the starting dose is reached (ie, 0.5 mg/kg qd). Then 
the starting dose (0.5 mg/kg qd) will be maintained until a sustained CR is achieved for 2 weeks, 
after which further tapering will be initiated, or prednisone tapering below 0.5 mg/kg qd may be 
initiated in case of sustained EoC for at least 4 weeks. Further tapering will be performed 
thereafter, as long as CR or EoC are sustained. The rules for tapering are shown in Table 3 . Each 
new tapered prednisone dose until 20 mg/day must be maintained for 2 weeks. Then, the 
prednisone dose is further tapered by 2.5 mg/day per week. When 10 mg/day is reached, this 
dose level will be maintained until CRmin has been achieved. Prednisone can then be further 
tapered upon clinical judgment by the investigator.  
In case of flare in the period between DC and CRmin, the prednisone dose will be increased. A 
flare is defined by the appearance of 3 or more new lesions in a 4-week period that do not heal 
spontaneously within 1 week, or by the extension of established lesions, in a participant who had 
achieved DC. If the flare occurs after CR and IMP was administered at home by a nurse, the 
participant will resume weekly on-site visits until he/she achieves CR again. Participants who are 
not controlled by a prednisone dose that is 2 dose levels above the dose at which the flare 
between DC and CRmin therapy is observed and that is at least 0.3 mg/kg/day (eg, according to 
Table 3 ) will be considered treatment failures. At visits when at least 1 new lesion is observed or 
established lesions remain extensive without being defined as a flare, the prednisone dose will be 
maintained or may be increased, according to clinical judgment. If the lesion resolves, then 
tapering of the prednisone dose will be pursued as planned.  
Participants who experience treatment failure, or flare after achieving CRmin, will be allowed to 
roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than W31. Participants who do not roll over 
into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 will complete the treatment-free follow-up period. 
Participants experiencing an SAE related to prednisone may also benefit from an early roll over 
to the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905, according to clinical judgment. 
Trial procedures will be performed per the SoA as detailed in Section 1.3.

The proposed trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
trial to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of efgartigimod PH20 SC in adult participants aged from 18 years with 
moderate to severe pemphigus vulgaris (PV) or pemphigus foliaceus (PF). This trial intends to 
demonstrate that efgartigimod PH20 SC with an add-on therapy of low doses of oral prednisone 
is a possible treatment modality for PV and PF, the administration of which will lead to early 
disease remission at minimal prednisone dose. 
In order to allow for a convenient subcutaneous (SC) administration with efgartigimod to 
achieve the targeted exposure and PD effect, efgartigimod will be coformulated with 
recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20). This compound is being used in 
coformulations with approved therapeutic antibodies to facilitate SC administration with 
volumes >2 mL. The use of rHuPH20 in combination with other therapeutic proteins typically 
increases the absorption rate of these proteins, albeit to different extents. Increased rate of 
absorption of efgartigimod by rHuPH20 is expected to increase the overall exposure to 
efgartigimod after SC administration allowing administration of a SC dose in an acceptable 
volume and duration of administration that targets an exposure that results in a close to the 
maximal PD effect.  
China- and Germany-specific modifications to the protocol are outlined in Section 10.16  .  
2.1. Trial Rationale 
The mainstays of therapy in PV are systemic corticosteroids and rituximab. Corticosteroids also 
rapidly affect PV symptoms (3–4 weeks), but must be administered at high daily doses (eg, oral 
prednisone 1–1.5 mg/kg) to attain effectiveness. At such high doses, the well-known cumulative 
toxicities common to corticosteroid treatment occur frequently, and using short courses at the 
lowest possible dosage by tapering gradually while keeping the disease in remission is the 
therapeutic goal. Recently, rituximab, a monoclonal antibody binding the CD20 antigen on, and 
depleting, B-lymphocytes, has been approved in adults with moderate to severe PV. When 
administered as adjunctive treatment to a short course of prednisone, rituximab was shown to 
induce a higher rate of remission after 1 or 2 years, and a longer duration of remission than 
prednisone alone; however, administration of intravenous (IV) rituximab frequently results in 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs) and adverse events (AEs), which may be of late onset. The late 
onset of action of rituximab is well-documented in the literature: in a meta-analysis reviewing 
30 studies, it was shown that rituximab did not result in an early achievement of disease control 
(DC) (mean time from first infusion: 6–7 weeks1) or CRmin (mean of 6–7 months on minimal 
prednisone therapy, 9 months off-therapy1,2). Furthermore, rituximab therapy carries the risk of 
inducing serious adverse events (SAEs, eg, 33% of infections3). Late onset neutropenia and 
hypogammaglobulinemia and the risk for patients to develop potentially fatal infections (eg, 
Pneumocystis carinii , multifocal leukoencephalopathy, septicemia) require a long-term 
monitoring of the clinical and immunological status of the patients under rituximab.4 
Other therapies for PV are now classified as corticosteroid-sparing agents.5They include 
immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide), intravenous 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 34 immunoglobulin (IVIg) and immunoadsorption. Among immunosuppressants, azathioprine and 
mycophenolate mofetil are preferentially used as first-line corticosteroid-sparing agents, whereas 
cyclophosphamide is more considered as a second-line adjuvant treatment.5 Because 
immunosuppressants have a delayed onset of action, they have no significant effect on DC,6and 
their use as monotherapy is only conceivable in mild and stable cases when a delay in achieving 
DC can be tolerated. The most documented effects of immunosuppressants are a decrease in the 
occurrence of flares, by about 30% compared to prednisone alone,7and a saving effect on the 
consumption of prednisone. There is evidence that azathioprine has a greater corticosteroid-
sparing effect.8 
Like corticosteroids and rituximab, the side effects of immunosuppressants are of clinical 
concern. They all may result in infections related to their broad immunosuppressive action. 
Azathioprine can cause potentially life-threatening bone marrow suppression, hepatitis, and is 
associated with increased risk of lymphoma. Assessment of methyltransferase activity of each 
individual before beginning azathioprine treatment is recommended, in order to prevent 
overdosage of the drug. The most frequent side effects of mycophenolate mofetil are 
gastrointestinal disturbance and hematologic disorders (lymphocytopenia). It is contraindicated 
in pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Cyclophosphamide has an unfavorable 
safety profile and, for this reason, must be used as a second-line therapeutic option when 
immunosuppressants are indicated. Its main side effects include hemorrhagic cystitis, 
hematologic abnormalities, cancer, and infertility. 
Neonatal crystallized fragment receptor (FcRn) inhibition is the mode of action shared by IVIg 
and efgartigimod. IVIg is today the only therapy other than corticosteroids that has demonstrated 
to improve DC (4–8 weeks), indicating the short onset of action of the drug.9 It has been shown 
to also have a corticosteroid saving effect. Its use as a monotherapy has been reported in a few 
case series.10 Interestingly, IVIg has been tested in combination with rituximab (sequential 
administration of 3 weekly infusions of rituximab and then IVIg at week 4; 6 cycles in 
6 months11). Nine out of 11 patients reached complete remission as early as 8 to 11 weeks. 
Overall, IVIg is relatively safe to use. Its main side effects are hypertension, coagulation 
disorders, aseptic meningitis and renal insufficiency. However, it is an expensive blood-derived 
product that must be used at high dosage (2 g/kg monthly) to achieve its immunomodulatory 
effects. Furthermore, it is not approved for the treatment of PV and other autoimmune bullous 
dermatoses (AIBD). Consequently, the availability of IVIg remains limited, especially in 
countries that have implemented a strict control of its use. 
Immunoadsorption is a procedural treatment that consists of selectively removing the circulating 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and pathogenic antibodies by extracorporeal adsorption from serum 
with protein A. Plasmapheresis is a less common alternative, involving plasma exchange using 
albumin and fresh frozen plasma. These treatments are only available in a few specialized 
centers, and thus are indicated in cases resistant or intolerant to other adjuvant therapies. When 
immunoadsorption is used, it is typically combined with immunosuppressants to prevent a 
rebound phenomenon, with a post-procedural rise in autoantibodies and transient lesion flare.12 
Otherwise, immunoadsorption treatment results in early DC in a majority of PV patients, ie, 4 to 
8 weeks.13 Its combination with rituximab has also been tried with success.14 Some procedure-
related side effects have been described, including infections at the central catheter site that 
appear to be more frequent in the PV population than in the autoimmune non-PV population.15 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 35 Non-mainstay adjuvant therapies of PV include methotrexate and ciclosporin as 
immunosuppressants, dapsone, and tetracyclines associated or not with niacinamide. Dapsone at 
high doses frequently induces side effects (hemolysis, hepatitis). Local therapies such as potent 
topical corticosteroids and topical antibiotics are often helpful to amend the mucosal and 
superinfected cutaneous lesions, respectively. 
Patients with PF typically follow the same type of management and monitoring of the clinical 
outcome measures as PV patients, although rituximab has not been labeled in the condition. 
Dapsone as initial treatment has been reported in mild cases, with a satisfactory outcome.16 
There is a need in pemphigus patients for a safer drug with a rapid onset of action and a 
favorable safety profile that would achieve early DC, be corticosteroid sparing, and achieve and 
maintain CR, with or without a low dose of corticosteroids. 
This trial intends to demonstrate that efgartigimod PH20 SC with an add-on therapy of low doses 
of oral prednisone is a possible treatment modality for PV and PF, the administration of which 
will lead to early disease remission at minimal prednisone dose. The efficacy, safety, patient 
outcome measures, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and PD of efgartigimod PH20 SC will be 
evaluated in patients with PV or PF. 
2.2. Background 
PV and PF (also called superficial pemphigus) are 2 close entities belonging to the heterogenous 
group of autoimmune skin blistering diseases, and clinically characterized by mucosal erosions 
(PV) and cutaneous blisters (PV and PF). PV is caused by IgG autoantibodies against the 
desmosomal proteins, desmoglein-3 (Dsg-3) and/or Dsg-1, on epidermal keratinocytes. Because 
the binding of the antibodies (which are predominantly of the IgG4 subtype and therefore do not 
activate complement) to the extracellular domain of Dsg is sufficient to cause loss of 
keratinocyte adhesion and blister formation, they generate directly the clinical manifestations of 
PV. Dsg-3 is expressed throughout the epidermis of the skin and the mucosa, whereas Dsg-1 
prevails in the superficial layer of the skin and is absent in the mucosa. Accordingly, mucosal PV 
lesions are mostly induced by anti-Dsg-3 antibodies, whereas cutaneous PV lesions are triggered 
by both anti-Dsg-3 and anti-Dsg-1 antibodies. Interestingly, disease activity has been shown to 
be closely correlated with serum levels of antibodies against Dsg-1 and, to a lesser extent, 
Dsg-3.17,18PF is caused by antibodies against Dsg-1 that is expressed in the superficial layer of 
the epidermis and, therefore, involves the skin only. Two forms have been described: the non-
endemic form, and the endemic form (also called “fogo selvagem”). Fogo selvagem has been 
observed in the Amazonian region, where a non-infectious protein (LJM11) residing in the 
salivary glands of the sand fly ( Lutzomyia longipalpis ) was suggested to cause a cross-reaction 
with Dsg-1.19 Otherwise, endemic and non-endemic PF share the same clinical, histological and 
immunological findings. Like in PV, anti-Dsg-1 autoantibodies are directly pathogenic.  
Both PV and PF are rare. The incidence of PV is variable, with a higher frequency along the 
Mediterranean border. Its annual incidence ranges from 0.8 per million in Finland to around 1.5 
per million in France, 4 to 5 per million in Italy and up to 8 per million in Greece and even 16 
per million in Israel.20 It is sporadic and affects patients in their middle age, of both sexes. PF is 
even less common in North America and Europe (10%–15% of the pemphigus cases).  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 36 Both conditions are chronic and intractable, with a life-threatening potential. Clinically, PV 
presents as a mucosal-dominant, mucocutaneous or, less commonly, solely cutaneous type. 
Patients frequently shift from 1 type to another, typically from mucosal type at the beginning of 
the disease to become mucocutaneous later on. Mucocutaneous type tends to be a more severe 
disease, whereas diagnostic delay is common in the mucosal type. Although it may affect a wider 
range of age, its peak frequency ranges between 50 and 60 years of age. Women are slightly 
overrepresented in the PV population, in which the female-predominant thyroid diseases and 
rheumatoid arthritis are associated.21Typically, lesions begin in the oral mucosa and might then 
extend to other mucosal areas and the skin. Mucosal involvement consists of flaccid blisters that 
rapidly rupture, leaving painful erosions. Mucosal lesions may also affect the pharynx, upper 
larynx, esophagus, nose and eyes, and genitals. They are usually associated with significant 
impairments, including difficulties of eating and swallowing, of having sexual intercourses, etc. 
They frequently lead to weight loss, malnutrition and alteration of QoL. Cutaneous lesions are 
featured by flaccid blisters and erosions that easily ooze and become superinfected (crusty 
lesions). Although any skin area may be involved, lesions predominate in the head, upper trunk 
and groin. They are painful, especially in the folds. At examination, the epidermis can be 
detached when the finger rubs the skin at the periphery of the lesions (Nikolsky sign), which is 
highly indicative of PV diagnosis. 
Diagnosis of PV follows an algorithm of different tools, which should be performed in the 
presence of clinical manifestations suggestive of the disease. They include histology, direct 
immunofluorescence (DIF), and the evidence of autoantibodies against Dsg-3 and/or Dsg-1 in 
serum either through indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) tests. Histopathology shows supra-basal acantholysis (keratinocytes floating in blister 
fluid). Acantholysis is highly suggestive of PV, as it is not seen in other autoimmune blistering 
diseases such as bullous pemphigoid (BP), but the diagnosis should be confirmed by the 
characteristic deposition of IgG and/or complement on the cell surface of keratinocytes by DIF. 
DIF is considered today as the gold standard investigation for diagnosis. However, IIF and/or 
ELISA are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Commercial ELISA assays are available for 
quantitative measurement of Dsg-1 and Dsg-3 autoantibodies in serum. They potentially offer 
advantages over IIF, such as increased sensitivity (>90%), but are not helpful for excluding other 
self-antigens and AIBDs. Therefore, IIF and ELISA may be considered complementary in the 
diagnostic investigation of PV. Taken together, the international guidelines recommend making 
diagnosis of PV in patients with indicative clinical signs, confirmed by histopathology, positive 
DIF, and positive IIF and/or ELISA.22 
PV is a chronic disease, with no tendency of spontaneous improvement. On the contrary, the 
disease worsens progressively and has a mortality rate 3 times higher than in the general 
population when untreated.23 Under treatment, the disease usually evolves in periods of 
remission and flare. Eventually, it takes many years for achieving a definite cure. As treatments 
are part of the co-morbidity factors that are related to their high rate of serious side effects, the 
mortality is still high and severe infections remain today the main cause of death.5  
Because Dsg-1 is expressed in the superficial portion of the epidermis, PF patients present with 
itchy, scaly and crusted erosions of the cutaneous tissue. Blisters are uncommonly seen, owing to 
their superficial nature and easy rupture. Another clinical variant may be the development of 
squamous and crusty lesions on the face, scalp, chest and inter-scapular areas (“seborrheic 
pemphigus”). In more severe forms, desquamative erythroderma may be observed in almost all 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 37 of the skin surface. PF diagnosis follows the investigational tools that are used in PV. At 
histology, a cleft in the subcorneal or the superficial granular layer can be seen. DIF shows the 
intercellular deposition of IgG within the epidermis, and the IIF reveals the presence of serum 
autoantibodies against intercellular components of the skin. ELISA tests quantify the positive 
level of anti-Dsg-1 antibodies in serum, whereas the search for anti-Dsg-3 antibodies is negative. 
Like PV, PF does not tend to amend spontaneously. Treatment is always needed, with the aim at 
healing existing lesions and preventing the appearance of new lesions as soon as possible. 
Basic and clinical research has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of pemphigus 
diseases and novel therapies have been developed. Nonetheless, long diagnostic delay and 
suboptimal treatment are important concerns in pemphigus diseases. As described above, a drug 
with a faster onset of action is needed so that quicker DC can be achieved in combination with 
low starting doses of corticosteroids (eg, prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg per day), and CR can be 
attained and maintained while the patient reaches rapidly minimal corticosteroid dose  
The therapeutic management of patients with pemphigus is very challenging. Its primary 
principles are to promptly stop the occurrence of new blisters and then achieve CR and to 
minimize the side effects of systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have indeed a high 
cumulative toxicity in these chronic diseases, which must be mitigated by reducing their amount 
and duration of exposure as much as possible. Secondarily, the objective of the treatments is to 
prevent the development of new lesions either on minimal corticosteroid therapy, or even 
without any treatment. For this purpose, patients must be managed by referral centers, where 
they can be monitored carefully by experienced dermatologists. In many patients, a multi-
disciplinary approach is necessary, including specialists in oral medicine, ophthalmologists and 
gynecologists when mucosal lesions are present. To help the practitioners in the therapeutic 
management of pemphigus patients, consensual definitions of the most important clinical 
endpoints among national and international experts,24 as well as regular guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of these diseases are available.2,10,25,26 In addition, validated scales for 
monitoring disease activity and extension (eg, Pemphigus Disease Area Index [PDAI], 
Autoimmune Bullous Skin Disorder Intensity Score [ABSIS]) have been established.27,28The 
specific scale Autoimmune Bullous Disease Quality of Life (ABQOL) was developed and 
validated for ascertaining the impact of the disease and its therapies on patient’s daily life.29 
According to the most recent international guideline,22 corticosteroids remain a first-line therapy 
in pemphigus. They are the most rapidly acting treatment known today, ie, DC achieved in about 
3 weeks (no new lesions, established lesions starting to heal) when used at effective dose.30-32 
Oral prednisone is the most commonly used corticosteroid. The starting oral prednisone dose is 
high, ranging from 1–2 mg/kg daily, and may be reduced (0.5–1 mg/kg per day) if combined 
with rituximab or immunosuppressants. If DC is not achieved after 3–4 weeks at the latest, the 
prednisone dose must be increased. In patients with very active disease, an IV bolus of 
corticosteroids (eg, methylprednisolone) may be preferred, especially at treatment initiation.
Tapering of oral prednisone is initiated as soon as DC is achieved or up to the end of 
consolidation (EoC) phase. EoC is defined as the absence of new lesions for at least 2 weeks and 
approximately 80% of established lesions healed. The duration of the consolidation period varies 
greatly between patients, mucosal erosions and extensive cutaneous lesions tending to be late to 
heal. The goal of the EoC phase is to reach CR (no new lesions, all established lesions

argenx Confidential 38 completely healed) and, at the same time, reach a minimal effective dose of prednisone (10 mg 
per day or less for at least 2 months), or even stop prednisone (off therapy), in order to prevent 
side effects. Unfortunately, this double objective is hard to achieve, and a majority of patients 
flare under a tapered dose of prednisone. In a prospective study, 64% of PV patients with 
prednisone could achieve a first complete remission on minimal dose after 12 months.33Flare 
occurred frequently, ie, in 45% of the cases within 6 months. Finally, the common course of PV 
is 1 of episodes of flare and transient remission, and it takes several years of prednisone 
treatment before achieving permanent remission. In 1 study, 36% of patients with PV were 
treated with prednisone or equivalent for at least 10 years.34 Meanwhile, the risk of 
corticosteroid-related side effects increased with treatment duration (osteoporosis, diabetes, 
hypertension, Cushing syndrome, cataract, glaucoma, infections, etc).35Accordingly, most PV 
patients need adjuvant therapies (eg, rituximab, immunosuppressants) to maintain them under 
remission and reduce the cumulative prednisone dose. 
The recent approval of rituximab in PV adults has dramatically changed the mainstay of therapy 
of the disease, and is now approved as a first-line therapy in association with prednisone for 
moderate and severe cases. Rituximab was primarily used in refractory PV patients, who do not 
respond well to other treatments. However, the lack of long-lasting remission and great number 
of SAEs associated with prednisone and immunosuppressants has led researchers to develop 
alternative first-line treatments. Rituximab as second-line and third-line treatment (1–2 g per 
cycle) was shown to a induce long-term remission at a high rate, which could not be achieved by 
any other treatment (75% remission rate in PV after 1 year25). Flare rates after rituximab therapy 
ranged between 25% after 1 year up to 80% in long-term follow-up. Recent evidence has shown 
the efficacy of a first cycle of rituximab (2 g) as first-line treatment followed by new cycles 
(0.5 g) after 12 months and 18 months, in combination with lower doses of prednisone 
(0.5-1 mg/kg per day according to disease severity2). Using this first-line regimen, a higher 
proportion of complete remission after 2 years, ie, 89%, was demonstrated. Flare cases were 
observed to be also lower (24% after 2 years), a majority occurring within 6 to 12 months after 
the first cycle. A strong prednisone sparing effect, ie, by about two-thirds, was demonstrated. 
2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of both efgartigimod 
and rHuPH20 may be found in the latest issue of the respective Investigator’s Brochures (IBs). 
2.3.1.  Risk Assessment 
In clinical studies to date, efgartigimod has been well-tolerated in healthy adult subjects and 
patients with pemphigus, myasthenia gravis (MG), and primary immune thrombocytopenia 
(ITP). The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were considered to be mild 
(grade 1) in severity.  
In the phase 2 study ARGX-113-1701 in participants with pemphigus, 5 severe (grade 3) TEAEs 
were reported, 3 of which were assessed as not related to the drug ( Syncope , Pneumonia , and 
Tibia fracture ) and the remaining 2 TEAEs of Tooth infection and Blood creatine phosphokinase  
(CPK) increased were assessed by the investigator to be possibly related to the IMP. Out of these 
5 severe TEAEs, no action was taken on the drug dose for 3 participants; drug was withdrawn 
from the participant who reported non-related grade 3 Pneumonia ; and the dose was interrupted 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 39 for the participant who reported possibly related blood CPK increase. The most commonly
reported TEAEs were Nasopharyngitis , Diarrhea , and Headache , reported in 4 (11.8%) 
participants each. The most frequently reported treatment-related TEAE was Influenza-like 
illness , which occurred in 3 (8.8%) participants in total.  
In the phase 2 trial ARGX-113- eported 
and no TEAE led to discontinuation from treatment or from the study. The most common TEAE 
was Headache , reported in 4 of 12 participants (33%) treated with efgartigimod 10 mg/kg and 3 
of 12 participants (25%) who received placebo. Additionally, in a randomized, double-blinded, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial in participants with MG (ARGX-113-1704), 65 (77.4%) 
participants in the efgartigimod group and 70 (84.3%) participants in the placebo group reported e severity. TEAEs of grade 3 or 4 severity were 
reported with similar frequencies (efgartigimod: 9 [10.7%] participants; placebo: 8 [9.6%] 
participants). Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 4 (4.8%) participants in the 
efgartigimod and 7 (8.4%) participants in the placebo group. No deaths occurred during the 
study. TEAEs that led to discontinuation of IMP were reported in 3 (3.6%) participants in each 
treatment group.
In the phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1603 in participants with ITP, 1 TEAE of Thrombocytopenia  
grade 4 was reported, which was considered unrelated to treatment, but led to treatment 
discontinuation. Injection site haematoma was the most commonly reported TEAE, reported in 3 
of 13 participants (23.1%) in the efgartigimod 5 mg/kg group and in 2 of 13 participants (15.4%) 
in the efgartigimod 10 mg/kg group. Headache  was reported in 1 of 13 participants (7.7%) 
treated with efgartigimod 5 mg/kg and 2 of 12 participants (16.7%) who received placebo. 
The only clinically relevant laboratory findings, observed after repeated administration of 
efgartigimod 10 mg/kg, were Decreased monocyte count  (reported for 1 participant with MG) 
and abnormal differential white blood cell count in individual healthy subjects after 
administration of a single dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg efgartigimod, which was associated with 
decreased CD8, CD3, CD56, CD4, and CD19 lymphocyte levels. All events were short-lasting 
and resolved within 2 to 4 days. An increase in C-reactive protein was reported in individual 
healthy subjects administered a single dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg efgartigimod. All events resolved 
within 3 to 6 days and were in general not associated with signs of fever or serious infections.
In nonclinical toxicology trials repeated administration of 100 mg/kg (15 infusions, every 2 days) 
efgartigimod was associated with reversible Kupffer cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia in rat, as well 
as hepatic cytoplasmic alterations and degeneration, and diffuse mixed inflammatory cell 
infiltrates (correlating with alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increase) in cynomolgus monkey. 
The former most likely relates to a reaction to the foreign protein in the rodent and the latter 
could be linked to endotoxins that were present in the test article batch used for the study. No 
such observations were made in a 6-month chronic dosing trial where cynomolgus monkeys 
were administered 100 mg/kg efgartigimod IV once a week. In healthy subjects or patients with 
MG or ITP, no clinically significant changes were observed in liver enzyme levels (including 
ALT and aspartate aminotransferase), serum lipids, or electrolytes (including potassium). 
No clinically significant changes in vital signs and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) findings have 
been observed in clinical trials to date.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 40 Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, efgartigimod should not be 
administered to pregnant or lactating women. However, reproductive toxicity studies in rats and 
rabbits showed that efgartigimod elicited no signs of maternal toxicity or teratogenic effects up 
to the high IV dose of 100 mg/kg/day and did not adversely affect male and female fertility, or 
the reproductive and developmental performance in rats following repeated IV injections at 
100 mg/kg/day.
rHuPH20, used in both the efgartigimod and placebo preparations, is a permeation (diffusion) 
enhancer with a well-characterized nonclinical and clinical safety profile that allows the rapid 
delivery of large volumes of fluid and/or co-administered drugs subcutaneously. In clinical 
studies, the SC administration of rHuPH20 in combination with other substances was well-
tolerated. Most AEs were mild, transient Injection site reactions , including erythema, pain, 
bruising, pruritus, burning, tenderness, edema, induration, irritation, paresthesia, numbness, and 
rash. Moderate Injection site reactions , which have occurred less frequently, include burning, 
erythema, pain, and numbness. Mild-to-moderate Headache  was also commonly reported. Many 
AEs in these trials were related to the co-administered drug or have been associated with the 
rapid introduction of a relatively large volume of fluid in the subcutaneous space. rHuPH20 is 
coformulated or coadministered with several products in the US and EU (eg, Herceptin® SC, 
MabThera® SC, HyQvia®, and Darzalex Faspro™).  
In the phase 1 trial ARGX-113-1901, overall, single-dose SC administration of 750 mg, 
1250 mg, 1750 mg, or 10 mg/kg efgartigimod co-mixed with 2000 U/mL rHuPH20 was 
well-tolerated by all subjects. No deaths, SAEs, or TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
reported. The most frequently reported TEAEs were Injection site reactions , most of which were 
considered related to the IMP. A total of 27 TEAEs reported in 20 (60.6%) subjects were 
considered by the investigator to be related to the IMP. All related TEAEs were reported as mild 
in severity, except for 1 related TEAE ( Injection site erythema ) that was reported as moderate in 
severity. Dose-related effects were observed. All subjects recovered from their TEAEs by the 
end of the study, except for 1 subject who experienced a TEAE of Dizziness . There were no 
clinically relevant findings with respect to clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECGs, or full-body 
physical examination. Targeted physical examination showed that a total of 19 subjects (57.6%) 
had 1 or more abnormalities at the injection site (including erythema, bruising, pain, 
discoloration, pruritus, swelling, and Hematoma), which were reported as TEAEs. The 
percentage of subjects with 1 or more abnormalities at the injection site appeared to increase 
with increasing SC doses of efgartigimod co-mixed with rHuPH20. 
2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment 
Efgartigimod has been shown to effectively reduce IgG antibodies and improve clinical 
outcomes in several clinical trials, including healthy subjects, participants with pemphigus, MG, 
and ITP. 
In the phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1701 in participants with pemphigus, the efficacy of efgartigimod 
was supported by PD effects (effects on IgG, anti-Dsg-1 and -3 autoantibodies) and the effects 
on the clinical activity (PDAI) and clinical outcomes of the disease (DC and CR). The drug had a 
fast onset of action by sharply reducing the serum levels of autoantibodies. Autoantibody 
reduction was correlated with a rapid decrease of the disease activity (PDAI), and was associated 
with an early achievement of DC and CR. Participants were able to achieve DC with or without

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 41 concomitant prednisone, whereas CR was achieved in combination with low prednisone dose. 
Flare was prevented when efgartigimod was given at weekly intervals, before and after DC or 
CR.  
In December 2021, the FDA approved efgartigimod for the treatment of generalized myasthenia 
gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody 
seropositive. In the phase 2 trial (ARGX-113-1602) of participants with gMG, 4 weekly IV 
infusions of 10 mg/kg efgartigimod led to statistically significant improvements in clinical scales 
and were well-tolerated.36Additionally, in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial in participants with gMG (ARGX-113-1704), the primary endpoint of the 
percentage of acetylcholine receptor–antibody (AChR-Ab) seropositive participants who after 
the first tr  points on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily 
Living (MG-
-point reduction observed no later than 1 week after the last IMP infusion was met. 
Participants who met this criterion were considered MG-ADL responders. In the AChR-Ab 
seropositive population, there was a statistically significantly higher proportion of MG-ADL 
responders in the efgartigimod group (67.7%) than in the placebo group (29.7%) (p<0.001; 
logistic regression, 2-sided exact p-value) in cycle 1.  
In the phase 2 trial (ARGX-113-1603) in participants with ITP, efgartigimod resulted in a rapid 
and marked reduction of IgG antibodies (maximum mean reduction of 65%) and of all IgG 
subtypes.37Additionally, efgartigimod was associated with an increase in platelet counts in more 
participants than occurred in the placebo group, with greater numerical separation from placebo 
as the platelet count threshold stringency was increased. Additional post hoc analyses further 
supported these observations, showing a longer duration of clinically meaningful effect and 
statistically significantly more active-9/L 
for more than 10 cumulative days compared to the placebo group. 
Efgartigimod is under investigation in an ongoing phase 2 trial (ARGX-113-1802) in participants 
with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) using efgartigimod PH20 SC, 
which uses the same formulation used in the current trial in pemphigus participants.
2.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion
Taking into account the efficacy and safety data collected up to date, the benefit-risk assessment 
supports further testing of efgartigimod PH20 SC in pemphigus.

4.1. Overall Design 
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to 
investigate the efficacy, safety, patient outcome measures, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, and 
PD of efgartigimod PH20 SC in adult participants aged from 18 years with PV or PF. See 
Section 1.2 for a diagram of the trial design. Enrolled participants are those who are either newly 
diagnosed or experiencing flare as follows:

 Moderate to severe (PDAI activity scor
course of oral prednisone (or equivalent). According to clinical judgment, the 
participant has shown no significant improvement of PV or PF signs for at least 
2 weeks before baseline and is considered fit to start prednisone treatment at 
0.5 mg/kg daily (qd) at baseline.

equivalent) has been given at stable dose ± a conventional immunosuppressant (eg, 
azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil) or dapsone 
and participants are fit to start prednisone treatment at 0.5 mg/kg qd at baseline. Note: 
conventional immunosuppressants and dapsone must be discontinued before baseline. 
The trial comprises a screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period of up to 30 weeks, 
and an 8-week follow-up period for participants who do not enroll into the OLE trial 
ARGX 113-1905. 
After confirmation of eligibility, participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo, as follows: 
Efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered by SC injection on day 1 and day 8 at a 
dose of mg, followed by weekly SC administrations of 1000 mg until CRmin is 
observed. Efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered at on-site visits until CR. After 
achieving CR, efgartigimod PH20 SC will be administered at on-site visits or at home 
by a nurse until CRmin is achieved. 
 Placebo (vehicle with 2000 U/mL of rHuPH20) SC will be administered using the 
same regimen. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 45 All participants or their caregivers will be invited to receive training for future 
self-administration of IMP in the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. The caregiver is a person of legal 
age that the participant proposes to perform the administrations. If the participants or caregivers 
have successfully completed self-administration training to the satisfaction of authorized staff, 
then the participants or caregivers may self-administer the next injections at the site under 
supervision of authorized staff. 
CR is defined as the absence of new lesions and complete healing of established lesions (except 
for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or erythema from resolving lesions). CR on minimal 
therapy (CRmin) is defined as the absence of new lesions and complete healing of established 
2 months (8 weeks). In non-Japanese participants, randomization will be stratified by disease 
status (experiencing flare and newly diagnosed), disease severity (PDAI activity score <30 and 
with 
population.  
All participants, regardless of treatment assignment, will concomitantly receive oral prednisone 
(or equivalent such as prednisolone) at 0.5 mg/kg qd starting dose. Except for oral prednisone (or 
equivalent), no other systemic therapies (eg, immunosuppressants, IVIg, immunoadsorption, 
anti-CD20 biologics) will be permitted during the trial.  
Participants will visit the clinic weekly until CR and for a minimum of 6 weeks to receive IMP 
and be evaluated for disease activity and disease outcome. After CR, IMP will be administered 
weekly at on-site or at home visits by a nurse until CRmin. At any post-baseline visit before DC 
is achieved, the prednisone dose will be adjusted by incrementing dosage according to clinical 
judgment, with the recommendation to increase by 1 or more steps (refer to Table 3)  in case of 
disease progression or insufficient clinical change. To facilitate common judgments among 
investigators, recommendations for assessment of disease progression and insufficient clinical 
change are:  
 Disease progression: increase of at least 5 in PDAI activity score compared to 
baseline score, observed at any post-baseline visit before DC. 
 Insufficient clinical change: absence of DC after 3 to 4 weeks of the participant being 
treated at the starting baseline prednisone (or equivalent) dose or after 3 to 4 weeks of 
any new incremented dose of prednisone. 
The recommendations of the prednisone dose escalation are: 
 Stepwise escalation of prednisone dose by 1 or more steps according to clinical 
judgment in case of disease progression. 
 Adjustment by incrementing dosage by 1 step in case of insufficient clinical change.
 Possible further escalation from the previous step by 1 or more steps, according to 
clinical judgment and under the same recommendation as above. 
 Maximum escalation to 1.5 mg/kg qd for 3 weeks. 
If, after a minimum of 3 weeks of oral prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg qd, DC is not attained, then the 
participant will be considered a treatment failure. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 46 For participants achieving DC with a daily prednisone dose of 0.5 mg/kg, prednisone will be 
maintained at 0.5 mg/kg qd until CR and 2 weeks thereafter, or until EoC (defined as the time at 
which no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 2 weeks and approximately 80% of 
lesions have healed) and 4 weeks thereafter, after which tapering will be initiated. For 
participants achieving DC with an escalated prednisone dose (ie, >0.5 mg/kg qd), the prednisone 
dose will be maintained until 2 weeks after achieving DC, then tapering will be performed 
according to the following stepwise procedure: dose reductions by 0.25 mg/kg qd (according to 
Table 3 ) every 2 weeks until the starting dose is reached (ie, 0.5 mg/kg qd). Then the starting 
dose (0.5 mg/kg qd) will be maintained until a sustained CR is achieved for 2 weeks, after which 
further tapering will be initiated, or prednisone tapering below 0.5 mg/kg qd may be initiated in 
case of sustained EoC for at least 4 weeks. Further tapering will be performed thereafter, as long 
as CR or EoC are sustained. The rules for tapering are shown in Table 3 . Each new tapered 
prednisone dose until 20 mg/day must be maintained for 2 weeks. Then, the prednisone dose is 
further tapered by 2.5 mg/day per week. When 10 mg/day is reached, this dose level will be 
maintained until CRmin has been achieved. Prednisone can then be further tapered upon clinical 
judgment by the investigator.  
In case of flare in the period between DC and CRmin, the prednisone dose will be increased. A 
flare is defined by the appearance of 3 or more new lesions in a 4-week period that do not heal 
spontaneously within 1 week, or by the extension of established lesions in a participant who had 
achieved DC. If the flare occurs after CR and IMP was administered at home by a nurse, the 
participant will resume weekly on-site visits until he/she achieves CR again. Participants who are 
not controlled by a prednisone dose that is 2 dose levels above the dose at which the flare 
between DC and CRmin is observed and that is at least 0.3 mg/kg/day (eg, according to Table 3 ) 
will be considered treatment failures. At visits when at least 1 new lesion is observed or 
established lesions remain extensive without being defined as a flare, the prednisone dose will be 
maintained or may be increased, according to clinical judgment. If the lesion resolves, tapering 
of the prednisone dose will be pursued as planned.  
Participants who experience treatment failure, or flare after achieving CRmin, will be allowed to 
roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than W31. Participants who do not roll over 
into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 will complete the treatment-free follow-up period. 
Participants experiencing an SAE related to prednisone may also benefit from an early roll over 
to the OLE trial, according to clinical judgment. 
Trial procedures will be performed per the SoA as detailed in Section 1.3.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Trial Design 
Concomitant therapy of oral prednisone at a starting dose level of 0.5 mg/kg per day:  The 
active treatment (efgartigimod PH20 SC) will be used in association with oral prednisone (or 
prednisolone as prednisone equivalent) at the starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day, because results 
of the phase 2 study ARGX-113-1701 showed that CR was achieved best in combination with 
prednisone at doses ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg per day. Taking into account that the 
proposed trial plans to include participants of higher disease severity (moderate to severe, instead 
of mild-to-moderate in phase 2), a concomitant prednisone dose of 0.5 mg/kg per day has been 
chosen as a starting dose, with an active stepwise tapering schedule initiated when CR is 
achieved (Section 6.8.1 ).  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 47 Prednisone dose escalation for achieving DC: Disease activity varies among pemphigus 
participants. In addition, oral prednisone doses as part of standard of care ranges from 1.0–1.5 
mg/kg per day. Rapid dose adjustment by incremental doses of prednisone is therefore allowed 
to achieve DC (Section 6.8.1 ). This approach is taken to allow for timely DC and therefore 
avoiding participants with uncontrolled disease symptoms dropping out of the trial early.   
Dose escalation guidance is based on disease progression or insufficient clinical change before 
DC happens or flare. Whereas flare is well-defined by guidelines (appearance of 3 or more new 
lesions a month that do not heal within 1 week, or extension of established lesions), disease 
progression and insufficient clinical change are not defined by consensus. Accordingly, the trial 
protocol specifies that the assessment of these conditions will be based on clinical judgment. In 
order to facilitate some common judgments between investigators, recommendations for 
assessment of disease progression and insufficient clinical change are:   
 For disease progression, an increase in the active PDAI activity score of at least 5 
compared to baseline or the preceding visit, as observed at any post-baseline visit 
before DC  
 For insufficient clinical change, the absence of DC for 3 to 4 weeks after baseline or 
after a new incremented dose of prednisone.   
Treatment failure:  Prednisone dose escalation in the trial will happen in a stepwise approach 
(from 0.5 to 0.75, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 mg/kg per day), investigators being able to increase the dose by 
1 or more steps according to the severity of the disease progression. The prednisone dose of 
1.5 mg/kg per day for 3 weeks without DC defines treatment failure, in accordance with the 
guidelines.24 In such circumstances, participants will be considered as nonresponders and will be 
invited to roll over prematurely into the OLE (trial ARGX-113-1905). Additionally, flare 
between DC and CRmin that is not controlled by a prednisone dose that is 2 dose levels above 
the dose at which the flare is observed and that is of at least 0.3 mg/kg qd (refer to Table 3) or 
the occurrence of an SAE considered related to prednisone by the investigator will be defined as 
treatment failure. 
Prednisone tapering: Two weeks after DC is achieved after an escalated prednisone dose above 
0.5 mg/kg qd, prednisone tapering will begin (Section 6.8.1 ). Prednisone tapering is a procedure 
that is applied by all practitioners, in order to minimize the side effects of corticosteroids while 
preventing a flare of the disease. In this trial:  
 Two-week intervals between tapering are defined with a step down of 0.25 mg/kg 
from 1.5 to 0.5 mg/kg per day (eg, from 1.5 to 1.25 mg/kg per day, then to 1 mg/kg 
and 0.75 mg/kg per day; refer to Table 3 ). The dosage of prednisone at which CR is 
achieved (which cannot be lower than the starting dose 0.5 mg/kg per day) will be 
maintained for 2 weeks after CR for observing a sustained CR, or prednisone tapering 
may be initiated or continued in case of sustained EoC (defined by the time at which 
no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 2 weeks and approximately 80% of 
lesions have healed) for at least 4 weeks.  
When CR is observed on daily prednisone of no lower than 0.5 mg/kg for 2 weeks, or 
when sustained EoC is observed, tapering may be initiated (see Section 6.8.1 ). Each 
new tapered prednisone dose until 20 mg/day must be maintained for 2 weeks. Then, 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 48 the prednisone dose is further tapered by 2.5 mg/day per week. When 10 mg/day is 
reached, this dose level will be maintained until CRmin has been achieved.  
When CRmin is achieved, prednisone can be tapered further upon clinical judgment, 
with the recommendation of a prednisone decrease by 2.5 mg/day every 4 weeks. 
When transient lesions appear, prednisone tapering will be temporarily delayed, or prednisone 
may be increased according to clinical judgment. Dose escalation will be performed when flare 
occurs. Taken together, the trial aims to be as close as possible to the real-world clinical practice 
regarding the prednisone regimen policy, while it allows studying the potential of prednisone 
sparing when associated with efgartigimod PH20 SC treatment.  
Definitions of clinical outcomes:  Consensual definitions of the most important clinical 
outcomes have been established through international guidelines24, and are now accepted by the 
vast majority of clinicians taking care of participants with PV and PF. They include in particular 
DC (no new lesions and established lesions beginning to heal), which corresponds to the 
beginning of the healing, and CR (no new lesions and established lesions completely healed), 
which is the end of the healing. The international guidelines recommend assessing CR in the 
light of the concomitant therapy status by corticosteroids, eg, achievement of CR associated with  this is more clinically 
meaningful than CR itself. Rollover to the OLE trial will occur at W31 or earlier in case of 
treatment failure or flare after CRmin.  
Flare is defined in international guidelines as the appearance of 3 or more new lesions in a 4 
week period that do not heal spontaneously within 1 week, or the extension of established lesions 
in a participant who had achieved DC. The appearance of new lesions that do not qualify as flare 
will be recorded as new transient or new persistent lesions. Transient new lesions are defined as 
new lesions that heal within 1 week. Persistent new lesions are defined as new lesions that last 
more than 1 week. As nonspecific lesions frequently occur in participants with pemphigus, it will 
be the duty of the investigators to confirm the nature of new pemphigus lesions through a 
physical examination during the visits. A historical report of new lesions by participants will not 
be evidence of a diagnosis of transient lesions or flare of pemphigus unless deemed indicative of 
pemphigus by the investigator. 
Proportion of participants who achieve CRmin within 30 weeks as primary endpoint and 
treatment duration of 30 weeks:  A trial duration of 30 weeks was selected based on results 
from the phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1701 in participants with pemphigus for encompassing the 
observation of the primary endpoint of CRmin in the majority of participants belonging to the 
active group. The time point at which CRmin is anticipated to be achieved for most participants 
varies between 24 and 30 weeks in participants under active treatment and depends on the body 
weight of the participants. Accounting for this variation between participants, all participants 
having achieved CRmin within the 30 weeks of the trial will be considered in the primary 
endpoint as responsive to treatment.
Tailored regimen of efgartigimod PH20 SC and rollover to the OLE: The trial comprises a 
screening period of up to 3 weeks, a treatment period until CRmin of up to 30 weeks, and an 
8-week follow-up period for participants who do not enroll into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. 
A tailored efgartigimod PH20 SC regimen is proposed due to its rapid effect and the variability 
of disease activity between participants. Participants will be administered the efgartigimod PH20 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 49 SC with concomitant low dose prednisone regimen subcutaneously until CRmin is achieved. 
Then, efgartigimod PH20 SC administration will be stopped, whereas the concomitant treatment 
by prednisone will be pursued with the option for further tapering to achieve CR off therapy 
(CRoff).   
4.3. Justification for Dose 
SC administration is highly preferred over an IV formulation for pemphigus patients in view of 
the expected need for prolonged weekly administration. Therefore, efgartigimod with rHuPH20 
will be administered SC each week for a maximum of 30 weeks in this trial. To achieve a fast PD 
effect and clinical response a dose of  mg will be administered in the first 2 weeks, followed 
by weekly doses of 1000 mg to maintain the PD effect and related clinical response. 
Active pemphigus is seen by most clinicians as a disease that requires urgent control. Signs of 
activity include the extension of the lesions (eg, mucosal lesions becoming mucocutaneous in 
PV) and the sharp increase in anti-Dsg serum levels. In such circumstances, respiratory 
infections related to lesions of the mouth or throat as well as skin infections are frequent. 
Infections are today the first cause of mortality in pemphigus. The exposure to non-targeted 
immunosuppressive therapies such as high doses of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants is a 
co-morbidity factor.5 
Trial ARGX-113-1701 showed that IV administration of efgartigimod resulted in a rapid DC 
with or without associated prednisone, as well as CR associated with low to intermediate 
prednisone doses (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg per day).  
In view of the severity of the disease a fast onset of action is desirable. Therefore, the proposed 
dose regimen for this trial starts with a dose that achieves close to maximal IgG reduction within 
2 weeks with a goal to reduce the time to a clinically relevant improvement. Subsequently, a 
lower weekly dose is expected to maintain improvement in this patient population. 
As pathogenic IgGs are key to the pathophysiology of pemphigus, the selected doses and dose 
regimen target a nearly maximal PD effect (ie, reduction of pathogenic IgGs). Considering the 
chronic nature of pemphigus, where patients are typically treated chronically for years with 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, the dosing regimen of a weekly regimen, reflects the 
need for chronic treatment to keep suppressing pathogenic IgGs. 
Results of the phase 1 trial in healthy subjects, the phase 2 studies in participants with MG, ITP, 
and pemphigus, and PK/PD modeling analysis, indicate that a dose of 10 mg/kg efgartigimod, 
administered weekly (q7d) through IV infusion achieved close to maximal IgG reduction, 
resulted in a reduction of pathogenic autoantibodies, and was associated with clinical efficacy in 
participants with MG, ITP, and pemphigus. Furthermore, this dose was considered safe and 
well-tolerated in all populations. The PK and PD profile of efgartigimod appeared to be similar 
in all investigated populations so far. Therefore, a flat SC dose resulting in a similar PD effect as 
achieved with 10 mg/kg weekly IV administration is targeted as a maintenance dose for 
participants with pemphigus.
PK and PD data from trial ARGX-113-1901, which investigated different efgartigimod PH20 SC 
doses, were used for a population PK/PD analysis to find an efgartigimod PH20 SC dose that 
results in a similar PD effect compared to efgartigimod 10 mg/kg IV. Simulations were 
performed to include parameter uncertainty. Outcome measures investigating comparable effects 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 50 on IgG levels as the 10 mg/kg IV dosed weekly, include area under effect-time curve days 22 to 
29, maximal IgG reduction between day 22 and 29, and trough IgG reduction at day 29. 
To maximize the probability of clinical improvement, both the median values and the 90% CI 
ranges of the PD outcome parameters were considered in the dose selection. A SC dose was 
selected for which the predicted median value on each of the 3 outcome parameters has at least 
reached the median value of the IV dosing, and for which the lower limits of the 90% CI are 
predicted to fall within the lower limits of the IgG reduction of 10 mg/kg IV dosing. A dose of 
1000 mg efgartigimod PH20 SC meets all these requirements. 
Based on these simulations, a weekly dose of 1000 mg efgartigimod PH20 SC is selected as the 
maintenance dose for this trial. The predicted IgG reduction with weekly efgartigimod PH20 SC 
1000 mg doses is comparable to that of efgartigimod IV 10 mg/kg. 
Based on the chronic dosing data from nonclinical studies, it is anticipated that this chronic 
dosing regimen in pemphigus is safe. A chronic dosing regimen of weekly IV infusions of 
10 mg/kg efgartigimod, or a SC equivalent as proposed for pemphigus, is anticipated to be safe 
as indicated by a 6-month study in cynomolgus monkey. In this study, animals were dosed with 
weekly efgartigimod infusions of up to 100 mg/kg. The no-observed-adverse-effect level 
(NOAEL) was set at the highest administered dose of 100 mg/kg. Both the C max and exposure 
data at the NOAEL observed in the nonclinical toxicity studies have been considered to provide 
sufficient exposure multiples to support the proposed dosing regimen for this trial. Furthermore, 
a bridging toxicity study of efgartigimod co-administered with rHuPH20 has been performed. In 
this 12-week bridging SC repeat-dose study, cynomolgus monkeys were treated with 
efgartigimod SC ± rHuPH20. As efgartigimod SC was well-tolerated, without toxicologically 
relevant systemic adverse findings up to the highest dose tested, a NOAEL above 100 mg/kg 
±2000 U/mL rHuPH20 (the highest tested dose) was established. No efgartigimod-related 
toxicity via SC injection was noted for behavior, external appearance, condition of feces, body 
weight, or food and water consumption, and there were no overt signs of toxicity or mortality or 
any influence on the myeloid:erythroid ratio in bone marrow. 
In view of the severity of the disease, a fast onset of action is desirable. Therefore, the dose 
regimen for the phase 3 trial starts with a dose that achieves close to maximal IgG reduction 
within 2 weeks, after which the PD effect is maintained with a lower weekly dose.  
PK/PD modeling indicated that 2 weekly doses of mg efgartigimod PH20 SC result within 
2 weeks in total IgG reduction close to maximal IgG reduction comparable to maximal IgG 
reductions achieved at steady state with 1000 mg efgartigimod PH20 SC. 
A maintenance dose of 1000 mg efgartigimod has been selected for this trial to be administered 
as weekly SC administrations coformulated with rHuPH20 until CRmin.  
4.4. End of Study Definition

tract infection) or had stabilization of a chronic medical problem (eg, uncontrolled 
hypertension). 
 Participants who are not on a stable dose of a concomitant medication prior to 
randomization as per inclusion and exclusion criteria may be rescreened once the 
stable dose criterion is met. 
The decision to rescreen participants may be optional based on clinical state of the participant 
and the decision to rescreen will solely be made per the sponsor’s discretion on a case-by-case 
basis. For the purpose of rescreening, a new ICF should be completed.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 57 Only participants enrolled in the trial may receive IMP. IMP administration must be performed 
by authorized and trained site staff or by an adequately trained and supervised participant or 
caregiver.  
6.2.3.  Storage 
Efgartigimod PH20 SC and placebo will be supplied to the pharmacy or substitute at the 
investigational site by and under the responsibility of the sponsor’s designated IMP supply 
vendor. The IMP supply vendor will also provide the investigator with the certificate of analysis, 
certificate of conformity, and European Union qualified person release documents (if 
applicable).
The IMP must be stored refrigerated (2°C to 8°C or 35°F to 46°F) in its secondary packaging, 
should not be exposed to freezing temperatures, should not be shaken, and should be protected 
from direct sunlight during storage at the clinical site. 
The investigator (or his/her designee) is responsible for the correct and safe storage of the IMP 
assigned to the clinical site, in a locked, secure storage facility with access limited to those 
individuals authorized to dispense the IMP and maintained within the appropriate temperature 
ranges. 
Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused IMP are provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual. 
For home administrations, the participant is responsible for the correct storage of the IMP at 
home. Participants will receive a guide on transport, storage and temperature monitoring of the 
IMP. 
6.2.4.  Accountability 
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
Detailed instructions on accountability of the IMP will be included in the Pharmacy Manual. 
6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
Once the participant has provided informed consent, the site will enroll the participant and a 
screening number will be allocated through the interactive response technology (IRT). 
The results of all screening procedures have to be available prior to baseline (day 1) to determine 
the eligibility for entering the trial. Randomization should be performed as soon as the 
participants meet the appropriate criteria to begin treatment. 
Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo. 
As this is a randomized, double-blinded trial, access to the IMP treatment assigned will be 
limited. No trial team members from the investigating staff, the sponsor (except the sponsor’s 
clinical trial supplies team), and the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee (except the 
specialty laboratories responsible for PK, PD, and immunogenicity [ie, ADA] analysis), will 
have access to the information related to IMP treatment assigned until after database lock.  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 58 The following data will remain blinded until database lock:
PK
 PD 
 Immunogenicity 
 Albumin and total protein 
 Exploratory research  
An independent unblinded data safety monitoring board (DSMB), including an independent 
statistician, may review all unblinded safety data as specified in Section 10.1.5 .
6.3.1.  Emergency Unblinding 
The process of breaking the blind will be handled through the IRT.
Participant safety is of utmost importance. If a safety issue is deemed a medical emergency by an 
investigator and timing is critical, then the investigator is permitted to use the IRT directly to 
unblind an IMP assignment code in order to ensure the medical emergency is properly managed 
and participant safety is maintained. If the issue is not deemed an emergency and timing permits, 
then the investigator is encouraged to first discuss the need to break a blind with the medical 
monitor at the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee or the sponsor’s medical expert in 
order to preserve the integrity of study data. 
If the blind is broken by the investigator, then it may be broken only for the participant 
concerned, and the IMP treatment assignment should not be revealed to the trial team members 
from the sponsor, nor from the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee, pharmacy 
personnel, or other site staff. 
Once unblinded, the participant should be discontinued from the trial. When the participant is 
withdrawn from the trial, the participant will be followed for 8 weeks for ongoing safety 
monitoring.  
Pertinent information regarding the circumstances of unblinding of a participant’s IMP treatment 
code must be documented in the participant’s source documents and electronic case report form 
(eCRF) without breaking the blind.
The sponsor and monitor at the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee must be notified 
immediately if a participant and/or investigator is unblinded during the course of the trial.
6.4. Trial Intervention Compliance 
The participants are dosed by qualified approved personnel. They will receive IMP directly from 
the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. Participants or their caregivers will be 
invited to receive training in self-administration or caregiver-supported administration 
respectively, and will be permitted to perform administration of the IMP on-site under 
supervision from the authorized staff. The date and time of each dose administered at the site 
will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF.  
The investigator should promote treatment compliance by stating that compliance is necessary 
for the participant’s safety and the validity of the trial. The prescribed dose, timing, and mode of 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 59 administration cannot be changed. All dates, start and end time of IMP administration, and any 
deviations from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRF. 
A sponsor’s designated monitor will review the pharmacy records at each site including the drug 
accountability and dispensing records on which the pharmacist or designated person should 
record all IMP released for participant use. The sponsor’s designated monitor will compare the 
dispensing record and vials with the individual participant’s identifiers, kit number, and visit 
schedule to confirm that the participant received the correct treatment and dose, and that the 
dosing schedule is correct. 
Errors that are identified will be communicated to the site personnel to ensure that the errors are 
not repeated. The sponsor’s designated monitor’s report will include details of any missed doses, 
medication errors (see Section 6.7), treatment or scheduling errors, and the associated 
explanations. It will be evaluated if these dosing errors will be reported as protocol deviations in 
the clinical database. All supplies and pharmacy documentation must be made available 
throughout the trial for the sponsor’s designated monitor to review. 
6.4.1.  Handling Missed Doses of the Investigational Medicinal Product 
All efforts will be made to ensure that the participant receives all administrations of IMP within 
the allowed visit windows. 
If a dose of IMP is missed or cannot be administered within the window of ±2 days of the 
planned administration day, this should be communicated to the medical monitor. The next dose 
should be planned as scheduled in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3). 
6.4.2.  Protocol Deviations 
The investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the approved protocol 
without agreement of the sponsor, and prior to review and documented approval of an 
amendment from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) and 
regulatory authority as per local regulation, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to trial participants, or when the change involves only logistical or administrative aspects 
of the trial (eg, change of telephone numbers, etc). The investigator (or designee) should 
document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol. 
6.5. Dose Modification 
Not applicable. 
6.6. Continued Access to Study Intervention After the End of the Trial 
Efgartigimod PH20 SC or placebo SC will be administered subcutaneously until CRmin. 
Participants at the EoS visit or ED visit in trial ARGX-113-1904 will be given the option to 
enroll into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 after confirmation of eligibility, while retaining the 
blinding of trial ARGX-113-1904. For each participant, the date of the baseline visit in the OLE 
trial ARGX-113-1905 will be the same as the date of the EoS visit in trial ARGX-113-1904. 
There is no need to schedule an additional visit for a roll over visit. At baseline of the OLE 
study, participants will be treated according to their clinical status at entry of the OLE trial 
ARGX-113-1905, as defined in the trial protocol. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 60 Week 34 (follow-up visit 1) or week 38 (follow-up visit 2) is the EoS for participants who do not 
enroll in the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. The week 38 follow-up visit will only be required for 
those participants who were still receiving IMP at least 1 visit between week 26 and EoS/ED. 
For participants who ended treatment prior to week 26, week 34 will be the EoS visit.
If a participant withdraws/discontinues early and does not roll over to the OLE trial 
(ARGX-113-1905), usual treatment will be administered, if required, in accordance with the trial 
site’s standard of care and generally accepted medical practice depending on the participant’s 
individual needs. Depending on the clinical status of the participant and the clinical judgment 
from the investigator, completion of the treatment-free follow-up period may be performed. 
6.7. Treatment of Overdose 
For this trial, a variation of more than 10% of the amount of efgartigimod will be considered an 
overdose. 
An overdose is defined as a deliberate or accidental administration of IMP to a participant, at a 
dose greater than that assigned to that participant per the trial protocol. 
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 
 Contact the medical monitor immediately. 
 Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities.
 Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in 
the eCRF. 
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in 
consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 
6.8. Concomitant Therapy 
All concomitant medications and procedures, whether allowed or not, must be recorded in the 
eCRF (including the name, indication for use, dose/schedule, start and stop dates). 
6.8.1.  Concomitant Pemphigus Therapy
All participants, regardless of treatment assignment, will concomitantly receive oral prednisone 
(or equivalent such as prednisolone) at 0.5 mg/kg qd as a starting dose. Except for oral 
prednisone (or equivalent), no other systemic therapies (eg, immunosuppressants, IVIg, 
immunoadsorption, anti-CD20 biologics) will be permitted during the trial. 
At any post-baseline visit before DC is achieved, the prednisone dose will be adjusted by 
incrementing dosage according to clinical judgment, with the recommendation to increase by 1 
or more steps (refer to Table 3)  in case of disease progression or insufficient clinical change. To 
facilitate common judgments among investigators, recommendations for assessment of disease 
progression and insufficient clinical change are:  
 Disease progression: increase of at least 5 in PDAI activity score compared to 
baseline score, observed at any post-baseline visit before DC.
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 61  Insufficient clinical change: absence of DC after 3 to 4 weeks of the participant being 
treated at the starting baseline prednisone (or equivalent) dose or after 3 to 4 weeks of 
any new incremented dose of prednisone. 
The recommendations of the prednisone dose escalation are: 
 Stepwise escalation of daily prednisone dose by 1 or more steps according to clinical 
judgment in case of disease progression. 
 Adjustment by incrementing dosage by 1 step according to clinical judgment in case 
of insufficient clinical change. 
 Possible further escalation from the previous step by 1 or more steps, according to 
clinical judgment and under the same recommendation as above. 
 Maximum escalation to 1.5 mg/kg qd for 3 weeks. 
If, after a minimum of 3 weeks of oral prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg qd, DC is not attained, then the 
participant will be considered a treatment failure. 
For participants achieving DC with a daily prednisone dose of 0.5 mg/kg, prednisone will be 
maintained at 0.5 mg/kg qd until CR and 2 weeks thereafter, or until EoC (defined as the time at 
which no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 2 weeks and approximately 80% of 
lesions have healed) and 4 weeks thereafter, after which tapering will be initiated. For 
participants achieving DC with an escalated prednisone dose (ie, >0.5 mg/kg qd), the prednisone 
dose will be maintained until 2 weeks after achieving DC, then tapering will be performed 
according to the following stepwise procedure: dose reductions by 0.25 mg/kg qd (according to 
Table 3 ) every 2 weeks until the starting dose is reached (ie, 0.5 mg/kg qd). Then the starting 
dose (0.5 mg/kg qd) will be maintained until a sustained CR is achieved for 2 weeks, after which 
further tapering will be initiated, or prednisone tapering below 0.5 mg/kg qd may be initiated in 
case of sustained EoC for at least 4 weeks. Further tapering will be performed thereafter, as long 
as CR or EoC are sustained. The rules for tapering are shown in Table 3 . Each new tapered 
prednisone dose until 20 mg/day must be maintained for 2 weeks. Then, the prednisone dose is 
further tapered by 2.5 mg/day per week. When 10 mg/day is reached, this dose level will be 
maintained until CRmin has been achieved. Prednisone can then be further tapered upon clinical 
judgment by the investigator. 
In case of flare in the period between DC and CRmin, the prednisone dose will be increased. A 
flare is defined by the appearance of 3 or more new lesions in a 4-week period that do not heal 
spontaneously within 1 week, or by the extension of established lesions in a participant who had 
achieved DC. If the flare occurs after CR and IMP was administered at home by a nurse, the 
participant will resume weekly on-site visits until he/she achieves CR again. Participants who are 
not controlled by a prednisone dose that is 2 dose levels above the dose at which the flare 
between DC and CRmin is observed and that is at least 0.3 mg/kg/day (according to Table 3 ) will 
be considered treatment failures. At visits when at least 1 new lesion is observed or established 
lesions remain extensive without being defined as a flare, the prednisone dose will be maintained 
or may be increased, according to clinical judgment. If the lesion resolves, tapering of the 
prednisone dose will be pursued as planned. 
The investigator should not implement any deviation from the concomitant oral prednisone (or 
equivalent) regimen, except for immediate safety concerns of the participants. After taking 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022

 Skin-directed topical corticosteroids  
 Skin-directed topical antibiotics, antiseptics and moisturizers  
Buccal and mucosa-directed corticosteroids, antiseptics and anesthetics 
Analgesics 
Usual supportive treatments associated with intake of oral corticosteroids (eg,

PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
7.1. Discontinuation of Trial Intervention 
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue trial 
intervention. If study intervention is permanently discontinued, the participant will enter the 
treatment-free follow-up period or be invited to roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. 
See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and 
follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed (refer to Section 1.3). 
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal From the Trial
A participant may withdraw from the trial at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. 
At the time of withdrawal from the trial, if possible, an ED visit (equivalent to EoS visit) should 
be conducted, as shown in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3). Refer to the SoA for data to be 
collected at the time of trial discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that 
need to be completed. The participant will be offered to enter the treatment-free follow-up 
period. A comment must be added to the source records to note if the participant accepts or 
rejects to perform the EoS visit and/or the follow-up period. 
If the participant withdraws consent, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the trial, he or she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must notify the sponsor immediately and document this in the 
site trial records. 
Reasons for ED from the trial include: 
 It is in the participant’s best interest – discussion with the medical monitor of the 
CRO/sponsor’s designee and the sponsor’s medical director is encouraged prior to 
discontinuation 
 The participant experiences a severe AE or SAE, or a clinically significant change in 
a laboratory test, if the investigator deems discontinuation appropriate 
 The participant became pregnant, which requires follow-up until delivery of the baby 
 The participant has active PV or PF disease as judged by the investigator, notably 
despite prednisone escalation 
Physician decision 
Unblinding occurred
If allergic angioedema or other serious hypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis 
or anaphylactoid reactions occurs. Administration of IMP should be discontinued

argenx Confidential 66 7.3. Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the trial site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required trial 
visit: 
 The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or 
should continue in the trial. 
 Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (if possible, 3 telephone calls 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the 
participant’s medical record. 
 Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
been lost to follow-up.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the trial as a whole are described in Section 10.1.

argenx Confidential 67 8. TRIAL ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Trial procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3). Adherence to 
the trial requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for trial 
conduct. 
When a protocol-required procedure cannot be performed, the investigator will document the 
reason, and any corrective and preventive actions that he/she has taken to ensure that the normal 
processes are adhered to in source documents. The trial team should be informed of these 
incidents in a timely manner. This will be considered a protocol deviation and will be recorded 
accordingly.
Screening 
At screening, all eligibility assessments should be performed after obtaining informed consent. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed before enrollment to confirm that 
potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable. 
The first day of the screening period is the day of the screening visit (the date of first screening 
visit is defined by the date of first screening procedure after signing the ICF).
Treatment Period
Each participant should attend each trial visit on the designated days. There is a permissible visit 
window of ±2 days during the treatment period. 
From signing of the ICF until the last trial-related activity, all AEs that occur and all concomitant 
medications that are taken and procedures performed, whether allowed or not, during the trial are 
to be recorded on the appropriate screens in the eCRF.
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed first with the CRO’s medical monitor/sponsor’s 
designee and then with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if 
the participant should continue or discontinue IMP. Additionally, an independent unblinded 
DSMB may review all unblinded safety data on a regular basis as specified in Section 10.1.5 .
A minimum of 6 on-site visits, V1(BL)/W1 to W6, is required before switching to home 
administrations, even if CR is achieved earlier than W6. Home visits are allowed once 
participants achieve CR, but not before the W7 visit. The investigator should call the participant
at least every 2 weeks until CRmin is achieved to confirm the participant is still in CR. On-site 
visits may continue at the investigator’s discretion.
During the IMP treatment period, all assessments and procedures have to be performed before 
the start of the IMP administration, except for the continuous assessment of AEs (see 
Section 8.4), and the recording of concomitant therapy and procedures (see Section 8.3.5 ).
At all visits, the efficacy and QoL assessments should be performed first, prior to any other trial-
specific procedure with the only exception of obtaining informed consent at screening. The 
EQ-5D-5L and ABQOL should be performed prior to all other efficacy assessments 
(Section 8.2).

All participants will complete W31/ED, which will be EoS for participants who enroll in the 
OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. 
Unscheduled Visits 
In case of suspected new lesions as reported by the participant, AEs, flare, or other safety 
reasons, participants should come to the clinic. This may require an unscheduled visit or can 
coincide with a planned observational or IMP-only visit. At this visit, assessments need to be 
performed as follows: 
- Assessments as specified in Table 4  below:  
Note: In case of new lesions or flare, the assessments indicated with footnote “b” in 
Table 4  should be performed only once at the visit where the new lesions or the flare is 
confirmed. These should not be repeated at subsequent visits (even if more new lesions 
develop at these subsequent visits or the flare is sustained) unless the subsequent visits 
coincide with planned observational or IMP-only visits and the assessments are to be 
performed during those visits per the SoA . 
- Assessments specified for the planned observational or IMP-only visit per the SoA 
(Section 1.3), if applicable. 
In case the participant was in CR when the new lesions/flare was observed: the planned weekly 
IMP-only or observational visits should be performed on-site (home visits are not allowed) for 
disease assessment and PDAI until CR is reached again. 
In case the participant was in CRmin or CRoff at the time of the new lesions: the participant 
should return for weekly on-site visits for disease assessment and PDAI until CR is reached 
again. This will require unscheduled visits or can coincide with planned observational visits. In 
case flare is confirmed in participants who had achieved CRmin, participants will be allowed to 
roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than week 31.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 70 8.2. Efficacy Assessments
The efficacy of the IMP will be assessed at on-site visits by the investigator, assessing the 
following: PDAI, DC, EoC, CR, CRmin, CRoff, and flare. The investigator will record the daily 
prednisone dose since the last visit, and treatment failures at on-site visits. For home visits, the 
investigator should call the participant at least every 2 weeks until CRmin is achieved to confirm 
the participant is still in CR.
The clinical activity of pemphigus will be assessed using the PDAI (see Section 10.8), which has 
been developed by the International Pemphigus Committee.24,27It is an evaluation tool able to 
capture the extent of the disease on the skin and mucosa. It is a validated system, which was 
found to be reproducible, reliable in the inter-rater assessment, and correlates with the global 
physician impression of extent. It is more sensitive than another developed scale, called ABSIS, 
especially in the pemphigus population with mild-to-moderate intensity. The PDAI has a 
possible score ranging from 0 to 263. Participants of mild severity distribute between PDAI 
activity scores of 1 to 15, those with moderate severity range from 15 to 44, and participants with  
8.3. Safety Assessments 
The planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3).
8.3.1.  Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA (refer to 
Section 1.3). 
A physical examination will include, at a minimum, an assessment of general appearance, skin, 
head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, 
musculoskeletal/extremities, abdomen, breast, and cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and 
genital/rectal systems. Any signs related to the natural history of pemphigus are not to be 
reported as physical abnormalities. 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.
Abnormalities in physical examination at screening will be reported as medical history in the 
eCRF. At all other trial visits, new clinically significant abnormal or worsened pre-existing 
conditions will be reported as an AE. 
8.3.2.  Height and Weight 
Height and weight will be measured at screening, and body mass index (BMI) will be calculated 
accordingly. Weight will be measured again at week 15 (or the first on-site visit thereafter if 
week 15 does not coincide with an on-site visit), and EoS/ED. Weight will also be measured if 
there has been an obvious change since the last measurement. For the assessment of height and 
weight, participants will be required to remove their shoes and wear light indoor clothing.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 71 8.3.3.  Vital Signs 
The assessment of vital signs (supine blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature) will be 
performed at the time points indicated in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3) and should be completed 
predose at visits when IMP is administered. 
Supine blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using standard equipment after at least 
10 minutes rest.
It is recommended that the method used to measure body temperature (eg, orally, tympanic, 
rectal, axillary, skin, temporal) at screening is maintained throughout the trial for each 
participant. 
Abnormalities in vital signs at screening will be reported as medical history in the eCRF. At all 
other trial visits, new clinically significant abnormal or worsened pre-existing vital sign 
abnormalities will be reported as an AE. 
8.3.4.  Electrocardiography
Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed at the time points indicated in the SoA (refer to 
Section 1.3) and should be completed predose at visits when IMP is administered. 
ECGs will be acquired according to instructions provided by a centralized ECG reading facility 
where the ECGs will be centrally assessed. At a minimum, interval data (PR, QT, QTcF 
[Fridericia corrected QT interval], and QRS intervals), ventricular rate, and overall interpretation 
will be recorded for each ECG. Data will be transferred electronically for inclusion in the 
database.   
Abnormalities in ECG at screening will be reported as medical history in the eCRF. At all other 
trial visits, new clinically significant abnormal or worsened pre-existing ECG abnormalities will 
be reported as AEs.
8.3.5.  Medical and Surgical History 
All significant findings, surgeries, and pre-existing conditions present at screening must be 
reported on the relevant medical history/current medical conditions page of the eCRF, including 
start and end dates, if known. 
Information should be provided on medical and surgical history and concomitant medical 
conditions specifying those ongoing at screening. 
Details collected as a part of the medical history must include, but are not limited to, all previous 
treatment/therapy taken for pemphigus, including start and end dates, if known. 
All available vaccination history will be recorded as part of the participant’s prior medication for 
vaccinations received in the past, or concomitant medication for vaccinations received during the 
trial as described in the SoA (Section 1.3). Any vaccination information the participant, his/her 
caregiver, or his/her legally authorized representative can remember should be recorded in the 
eCRF (with the brand name of the vaccine and date of vaccination, if possible).  
For vaccines where multiple doses or boosters are received, only the last 1 must be recorded in 
the eCRF (with the brand name of the vaccine and the date of vaccine administration entered, if 
known).

argenx Confidential 72 8.3.6.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
This section is applicable globally, except for China. For China-specific instructions, refer to 
Section 10.16.1.2.
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, 
urinalysis, and serology (ie, viral testing) will be collected and analyzed at a central lab as 
indicated in the SoA (refer to Section 1.3) and Section 10.2. The urine sample for the pregnancy 
test will be analyzed locally. 
Participants may be rescreened (ie, redoing the full assessments as per SoA in Section 1.3) or 
retested once (ie, repeating 1 test, see Section 5.4) if still within the screening period. 
On days that IMP is administered, blood for laboratory assessments should be collected before 
dosing. 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated, at the discretion of the 
investigator. 
The estimated total maximum blood volume needed for a participant during the trial (when 
completing the trial) is approximately 910 mL for the entire duration of the trial. 
For all female participants of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed 
centrally at screening (on the samples taken for clinical laboratory tests), and a urine pregnancy 
test will be conducted and analyzed locally at the site visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3). A 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test will be run to confirm postmenopausal status and 
exclude that a woman is of childbearing potential; see Section 10.5. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all time 
points throughout the trial. The investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory values. If the 
investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it will be considered 
as a laboratory AE, however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current 
diagnosis, then it may be documented accordingly without being reported as an AE. 
The details of sampling, handling, storage, and transportation of the samples will be described in 
the Laboratory Manual. 
Refer to Section 10.6 for the addresses of the laboratories used for sample analyses.
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the trial should be recorded as an AE and repeated until the values return to normal or baseline 
or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. 
 If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the investigator, then the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified. 
 All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.2, must be 
conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the SoA (Section 1.3).  
 If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the event must be recorded in the eCRF.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 73 8.3.6.1.  Vaccination Antibodies Testing 
Vaccination antibodies testing will not be performed in China. 
Sites participating in the vaccination antibody testing will collect all available vaccination history 
from participants. Serum samples collected at screening and further visits according the SoA 
(Section 1.3) may be used to analyze vaccination antibodies and any response to vaccines 
received during the trial. Data from testing of vaccination antibodies will be described in a 
separate report. 
8.3.6.2.  Storage of Blood and Tissue Samples After the Trial 
This section is applicable globally, except for China. For China-specific instructions, refer to 
Section 10.16.1.2.1.
Any samples remaining after the laboratory analyses as defined in the protocol have been 
completed may be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the trial, in the laboratory or long-
term storage designated by the sponsor or research partners worldwide, for future additional 
medical, academic, or scientific research to address any scientific questions related to 
efgartigimod, FcRn biology, or pemphigus, unless this would not be allowed according to local 
regulations or the participant would not have agreed. 
In addition, blood and tissue samples may be used to validate methods to measure efgartigimod, 
antibodies, and biomarkers, as well as used for vaccination antibody testing and any other 
additional research interests. 
8.3.7.  Infections and Vaccinations 
Pemphigus patients are prone to develop infections. They include infections of the bronchi 
(bronchitis) and the lung (pneumonia), resulting from the mucosal pemphigus lesions of the 
upper respiratory tract, infections of the mouth and ear-nose-throat (ENT) system, 
superinfections of the skin, and infections of the genital and urinary tract. Concomitant and 
historical treatments by non-targeted therapies (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) or targeted 
therapies (rituximab) are co-morbidity factors able to trigger or aggravate these infections.  
In this trial, some measures able to mitigate the occurrence of infections are required, and other 
precautionary measures optimizing the prevention of infections are recommended. For these 
reasons, the following actions are excluded for trial entry (refer to Section 5.2):  the administration of live/attenuated vaccines (eg, measles, mumps, rubella, rotavirus, 
smallpox, chickenpox, yellow fever) within the 4-week period prior to baseline visit 
(exclusion criterion 15) or during the trial. 
 participants with an active or uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at 
screening (exclusion criterion 16). 
 Participants that tested positive for an active viral infection at screening with HBV 
type B or type C, and HIV (exclusion criterion 17). 
 participants with hypogammaglobulinemia, ie, total IgG <6 g/L (exclusion 
criterion 18).
The following measures prior to and during the study are highly recommended: 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 74  To initiate or renew administration of non-live, inactivated, polysaccharide or 
recombinant vaccines (eg, tetanus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, shingles) in participants 
susceptible to enter the trial, at least 4 weeks before baseline visit.  
 To vaccinate participants that are especially prone to or with an history of respiratory 
infections against Pneumococcus  or Streptococcus pneumoniae . 
 To vaccinate pemphigus participants with seasonal vaccines (eg, influenza virus), 
especially those susceptible to enter the trial in the winter months. 
 To screen for possible infections (eg, respiratory, skin, mouth, eyes, nose and throat, 
genitals) and, if appropriate, initiate antibiotic treatment before baseline visit. 
 To provide participants suffering from recurrent episodes of herpes simplex or herpes 
zoster with antiviral treatment throughout the trial treatment.
Any other preventive measure that may be considered for the safety of the participants can also 
be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the medical monitor of the CRO/sponsor’s designee 
and, subsequently, the sponsor’s medical monitor, before the participant enters the trial. 
All available vaccination history and any vaccination received during the study should be 
recorded in the eCRF with the brand name of the vaccine and the date of vaccine administration. 
8.3.8.  Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Risk Monitoring 
Not applicable. 
8.3.9.  Additional Safety Assessment 
As an additional assessment of the impact of glucocorticoid morbidity, the GTI will be used. It is 
a complementary scoring system to the overall report of AEs that are judged as related to 
glucocorticoids by investigators during interventional studies. It also enables the monitoring of 
long-term tolerability of glucocorticoids during their prolonged use during clinical practice.  
The original version of the GTI (GTI 1.0) has been developed as a prospective tool to assess the 
impact of glucocorticoid morbidity.38Its optimal use is in prospective, randomized, controlled-
clinical trials in which glucocorticoids are administered chronically, but the GTI has also been 
employed in real-world applications. In this trial, the GTI 2.0 will be used.39 In this new version, 
the weights derived in the initial GTI validation study are used to generate 2 scores from the 
composite GTI, ie, the CWS and the AIS. These scores and their rationales are briefly outlined 
below. For the sake of simplicity, we use the term “GTI” below to refer to the GTI 2.0 
instrument that will be used in this trial.
The GTI is composed of 2 components: 
 The Composite GTI (C-GTI), which serves as a primary instrument intended to 
capture common glucocorticoid toxicities (ie, toxicities that are likely due to 
glucocorticoid exposure and sensitive to cumulative doses over the period of 
6 months to 3 years). The C-GTI has 9 functional domains (specifically: BMI, 
glucose control, blood pressure, lipid metabolism, bone mineral density, muscle 
strength, skin toxicity, neuropsychiatric effects and infection). Each of the domains 
contains 3 to 4 weighted items that correspond to varying degrees of glucocorticoid 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 75 toxicity within their respective domain. Among the 9 GTI domains, bone mineral 
density is excluded if the GTI will be measured at intervals shorter than 1 year, 
because bone densitometry is not sufficiently reliable in measuring changes at shorter 
intervals. Therefore, in the context of the ARGX-113-1904 trial with a maximum 
duration of 30 weeks, the index is truncated by removing the “bone mineral density” 
domain. Development of the GTI beyond the original validation work has suggested 2 
approaches to analysis. These approaches provide complementary information about 
the ability of an investigational agent to reduce GC toxicity and also optimize the 
granularity with which the GTI captures the GC toxicity. The CWS is designed to 
assess cumulative GC toxicity, regardless of whether the toxicity has lasting effects or 
is transient. New toxicities that occur are added, but toxicities that appear to resolve 
on follow-up are not removed. Thus, the CWS serves as a lasting record of GC 
toxicity observed, and can only increase or remain the same over time. In the case of 
the presence of some GC toxicity at baseline, the AIS can be used to establish that a 
new therapy is effective at diminishing any baseline GC toxicity over time. With the 
AIS, toxicities can be removed if improvement occurs and added if worsening occurs. 
If toxicities present at baseline or occurring during the trial resolve over the course of 
follow-up, then that improvement is reflected in a negative score for that item during 
the interval. Both the CWS and the AIS are calculated for each interval, and then the 
interval scores are summed.  The complementary GTI Specific List (GTI-SL) captures well-known glucocorticoid-
related side effects. It is not weighted, and provides additional information in the 
domains most affected by glucocorticoid use during an individual’s treatment course.
It comprises 11 domains (including 9 shared in common with the C-GTI) and 
23 items. In this study, the item “major decrease in bone mineral density” will be 
excluded as bone matter density will not be assessed, and 22 items will be used.
The GTI with its 2 components (C-GTI and GTI-SL) are located in Section 10.15  (Appendix 15).  
8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Definitions of AE and SAE are provided in Section 10.4 as well as guidelines for assessing 
causality and relationship to IMP. 
AEs may be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally authorized representative). 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the trial intervention or trial procedures, or that 
caused the participant to discontinue IMP and/or the trial  (see Section 7). 
An unexpected AE is any adverse drug event that is not listed in the reference safety information 
in the current IB or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has been observed. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 76 Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity (using the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE Version 5.0]), seriousness, and causal relationship to the IMP or trial 
procedures. The action taken with the investigational drug and the outcome of the event must 
also be recorded. 
8.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the last follow-up visit 
(Section 1.3). 
All SAEs and AESIs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.4. The investigator 
will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the trial 
participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death due to any cause, 
at any time after a participant has been discharged from the trial, and the investigator considers 
the event to be reasonably related to the trial intervention, trial participation, or corticosteroid 
(non-IMP) use, then the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. 
8.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.4. 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences. 
8.4.3.  Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts.  
Any AEs observed from signing the ICF until End-of-Treatment, the last follow-up visit, until 
the participant is lost to follow-up, or until the participant withdraws consent (as defined in 
Section 7.3) must be followed until resolution. Resolution means that the participant has returned 
to a baseline state of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement or 
worsening of the AE. 
Every effort should be made to follow all (S)AEs considered to be related to the IMP or trial 
procedures until an outcome can be reported. If the participant is lost to follow-up, all AEs will 
be categorized based on the investigator’s last assessment. 
As long as the participant is still in the trial, resolution of SAEs (with dates) should be 
documented on the AE page of the eCRF and in the participant’s medical record to facilitate 
source data verification. If, after follow-up, return to the baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the SAE form. 
All pregnancies reported during the trial should be followed until pregnancy outcome. See 
Section 10.5. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 77 For SAEs, AESIs (see Section 8.4.8 ), non-serious AEs, and pregnancies, the sponsor’s designee 
may follow-up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional 
case details and outcome information (eg, from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, 
or autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 
Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in Section 10.4. 
8.4.4.  Reporting of AEs and SAEs 
All AEs that occur during the trial, from signing of the ICF until End-of-Treatment or the last 
follow-up visit, are to be recorded on the appropriate AE pages (either “serious” or 
“non-serious”) of the eCRF. The investigator should complete all the details requested, including 
date of onset, time of onset, stop date (when applicable), stop time (when applicable), severity, 
action taken, outcome, and relationship to IMP, to corticosteroid (non-IMP) use, and to trial 
procedures. Each event should be recorded separately in the eCRF. 
Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this trial after the signing of the 
ICF, whether or not related to the IMP, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the 
trial site’s knowledge of the event). Further information on follow-up procedures is provided in 
Section 8.4.3  and Section 10.4.  
The report will contain as much available information concerning the SAE as possible, to enable 
the sponsor (or an authorized representative) to file a report, which satisfies regulatory reporting 
requirements. These timelines apply to initial reports of SAEs and to all follow-up reports. 
Criteria for documenting the relationship to IMP as well as severity, outcome, and action taken 
will be the same as those previously described. 
All SAEs that are spontaneously reported within 30 days after the last trial visit are to be 
collected and reported in the safety database, and all efforts should be made to follow-up until 
resolution. 
Additional follow-up information should be completed and entered on a paper SAE report form 
and sent by fax/email to the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee. 
8.4.5.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC, and investigators.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
The sponsor (or its designee) will be responsible for reporting suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) to the relevant regulatory authorities and IEC/IRB, as per applicable 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 78 regulatory requirements. The sponsor (or its designee) will also be responsible to forward 
SUSAR reports to all investigators involved in the study, who will be required to report these 
SUSARs to their respective IECs/IRBs, as per their local regulatory requirements.
8.4.6.  Pregnancy 
If a pregnancy is reported, then the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy of a 
female participant or female partner of male participant (after obtaining the necessary signed ICF 
from the female partner; see Section 10.5) . 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be reported as such. 
The participant/pregnant female partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant/pregnant 
female partner and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. 
Any post-study pregnancy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention 
by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 8.4.5 . While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
participants/pregnant female partner, the investigator may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting. 
Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will discontinue 
study intervention or be withdrawn from the study. 
8.4.7.  Disease-Related Events and/or Disease-Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
Reportable AEs or SAEs 
Not applicable. 
8.4.8.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non-serious, related or not related) is an event of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program (eg, an underlying condition being 
investigated, a mechanism of action/potential immunosuppression). Further characterizing 
information will be collected in the eCRF. This event could be expected due to the natural 
progression of the underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the participant(s) and the 
participant’s predisposing risk factor profile including concomitant medications. 
Efgartigimod treatment induces reductions in IgG levels, and there is a potential risk for 
infections associated with low IgG levels. Moreover, due to the nature of underlying disease, 
Pemphigus patients are more prone to infections; therefore, infections are considered as AESI in 
this trial (see Section 8.3.7) .  
The characteristics of infections in the phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1701 with efgartigimod in 
pemphigus patients are summarized in Table 5 . A total of 32 TEAEs related to infections were 
reported in 21 (61.8%) patients; among them, 7 events in 5 (14.7%) patients were assessed as 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022

argenx Confidential 79 probably or possibly related to efgartigimod, and the remaining 25 events were assessed as not or 
unlikely related to efgartigimod.

Notes: Percentages are based on the number of patients in the safety analysis set. Adverse event terms are coded by 
SOC and PT using MedDRA version 23.1. 
No causal factor related to the mechanism of action of efgartigimod (eg, severe 
hypogammaglobulinemia) could be identified. However, it is important to mention that the trial 
does not include a comparative arm (ie, placebo control) to better assess the relationship to the 
drug; thus, the contribution of a drug that reduces serum IgG levels cannot be excluded.  
8.4.9.  Infusion-related Reactions 
IRRs are defined as AEs within the standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) queries for hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reaction, and extravasation (excluding 
implant); all broad search applied; and all AEs that occurred within 48 hours of an infusion.  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 80 In the phase 2 trial ARGX-113-1701 in pemphigus, efgartigimod IV infusions have resulted in 
only 1 case of grade 1 urticaria, which was assessed as an IRR.   
8.4.10.  Injection Site Reactions
Efgartigimod co-mixed with rHuPH20 in single-dose SC administrations was well-tolerated in 
healthy subjects with frequently reported mild Injection site reactions , including erythema, pain, 
bruising, pruritus, burning, tenderness, edema, induration, irritation, paresthesia, numbness, and 
rash. Injection site reactions  observed after SC administration in this study will be reported as an 
AE. 
8.5. Pharmacokinetics 
Blood samples for PK will be collected from each participant as presented in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). Sampling will be done predose on IMP administration visits (within 2 hours before 
IMP). 
An additional PK sample will be taken on day 3 and on day 11 (±1 day) until samples from 
24 participants are obtained.
Concentrations of efgartigimod will be determined using a validated assay. 
The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the requisition 
form. If no sample was taken, the reason will be recorded in the relevant section of the eCRF.  
8.6. Pharmacodynamics 
This section is applicable globally, except for China, where IgG subtypes will not be determined.  
At screening, total IgG will be measured as part of inclusion and exclusion criteria, but they will 
not be part of PD evaluation parameters at this time point.  
Blood samples for the determination of the PD markers (total IgG, IgG subtypes [IgG1, IgG2, 
IgG3, and IgG4]) and anti-Dsg-1 and anti-Dsg-3 autoantibodies will be collected as indicated in 
the SoA (Section 1.3). Sampling will be done predose on IMP administration visits. 
These PD markers will be determined using validated assays. IgG subtype analyses may be 
limited to a representative portion of study participants.
The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the requisition 
form. If no sample was taken, the reason will be recorded in the relevant section of the eCRF.
8.7. Skin Biopsies 
A substudy to evaluate markers of pemphigus pathology in skin biopsies will be conducted at 
selected sites. Not all countries participating in the study, including China, will include sites that 
perform the substudy. 
At participating sites, two 4-mm skin biopsies, 1 peri-lesional and 1 non-lesional, will be 
collected solely based on voluntary participation and giving informed consent, at 2 time points: 
at baseline and after healing of 80% of blisters (EoC) or at End-of-Treatment if 80% of healing is 
not achieved, to scientifically address the disease dynamics in response to experimental therapy 
with efgartigimod plus corticosteroids or corticosteroids only.  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 81 Collected biopsy samples will be immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, at room 
temperature, and after 24 hours transferred in ethanol for shipment to a central laboratory for 
processing and analysis. 
The following markers are planned to be measured in these samples: 
 Total IgG and subtypes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4  
 Inflammatory cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, TNF- , and IFN-   
 Cellular infiltrates: CD45+ leukocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T helper cells, CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells, CD20+ B cells, CD138+ plasma cells, neutrophils  
 Desmoglein and FcRn expression level 
Skin biopsies for this exploratory substudy will be collected as indicated in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). To maintain the study blind, samples will be recoded before analysis. 
8.8. Imaging 
For illustrative purposes, pictures of different anatomical regions may be taken at selected sites 
at the discretion of the investigator. The imaging substudy will be performed at selected sites and 
will not be performed in China.
As a guidance for participating sites, time points of baseline, DC, CR and flare are indicated. 
Pictures may also be taken at intermediate timepoints. 
Photography is generally accepted as routine practice for documenting dermatological conditions 
in medical practice. Photographs will be taken at baseline and at subsequent visits to document 
response and progression. Participants will be requested to provide consent for any use that will 
be made of the image and for sharing anonymized pictures with the sponsor. 
8.9. Exploratory Research 
The subsections below are applicable globally, except for China, where no exploratory research 
will be conducted.
8.9.1.  IgG Autoantibody Subtype and Specificity Study 
Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease caused by IgG autoantibodies against adhesion 
proteins. These autoantibodies are characteristically directed against Dsg-1 and Dsg-3, and 
predominantly of the IgG4 subtype.40 Despite this, serum concentrations of anti-Dsg 
autoantibodies do not always correlate with the disease activity, the anti-Dsg-1/3 autoantibody 
profile does not always match the clinical phenotype of skin and mucosal involvement when 
taking into account the relative expression patterns of Dsg-1 and Dsg-3 in skin and mucosa, and 
there is evidence of synergy of anti-Dsg and non-Dsg antibodies in pemphigus.40-42 
Efgartigimod, an FcRn inhibitor that gives a targeted reduction of IgG antibodies of all 
subtypes43 has been evaluated in the treatment of participants with MG,36ITP,37 and pemphigus 
(trial ARGX-113-1701). 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 82 The objective of the IgG autoantibody subtype and specificity research in this trial is to link 
serological profiles (ie, beyond the overall IgG reactivity toward Dsg-1 and/or -3 whole 
extracellular domains) with clinical observations. 
Blood samples for this exploratory research will be collected as indicated in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). To maintain the study blind, samples will be recoded before analysis. 
8.9.2.  Immunological Profiling
Immunological profiling aims to comprehensively evaluate the impact of efgartigimod on 
immune parameters to confirm the drug mode of action, illuminate previously unappreciated 
pathways and targets impacted by therapy, and define molecular and cellular biomarkers 
associated with treatment response. Specific analysis will include evaluation of:
 Anti-non-Dsg specific autoantibodies
 Pro-inflammatory cytokines
 T- and B-cell populations
Blood samples will be collected as indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
8.9.3.  Genetics 
The genetics study aims to understand how specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and 
non-HLA genes affect dynamic changes in T- and B-cell receptor repertoires and changes in 
RNA transcriptional profiles of genes linked to disease activity. Participation is optional and 
participants who do not wish to partake in the genetic research may still join in the trial. 
A blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to 
participate in the genetic analysis component of the study (Section 8.9.2 ).  
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested 
from the participant. A signed ICF will be required to obtain a replacement sample unless it was 
included in the original consent. 
Blood samples for RNA extraction will be collected at baseline, after 4 weeks (W5), W13 (or the 
visit at which CR is observed if before W13), and at EoS/ED. 
See Section 10.7 for information regarding genetic research. Details on processes for collection 
and shipment of these samples can be found in the Laboratory Manual. 
8.10. Immunogenicity Assessments 
Blood samples to assess immunogenicity of efgartigimod and rHuPH20 will be collected as 
indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3). Sampling will be done predose on IMP administration visits. 
All samples will be analyzed first in a validated screening assay, followed by an assessment of 
specificity of the measured ADA response in screening positive samples in a confirmation assay. 
Finally, in samples scoring positive in both screening and confirmatory assays, a titration of the 
ADA response will be performed. Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) will be tested for all confirmed 
positive ADA samples.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 83 The actual date and time of collection of the blood sample will be recorded in the requisition 
form. If no sample was taken, the reason will be recorded in the relevant section of the eCRF. 
8.11. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics 
See Section 8.12. 
8.12. Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes 
The participant will complete the patient-reported outcome (EQ-5D-5L) and the QoL 
questionnaire (ABQOL) as indicated in the SoA (Section 1.3).  
EQ-5D-5L : EQ-5D (5-level version) is a standardized measure of health status developed by the 
EuroQoL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal (see Section 10.10 ). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions 
(mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension now 
has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme 
problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) 
in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision 
results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 
dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number expressing the level selected for that 
dimension. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. 
A total of 3125 possible health states is defined in this way. Each state is referred to in terms of a 
5-digit code. For example, state 11111 indicates no problems on any of the 5 dimensions, while 
state 12345 indicates no problems with mobility, slight problems with washing or dressing, 
moderate problems with doing usual activities, severe pain or discomfort and extreme anxiety or 
depression. 
ABQOL : The ABQOL scale was developed and validated for ascertaining the impact of 
pemphigus and its therapies on patient’s daily life (see Section 10.11 ).29

The statistical analyses will be performed by the sponsor’s designated CRO using statistical 
analysis systems SAS®(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) version 9.4 or higher, and the software 
package R, if applicable. The standard operating procedures (SOPs) and work instructions of the 
sponsor’s designated CRO will be used as the default methodology if not otherwise specified. 
A detailed and comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and signed-off 
prior to final analysis database lock. Minor changes to the statistical methods set out in this 
protocol do not require a protocol amendment but will be documented (as changes from the 
protocol) in the SAP and in the trial report(s). The below paragraphs contain the main general 
features of the statistical analysis. More details will be provided as needed in the SAP. 
9.1. Statistical Methods 
In general, data collected will be listed, together with derived variables. Graphical displays will 
show safety and efficacy variables over time. Descriptive statistical methods will be used to 
analyze safety and efficacy data. Summaries will generally be provided by treatment assignment 
and overall. 
Summaries for continuous measures will include the number of observations (n), mean, SE, 
median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables, summaries will include sample size, 
frequencies, and percentages. 
9.2. Statistical Hypotheses 
The statistical hypothesis is derived from the primary trial objective as stated in Section 3.  Null hypothesis: There is no difference between efgartigimod PH20 SC and placebo 
in the proportion of participants with PV having achieved CRmin within 30 weeks. 
 Alternative hypothesis: There is a difference between efgartigimod PH20 SC and 
placebo in the proportion of participants with PV having achieved CRmin within 
30 weeks.
9.3. Sample Size Determination 
The sample size calculation is based on the following assumptions: 
 Endpoint: proportion of PV participants having achieved CRmin within 30 weeks 
 Percentages for sample size calculation 
 Efgartigimod: 40% to 50% 
 Placebo: 1% to 20% 
 Power: 90% 
 Significance level: 5% (two-sided) 
The sample size calculation was performed using PASS 2019 software (NCSS Statistical 
Software, Kaysville, Utah). The assumption is made that the responses from each group follow a 
binomial distribution.  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 85 Table 6 presents the number of participants needed in the placebo group; with a randomization 
ratio of 2:1 the efgartigimod group should have twice the number of participants.  
Table 6: Sample Size Calculation
Efgartigimod
40% 45% 50%Placebo 1% 16 14 12
5% 22 19 16
10% 34 27 22
15% 52 39 30
20% 87 59 42
Assuming a clinically relevant difference of 30% and an expectation to achieve CRmin in 50% 
of PV participants, a total of 126 participants randomized to either the efgartigimod arm or the 
placebo arm in a 2:1 ratio (84 participants in the efgartigimod arm and 42 participants in the 
placebo arm) will yield more than 90% power in a 2-sided test at the 5% significance level. The 
target number of Japanese participants with PV is 9.  
A representative number of participants with PF (up to approximately 24 participants or 16% of 
the total target population) may participate in the trial, although they are not included in the 
sample size calculation. The target range for the number of Japanese participants with PF is 1 to 
3 (included in the 24 participants globally). Thus, a total of 150 participants can be randomized 
in an allocation ratio of 2:1.
As a result of regulatory interactions, this amendment includes an additional analysis: absence of 
new or established lesions while a participant is off IMP and is receiving minimal therapy for at 
least 2 months (8 weeks).  
For this additional analysis, the assumed response rates are 34% and 11% for efgartigimod and 
placebo, respectively. With 183 participants with PV, this will result in 95% power in a 2-sided 
test at the 5% significance level, assuming that the geopolitical situation in Ukraine and impacted 
areas might result in a 5% power loss.  
In addition, the representative number of participants with PF may increase (up to approximately 
30 participants or 14% of the total target population) to compensate for participants whose data 
are at risk due to the geopolitical situation.  
9.4. Populations for Analyses 
The following populations are defined:
Population Description Modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) All randomized participants (PV and PF participants) who received at least 1 
dose or part of a dose of IMP. Two subsets are identified: PV participants 
and PV+PF participants. Participants will be analyzed according to their 
randomized treatment. 
Per protocol (PP) All participants in the mITT population for whom no major protocol 
deviations were reported 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 86 Population Description 
Safety (SAF) All randomized participants (PV and PF participants) who received at least 1 
dose or part of a dose of IMP. Participants will be analyzed according to the 
treatment actually received. 
Pharmacokinetic All participants in the SAF population for whom at least 1 serum PK 
concentration is available 
Pharmacodynamic All participants in the SAF population for whom at least 1 serum PD 
concentration is available 
9.5. Statistical Analyses 
The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock and it will include a more technical and detailed 
description of the statistical analyses described in this section. This section is a summary of the 
planned statistical analyses of the most important endpoints including primary and key secondary 
endpoints. 
9.5.1.  General Considerations 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the mITT population subset of PV 
participants. All efficacy key secondary and other secondary analyses will be performed on the 
PV+PF participants population, unless otherwise specified. The safety analyses will also be 
performed on the SAF population (PV+PF participants).
The baseline value will be the last assessment prior to the first administration of efgartigimod 
PH20 SC treatment.  
All trial visits will be recalculated based on actual dates and will be referred to as “analysis 
visits” which will be used in the statistical analyses. The rules for calculating the analysis visits 
will be documented in the SAP. Rules for imputing partial dates or missing dates will also be 
documented in the SAP. 
9.5.2.  Patient Disposition 
Patient disposition will be summarized in a table. It will include the number of participants 
screened, enrolled or randomized, received IMP treatment, completed the trial, as well as the 
number of early discontinuations from IMP treatment and trial, with reasons for discontinuation 
from IMP or trial. Summaries will be provided overall and by treatment group, for the overall 
trial period, by treatment period and, by follow-up period.
9.5.3.  Analysis Sets and Protocol Deviations 
The number of participants for each analysis set, as described in Section 9.4, will be presented in 
a table and listing. 
Major protocol deviations, by treatment group and trial stage, will be summarized in a table and 
presented in a listing.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 87 9.5.4.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant Medication 
Participant demographic and baseline characteristic data, including prior and concomitant 
therapies will be summarized using standard summary statistics (see Section 9.1) and listed. 
9.5.5.  Safety Analyses 
Exposure to IMP and cumulative prednisone statistics will be summarized by treatment group, 
separately. 
Summaries of TEAEs and other safety parameters will be provided by treatment group. 
Summary statistics will be presented for all other safety endpoints including vital signs, physical 
examinations, laboratory values and ECGs. 
AEs will be classified using the latest version of the MedDRA classification system. Adverse 
events and AESIs will be listed corresponding to SOC and MedDRA PT. Multiple occurrences 
of a single PT in a participant will be counted only once at the maximum severity/grade. Any 
AEs with missing severity or relationship to IMP will be classified as severe and treatment-
related, respectively. All AEs will be summarized by relatedness to IMP. Any AEs leading to 
death or discontinuation of IMP will also be summarized. 
9.5.6.  Primary Endpoint
The International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use [ICH] E9 (R1) provides further information on estimands and sensitivity analyses in 
clinical trials; ICH E9 (R1) came into effect on 30 Jul 2020 and follows below.  
Definition of the Estimand for the Primary Endpoint  Population: adult participants with moderate to severe PV newly diagnosed or experiencing 
flare, on add-on therapy of low doses of oral prednisone, and that are further defined by the 
inclusion (Section 5.1) and exclusion (Section 5.2) criteria. 
 Variable: proportion of PV participants who achieve CRmin within 30 weeks
 Main intercurrent events (ICEs): 
1. Intercurrent medications before CRmin 
a. Immunosuppressants or dapsone at therapeutic doses for at least 4 weeks 
b.  
c. Immunoadsorption or plasma exchange
d. Rituximab or other anti-CD20 biologics 
e. IV corticosteroids >200 mg cumulatively within 2 weeks
2. Discontinuation of IMP before CRmin due to lack of efficacy 
 Population-level summary: the strata-adjusted difference in the proportion of responders
(95% CI) between efgartigimod PH20 SC in combination with add-on therapy of low doses 
of oral prednisone and placebo in combination with add-on therapy of low doses of oral 
prednisone. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 88 Handling of Main ICEs
A composite strategy approach will be taken to address both main ICEs. This implies that 
participants that take intercurrent medications before CRmin as specified previously, as well as 
participants that discontinue IMP before CRmin due to lack of efficacy, will be considered 
nonresponders for the primary endpoint analysis. 
Estimation of Treatment Effect and Statistical Inference 
The proportion of participants with PV having achieved CRmin within 30 weeks will be tested 
by means of a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test using the mITT population. The 
model will be stratified by disease status, disease severity, and body weight at randomization. 
The strata-adjusted difference of proportions will be presented with its 95% CI and 2-sided 
pvalue. In addition, the odds ratio and its 95% CI will be provided. 
Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data for reason of 1 of the main ICEs will be handled as described above.  
If, for the primary endpoint, CR assessment is missing, the participant will be considered a 
nonresponder. Further details on other imputation techniques for missing CR values will be 
provided in the SAP.  
Details on handling other missing data will also be provided in the SAP. 
Supplementary Analyses  
To facilitate interpretation of the estimated treatment effect in the primary analysis, 
supplementary analyses will be conducted on the supportive estimands where the main ICEs are 
handled differently (eg, by using the hypothetical or treatment policy strategy instead of a 
composite strategy). Moreover, a supplementary landmark analysis will be performed at week 30 
using the same CMH test. Details will be provided in the SAP. 
The proportion of participants with PV who have achieved CRmin and sustain CR while not 
receiving IMP and while receiving minimal prednisone (8 weeks) will be analyzed within the scope of the integrated summary of efficacy with 
combined data from trial ARGX-113-1904 and the open-label follow-on trial ARGX-113-1905.  
9.5.7.  Key Secondary Endpoints Subject to Alpha Control 
The first key secondary endpoint, defined by the proportion of PV+PF participants that have 
achieved CRmin within 30 weeks, will be tested using a stratified CMH test with stratification 
variables similar as for the primary endpoint, using the mITT population. As this first key 
secondary endpoint is similar to the primary endpoint, the same approach for handling the main 
ICEs, as suggested for the primary analysis, will be applied. 
The second key secondary endpoint, cumulative prednisone dose over the trial duration, will be 
analyzed in the form of a normalized cumulative prednisone dose (NCPD), normalizing by 
weight and by number of days in study and will be denoted as NCPD. The NCPD endpoint will 
be analyzed using the mITT population in PV participants. The following formula will be 
adopted to calculate NCPD for each participant. 
NCPD =           
(      )  (    )  
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 89 For the NCPD endpoint, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will be used to compare both 
treatment groups. The model will include treatment and the stratification variables will be 
considered as factors.  
For the third and fourth key secondary endpoint, respectively time to CR and time to DC, both 
treatment groups will be compared using the Fleming-Harrington weighted log-rank statistic FH 
(1,0).44This analysis will be performed using the mITT population (PV participants). For both 
endpoints, survival curves will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier time to event method. 
Details on how to deal with the main ICEs for the second, third, and fourth key secondary 
endpoints will be provided in the SAP. 
The primary endpoint will be tested at a 5% 2-sided alpha level and will act as a gatekeeper for 
testing the secondary endpoints. Subject to meeting significance for the primary endpoint, 
secondary endpoints will be tested at the 5% 2-sided significance level in a strict hierarchical 
order as follows: 
1. Comparison of the proportion of PV+PF participants having achieved CRmin within 
30 weeks between efgartigimod PH20 SC and placebo 
2. Comparison of the NCPD in PV participants between efgartigimod PH20 SC and placebo 
3. Comparison of time to CR in PV participants between efgartigimod PH20 SC and 
placebo 
4. Comparison of time to DC in PV participants between efgartigimod PH20 SC and 
placebo 
Supplementary analyses for the key secondary endpoints will be conducted. Subgroup analyses 
for the primary and/or key secondary endpoints may also be conducted. Details will be provided 
in the SAP. 
9.5.8.  Other Secondary Endpoints 
The time to event and cumulative prednisone dose endpoints that are part of the other secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the mITT population (PV+PF participants) in line with the 
methodologies outlined above for the key secondary efficacy endpoints.  
The remaining binary endpoints will be analyzed in the mITT population using the same 
methodology as for the primary endpoint (stratified CMH test). 
The magnitude of the effect of efgartigimod PH20 SC compared to placebo in the PF 
subpopulation will be evaluated using the posterior distribution of the treatment effect 
(difference between efgartigimod PH20 SC and placebo) obtained in a Bayesian analysis. This 
Bayesian analysis will incorporate historical data for the placebo in an informative maximum a 
posteriori probability estimate prior with robustness modifier.45Details of this analysis will be 
included in the SAP.  
Analysis of the continuous endpoints GTI-CWS and GTI-AIS (as components of the C-GTI) at 
week 15 and the EoS/ED visit will be analyzed in the mITT using the ANOVA model to 
compare both treatment groups (see Section 9.5.7 ). The complementary GTI-SL will be analyzed 
descriptively. More details on additional analyses (eg, correlation between GTI-CWS and GTI-
AIS and cumulative or average daily prednisone dose) will be specified in the SAP.

10.1.5.  Committees Structure 
10.1.5.1.  Data Safety Monitoring Board 
The sponsor will appoint an independent DSMB consisting of an independent group of clinical 
experts who are not involved in the trial management. They will be supplemented by an 
independent statistician. The objective of the DSMB will be to review all unblinded safety data 
(including the overall number of participants treated up to that point, rates, and participant-level 
details) and the evaluation of IgG. The planning and frequency of the meetings will be detailed 
in a DSMB charter. In addition, ad hoc meetings can be requested at any time during the trial by 
either the sponsor or the DSMB. The DSMB will advise the sponsor regarding continuation, 
modification, or termination of the trial after every meeting.
Additionally, the composition, objectives, role, and responsibilities of the independent DSMB 
will be described in the DSMB charter, agreed with the DSMB members and the sponsor. The 
DSMB charter will also define and document the content of the safety summaries and general 
procedures (including communications). 
10.1.6.  Dissemination of Clinical Trial Data 
The sponsor or designee, and auditor may access participant records for the purpose of 
monitoring this trial, auditing, and managing progress details. The investigator must be fully 
aware that the sponsor or designee and auditor can inspect documents to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of a participant’s chart and eCRF records. Such information must be kept 
confidential in locked facilities that allow for this. The investigator will prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents to record all observations and other pertinent data for 
each participant enrolled into the trial.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 94 The investigator is responsible for maintaining source documents. These will be made available 
for verification by the sponsor’s designated monitor at each monitoring visit. The investigator 
must submit an eCRF for each participant, regardless of duration of participation or 
administration of IMP (ie, an eCRF has to be submitted for screen failures as well). All 
supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as laboratory or hospital records, 
should be clearly identified with the trial and participant number. Any personal information, 
including participant name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve data privacy. 
10.1.7.  Data Quality Assurance 
All participant data relating to the trial will be recorded on electronic CRF unless transmitted to 
the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for 
verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by physically or electronically signing the 
CRF.
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF. Only if requested as per local regulations, no source data 
verification will be performed on race and ethnicity. 
The investigator must permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk-based initiatives in operations and quality such as 
Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk-Based Monitoring), methods, 
responsibilities and requirements, including handling of noncompliance issues and monitoring 
techniques (central, remote, or on-site monitoring) are provided in the monitoring plan. 
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this trial including quality 
checking of the data.  
The sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other individuals (eg, 
CROs/sponsor’s designee). 
Trial monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the 
CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; 
that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the trial is being conducted 
in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH GCP, 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
10.1.7.1.  Data Handling and Record Keeping 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to maintain essential trial documents (records and 
documents pertaining to the conduct of this trial and the distribution of IMP, including regulatory 
documents, eCRFs, signed participant ICFs, laboratory test results, IMP inventory records, 
source documents, relevant correspondence, AE reports, and all other supporting documentation) 
as required by the applicable national regulatory requirements. The trial site should plan on 
retaining such documents for approximately 25 years after trial completion. The trial site should 
retain such documents until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in 
an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH 
region, or at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP. 
The sponsor will notify the principal investigator of these events. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 95 These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory 
requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the trial is being conducted. 
Participant identification codes (ie, participant names and corresponding trial numbers) will be 
retained for this same period of time. These documents may be transferred to another responsible 
party, acceptable to the sponsor, who agrees to abide by the retention policies. The investigator is 
required to notify the sponsor (or an authorized representative) in writing prior to changing the 
location or status of any essential clinical trial documents. The investigator must contact the 
sponsor prior to disposing of any trial records. 
No records should be disposed without the written approval of the sponsor, argenx BV. 
For studies conducted outside the US under an US investigational new drug (IND), the principal 
investigator must comply with US Food and Drug Administration IND regulations and with 
those of the relevant national and local health authorities. 
10.1.7.2.  Quality Assurance Audit 
Trial processes, trial sites (including, but not limited to site visits, central laboratories, vendors), 
the trial database, and trial documentation may be subject to quality assurance audit during the 
course of the trial by the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, CRO, or other vendor, on behalf of 
sponsor. In addition, inspections may be conducted by regulatory bodies at their discretion. Such 
audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the trial. 
10.1.7.3.  Quality Control 
Quality control will be applied to each stage of trial-related activities. 
The following steps will be taken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, completeness, and 
reliability of the data: 
 Investigator meetings 
 Central laboratories for clinical laboratory parameters 
 Site initiation visit 
 Routine site monitoring 
 Ongoing site communication and training 
 Ongoing oversight by sponsor’s designated monitors of safety parameters and 
adherence to selection criteria 
 Eligibility review by sponsor’s designated CRO and medical monitors/sponsor’s 
designee 
 Data management quality control checks 
 Continuous data acquisition and cleaning 
 Quality control check of the clinical trial report (CTR) 
 To avoid interobserver variability, every effort should be made to ensure that the 
same individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes all efficacy 
and safety evaluations. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 96 In addition, periodic audits can be performed as specified in Section 10.1.7.2 .
When audits or inspections are conducted, access must be authorized for all trial-related 
documents including medical history and concomitant medication documentation to the 
authorized sponsor’s representatives and regulatory authorities. 
10.1.8.  Source Documents 
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator's site. 
Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the 
source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator may need to request 
previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the trial. Also, current medical 
records must be available. 
The definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the source data agreement, defined 
per site and agreed upon between the CRO/sponsor’s designee and the investigator. 
The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the CRF. 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into 
the CRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source 
documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is 
being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study 
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
10.1.9.  Monitoring 
The sponsor has engaged the services of a CRO to perform all clinical study monitoring 
functions within this clinical study outside of China. In China, the sponsor has engaged a 
designee. The sponsor’s designated monitors will work in accordance with their applicable 
SOPs. 
Monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH GCP guidelines to verify 
that, among others, the: 
 Data are authentic, accurate, and complete 
 Safety and rights of participants are being protected 
 The study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other 
study agreements, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agree to allow the 
sponsor’s designated monitor direct access to all relevant documents. 
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space, and qualified personnel for 
monitoring visits. 
The sponsor’s designated monitor will perform an eCRF review, source document verification 
(wherever allowed as per local regulations), and source document review. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 97 The source documentation agreement form describes the source data for the different data in the 
eCRF. This document should be completed and signed by the sponsor’s designated monitor and 
investigator, and should be filed in the investigator’s study file. Any data item for which the 
eCRF will serve as the source must be identified, agreed, and documented in the source 
documentation agreement form.
Upon completion or premature discontinuation from the study, the sponsor’s designated monitor 
will conduct site closure activities with the investigator and site staff as appropriate, in 
accordance with applicable regulations, ICH GCP guidelines, and CRO/sponsor’s 
designee/sponsor procedures. 
10.1.10.  Data Management 
Data generated within this clinical study will be processed according to the SOPs of the data 
management and biostatistics departments of the sponsor’s designated CRO/sponsor’s designee.
Case report forms are provided for each participant in electronic format (ie, eCRF). Data will be 
transcribed by the study site staff from the source documents onto the eCRF, as per local 
regulations. Data must be entered in English. Guidelines for eCRF completion, including the 
collection of the investigator’s e-signature, will be provided by the CRO/sponsor’s designee. 
Appropriate training and security measures will be completed by the investigator and all 
designated site staff prior to the study being initiated, and any data being entered into the system 
for any study participant at the site. 
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original (or 
source) medical records unless otherwise specified. Only if requested as per local regulations, no 
data collection or source data verification will be performed on race and ethnicity. Source 
documents are all documents used by the investigator or hospital that relate to the participant’s 
medical history, that verify the existence of the participant, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
and all records covering the participant’s participation in the study. They can include laboratory 
notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, participant files, etc. The eCRFs 
should be completed by the investigator or a qualified designee from the site as soon as the data 
are available. 
As a matter of regulation, the investigator is responsible for the accuracy and authenticity of all 
clinical data entered onto eCRFs. Prior to database lock, each completed eCRF must be reviewed 
for accuracy by the investigator, corrected as necessary, and then approved. The investigator’s e-
signature serves to attest that the information contained in the eCRFs has been reviewed by the 
investigator and is true and accurate. The investigator will be required to electronically sign off 
the eCRF. 
The data will be verified for completeness, missing data, inconsistencies, and for necessary 
medical clarifications. Queries arising from these checks will be flagged to the study site, and the 
study site staff will correct data, confirm, or clarify data as appropriate. The CRO/sponsor’s 
designee will provide the details of the review process in a data management plan and a 
monitoring plan. Any change, including the issuing of queries, will be fully audit-trailed by the 
electronic data capture system, meaning the name of the person, time, and date stamp are 
captured, as well as the reason for change. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 98 Data will also be provided by third party vendors, such as the results generated by the central 
laboratories, ECG reader, etc. These data will need to be reconciled with the data recorded in the 
eCRF before it can be merged with the eCRF data into the clinical database. The CRO/sponsor’s 
designee will provide a data management plan detailing this reconciliation. 
AEs, concomitant diseases, and medical history terms will be assigned to a lowest level term and 
a PT, and will be classified by high level term, high level group term, and primary SOC 
according to the MedDRA thesaurus. 
Prior and concomitant medications, including concomitant pemphigus therapy, will be classified 
according to active drug substance using the WHO drug dictionary (WHODD). The generic 
name, the preferred name, and the WHO name will be assigned using the WHODD thesaurus.
The anatomical therapeutic chemical classes will be assigned to the prior and concomitant 
medications and procedures. Prior and concomitant procedures will be coded according to the 
MedDRA thesaurus.
10.1.11.  Study and Site Start and Closure 
The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of 
participants, upon availability of mandatory approvals. 
The sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited to: 
 Safety concerns as recommended by the DSMB 
 Inability to achieve the recruitment target within a reasonable time 
 Determination that no further benefits are expected from the study (in the sponsor’s 
judgment)
 Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor’s procedures, or GCP guidelines
 Discontinuation of further study medication development
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, any CRO(s) used in the study, and the 
sponsor’s designee of the study, of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the 
applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and 
should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow-up. 
The study can also be terminated by the regulatory authority for any reason or at a site level by 
the IRB/IEC. The sponsor may close individual study sites prematurely for reasons such as poor 
protocol compliance or unsatisfactory recruitment of participants.

intervention. 
 NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the 
use of study intervention. 
Definition of Unsolicited and Solicited AE 
 An unsolicited adverse event is an adverse event that was not solicited using a Participant 
Diary and that is communicated by a participant who has signed the informed consent. 
Unsolicited AEs include serious and non-serious AEs. 
 Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (ie, symptoms or illnesses requiring a 
hospitalization, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). The 
participants will be instructed to contact the site as soon as possible to report medically 
attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not medically attended, are of 
participant’s concern. Detailed information about reported unsolicited AEs will be collected 
by qualified site personnel and documented in the participant’s records. 
 Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by participants 
will be collected during interview with the participants and by review of available medical 
records at the next visit. 
 Solicited AEs are predefined local at the injection site and systemic events for which the 
participant is specifically questioned, and which are noted by the participant in their diary. 
Events to be Collected as AEs 
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific 
judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention- intervention interaction. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention 
or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is 
an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses 
should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 105 Events to be Collected as AEs 
 “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported 
as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the 
signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as 
AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT to be Collected as AEs
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments 
which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 
 The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition. 
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the 
procedure is the AE. 
 Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital). 
 Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
10.4.2.  Definition of SAE
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
1. Results in death 
2. Is life-threatening 
The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills 
any other seriousness criteria, the event will be considered as serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline will not collected as an AE. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 106 A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
(eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
6. Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as significant medical events that may jeopardize 
the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes 
listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions or development of intervention dependency or 
intervention abuse.  
10.4.3.  Recording and Follow-up of AEs and/or SAEs 
AE and SAE Recording 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. 
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information. 
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records in 
lieu of completion of the required form. 
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested. In this 
case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on 
the copies of the medical records before submission. 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
Assessment of Severity 
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study. 
All AEs observed will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The NCI CTCAE is a descriptive 
terminology, which can be utilized for AE reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for 
each AE term.  
The grade refers to the severity of the AE. If a particular AE’s severity is not specifically graded 
by the guidance document, the investigator is to use the general NCI CTCAE definitions of grade 
1 through grade 5 following his or her best medical judgment. The CTCAE displays grades 1 
through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on the following 
general guideline: 
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 107 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
Grade 5: Death related to AE. 
Note: a semi-colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grades. 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An 
event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in 
the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
Assessment of Causality 
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE, under 1 of the following categories. 
 Not related: Events can be classified as “not related” if there is not a reasonable possibility 
that the IMP caused the AE. 
 Unlikely related: An “unlikely” relationship suggests that only a remote connection exists 
between the IMP and the reported AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, 
progression or expression of the disease state, or reaction to concomitant medication, appear 
to explain the reported AE. 
 Possibly related: A “possible” relationship suggests that the association of the AE with the 
IMP is unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by other conditions. 
 Probably related: A “probable” relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of 
the AE with drug administration exists and, in the Investigator’s clinical judgment, it is likely 
that a causal relationship exists between the drug administration and the AE, and other 
conditions (concurrent illness, progression or expression of disease state, or concomitant 
medication reactions) do not appear to explain the AE. 
 Related: A “related” relationship suggests that the AE follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of IMP, it follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
IMP, and it cannot reasonably be explained by known characteristics of patient’s clinical 
state. 
A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as 
well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be 
considered and investigated. 
The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in 
his/her assessment. 
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed 
the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report. However, it is very important that the investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE 
data. 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 108 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and 
send an SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements. 
For final reporting purposes, the relationship will be converted into “Binary Determination,” per 
CIOMS. Unrelated and Unlikely Related will be merged into “Unrelated” and Related, Possibly 
Related, and Probably Related will be merged into “Related.” 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements 
and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested to elucidate the nature and/or causality 
of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals. 
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the 
investigator will provide a copy of any post-mortem findings including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally submitted documents. 
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data within 24 hours of receipt of the information.
10.4.4.  Reporting of SAEs and AESIs
SAE and AESI Reporting 
 All SAEs and AESIs will be recorded on the AE form of the eCRF. SAEs will also be recorded 
on the paper SAE report form.  
 The investigator or designated site staff will ensure all entered data are consistent. 
 An email alert for the SAE and AESI reports on the eCRF will automatically be sent to the 
sponsor/designee’s safety mailbox via the electronic data capturing (eDC) system. 
 The paper SAE report form will be faxed or emailed to the sponsor/designee (see Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting on page 2 of this protocol).

Pregnancy Information 
10.5.1.  Definitions:
10.5.1.1.  Woman of Childbearing Potential
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is either:  
a. Postmenopausal: A postmenopausal state is defined by continuous amenorrhea for at 
least 1 year without an alternative medical cause with an FSH measurement of 
>40 IU/L. A historical pretreatment FSH measurement of >40 IU/L is accepted as 
proof of a postmenopausal state for women on hormone replacement therapy.
b. Surgically sterilized: Women who have had a documented permanent sterilization 
procedure (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy). 
10.5.2.  Contraception Guidance:
10.5.2.1.  Female Contraception for Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential must use a highly effective or acceptable contraception 
method, which should be maintained at minimum until after the last dose of IMP. 
The same type of hormonal contraception must have been received for at least 1 month before 
starting the study. 
Highly effective methods of contraception are: 
1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation 
a. Oral 
b. Intravaginal 
c. Transdermal 
2. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
a. Oral 
b. Injectable 
c. Implantable 
3. Intrauterine device (IUD) 
4. Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
5. Bilateral tubal occlusion 
6. Vasectomized partner 
7. Sexual abstinence 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 110 Acceptable methods of contraception are:
1. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception in which inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action 
a. Oral 
b. Injectable 
c. Implantable 
2. Male or female condom with or without spermicide
3. Cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
10.5.2.2.  Male Contraception: 
An acceptable method of contraception is a condom. 
10.5.3.  Collection of Pregnancy Information 
Male Participants With Partners Who Become Pregnant 
 Male participants will be instructed through the ICF to immediately inform the 
investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the trial. 
 The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male 
participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in 
this trial. 
 After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female 
partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy and submitted via email or fax (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax  details on 
page 2 of this protocol). 
 The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. 
Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal 
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
 An investigator, who is contacted by the male participant or his pregnant partner, may 
provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the 
fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the physician and/or 
obstetrician. 
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant 
 A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening. A urine pregnancy test will 
be conducted and analyzed locally at the visits detailed in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
 The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant during the period of administration of IMP. The initial information 
will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor and/or 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 111 sponsor’s designee within 24 hours of learning of a participant’s pregnancy. The 
following actions will be performed: 
The participant should immediately be discontinued from treatment.
The participant should have the ED assessments and enter the follow-up period.
All assessments for ED (see Section 7) must be performed unless contraindicated 
by pregnancy (harmful to fetus) or unless the participant withdraws informed 
consent. 
 The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow-up information on the participant and the neonate and 
the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion (occurring at <22 weeks 
gestational age) or still birth (occurring at >22 weeks gestational age) is always 
considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any posttrial pregnancy-
related SAE considered reasonably related to the IMP by the investigator will be 
reported to the sponsor as described in Section 8.4.5 . While the investigator is not 
obligated to actively seek this information in former trial participants, he or she may 
learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
 The investigator must update the participant with information currently known about 
potential risks and available treatment alternatives. 
 If required by local regulations, the female participant will be requested to sign a 
separate pregnancy ICF. 
 Full details will be recorded on a paper pregnancy report form and submitted via 
email or fax (see the Safety Mailbox/Fax details on page 2 of this protocol), and 
reporting details will be specified in the trial manual. The investigator will update the 
pregnancy report form with additional information as soon as the outcome of the 
pregnancy is known.
If the outcome of the pregnancy is an SAE, then this must be additionally reported as 
an SAE on the appropriate SAE report form.

The instructions outlined in this section are applicable globally, except for China, where no 
genetic research will be conducted. 
Use/Analysis of DNA 
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study intervention, susceptibility to, and 
severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be due to 
genetic determinants that impact intervention absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; mechanism of action of the intervention; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of 
the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample 
will be collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. 
DNA samples will be used for research related to efgartigimod or pemphigus and related 
diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic tests related to 
efgartigimod and pemphigus. Genetic research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more 
candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (as appropriate). 
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of genetic factors involved in 
the response to efgartigimod PH20 SC or study interventions of this class to understand study 
disease or related conditions. 
The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study 
summary. 
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality. 
The samples will be retained while research on efgartigimod continues but no longer than 
15 years or other period as per local requirements.

argenx Confidential 129 10.14. Appendix 14: Possible Adaptations of Trial Protocol During 
COVID-19 Pandemic 
Introduction 
The aim of the ARGX-113-1904 trial is to investigate a new SC treatment option for patients 
with pemphigus. This SC treatment consists of efgartigimod coformulated with recombinant 
human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20) (called efgartigimod PH20 SC) and could offer clinically 
significant benefits to pemphigus patients. 
The sponsor (argenx BV) has performed a critical assessment of the use of efgartigimod during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the risk-benefit assessment, the clinical trial 
ARGX-113-1904 can be conducted; however, because of the pandemic, argenx BV 
acknowledges that considerable difficulties for participating centers to meet all previously 
planned assessments might occur (see the SoA in Section  1.3). Therefore, an Appendix with 
possible adaptations to this trial has been developed. This Appendix describes a minimum 
number of assessments required to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of the participants during 
the trial and to secure the collection of the critical parameters for analysis. It remains at the 
investigator’s discretion to assess if it is in the best interest of the participant to 
participate/continue in the trial.  
Note that a “home visit” as described in this Appendix could also be a visit at an alternative 
convenient location. 
Note that the home nurse, who will go to the participant in case of a home visit, could also be 
another qualified person to perform all tasks (eg, a physician). In addition, a home nurse can be 
qualified personnel from an alternative convenient location if the trial visit cannot be performed 
at the trial site. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2 main goals of the study are the participant’s safety and 
the participant’s data collection. 
For participants with no suspected signs of COVID-19 or have tested negative:  
The administration of efgartigimod PH20 SC may continue, while the safety of the participants 
should be preserved. For participants who have no suspected signs of COVID-19 disease or are 
tested negative, there is no evidence that efgartigimod PH20 SC must be discontinued. In these 
participants, it is therefore recommended to make an individual benefit/risk assessment, which 
includes the participant’s age, the co-morbidities (eg, obesity, respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes), the treatment history (eg, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and 
rituximab) and the disease activity. The environmental conditions of containment for each 
participant are also to be considered. Based on this benefit/risk assessment, administration of 
efgartigimod PH20 SC may be pursued, postponed or discontinued. 
Data collection:
It is important to continue collecting critical clinical trial data, for example, through telephone 
communication when trial site visits cannot be performed. The assessments deemed suitable for 
regular telephone consultation are questions on AEs, disease outcomes (DC, CR, flare) and 
compliance for prednisone intake and its dose. Prednisone dose must be adapted according to the 
study protocol.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 130 POSSIBLE ADAPTATIONS TO ARGX-113-1904 TRIAL PROTOCOL DURING 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC 
Implementation of this Appendix
 Implementation for all sites includes social distancing, personal protective equipment 
(PPE), and a telephone call before each trial visit for checking of COVID-19 
symptoms. 
 The adaptations to the visits and procedures described in this Appendix that are 
acceptable alternatives to the main protocol procedures should only be implemented 
in exceptional cases and after approval of the sponsor and/or CRO. Approval will be 
granted based on the possibility of the participant to go to the site and per local and/or 
hospital regulations. 
The Appendix is intended for countries and/or sites in geographical areas where COVID-19 has 
affected trial sites’ workload, severe movement restrictions have been imposed, or when there is 
a risk to participants/trial staff if attending trial sites for trial visits. The initial duration of the 
implementation of this Appendix will be agreed and can be extended based on the local epidemic 
status.
When a (home) visit is performed under this COVID-19 Appendix, it should be documented as a 
COVID-19 (home) visit in the eCRF for the applicable visit. 
Testing for COVID-19 
Additional testing for COVID-19 beyond that mandated by relevant local authorities is not 
required at the start of the study. However, argenx BV recommends participants who develop 
symptoms of COVID-19 during the trial to be tested. 
Protecting Home Nurse and Site Staff From COVID-19 
The home nurse and site staff as well as qualified personnel from an alternative convenient 
location. Staff should apply appropriate social distancing and use personal protection equipment 
according to the local hospital and governmental regulations/recommendations; see also below.
Participants With COVID-19 (Either a Positive Test or With Symptoms [Suspicion of 
COVID-19 Infection]) 
Participants with a COVID-19 infection should not enter the trial. In case a participant develops 
a COVID-19 infection during trial participation, the following applies. 
The instructions to manage an infection that are in the main protocol are also applicable in case 
of an infection with COVID-19 (ie, it will be considered an AESI similar to all infections). 
Treatment should be interrupted until the participant is considered recovered from COVID-19 
(according to the local recommendations). 
During the pandemic, the trial site staff should contact participants prior to each visit to inquire 
about COVID-19 symptoms and exposure using the flow charts below and make a decision on 
proceeding or postponing the visit according to the following flow charts. 
The following symptoms should be specifically addressed during that phone call: fever, cough, 
sneezing, loss of taste/smell, difficulties breathing/chest tightness.

Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 132 Participants with symptoms of COVID-19 infection will be treated for this infection as guided by 
the local health care system. Participants will be monitored by the trial site by telephone contact. 
In case the participant will have to be in self-isolation for a longer period than 2 weeks, it will be 
discussed on a case-by-case basis with the sponsor and/or with the CRO whether the participant
can remain in the trial.
Once a participant has recovered, the participant can continue the trial and receive trial 
medication, provided that the participant has not received/is not receiving prohibited medication 
(see Section 6.8.2 ). 
Critical Parameters to Be Collected During the Trial  
Please note that, if feasible, all assessments, including those that are not critical (ie, indicated as 
assessments that are not mandatory in the SoA in Section  1.3) should be performed. 
The critical parameters that must be collected during the trial are summarized in the following 
table: 
Eligibility

 Demographics 
 Disease and medical history 
 Physical examination and study assessments 
 Other parameters to confirm eligibility Efficacy 
 Disease assessment (DC, CR, EoC, flare) 
 Monitoring of prednisone dosage

 Safety labs IMP 
 Administration  
 Accountability 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the collection of these critical parameters is specified in the 
SoA in Table 10 . 
 The evaluation of eligibility for the trial will be as described in the main protocol. The 
screening visit must be performed at the trial site (see below). 
For the evaluation of efficacy, safety, and for the IMP administration and 
accountability, certain modifications compared to the main protocol are allowed in 
this protocol compared to the main protocol (see below). 
Mandatory Site Visits and Allowed Home Visits
In order to collect the critical parameters of the trial, certain visits have to be performed at the 
site (screening, baseline, and EoS/ED) and other visits can be at home (“home” as described in 
this Appendix could also be a visit at an alternative convenient location). 
 Screening Visit 
The screening visit of the trial needs to be performed at the trial site. If it is not possible to go to 
the trial site due to the COVID-19 situation, the participant cannot start screening and has to wait 
until the situation changes and the participant is able to go to the trial site. Note that 
Clinical Protocol ARGX-113-1904 v 5.0 09 Dec 2022
Efgartigimod PH20 SC  
argenx Confidential 133 transportation to the trial site can be facilitated if the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
allows this. 
Baseline Visit 
The baseline visit has to be performed at the trial site. If it is not possible to go to the trial site for 
these baseline visits due to the COVID-19 situation, the sponsor or CRO have to be contacted as 
soon as possible to discuss viable options.  
 Other Trial Visits 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, study visits after the screening and baseline visits will be done 
at home, including blood and urine collection. A home nurse will travel to the participant’s home 
to conduct this visit (or the participant will go to an alternative convenient location). The 
investigator will talk to the participant via an audio or video interview to elicit AE, concomitant 
medications, and general wellbeing of the participant. The investigator will also perform efficacy 
assessments using an audio or video interview with the participant. The assessments via an audio 
or video interview will be conducted before the home nurse administers the trial medication. The 
division of tasks between the investigator and home nurse are indicated in the following scheme.
In the exceptional case that a home nurse cannot be identified or cannot travel to the participant’s 
home, vital sign measurements and blood and urine collection will not be performed, and IMP 
may be administered through self- or caregiver administration, provided that the participant 
or caregiver has completed the training and has been deemed competent. IMP administration by 
the patient or caregiver can be supported by a video connection. Such an exception will require 
concurrent sponsor and investigator approval on a case-by-case basis.  EoS/ED 
The EoS/ED visit of the trial needs to be performed at the trial site. If it is not possible to go to 
the trial site for this visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sponsor or CRO have to be 
contacted as soon as possible to discuss viable options.

argenx Confidential 134 Efficacy Assessments
The critical efficacy assessments of the trial are: 
- Disease assessment (DC, CR, EoC, flare) 
- Monitoring of prednisone dosage 
Safety Assessments 
Adverse event
During home visits, a telephone/video interview will be conducted by the treating physician or 
designee about possible AEs. Any suspected COVID-19 infection relevant signs or symptoms 
(including an abnormal laboratory findings) will be reported as an AE, with clear distinction 
whether it is a confirmed test positive COVID-19 infection or suspected infection if not tested.
 Vital signs 
During home visits, vital signs (heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure) will be 
measured by the home nurse at the beginning of the home visit and the results will be 
communicated to the treating physician. If pyrexia is detected, the home nurse should call the 
trial site immediately and await further instructions from the treating physician. 
 Blood and urine sampling 
During home visits, blood samples will be collected for clinical chemistry, hematology, anti-
Dsg-1 and anti-Dsg-3 antibodies, PK, total IgG and IgG subtypes (IgG subtypes are not 
determined in China), and ADA weekly until week 6 and then every 4 weeks until EoS/ED. 
Additionally, urine samples will be collected for urinalysis and urine pregnancy testing.
 Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
At screening (which is performed at the site), ECGs are required. A local ECG machine from the 
site can be used in case equipment from the central ECG laboratory does not arrive at the site. A 
test transfer to the central ECG laboratory (eResearchTechnology [ERT]) with an anonymized 
test ECG is required. Requirement for the test ECG and test transfer are described in the user 
guide (“site upload tool quick guide”) from ERT. Except for screening, an ECG is not considered 
as critical data at other visits and will not be done in case of a home visit. 
Concomitant Medication 
At the time of the home visit, the site treating physician will telephone/video interview the 
participant about concomitant medications, especially prednisone dosage. It will be documented 
whether concomitant medication is taken for a confirmed test positive COVID-19 infection or 
suspected infection (if not tested). 
IMP Administration 
IMP can be administered at home by trained and authorized personnel (eg, home nurse). 
Trial Endpoint
The criteria for the trial endpoint for a participant as described in the main protocol also apply to 
this Appendix.

lesions or flare after achieving CR should return to weekly on-site visits until CR is achieved again. 
cA minimum of 6 on-site visits, V1(BL)/W1 to W6, are required before switching to home administrations, even if CR is achieved earlier than W6. The W7 visit 
is the first eligible “IMP administration only” visit (refer to column “Weekly home or on-site visits until CRmin”), at home or on-site, if CR is achieved 
between W1 and W6.

argenx Confidential 140d Home visits are allowed once participants achieve CR, but not before W7. The investigator should call the participant every 2 weeks until CRmin is achieved to 
confirm the participant is still in CR. On-site visits may continue at the investigator’s discretion. 
e W38 (follow-up visit 2) is the end of the trial for participants who do not enroll in the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905. The W38 follow-up visit will only be 
required for those participants who were still receiving IMP at least once from W27 onward. For participants who ended treatment prior to W27, W34 will be 
the end of the trial. 
f Trial visit windows are ±2 days during the treatment period and ±3 days for follow-up visits. 
g No trial-related assessments can be initiated before the participant has provided as signed ICF. 
h Only required if not available from medical history.  
iHeight and weight will be measured (and BMI will be calculated accordingly) at screening, at week W15 (or the next on-site visit if W15 does not coincide 
with an on-site visit), and EoS/ED. Weight will also be measured if there has been an obvious change since the last measurement. 
j At visits in which IMP is administered, the assessment or procedure should be completed before dosing. 
k A complete physical examination will be completed at each on-site visit. Vital sign measurements include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and 
body temperature. Supine blood pressure and heart rate will be measured using standard equipment after at least 10 minutes rest. 
l ECG to be taken at W12. If the W12 visit does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. ECG (heart 
rate, PR, QT, and QRS interval) will be read centrally. QTcF and QTcB will be calculated. 
m Randomization will take place on day 1 after all eligibility checks are confirmed (eg, PDAI) and before other baseline assessments are run, and prior to dosing. 
n Urinalysis will be performed by dipstick method and will include specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, 
leukocyte esterase, and microscopic examination (if blood or protein test results are abnormal). 
o Samples will be taken every week from V1(BL)/W1 to W9 and then every 4 weeks and at the visit where CR is observed. Once CR is achieved, samples will 
be taken every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. For participants achieving CR between V1(BL)/W1 and W6, samples will be taken weekly from W1 to 
W6 and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. 
p A urine pregnancy test will be conducted and analyzed locally during on-site visits at least once every 4 weeks (before and after CR) and at the time of CR. 
qViral testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
DNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, HCV messenger RNA (mRNA), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies. 
r At screening, a serum pregnancy test must be performed in women of childbearing potential or FSH test to confirm postmenopausal status. 
sClinical blood laboratory tests will include hematology and blood chemistry at all visits and international normalized ratio (INR) or activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) at screening only. The hematology profile includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), RBC count, platelet 
count, WBC count with differential. The blood chemistry profile includes sodium, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), creatinine, creatinine 
clearance, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 
C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, total protein, and albumin. 
t For PK assessment, blood samples will be taken predose (within 2 hours before the start of IMP administration at visits where IMP is administered). An 
additional PK sample will be taken on D3 and on D11 (±1 day) until samples from 24 participants are obtained. At unscheduled visits blood samples for PK 
will only be taken if IMP is administered. 
u At screening, total IgG will be measured as part of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers total IgG and its subtypes (IgG1, 
IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) will be measured centrally from a blood sample taken predose. 
v An extra sample(s) will be taken for additional research (including vaccination antibodies and other additional research). The actual testing of vaccination 
antibodies depends on (a) whether a vaccination was given to the participant; (b) whether a test is available for the vaccination given to the participant; and (c)

argenx Confidential 141whether the sample requirements (serum, volume, frozen sample, storage duration) match the serum samples taken and reserved for this. Timepoints for 
analysis will be decided upon occurrence of vaccination during the study. 
wAnti-drug antibodies to efgartigimod (in serum samples) and antibodies against rHuPH20 (in plasma samples) will be tested predose every 2 weeks from 
V1(BL)/W1 to W9 and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits and at the visit where CR is observed. Once CR is achieved, samples will be taken every 4 weeks at 
on-site visits until EoS/ED. For participants achieving CR between V1(BL)/W1 and W6, samples will be taken predose at V1(BL)/W1, W3, W5, the visit 
where CR is observed, W10, and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) will be tested for all confirmed positive 
ADA samples. 
x Blood sampling for IgG autoantibody subtypes and specificity will be taken every 4 weeks (V1[BL]/W1, W5, W9, etc) and at the visit where CR is observed. 
Once CR is achieved, samples will be taken every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. For participants achieving CR between V1(BL)/W1 and W6, samples 
will be taken at V1(BL)/W1, W5, the visit where CR is observed, W10, and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. Serum aliquots from all time 
points will be used for IgG subtype and specificity analyses. For cytokines and complementary specificity analyses, aliquots from baseline, after 4 weeks (W5), 
W13 (or the visit at which CR is observed if before W13), and EoS/ED will be used. 
y Samples for B- and T-cell populations and RNA transcriptional profiles will be performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (W5) and at W13 (or the visit at which CR 
is observed if before W13) and at EoS/ED.
z HLA/non-HLA genotyping will only be performed at baseline and D15. 
aaTwo 4 mm skin biopsies, 1 peri-lesional and 1 non-lesional, will be collected solely based on voluntary participation at baseline and after healing of 80% of 
blisters (EoC) or at EoS/ED (in case EoC has not been achieved) for scientific purposes. 
bb Pictures of different anatomical regions may be taken at the discretion of the investigator. As a guidance, time points of baseline, DC, CR and flare are 
indicated. Pictures may also be taken at intermediate timepoints. 
cc Questionnaires are to be completed prior to any other activity. 
ddAssessments will be performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (W5), W15, and EoS/ED visits. If the W15 visit does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the 
assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. 
ee The GTI assessment will be performed only at baseline, W15 and EoS/ED. If W15 does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the assessment should be 
performed at the next on-site visit. 
ff Participants will be trained to self-administer IMP (foreseen in the OLE trial; not in the ARGX-113-1904 trial) during the first 4 visits as of V3 when IMP is 
administered; thereafter, training for self-administration is optional (only if needed). 
gg IMP will be administered until CRmin. To ensure proper safety monitoring, participants should remain at the site for at least 1 hour after the first administration 
and for 15 minutes after subsequent administrations. Participants will be released according to their clinical status. For Germany-specific monitoring 
instructions, refer to Section 10.16.2.1 . Participants who experience treatment failure, or flare after achieving CRmin, will be allowed to roll over into the OLE 
trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than W31. Participants who do not roll over into trial ARGX-113-1905 will complete the treatment-free follow-up period. 
hh Disease assessment parameters include disease control (DC), end of consolidation (EoC), complete clinical remission (CR), complete remission on minimal 
therapy (CRmin), complete remission off therapy (CRoff), flare, and treatment failure. Participants who have achieved CR and have new lesions should come 
to the clinic for a UNS for disease assessment. 
ii Prednisone dose tapering will begin 2 weeks after achieving CR or 4 weeks after sustained EoC (thus, no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 6 
weeks and approximately 80% or more of lesions have healed).

argenx Confidential 145 GTI Supporting Information: Definitions
Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy definitions: 
Glucocorticoid myopathy is defined as mild symmetrical weakness of the proximal 
muscles and/or neck flexors associated with steroid therapy and NOT due to any 
other apparent cause. Muscle enzymes are typically within normal limits. 
 Minor/Mild and moderate severity myopathy are defined by a muscle strength of 
grade 4 on the standard Medical Research Council Rating scale.
A 4 means weaker than normal but greater than antigravity strength against 
resistance. 
“Minor” or “Mild” is mild weakness (Grade 4) that does NOT functionally limit 
the patient. 
 “Moderate” is mild weakness (Grade 4) that does impose functional limitations on 
the patient enough to interfere with normal daily activities. 
Note that a person may have muscle weakness consistent with glucocorticoid-
induced myopathy that is detectable on physical examination but the person is not 
aware of it or have any corresponding functional limitation. This would be 
classified as minor or mild. 
 Severe glucocorticoid-induced myopathy, defined as a weakness of grade 3 or less 
(no more than antigravity strength and unable to overcome any resistance or any 
degree weaker), is included in the Specific List. People who are severely weak may 
have difficulty rising from a chair without assistance or other major functional 
limitations but the formal categorization should be based on the degree of weakness 
on strength testing.

where CR is observed, W10, and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) will be tested for all confirmed positive ADA 
samples. 
xQuestionnaires are to be completed prior to any other activity.
y Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (W5), W15, and EoS/ED visits. If the W15 visit does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the 
assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. 
z The GTI assessment will be performed only at baseline, W15 and EoS/ED. If W15 does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the assessment should be 
performed at the next on-site visit. 
aaParticipants will be trained to self-administer IMP (foreseen in the OLE trial; not in the ARGX-113-1904 trial) during the first 4 visits as of V3 when IMP is 
administered; thereafter, training for self-administration is optional (only if needed). 
bbIMP will be administered until CRmin. Participants should remain at the site for at least 1 hour after the first administration and 15 minutes after subsequent administrations for safety monitoring. Participants will be released according to their clinical status. Participants who experience treatment failure, or flare after 
achieving CR on minimal therapy, will be allowed to roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than W31. Participants who do not roll over into trial 
ARGX-113-1905 will complete the treatment-free follow-up period.  
ccDisease assessment parameters include disease control (DC), end of consolidation (EoC), complete clinical remission (CR), complete remission on minimal 
therapy (CRmin), complete remission off therapy (CRoff), flare, and treatment failure. Participants who have achieved CR and have new lesions should come 
to the clinic for a UNS for disease assessment. 
dd Prednisone dose tapering will begin 2 weeks after achieving CR or 4 weeks after sustained EoC (thus, no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 6 
weeks and approximately 80% or more of lesions have healed).

urinalysis, serology (ie, viral testing), and tuberculosis QuantiFERON/IGRA test and other tests 
that have been approved in China with similar validity versus QuantiFERON (eg, T-SPOT) will 
be collected and analyzed as indicated in the SoA (refer to Section 10.16 ) and Section 10.16.1.3. 
In China, a certified laboratory will be used for clinical safety laboratory assessment. The urine 
sample for the pregnancy test will be analyzed locally. 
Participants may be rescreened (ie, redoing the full assessments as per SoA in Section 10.16) or 
retested once (ie, repeating 1 test, see Section 5.4) if still within the screening period. 
On days that IMP is administered, blood for laboratory assessments should be collected before 
dosing. 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated, at the discretion of the 
investigator.
For all female participants of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at 
screening (on the samples taken for clinical laboratory tests), and a urine pregnancy test will be 
conducted and analyzed locally at the site at the visits specified in the SoA (Section 10.16 ). A 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test will be run to confirm postmenopausal status and 
exclude that a woman is of childbearing potential; see Section 10.5. 
Clinical laboratory tests will be reviewed for results of potential clinical significance at all time 
points throughout the trial. The investigator will evaluate any change in laboratory values. If the 
investigator determines a laboratory abnormality to be clinically significant, it will be considered 
as a laboratory AE, however, if the abnormal laboratory value is consistent with a current 
diagnosis, then it may be documented accordingly without being reported as an AE.
The details of sampling, handling, storage, and transportation of the samples will be described in 
the Laboratory Manual. 
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the trial should be recorded as an AE and repeated until the values return to normal or baseline 
or are no longer considered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. 
 If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by the investigator, then the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified.
 All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 10.16.1.3 , must be 
conducted in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the SoA (Section 10.16 ).  
 If laboratory values from non-protocol specified laboratory assessments (except for 
total IgG; refer to Section 8.6) performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a 
change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the 
investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the event must be recorded in 
the eCRF.

on-site visits until EoS/ED. For participants achieving CR between V1(BL)/W1 and W6, samples will be taken predose at V1(BL)/W1, W3, W5, the visit 
where CR is observed, W10, and then every 4 weeks at on-site visits until EoS/ED. Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) will be tested for all confirmed positive ADA 
samples. 
xQuestionnaires are to be completed prior to any other activity.
y Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 4 weeks (W5), W15, and EoS/ED visits. If the W15 visit does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the 
assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. 
zThe GTI assessment will be performed only at baseline, W15 and EoS/ED. If W15 does not coincide with an on-site visit, then the assessment should be 
performed at the next on-site visit. 
aaParticipants will be trained to self-administer IMP (foreseen in the OLE trial; not in the ARGX-113-1904 trial) during the first 4 visits as of V3 when IMP is administered; thereafter, training for self-administration is optional (only if needed). 
bb IMP will be administered until CRmin. Participants who do not roll over into trial ARGX-113-1905 will complete the treatment-free follow-up period. 
Participants should remain at the site for at least 1 hour after the first administration and 15 minutes for subsequent administrations for safety monitoring. 
Participants will be released according to their clinical status. Participants who experience treatment failure, or flare after achieving CR on minimal therapy, 
will be allowed to roll over into the OLE trial ARGX-113-1905 earlier than W31.  
cc Disease assessment parameters include disease control (DC), end of consolidation (EoC), complete clinical remission (CR), complete remission on minimal 
therapy (CRmin), complete remission off therapy (CRoff), flare, and treatment failure. Participants who have achieved CR and have new lesions should come 
to the clinic for a UNS for disease assessment. 
ddPrednisone dose tapering will begin 2 weeks after achieving CR or 4 weeks after sustained EoC (thus, no new lesions have developed for a minimum of 6 
weeks and approximately 80% or more of lesions have healed).

To ensure proper safety monitoring, participants should remain at the site for at least 1 hour after 
the first administration. In Germany, participants should remain at the site for at least 30 minutes 
after the 5 subsequent administrations and for 15 minutes after all administrations thereafter. 
Participants will be released according to their clinical status.

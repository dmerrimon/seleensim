 Transcranial Near -Infrared Light in Healthy Subjects: a 
Cerebral Blood Flow Study with Diffuse Correlation 
Spectroscopy (NIR -flow).  
 
 
1. Study Summary  
Protocol  #:  
  
Study Purpose:  The purpose of this study is:  
 To assess the change in cerebral blood flow  induced by the 
Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Light 
Therapy in healthy subjects  
 To correlate with cognitive performance  the change in cerebral 
blood flow  induced by the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse 
Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 To correlate with skin pigmentation  the change in cerebral 
blood flow  induced by the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse 
Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 To correlate with brain electrical activity  the change in 
cerebral blood flow  induced by the Transcranial Continuous 
and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 To assess the safety and tolerability  of the Transcranial 
Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy 
subjects  
 
  
Trial Design:  In essence, t his study  consists in three sequential sessions of Diffuse 
Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS), each one week apart , to test three 
different modes of intervention with Transcranial Light Therapy  
(TLT) . Healthy subjects will receive  first a session with continuous 
light (c -TLT), then a session with sham (s -TLT) and one session with 
pulse light (p -TLT). Before and after e ach session, subjects will 
undergo  DCS, which will allow measuring the impact of the 
interv ention on cerebral blood flow. We expect that out of 30 subjects 
enrolled 10 subjects will be eligible to complete the study.  The study 
will be conducted in single b lind.  
  
Study 
Population:  Subjects  eligible for study participation will be healthy  by Structured 
Clinical Interview for Diagnostic Statistical Manual -IV (SCID ) 
criteria .  Subjects will be between 18 -70 years of age (have not had 
71st birthday) on the d ate of screening. Subjects who will be permitted 
into the study include those who meet all the inclusion criteria and 
have none of the exclusion criteria.

.    
   
Duration of 
Participation:  Subjects will be followed in the study for  5 weeks.  
 
Endpoints:   
Engagement of cerebral blood flow – The effect of TLT on 
cognition will be assessed before and after each session (c -TLT, s -
TLT and p -TLT) by measuring the Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy 
(DCS ) signal.   
Engagement of cerebral electrical activity  – The ef fect of TLT on 
brain electrical waves  will be assessed before and after each session 
(c-TLT, s -TLT and p -TLT) by measuring the Electro -
Encephalographic (EEG)  signal.   
Engagement of cognitive circuitry – The effect of TLT on working 
memory will be assessed  immediately after each session  by n -back 
task.

 3. Introduction   
Transcranial Light Therapy (TLT) with near -infrared light has recently emerged as a 
potential new antidepressant treatment in both animal models  1 and human studies 2–4. TLT 
consists of delivering invisible near -infrared radiation (NIR) , or red light  to the scalp of the 
subject , which penetrates the skull and modulates function of the adjacent cortical areas of 
the brain. Red and/or near -infrared light appear s to increase cellular brain metabolism and 
neuroplasticity, and to modulate endogenous opioids, while decreasing inflammation and 
oxidative stre ss 5–7. TLT has been shown to penetrate deeply into the cerebral cortex 8–10, to 
modulate cortical excitability 11 and improve cerebral perfusion 10 and oxygenation 12. 
Studies have suggested that it can significantly improve cognition in healthy subjects 13–15, 
and in subjects with traumatic brain injury  16–18. The safety of TLT has been studied in a 
sample of  1,410 acute stroke subject s, with no significant differences in rates of adverse 
events between TLT an d sham exposure 19–21.  Converging evidence from uncontrolled 
studies suggests both an antidepressant and anxiolytic effect of TLT in subjects suffering 
from Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) 2–4. It is critically important to understand the 
biological targets of TLT and w e hypothesize that the improvement in cerebral brain flow 
is one of the underlying mechanism for the boost in bioenergetic metabolism leading to 
therapeutic effects, such as enhancement of cognitive functioning.   
3.1 Summary of Prior Clinical Experience  
 
We conducted two studies on the safety an d efficacy of TLT  delivered to the forehead 
(prefrontal cortex) twice a week in subjects with MDD.  
 
ELATED -1 was  a proof of concept study of 3 weeks of TLT (Neurothera - class IV 
laser, wavelength 808 nm; irradiance 700 mW/cm2; fluence of 84 J/cm2; total energy 
2.4 kJ per session for 6 sessions) ( 6). All subjects (n=4) were treated with TLT. 
Baseline mean Hamilton Depression rating scale ( HAM -D-17) scores for depression 
decreased from 19.8±4.4 (SD) to 13±5.35 (SD) aft er treatment (p=0.004).   
 
ELATED -2 was a double -blind, randomized, controlled study of 8 weeks of TLT 
(Omnilux New U - LED, 830 nm; 36.2 mW/cm2; up to 65.2 J/cm2; vs. sham for 16 
sessions). At endpoint, the mean HAMD -17 for depression decreased of 11.7±7.5 
points ( TLT, n=9) vs. 5.3±7.0 points (sham, n=9) (p=0.04); the differences were even 
more pronounced in the completers sample as HAMD -17 decreased of 15.7±4.4 ( TLT, 
n=6) points vs. 6.1±7.9 points (sham, n=7) (p=0.01).  
 
These findings suggest that  TLT could be a novel intervention for subject s with MDD.  
Both the Laser  study (ELATED -1) and the LED  study (ELATED -2) were conducted by 
our group at Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ).  
 
NIR-flow (the present submission) will test for the first time  the biological 
underpinning of TLT , by focusing on the effect of TLT on cerebral blood flow .

.    
 The LiteCure® The PhotoBioModulation -1000 (TPBM -1000)  device to be used in this 
study does not require  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) approval. In fact, the 
TPBM -1000 device used in this study is considered a non -significant risk device 
because:  
 TPBM -1000 dose does not exceed the Maximum Permissible Exposure 
(MPE) for skin – Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),  
21CFR1040.10 and 21CFR1040.11;  
 TPBM-1000  is substantially equivalent to the OmniLux New U device (used 
in ELATED -2 at MGH), which the FDA has already categorized as a non -
significant risk device;    
 TPBM -1000  differs from the OmniLux  New U  only in that it provides an 
additional site of irradiation – treatment is delivered to EEG sites FP1 and 
FP2 in addition to F3 and F4 on the forehead;  
 currently FDA -cleared LED devices are typically available over -the-counter 
and are considered saf e to use without professional supervision.  
3.2 Overview of LiteCure  Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) System  
LiteCure® TPBM -1000  is a new device with the flexibility to safely deliver either 
continuous light (c -TLT), pulsed light (p-TLT), or sham.   The TPBM -1000  device  is 
configured for in-office use. 
 
TPBM -1000  deliver s NIR light output at 830 +/ - 30 nm.  The NIR output is invisible to 
the naked eye, thus, the  device includes visual  and/or audible  indicators of light 
emission , and is designed to deliver light to  EEG sites: Fp1, Fp2, F3 and F4, covering a 
total surface active t reatment area, of  35.8 cm2[(11.52 cm2x2) + (6.38 cm2x2)]  with an 
average irradiance of 54.8 mW/cm2 and an average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2.  While the 
average fluence (energy density) is comparable to the Omnilux New U , the treatment 
area is significantly less  for the TPBM -1000  (Omnilux New 28.7 cm2 x2, which results 
in less total energy delivered per session of 2.3 kJ (compared to up to 3.7 kJ for the 
Omnilux New U) .   
 
TPBM -1000  devices  will be fabricated  to deliver either c -TLT, p -TLT, or Sham  (s-
TLT) . In simple terms, in either TLT mode the TPBM -1000  device delivers therapeutic 
NIR energy; in sham the device will not deliver any light energy. The apparent 
behavior (i.e. the performance/output of all visible and audible indicators) of the  device 
in any of the three programmed treatment modalities will be identical , ensuring the 
study is blinded to the operator.  In addition, because of the low average irradiances 
delivered in e ither c -TLT and p -TLT modes the subject s will not experience any 
heating sensation ensuring the study is single -blind. The device will shut off 
automatically if skin temperature above 41C were detected . 
 
The TPBM -1000  devices  consists of a source of light,  mounted on a cap, attached to a 
console that controls the  light delivery modality: c -TLT, p -TLT, or Sham .

.    
 3.3 Overview of the DCS Device  
Separate  hybrid FDNIRS -DCS instrument s are  described in detailed in the relative 
medical device brochure.    FDNIRS -DCS d evices are approximately 23” (l) x 18” (w) 
x 9” (h). Technical specs are provided at:  
 iss.com/biomedical/instruments/metaox.html . The devices are limited by Federal (or 
United States) l aw to investigational use. The devices contain no conductive patient 
leads and no user serviceable parts. They have a highest rated current of 3 Amp and 
are designed for safety compliance with UL/IEC 60601 -1 3rd Edition as a Class I, 
Type B device. Prior t o investigational use, devices are tested for conformance with 
ground bond, earth leakage, and enclosure leakage requirements. The devices are not 
yet under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational device exemption 
(IDE) regulations, and are cons idered non -significant risk. During the conduct of 
human studies the investigators should follow good clinical practice requirements and 
21 CFR 812 investigational device exemption regulations.  
 
The FDNIRS portion of the instrument consists of 8 radio - frequency (110 MHz) 
modulated laser diodes operating at 8 different wavelengths ranging from 670 -830 
nm and 2 to 4 photomultiplier tube (PMT) detectors for heterodyne detection (similar 
to the Imagent from ISS, Inc).  
The DCS component of the instrument consi sts of a long -coherence length 852 nm 
laser, 4 to 8 low dark -count photon counting avalanche photodiodes, and a custom -
made correlator board. A short -pass filter in front of the FDNIRS PMTs, along with 
in-house designed software enables simultaneous FDNIRS -DCS measurements.  
Furthermore, to customize this instrument for use in humans, the MGH group has 
designed optical probes which host fiber optics. Each probe consists of 1 source and 
up to 8 detector fiber bundles terminated with 90 deg prisms providing mu ltiple 
source -detector separations (ranging from 0.3 to up to 5 cm).    
The optical parameters for the FNIRS - DCS device s can be summarized as follows, 
irradiance 250 -400 mW /cm2; area: 0.0962 cm2 and 10 min exposure (twice 10 min, 
before and after the session with TPBM -1000); fluence: 150 -240 J/cm2. Total energy 
delivered in 10 min by the FNIRS -DCS device s: 14.43 – 23.08 J (this energy will be 
delivered twice before and after  each TPBM -1000 sessions). The incremental 
exposure to NIR resulting from the FNIRS -DCS device s are minimal: in fact the NIR 
light is shed to a tiny area 1/350 of the area irradiated by TPBM -1000 and the energy 
shed in 10 min by the FNIRS -DCS are  inferior to the total energy shed by the TPBM -
1000 by more than 2 orders of magnitude.   
 
3.1 Overview of the EEG  Device  
 
The StatX24 (Advance Brain Monitoring)  is an internally battery powered Type BF 
device intended for continuous use (16 -17 hours). The StatX24 provides an integrated 
approach for wireless acquisition and recording of electroencephalographic (EEG), 
electrooculographic (EOG), and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. The system 
 
  
                           Page 11 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 utilizes the patented Sensor Headset and patented EEG sensors, which record high 
quality EEG, obtained with less than five -minutes of set -up time and no scalp 
abrasion required. The wireless technology allows the user to be un -tethered and 
move around the home, healthcare facility, or clinical research environment while 
real time data is collected and displayed.  
The StatX24 acquires twenty channels of monopolar EEG recordings with a linked 
mastoid reference and optional channel for ECG, EOG, or EMG. The 1 -10th 
channels, as well as the 21st channel, are differential channels.  The 22nd -24th 
channels are referential channels. The StatX24 consists of: (1) StatX24 Headset with 
a Bluetooth (BT) Receiving Unit for bi -directional transmission of digitized 
physiological signals, (2) a Neoprene Strap, and (3) a Strip with EEG sensors s ites in 
the standard 10 -20 format + POz (Fz, Cz, Pz, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, T5, T3, 
F7, Fp1, Fp2, F8, T4, and T6 with Linked Mastoids).  
The Sensor Headset collects signals from the sensors placed on the patient and 
performs analog -to-digital conve rsion, encoding, formatting, and transmitting of all 
signals. The signals communicate using a 2.4 to 2.48 GHz radio transmitter. StatX24 
acquisition utilizes the bi -directional capabilities of the system to initiate scalp -
electrode impedance monitoring and  monitors the battery capacity in the StatX24 
Headset. A BT Receiving Unit is used as the base unit affixed to the PC workstation.  
3.2 Overview of Rationale for Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy Cognit ive 
Tasks  and Electroencephalogram  
Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy  
From a cellular and molecular perspective, the beneficial effect of TLT (NIR) on 
brain metabolism is the primary putative mechanism for its therapeutic effects.  In 
experimental and animal models NIR (and red) light delivered noninvasively is 
absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase, and by stimulating the mitochondrial respiratory 
chain, leads to increased adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) production  22. In a study on 
healthy subjects, TLT (NIR) improved cerebral oxygenation, supposedly through a 
mechanism of neurovascular coupling, which entails an increase in cerebral blood 
flow coupled with increased oxygen demands 12.  Similarly, a study in MDD subjects 
found that a single session of t -PBM led to a nearly significant increase in regional 
cerebral blood flow 2 ─ both studies relied on functional NIR spectroscopy (fNIRs) to 
assess, respectively, oxygenation and blood flow.   In a case report of moderate, 
chronic TBI, the improvement in brain perfusion subsequent to TLT was imaged with 
single positron emission computerized tomography (SPECT) 23. 
 
Cognitive Tasks  
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are 
uniquely situated to play a critical role in learning , executive functions, attention and 
inhibition . Studies have shown that DLPFC exhibits significant plasticity  during the 
learning process, in which neuronal activity changes to dynamically encode and 
recode procedural memories once a sensory motor association has been made. The 
purpose of this study is to determine whether TLT can be used to change the speed at 
which subjects learn and perform in cognitive tasks .  TLT applied to prefrontal 
 
  
                           Page 12 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 regions of the brain implicated in visual -motor learning processes can enhance neural 
plasticity and improve behavioral performance.  
 
Electroencephalogram  
EEG recorded at the sc alp offers the opportunity to access the synchronization of 
oscillatory frequencies (1Hz to 100Hz) from within and between cortical regions, 
revealing network changes that reflect abnormal connectivity. Synchronization within 
and between cortical regions i s of interest in the field of TLT. In animal models of 
depression, TLT was found to regulate  the EEG  tracing  in all wave frequency bands 
except for theta . Similar effects have been documented in dementia subjects who 
experienced normalization of delta and alpha waves power during the course of a 
pilot study with TLT treatment (Berman M & Hamblin M unpublished data).   
 
 
4. Investigational Plan  
4.1 Rationale  
The specific aims of this study are: 
1. To assess the change in cerebral blood flow  induced by the Transcranial Continuous 
and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy (c -TLT and p -TLT) in healthy subjects  
2. To correlate with cognitive performance  the change in cerebral blood flow  induced 
by the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Lig ht Therapy in healthy 
subjects  
3. To correlate with brain electrical activity  the change in cerebral blood flow  induced 
by the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy 
subjects  
4. To correlate with skin pigmentation  the change in  cerebral blood flow  induced by 
the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy 
subjects  
5. To assess the safety and tolerability  of the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -
Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 
 
 
4.2 Study De sign 
This study is a single -blind, sham -controlled, study on the use of Transcranial  
continuous  light therapy (c-TLT)  and pulse  light therapy  (p-TLT) as an enhancer of 
cerebral blood flow in healthy subjects .    
 
We expect that out of 30 subjects enrolled 10 subjects will be eligible to complete a 
sequence of three sessions of  Transcranial  Light  Treatment  (TLT ) and sham.   
 
 
  
                           Page 13 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 All eligible subjects  will receive two  TLT sessions and one of s ham (s-TLT)  within 
the course of 5 weeks . While the sequence  (c-TLT, s -TLT, p -TLT)  will be the same 
for all subjects, the subject s will be blind to the specific mode of function used in 
each session.  
 
The study site (MGH ) will have one Litecure device , which will recognize the 
subjects’  codes generated by the study statistician. Only  subjects will be blind to the 
treatment group assignment. The Sham treatment consists of applying all the 
procedures for the delivery of the TLT, while actually delivering no light. The 
blinding of the sham will be effective b ecause the radiation is not visible and because 
the active therapy (continuous or pulsed) will not produce any subject -discernable 
difference from sham, e.g., skin warming. T he sham treatment will mimic the TLT 
procedure. The tr eatment will be bilateral and applied to the frontal areas with two 
application site s on the left side and two on the right side [left and right forehead 
centered on EEG sites on F3 , F4, Fp1, Fp2 ]. Energy is administered with a radiation 
wavelength of 830 nm. The duration of irradiation is 20 minutes at each application 
site (the 4 sites are irradiated at the same time which is equivalent to 20 minutes of 
total time ). The entire sessions is estimated to last about 1.5 hours. The additional 
time is  needed to have the subject complete a urine toxology and self -report forms, to 
prepare the subject, to place the necessary protections (e.g. goggles), to inspect the 
subject’s skin, to complete DCS before and after TLT, to set the TLT devices , and to 
give the subje ct time to rest after the irradiation. TLT treatment will only be 
administered by licensed physicians (i.e. MDs) who are on study staff. All staff who 
deliver treatment must pass training that is approved by the MGH  Laser Safety 
Committee. The treatment wi ll follow these specifications: wavelength 830  nm; 
average irradiance 54.8 mW/cm2; average fluence of 65.8 J/cm2 (consistently with  
energy density used in the ELATED -2 study at MGH with the device  Omnilux  New 
U). 
4.3 Study Population  
 
Healthy subjects who meet all inclusion criteria, have none of the exclusion criteria,

.    
 Subjects will be recruited, via screenings, advertisements , and postings . Study 
participants will also be recruited via internet -based advertisements, e.g., 
Craigslist, Clinical Trials @ Partners, the study site ’s website s, RSVP for 
Health (which will also generate listserv emails to Partners employees, 
regarding research studies in need of volunteers), etc.   
 
Participants who contact the respective study site staff in response to any of 
the aforementioned advertisements w ill complete phone  screening questions 
to determine preliminary eligibility for the study.  
4.3.2 Use in Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must consent (without any element 
of coercion) to use a double -barrier me thod for birth control (e.g. condoms 
with spermicide) if sexually active.  A pregnancy test will be performed at 
the Screening Visit.  
 
4.3.3  Criteria for Enrollment  – listed on pages 5 -6 
4.4 Subject Numbering  
Subjects enrolled in the NIR-flow study will be identified by subject numbers 101 
through 130 (to account for screen failures and drop -out before TLT sessions ). 
4.5 Sample Size  
The NIR-flow study is expected to enroll 30 subjects, with 10 subjects who will be 
eligible and have analyzable data  (at least 1 session post randomization) .   
 
4.6 Subject Confidentiality  
Any information and data provided to Litecure Inc. or its designees in reference to 
any subject’s participation in this investigation will be considered confidential. The 
Investigator wil l need to ensure that all subjects’ anonymity will be maintained on all 
documentation submitted to Litecure Inc  by completely redacting (eliminating or 
“blacking out”) each subject's name and/or other identifying information. The 
identifying information wi ll be replaced with the subject's study number and initials. 
The investigational site is not to provide to Litecure Inc  information such as subject’s 
telephone numbers, home address, personal identification numbers such as passport 
numbers, etc. Care must be taken by site research personnel when communicating 
with representatives from Litecure Inc  in the form of telephone or electronic 
correspondence in not providing information that may disclose a subject’s identity.  
 
Documents associated with the study th at are not intended to be submitted to Litecure 
Inc (e.g., signed Informed Consent Forms) must be kept in strict confidence by the 
Investigator.  Only study site personnel, authorized Litecure Inc  personnel, and 
regulatory authority inspectors will have ac cess to these confidential files.

.    
 4.7 Study Visits  
Study visits occur a t MGH Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Disorder 
(CATSD ) in Boston .  
 
The study involves screening,  3 TLT session paired with Diffuse Correlation 
Spectroscopy (DCS), and one  follow -up visit.  
 
Screening Visit (Week 1)  
The screening visit is expected to take about 2 hours. The Principal Investigator (PI) 
at the site or a Sub -investigator will assess subjects  against the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  If a subject  appears to qualify and agrees to participat e in the 
study, then the subject  will undergo the informed consent process prior to initiation of 
any study -specific activities. Screening Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be completed 
and subjects who qualify to pa rticipate in the study will proceed to the first Treatment 
Visit 1. If the subject does not meet entry criteria, the Investigator will document the 
subject’s ineligibility for study participation and complete the appropriate CRFs.   
 
TLT-DCS  Visits – Visit s 2-4 (Weeks 2-4)  
There is  one TLT session per week for 3 weeks.  TLT-DCS Visit 2 -4 will consist of 
all subjects receiving  TLT, with DCS before and after TLT.  Two groups of 
assessments will be conducted: 1. Before the TLT session  to reflect the symptoms 
endorsed in the past week : Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire  (ASQ ), Symptoms of 
Depression Questionnaire  SDQ , Quality of Life in N eurological Disorders ( Neuro -
QoL), Sexual Functioning Inventory ( SFI), Systemic Assessment for Treatment 
Emergent Events ( SAFTEE) , and 2. After the TLT session  to reflect the immediate 
changes associated with the session : Positive and Negative Symptoms Questionnaire 
(PANAS ), TLT Self -Report Questionnaire ( TSRQ ), Perceptions of Blinding 
Questionnaire ( PBQ). C ognitive tasks  will occur right after the TLT session .  A 
detailed description of the study visits can be found below.  EEG recording will 
immediately precede and follow the DCS -TLT-DCS triad and will in part overlap 
with the cognitive task.  
 
Follow -Up Visit  – Visit 5 
All subjects will undergo  assessments including ASQ, SDQ, Neuro -QoL, SFI, 
SAFTEE, PANAS  and cognitive tasks at the follow -up visit (Week 5).  
 
4.8 Detailed Study Visits  
4.8.1 Screening Visit – Visits 1 (Week 1) 
Purpose  
The purpose of the Screening Visit will be to determine the eligibility of subject s 
for participation in the NIR-flow  study.  
 
 
 
  
                           Page 16 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 Procedures  
The screening visit will occur at the MGH Center for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress 
Disorders (CATSD) in Boston. At this visit subjects will be consented for the study, 
will receive a psychiatric evaluation, and will be screened for presence of 
psychiatric disorders using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic 
Statistical Manual -IV (SCID -IV).  The SDQ, ASQ and PANAS will be used to 
assess for subthreshold sympto ms. The SFI and NEURO -QoL will be used to assess 
sexual and cognitive functioning.  
 
Routine laboratory tests (Urine Tox Screen and Urine Pregnancy Test) and 
complete physical exam including vitals and weight will be performed at screen; the 
tests will be processed by a laboratory at MGH.  
 
Once all tests and procedures become available for review, the Investigator will 
then proceed to closely re -evaluate the subject for all the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
4.8.2 TLT -DCS Visits – Visits 2 -4 (Weeks 2-4)                                                                                                                                      
The TLT s essions will occur once  weekly for three weeks at  the MGH Martinos 
Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown . Subjects missing one session will 
be allowed to still receive their TLT session, by shifting the overall study schedule 
of one week. The study PI will be an active participant in the delivery of the TLT. 
The PI and other collaborators from MGH CATSD  will assist with the delivery of 
TLT. The device  TPBM -1000  for the administration of the TLT will be provided by 
Litecure  Inc. Litecure  will provide training of MGH CATSD  staff in the use of the 
device  and will provide training certificates at the completion o f the training .   
 
The overall study visit is estimated to last about 1.5 hours. The TLT session is 
estimated to last about 50 min – 5 minutes of EEG before DCS,  10 minutes of DCS 
before  TLT, 20 minutes of TLT, 10 minutes of DCS after  TLT and 5 minutes of 
EEG after DCS . EEG recording will extend to cover at least part of the time 
devoted to the cognitive tasks. Study sessions will take place in an office dedicated 
to TLT treatment at MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imagining in 
Charlestown . Only the subj ect and the staff administering the TLT will be allowed 
in during the session. The subject will comfortably lie down on a n exam bed  or sit 
on a recliner . The sites of application of TLT (left and right forehead) will be 
inspected for any possible skin lesi ons (e.g. laceration or signs of inflammation) 
which would contraindicate the treatment. The study staff administering the TPBM 
device at the TLT -DCS sessions will appropriately remove any reflective objects to 
fall into or obstruct the path of the light e nergy produced by this device. Both the 
subject receiving the  TLT and the study staff will wear protective eyewear in the 
form of goggles .  During treatment sessions the office will be kept completely dark 
and a warning sign will hang  at the office door.  The staff will be provided training 
on basic safety procedures relative to the use of the device.  
 
 
  
                           Page 17 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 The trained staff administering the TLT will use utmost care to never  shine the light 
in or nea r the eyes of the subject  safety goggles will be selected ba sed on the TLT 
biophysical properties, in accordance to the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) guidelines. The delivery of the TLT is expected to last 20 
min total (simultaneous application on the left and right forehead). The subject wil l 
be asked to rest for five minutes after the delivery of TLT. The skin at the sites of 
the application will be inspected again prior to dismissing the subject. A log with 
the dates of treatment delivery per each study subject will be kept at MGH CATSD  
(Boston) .  
 
During TLT-DCS  Visit 2-4, subjects will receive  TLT-c (Visit 2), TLT -s (Visit 3)

4.8.4 Termination  
We will encourage  subjects to complete the follow -up visit  in the study regardless of 
discontinuation of the TLT  sessions .   
4.9 Scales & Forms  
We will offer clinical interviews and study forms in English. All scales will explore 
the past 7 days except for SCID (lifetime), PANAS (past 5 min), TSRQ and PBQ 
(both past session). Below are brief descriptions of the forms that will be utilized in 
this study.  
 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID -I/P) – The SCID -I/P, 
administered by the clinician, proceeds by modules to diagnose the different 
psychiatric disorders. Questions here are asked exactly as written, and each is 
based on the individual  criteria from DSM -IV. Answers are generally rated on a 
scale of 1 -3 (1 = doubtful, 2 = probable, 3 = definite), and based on the number of 
positive answers, a diagnosis is determined. The entire SCID -I/P is administered 
at screening as per Table 1.   
 Symp toms of Depression Questionnaire (SDQ) – This is a comprehensive 
measure of depression that includes the assessment of symptoms in the anxiety –
depression spectrum. It assesses irritability, anger attacks, and anxiety symptoms 
together with the commonly con sidered symptoms of depression. Analysis of the 
factor structure of the SDQ identified 5 subscales, including one in the anxiety –
depression spectrum, with adequate internal consistency and concurrent validity.  
 Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ) – This, is a 17 -item self -report 
questionnaire measuring the frequency and intensity of 17 symptoms of anxiety, 
including nervousness, worrying, irritability, trouble relaxing, insomnia, lack of 
energy, difficulty concentrating, somatic symptoms, and impairment in  
functioning due to anxiety.  
 Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE -SI) – The 
SAFTEE is a commonly used instrument originally developed by NIMH and 
adapted into a self -report instrument. The version of the scale that we plan to use 
 
  
                           Page 19 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 is the same used by the multi -center, NIMH -sponsored CO -MED trial, and it 
examines in a systematic fashion all possible treatment -emergent side effects and 
probes specific adverse symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and 
self-injurious behavi or.  
 Positive and Negative Symptoms Questionnaire (PANAS) – The 20 -item 
PANAS, comprises two mood scales, one measuring positive affect and the other 
measuring negative affect. Each item is rated on a 5 -point scale ranging from 1 = 
very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely to indicate the extent to which the 
respondent has felt this way in the indicated time frame. The authors have used 
the scale to measure affect at this moment, today, the past few days, the past 
week, the past few weeks, the past year,  and generally (on average).  
 Adverse Events Form - the Adverse Events Form captures any adverse event 
(serious or otherwise) specifically related to the application of the TLT. This 
form will help to determine if the side effects of the TLT are too great fo r a 
participant to continue in the study.  
 Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro -QoL Item Bank v2.0 – 
cognition function – short form) - The cognitive section of the Neuro -QoL is an 
8 item self -rated measure of both executive function and general concerns. It 
measures perceived difficulties in cognitive abilities (e.g., memory, attention, and 
decision making) or in the application of such abilities to everyday tasks (e.g., 
planning, organizing, calculating, remembering and learning).  
 Massachusetts General Hospital Sexual Functioning Inventory (MGH -SFI) -
This is a subject -rated self -report outcome measure that quantifies sexual 
dysfunction into 5 functional domains (“interest in sex,” “sexual arousal,” “ability 
to achieve orgasm,” “ability to maintai n erection” [males only], and “sexual 
satisfaction”).  
  The TLT Self -Report Questionnaire (TSRQ)  – An open -ended questionnaire 
focusing on potential inconveniences and discomforts from the TLT.  
 Concomitant medications form – This form will be completed at  every TLT 
study visit, including the screening visit, as a safety -monitoring tool.  
 The Perceptions of Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ): the PBQ is a self -report 
questionnaire to determine the degree to which the participant believes s/he is 
receiving the treatment or the sham.  
4.10 Cognitive tests  
n-Back Task : The subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists 
of indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from  n steps earlier in the 
sequence. The load factor  n can be adjusted to make the task more or less difficult.  
The n-back task captures the active part of working memory. When  n equals 2 or more, 
it is not enough to simply keep a representation of recently presented items in mind; the 
working memory buffer also needs to be updated continuously to keep track of what the 
current stimulus must be compared to . To accomplish this task, the subject needs to b oth 
maintain and manipulate information in working memory .

.    
 4.11 EEG recording  
The participant will be fitted with an EEG sensor headset and ECG leads  to start their 
resting state data acquisition. For resting state acquisition with eyes open, the participant 
will be asked to relax, sit still and focus on a cross on the computer for 5 minutes while 
EEG data is acquired. The participant will be instructed to try to limit blinking and any face 
movement including clenching their jaw. Several acquisitions and/or lon ger acquisitions 
may be necessary if the participant is particularly restless. The participant will then be 
asked to relax and close their eyes for 5 minutes during the eyes closed resting state 
acquisition. Multiple and/or longer eyes closed acquisitions may be necessary if the 
participant has difficulty or is unable to sit still for 5 minutes. Any issues, including 
inability to remain still for the acquisition, should be noted in the participant's file.  
 
 Data Collection Forms  
All study subjects will be blind to  TLT assignment  (single -blind) . A number of 
procedures are in place to assure data integrity and protocol adherence. We will use 
Research Electronic Data Capture to support direct data entry by subject s and study staff. 
REDCap is a free, secure, HI PAA compliant web -based application hosted by the Partners 
HealthCare Research Computing, Enterprise Research Infrastructure & Services (ERIS) 
group. Web -based surveys rely on a study -specific data dictionary defined by members of 
the research team with pl anning assistance from Harvard Catalyst/The Harvard Clinical and 
Translational Science Center EDC Support Staff. These support staff will then oversee the 
automated export of study data from REDCap to a relational study database in Microsoft 
Access 2000, a llowing for systematic data querying and checking.  
Self-report measures will be completed by participants on a computer, directly into 
REDCap, thus minimizing errors due to data entry.  For clinician -administered measures, 
all clinicians and independent e valuators (IEs) will enter responses directly in REDCap.  
 
To minimize missing data for self -report forms, we will program missed question 
warnings in REDCap that will alert participants in real -time if they inadvertently skip a 
question.  Participants may  then go back and answer any missed questions, or, if they 
intentionally skipped questions, they may ignore the warning message and continue answer 
the remaining questions.  We will also program real -time range checks in REDCap that 
generate error messages  if a value outside the acceptable range is entered for a given field.  
To ensure confidentiality, data will be identified in the database only by subject number, 
visit number, and date of visit. By recording the study data in this manner, the information 
can be considered ‘de -identified’ and therefore compliant with the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health Information (“Privacy Rule”) of the Health Insurance 
Portability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Any data that is transmitted electronically w ill be fully 
encrypted and password protected. Subjects’ names will not be entered into the database; 
each will be uniquely identified only by an ID number. Consent forms, any hard copy PHI, 
and any study measures that are completed on paper will be kept a nd filed in locked office 
cabinets.  
 
  
                           Page 21 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 4.12     Data Management  
The principal investigator , Dr. Cassano  is ultimately responsible for the quality of 
the data collection and overall conduct of the study, and directly supervise  the study 
coordinators and data managem ent staff at MGH . Data management will include clinician 
and subject  rated assessments (see assessments), screening data, fidelity data, visit 
adherence data  and rater reliability data and safety reporting , including  DCS and cognitive 
data. Weekly reports  from REDCap  will monitor subject enrollment, completion, attrition, 
and individual subject progress as well as the completion of critical assessments. 
Additional reports will be done as needed to monitor baseline cha racteristics, protocol 
adherence, and other issues of interest.  
 
All measures that are completed on paper will be entered by the RA into REDCap , and 
a two pass verification system will be used to minimize any data entry errors. All records in 
REDCap have a form completion status that may be Incomplete (appears as a red circle in 
Record Status Dashboard), Unverified (yellow circle), or Verified. The RA initially 
entering data will save each record entered as Unverified (at which point it will appear as a 
yellow circle in the Record Status Dashboard). A second RA at each site will then go into 
each unverified record, compare each entered value against the paper source document, 
make any corrections, and then re -save the record as Verified (at which point it w ill appear 
as a green circle in the Record Status Dashboard). The color coding system built into 
REDCap readily allows for identification of unverified records.  
 
Coded data may be sent to collaborators within and outside of Partners for research 
purposes. Coded sample/data may be shared with for profit companies that are working 
with Partners researchers, such as Litecure, LLC or Advanced Brain Monitoring, Inc (the 
manufacturer of the EEG device used this in study). Samples/data will not be sold to 
anyone f or profit.  Data may also be shared with other Partners IRB approved protocols 
supervised by the principle investigator of this study.  
 
4.13     Training  
Trained study clinicians will administer diagnostic assessments and rating scales. 
All raters will be exper ienced clinicians who will have undergone specific training to 
criteria  in the use of the study measures.  
4.14      Blinding of the Study  
Since this is a single -blind, sham -controlled study, measures have been taken to 
assure that the integrity of the blinding of the treatment modalities remains intact. The two 
means of assuring that the treatment modalities will not be disclosed to subjects  include  
detectors sen sitive to heating of the skin  (which will switch off the device to prevent 
overheating)  and the introduction of a rating scale for subjects to assess their best guess on 
treatment assignment.  
 
 
  
                           Page 22 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 The performance/output of all visible and audible indicators is  identical for all three 
treatment modalities, (i.e. other than  the emission of invisible light radiation, the behavior 
of the system is identical for all).  
4.15      Compensation  
 Subjects will be compensated $50 per screen (only if deemed eligible) and $100 per 
TLT-DCS visit, and $50 per follow -up visit; for a total of $400, if all five visits are 
completed. Compensation will be provided after Weeks 2 ($150), 3 ($100), 4 ($100), an d 5 
($50), with the correspondent amount subtracted for each visit missed. Any research 
participant parking in one of the three Mass General Hospital garages will receive a 
parking voucher.  
 
4.16      Accountability/Investigational Product Control  
 U.S. f ederal law and ICH Guideline E6 § 5.14 requires that all investigational 
medical devices be strictly controlled. All study devices must be kept in a secured area at 
the clinical sites in compliance with all applicable FDA (U.S. sites) regulations.  
 
 The Principal Investigator s or designated study site personnel who verify the receipt 
of the devices/device accessories must complete the Device/Accessories Acknowledgment 
Form and fax a copy to Litecure Inc .  Device Accountability and Acknowledgment Logs 
will be maintained at each study site.  These logs will list all equipment received, the 
receiving date, the serial number of each device.  Study site personnel will initial the log 
each time the device is used. TPBM -1000  use will also be recorded on the appro priate 
CRF.   
 
 Malfunctioning devices and device accessories, including all components, will be 
returned to Litecure Inc. for investigation , at Litecure expense .   
4.17      Clinical Adverse Events  
 4.17.1 Overview and Definitions  
All adverse events will be recorded from the time of Informed Consent 
through study completion, or termination.  The Adverse Event CRF must be 
completed and submitted to the IRB, FDA, and Litecure , as required.  Regulations 
for adverse event handling and r eporting contained in the FDA and ICH Guidelines 
will be adhered to.  
 
Consideration of Adverse Events will hereafter consist of Adverse Events, 
Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Device Effects, including Anticipated 
Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipat ed Adverse Device Effects.  
 
 Adverse Event is defined as any untoward/undesirable clinical occurrence in 
a clinical investigation of a subject using a device and/or product and which 
 
  
                           Page 23 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a device product, 
whether or not considered related  to the device product. Only abnormal 
laboratory values that are deemed clini cally significant by the investigator 
will be classified as adverse events.  
 Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward/undesirable adverse 
experience that results in any of the following outcomes:  1) death; 2) a life -
threatening adverse experience; 3) inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation 
of existing hospitalization; 4) a permanent/persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; 5) important 
medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or  require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition .  
 Anticipated Adverse Device Effect is defined as any adverse effect related  to 
the device or procedure, which is identified in the protocol . 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects is defined as any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, 
or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary pla n or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
 4.17.2 Safety Monitoring  
The study subjects will undergo frequent  clinical evaluations including 
mood and anxiety  scores, concomitant medications, adverse events, and serious 
adverse events and unexpected device events will be recorded from study entry 
through completion.  
 
If skin erythema is present, treatment will be suspended. Subject s will be 
instructed to  contact the study site principal investigator or a member of his staff at 
any time between visits concerning adverse events or worsening of subthreshold 
symptoms. If at any study visit the subjects’ clinical condition is significantly 
worsened from baseli ne, the subject will  be referred to appropriate level of care . 
(see 4.8.4  Termination ).    
 
Recording of physiological data with the EEG system poses no known 
health risk. Participants may experience mild discomfort due to the pressur e exerted 
by the senso r headset; to minimize this risk, caps are adjustable and sensor strips are 
available in a variety of sizes.  Discomfort may also arise from a mild allergic 
response to extended exposure to the conductive gel used in the EEG sensors; to 
mitigate this risk, alcohol wipes will be available to remove the gel immediately to 
reduce any allergic reactions.  
 
  
                           Page 24 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
  
 
The s ite Principal Investigator (Dr . Cassano) will have monthly  conference 
calls or meetings  (which will include study RAs); during these conference calls he 
will discuss all Adverse Event reports to identify any safety concern, based on such 
concerns he will be able to decide temporary discontinuation of study enrollment, 
modifications of the study protocol, or to terminate the study .   
 
Research assistants responsible for data collection and storage will be aware 
of and comply with all regulatory requirements related to adverse events.  In the 
event that a subject  becomes ill or is injured as a direct result of study participation, 
medica l care will be made available.  All adverse events (and device events) will be 
followed to resolution and reported to the MGH IRB as serious in the ev ent that 1. 
they are unanticipated and possibly related to the study (same reporting as SAE) or 
2. if they  meet any one of the following criteria: Any fatal event, immediately life -
threatening event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event requiring or 
prolonging inpatient  hospitalization, or any congenital anomaly. This also includes 
any event tha t a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, 
contraindication, side effect, or precaution.   
 
Expedited review will occur for all events meeting the FDA definition of 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) – i.e., any fatal event, immediately life -threatening 
event, permanently or substantially disabling event, event requiring or prolonging 
inpatient  hospitalization, or any congenital anomaly. This also includes any event 
that a study investigator judges to impose a significant hazard, contraindicat ion, 
side effect, or precaution.  Notification by e -mail of all related study forms shall be 
made to the  IRB within 2 days of the occurrence of any SAE.  Information will be 
reviewed and a determination made of whether there was any possible relevance to 
the study TLT exposure.  Additional reporting to l ocal IRBs will be done within 5 
business days/7 working days of the date the investigator first becomes aware of the 
problem.  
            4.17.3 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
After review with  the subject by the study site personnel, all Adverse Events 
occurring during the study, whether or not attributed to the TPBM -1000  device or 
TLT procedure, observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject, will be 
documented in the subject’s source  document and on the appropriate CRF pages.  
The following attributes must be assigned:  
 
1. Description of event  
2. Date of onset  
3. Date of resolution (if applicable)  
4. Seriousness  
5. Relationship to the study device and/or procedure(s)  
6. Intensity  
7. Action(s) taken  
 
  
                           Page 25 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 8. Outcome(s)  
 
Intensity is defined as a measure of the severity of a reac tion, effect or experience. 
The measurement(s) are described as mild, moderate or severe. The event itself, 
however, may be of relative minor medical significance.  
 
The intensity of Adverse Events is assessed as mild, moderate or severe according 
to the following index scale:  
 
Mild  
The Adverse Event is transient, requires no treatment, and does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activity.  
Moderate  
The Adverse Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to 
the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually ameliorated 
by simple therapeutic measures.  
Severe  
The Adverse Event interrupts the subject’s usual daily activity and requires 
systematic therapy or other treatment.  
 
If the Adverse Event is of such intensity in the Investigator’s judgment that it 
warrants withdrawal from the study, the subject should be withdrawn from 
treatment. The subject should be given appropriate care under medical supervision  
until symptoms resolve.   
 
The relationship of an Adverse Event to the study device or procedure will be 
graded as follows:  
 
None  
The Adverse Event is not associated with the study device use.  
Remote  
The temporal association is such that the study device is not likely to have 
had an association with the observed Adverse Event.  
Possible  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  
a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use, but  
b) Could have been produced by the subject’s clinical  state or other modes 
of therapy administered to the subject.  
Probable  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  
a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use;  
b) Abates upon discontinuation of the treatment;  
c) Cannot be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical state.  
Definite  
This causal relationship is assigned when the Adverse Event:  
 
  
                           Page 26 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 a) Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from device use;  
b) Abates upon discontinuation of the tre atment; and  
c) Is confirmed by the reappearance of the Adverse Event on repeat 
exposure.  
 
*For purposes of reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events, “None” and “Remote” 
will be considered as having no association with the device or treatment procedure.  
 4.17.4 Serious Adverse Events  
All Serious Adverse Events must be reported to the overseeing Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), FDA, and Litecure Inc as required.  
 
If the Investigator s are notified by Litecure Inc  or its designee  of any Serious 
Adverse Events that are considered to be Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects, the 
Investigator s must notify his/her own IRB/EC as required.  
 4.17.5 Deaths  
Deaths which must be reported to Litecure Inc include all deaths while participating  
in the study.  
 4.17.6 Withdrawals for Adverse Events  
All Adverse Events which result in the subject’s withdrawal from the study must be 
reported immediately by telephone to Litecure Inc . 
  
The Investigator may be asked to provide detailed follow -up information.  The 
Investigator will determine the reportability of the event on a case -by-case basis, 
and will report to the appropriate regulatory authorities evaluating the study device 
as neces sary.   
4.18 Measures to Assure Subject’s Safety  
The Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who enter 
this study and for alerting Litecure Inc of any study -related  event that seems unusual and/or 
unanticipated for his/her si te.  
 
The Investigator will be responsible for the appropriate medical care of the subjects 
during the study in connection with protocol procedures for his/her site.  
 
The Investigator will remain responsible for providing any appropriate health care 
option s after a subject’s completion or discontinuation from the study due to adverse events.  
 
  
                           Page 27 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 4.19 Subject Disposition Criteria  
4.19.1 Withdrawal from the Study  
Each subject and the Investigator reserve the right at any time to terminate a 
subject’s participation in the clinical investigation.   
 
Possible reasons for withdrawal or removal from the study may include:  
 
1. The subject voluntarily withdraws consent.  
2. The subject was not eligible based on the study inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  
3. The subject develops an Adverse Event that would not allow continuation in 
the study.  
4. The subject has an Adverse Event which in the opinion of the Investigator 
warrants withdrawa l from the study. Litecure Inc must be notified within 
two business days.  
5. A decision is made by the subject and/or Investigator that the subject should 
be withdrawn from the study.  
6. Subject death  
7. Positive pregnancy test during the eligibility procedures  
 
Treatment will end for participants who experience temporary pain or discomfort 
during a treatment session. A research assistant or the study doctor will follow -up 
within a 24 -hour period, after the discontinued treatment, with the patient who 
experienced discomfort. The subject may continue with the study if the acute pain 
stopped. If the subject experiences discomfort after 24 -hours the aforementioned 
treatment discontinuation process may begin.     
When a subject withdraws or is removed from the study, t he following will be 
performed, if feasible , at the study termination (exit) visit : 
 
 Concomitant medications form  
 ADVERSE EVENTS FORM  
 ASQ (self -rated)  
 SDQ (self -rated)  
 NEURO -QoL (self -rated)  
 SFI (self -rated)  
 SAFTEE (self -rated)  
 PANAS (self -rated)  
 Cognitive  tests 
 
For all subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely, the date, and reason for 
withdrawal will be documented.  
 
  
                           Page 28 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
 4.19.2 Lost to Follow -up 
If the  site is unable to contact a subject or if the subject fails to appear for a visit, 
three documen ted phone calls should be made. T he site’s unsuccessful attempts to 
contact the subject and the  subject’s failure to contact the site will result in the 
subject being withdrawn from the study.  The subject will be considered Lost to 
Follow -up.  
 
4.20 Risk and Benefits Overview  
4.20.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Risks to the subject may include but are not limited to the following:  
The TPBM -1000  emits light with a longer wavelength than the human eye can see. 
The TPBM -1000  output is less than the maximum permissibl e exposure (MPE).  
The staff will be provided training on basic safety procedures relative to the use of 
the device. The staff administering the TLT will be careful not to operate the 
TPBM -1000  device  unless it is in direct contact with the subject’s skin. Both  the 
subject receiving the TLT  and the study clinician present in the TLT delivery room  
will wear protective eyewear in the form of goggles or eye pads.   The goggles 
provided with the TPBM -1000  are in direct contact with the area surrounding the 
subject’s eye.  Since they are reusable they should not be shared between subjects.  
The eye pads are disposable and should be discarded after use.  The eye pads use an 
adhesive to adhere to the subject’ s eyelids so there is potential for an allergic 
reaction.  
 
Failure of the TPBM -1000 , resulting in the cessation of investigative therapy can 
cause:  
1. No adverse event to our knowledge  
2. Unforeseeable adverse events  
 
Delivery of the infrared energy to an inappr opriate site, such as directly over the 
open eye, is not recommended and could pose a risk to the subject.  
 
Application of the TPBM -1000 may result in mild thermal sensation of 
warmth  during the use.  The temperature of the skin is well below the level for 
thermal damage.  
 
Based on human clinical trial experience to date, each adverse event listed 
below has been reported with TLT : 
1. Application Site Erythema  
2. Application Site Pain  
3. Applica tion Site Discomfort  
4. Application Site Warmth  
5. Application Site Reaction  
6. Headache  
 
  
                           Page 29 of 39                                                    C O N F I D E N T I A L                                                                           
.    
  
Additional potential side effects of TLT, documented at MGH in prior trials, 
include:  
 
- Seeing vivid colors, having abnormal taste  
- Feeling “out -of-body” experiences  
- Insomnia, restless sleep, erratic sleep, early morning awakenings  
- Vivid dreams  
- Irritability  
- Word finding difficulties  
- Abdominal bloating  
 
Other potential risks are described below:  
 
Risk of Worsening of lingering Depression  of Anxiety and  Manic Switch :   
We will min imize this risk by selecting only healthy subjects.  We will also 
discontinue any subject who develops active suicidal ideation during the course of 
the study ; we will then  arrange for appropriate levels of care and standard 
antidepressant treatment ( see 4 .8.4 Termination ).  Manic switches are possible 
adverse events and will be closely monitored during treatment as well.  Subjects 
who develop mania or hypomania will be discontinued and provided appropriate 
level of care.  
 
Answering detailed questionnaires  may create a mild degree of inconvenience 
for the subjects.  
 
Length of testing for cognitive circuitry : 
The total length of this task takes a total of 45-60 minutes at baseline and 45 
minutes from  week  1 to week 5 . There is no expected risk to the subject s beyond 
the ~45-60 minutes of sitting in front of computer for testing  and possible 
experience of startle . Every effort will be made to ensure that the subject s are 
comfortable and safe during this period, and the study can be stopped at any time. 
Beyond these issues, there is minimal or no risk to the subject s. 
4.20.2 Benefits  
Study subjects will receive systematic MINI assessment of their DSM  comorbidity  
and subthreshold symptoms . This information will be readily available to their 
treating clinicians  of PCP  if the subjects so desire and agree to disclosure. This 
information might guide long term treatment  if subjects are indeed symptomatic . In 
the short -term, the subject will receive close and syst ematic monitoring for anxiety 
and depressive symptoms  and formalized cognitive assessments , beyond current 
standards of care. Easy access to routine physical exams are also a potential benefit.

 5   Data Analysis Methods  
5.1  General Considerations  
The purpos e of this study is to assess the change in cer ebral blood flow induced by 
the Transcranial Continuous and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy 
subjects  
 
This study is expected to enroll 30 subjects and treat 10 subject s with TLT for a total 
study duration of 5 weeks.  
5.2  Specific Primary Aim 
To assess the change in cerebral blood flow induced by the Transcranial Continuous 
and Pulse Near -Infrared Light Therapy in healthy subjects  
 
Hypothesis 1: We anticipate that p-TLT will trigger a significantly greater increase in 
CBF as compared to c -TLT, and c -TLT will trigger a significantly greater effect than 
sham (s -TLT). We expect that we will be also able to  estimate the effect size  of each 
type of TLT in terms of increase of CBF .  
5.3  Sample Size  
With respect  to the TLT study, we expect 30 subjects  to sign informed consent, 
including screen failures.   
 
5.4  Subject Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized.  Descriptive 
summaries will include the number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum for continuous parameters, frequencies and percentages for 
categorical parameters.  
5.5  Efficacy Analyses for Primary Aims  
 
For the primary analysis,  delta CBF (measured with DCS -spectroscopy pre - and post - 
TLT) will be compared in all ten subject s by paired t -test. The primary comparisons 
will include: a) delta CBF for p -TLT and delta CBF for c -TLT subject s (n=20  within 
subject comparison ) and b) delta CBF for c -TLT and delta CBF for s -TLT (n=20  
within subject comparison ).  
5.6 Safety Analyses  
The number and percent of Adverse Events through study completion will be presented 
by adverse event type.

.    
 5.7 Additional Safety Analyses  
Descriptive statistics for safety endpoints will include number of s ubjects, mean, 
standard deviation, median minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and 
frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.

 6 Ethical Review & Regulatory Considerations  
6.1  Ethical Review  
Prior to the start of the study the Investi gator will obtain IRB approval of the protocol 
and the Informed Consent Form. Additional documentation may be required pending 
applicable local requirements.  At least the following documentation must be 
obtained:  
 
1.The IRB/EC approval of the protocol.  
2.The IRB/EC approval of the Informed Consent Form.  
3.The IRB/EC annual (or any other frequency when applicable – i.e. quarterly, 
semiannually according to the local IRB/EC standard operating procedure) 
renewed approval of the protocol.  
4.The IRB/EC approval of any revisions to the Informed Consent Form or 
amendments to the protocol.  
6.2  Regulatory Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines and other applicable regulatory requirements including but not  limited to:  
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations on Investigational Device 
Exemption (21 CFR 812),  
 The FDA Regulations on research with human beings ( 21 CFR 50 , 54 and 56),   
 The Health and Human Services (DHHS) Regulations on research with human 
beings (45 CFR 46  Subparts A, B, C, and D) and  
 The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) “Guidance for Industry -E6 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline.”   
The Study will be conducted in the US in accordance with the Privacy Rule (45 CFR 
Parts 160 and 164)  of the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA).     
 
6.3  Monitoring Procedures  
Monitoring will be conducted by the PI who will periodically review lab results and 
clinical information. The PI will be coordinating the different phases of the protocol 
implementation such as TLT delivery and follow up. The PI will be frequently in 
contact with the other staff members responsible for TLT delivery and with Litecure 
Inc, which will lend the TLT device. We have minimized risks potentially associ ated 
with the use of Transcranial  Light  Therapy (TLT) by requiring two methods of 
contraception (although TLT has not been associated with teratogenic effect).  In 
addition, we are providing the subjects with  safety goggles or eye pads during the 
TLT deliv ery.  We have also included treatment discontinuation rules based on the

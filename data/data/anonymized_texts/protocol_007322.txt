EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  10 2 INTRODUCTION  
Multifocal contact lenses provide correction for vision at near as well as in the distance. This 
segment of the contact lens market has been slowly growing as more products bec ome 
available. In the past year,  two monthly replacement, multifocal contact lenses have come to 
market that also correct the astigmatism component of a prescription.  
CooperVision are interested in comparing their contact lens (Biof inity Toric Multifocal) with a 
competitor lens (Ultra Multifocal for Astigmatism, Bausch & Lomb). Of particular interest is the 
comparison of handling the lens to insert onto the eye. A previous study  sponsored by 
CooperVision compared the non -multifocal lenses of these lens brand families,  and showed that 
the Biofinity Toric lens was easier to insert than the Ultra for Astigmatism lens. Ease of handling 
a lens for insertion is arguably more critical in a presbyopic population who require specific prescript ion for seeing well up close.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
The objective of the study is  to compare the handling and performance of Biofinity Toric 
Multifocal to Ultra Multifocal for Astigmatism.  
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
1. Subjective at -home ratings of  ‘Lens handling for insertion’ , using a 0 -10 scale, collected 
on Day 28 .   
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between  the subjective at-home ratings of 
‘Lens handling for insertion’, collected on day 28 for each lens type. 
5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This is a prospective, randomized, participant  masked, crossover , bilateral dispensing study  
conducted at CORE and seven other clinical practice sites in Canada and the USA . Each lens 
type will be worn for approximately one month. The lens prescription of each lens type will be 
optimized after 3 -7 days before the one month wear period.  
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  11 5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will be generated using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The final study randomization schedule will be generated by CORE’s  
Database Administrator  and provided to the research assistants at each site for the study.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
Participant s will be masked to the lens type they are wearing during the study. Foils will not be 
visible to participants when the lenses are removed from the blister packs and information 
specifying which lens is being worn will not be shared with the participant.  
It is not possible for the study investigators to be masked because of the need to follow the 
specific lens fitting guide during the lens prescript ion optimization visit (visits 1 -1 and 2 -1).  
5.2 STUDY POPULATION 
5.2.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size was calculated using the end of month subjective ratings for ‘lens handling for insertion’ from a previous study .  
In order to detect a mean difference of 0.7 units on the 0 to 10 scale for the end of month ratings of ‘lens handling for insertion’, using a standard deviation of 1.7 with 80% power and alpha 0.05 in a two -tailed t -test, a minimum sample size of 49 participants is recommended. To account for 
dropout, up to 60 participants may  be randomized and dispensed with study product in total, with 
the target of  at least 49 completing the study.  
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  12  
Figure 1: Sample size calculation graph  
 
5.2.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records , databases  and advertising materials (eg. 
posters, email scripts) approved by the relevant r esearch ethics review board. All initial 
individual -targeted recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment scripts, will be 
conducted by practice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the research. This 
separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. This process 
will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.  
It is anticipated that up to 80 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 60 participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of 49 
completing the study. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants prior to their 
enrolment in the study (Appendix 1). 
 

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  13 5.2.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 42 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years; 
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week;  
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule; 
6. Habitual ly wears  soft contact lens for the past 3 months minimum;  
7. Has refractive astigmatism of at least -0.75DC;  
8. Is presbyopic and requires a reading addition of at least +0.75D;  
9. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen (or +0.20 
logMAR) which participants also deem to be ‘acceptable’, with the available study lens 
parameters  (sphere +4 to -6; cylinder -0.75 to -1.75DC;  near addition +0.75 to +2.50) . 
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Habitually wears one of the study contact lenses; 
3. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection; 
4. Has a systemic condition  that in the opinion of the investigator may affect  a study 
outcome variable;  
5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may 
affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable; 
6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein and/or the care product Opti -
Free PureMoist  being used in the study;  
7. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment;  
8. Has undergone refractive error surgery.  
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not act ive. 
 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  16 5.3.6 DISPOSING OF STUDY PRODUCTS  
At the end of the study, all sites will return all unused products  to CORE , unless otherwise 
directed. Worn lenses will be disposed of at the sites according to local regulations. 
5.3.7 PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
Accountability logs must  be kept by each site to include the number of contact lenses and lens 
care system bottles received, dispensed  and returned. (where relevant). All products dispensed 
to participants must also  be recorded in participant dispensing logs. All logs should be sent to 
CORE on request.  
5.4 SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
This study has a minimum of 9  scheduled study visits, including the screening visit , though some 
visits may be scheduled concurrently on the same day . There is an option for repeated 
screening and lens fitting visits as needed.  
A scheduled follow- up visit may only take place when the participant  attends  wearing the 
study lenses for at least two hours. If  this is not the case and the participant  is not experiencing 
any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations  will be assessed for their 
suitability to be included in the analysis population.  Table 3 summarizes the scheduled study visits 
and study codes.

in the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and is eligible to continue in the study. 
12. From both fitting set s, the investigator will chose lenses that are close to the required 
prescription to determine the axis rotation of the lenses on each eye . The investigator will 
complete their lens order sheet after giving consideration to the axis rotation of this initial 
fitting lens.  
13. Schedule Visit  0-1 in approximately 4-6 weeks time or schedule once  lenses are 
available on site.  

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  19 5.4.2 REPEATED SCREENING VISITS 
In some circumstances a repeated screening may need to be scheduled. Examples include, but 
are not limited to:  
1. Incomplete information available at time of screening to determine eligibility (e.g. current lens brands worn, history from current eye care practitioner etc.)  
2. Study procedures unable to be completed in time scheduled for visit;  
3. Study products not available at the time of the screening visit;  
4. A transient health condition which may affect the eye(s) (e.g. a common cold, active allergies, fatig ue etc. ) 
5. The short term use of medications (e.g. antibiotics, antihistamines etc.) 
6. Reassessment of baseline ocular conditions (e.g. corneal and/or conjunctival staining, scars etc.)  
The maximum total number of screenings permitted will be 3, the initial and two repeat screening visits.

weeks time or wait until lenses arrive on site.  
5.4.4 REPEATED LENS FITTING VISITS  
Because it is not possible to provide each site with a complete fitting set of all available power combinations, multiple lens power combinations will be ordered to maximize the likelihood of a successful lens fit at visit 0 -1. However if this initial lens  fitting is unsuccessful and further lens 
powers are required, they will be ordered and a repeated visit, visit V0- 1/R1, will be scheduled. 
There is no limit to the number of repeated visits allowed within the protocol.  They will be 
numbered successively eg. V0 -1/R1, then V0- 1/R2, then V0- 1/R3 etc.

completed either at study completion, or if the participant is discontinued from the study at another 
time. A study exit form must be completed for all participants who have taken a study ID number. 

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  27 5.5.1 STUDY LENS FITTING   
Both lens types will be fit according to the manufacturers fitting guide, using the vertex -corrected 
spectacle refraction as a guide. Learnings from the first lens fit will not be applied to the second 
lens fit because it is of interest to determine how many lenses were needed to achieve the final 
lens prescription at V0- 1 and at each optimization visit (V1- 1 and V2 -1).  
For both lens ty pes, the multifocal contact lenses  may need to  be ordered to conduct and 
complete the  trial fit ting. Lenses will be ordered through CORE, see section 5.3 for details. If 
necessary , the same brand of ‘non- multifocal’ toric lens (ie. Biofinity Toric or Ultra  for 
Astigmatism) may be used to determine the orientation and possibly the sphere and cylinder 
powers  required for the respective brand of multifocal contact lens . These toric lenses will not be 
recorded in lens accountability logs but their prescription,  expiry date and Lot# details will be 
recorded on the study data collection forms. 
This protocol allows for an unrestricted number of lens fitting visits and they will be numbered as 
follows:  
• V0-1 (first fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R1 (first repeated fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R2 (second repeated fitting visit)  
• V0-1/R3 (third repeated fitting visit)  
• Etc.  
No lenses will be dispensed until the final prescriptions for each lenses have been determined 
during a fitting visit.

6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by CORE. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the prot ocol will be  reported in the study report. As described in Section 
15.4.3 , major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and the relevant r esearch ethics 
review board within 7 days of the Principal Investigator becoming aware of them ( or as per 
research ethics review board guidelines) .  
7 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO HUMAN PARTICIPANTS  
This is a minimal risk study  because of the use of marketed products and standard optometric 
assessments. 
The two c ontact lens  types in this study  will be wor n as per their approved use; on a daily wear 
basis, for up to 1 month each. Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact 
lenses can occur  (eg: inflammation and infection) . Complications that may occur during the 
wearing of contact lenses include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, 
discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision. More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are 
very infrequent, the possibility does exist. The incidence of infection due to daily -wear soft 
lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one eye. Thirty five million Amer icans who currently wear contact lenses assume this risk.  
When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact lenses are worn on an extended wear 
basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with wearing 
contact lenses on a daily wear basis . 
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
Participants  will be provided with OptiFree PureMoist to care for the study contact lenses. 
Participants will be asked if they  have a known allergy or sensitivity to this product.  

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  31 20 Other sign and/or symptom warranting classification as a non- significant 
adverse event  
 
8.1 NORMAL OR ADAPTIVE SYMPTOMS 
Transient symptoms such as end- of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact lens wear and may occasionally reduce wearing time. These 
are not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opinion they are unexpected in nature, severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
8.2 PROCEDURES FOR ADVERSE E VENTS  
Treatment of an adverse event will depend on its nature and severity. Based on the clinical judgment of the investigator the participant may be referred to an ophthalmologist for treatment. The investigator will attempt to determine whether the reaction is related to the test device or a result of other factors. An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a separate adverse event form will be completed for each eye . Whenever 
possible, the adverse event will be photo -documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor (bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to the site Principal Investigator and CORE ’s contact 
below within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event .  Reporting  to the IRB will be completed by 
the respective site Principal Investigator, overseen by CORE’s contact, within 24 hours , via the 
IRB specified method (by fax, mail/ delivery, phone or email, unless otherwise specified by the IRB. CORE ’s contact  will inform the sponsor immediately upon  becoming aware of the event , at 
least within 24 hours . All fat al or life threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB.   
CORE sub -investigators and all s ites will report a ll other Adverse Events to CORE’s contact below 
who will report them to the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  32 occurrence.  CORE  will ensure all adverse  event s are reported to all IRBs involved in this study 
approval,  as per IRB  requirements  (by fax, mail/delivery, phone, or email).  
 
   
   
   
   
 
 
  
   
   
   
    
 
 
Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report. 
9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the par ticipant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed for their active involvement in the study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a participant will be 
offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study: 
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding:  Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study 
depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   

EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  33 • Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent symptoms they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to 
reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topical ocular medication during the study  unless  that topical ocular medication 
is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
investigator) after stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular condition).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do 
not return for a final exit visit, and if the investigator has made a reasonable effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE  or a research ethics review 
board. 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required .   
When a participant choses to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  34 Adverse Eve nt should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. The research ethics review board  would also be notified within 
24 hours of any device malfunction that may contribute to a Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as 
comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be provided with a 
letter of appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about recei ving 
feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
Participant remuneration will be  provided at the end of their study involvement. 
12 S TATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
All data will be analyzed by CORE  at the University of Waterloo.  Unmasked data analysis will 
be conducted using Statistica 10, Statsoft or other suitable software.  Descriptive statistics will 
be provided on demographic data (age, gender, refractive error distribution, etc.).  Table 7  lists 
the primary and other outcome variables and anticipated statistical procedures.  
Visual acuity results will be converted to LogMAR for analysis purposes. 
Comparisons will be made between the study lenses for the variables measured at the 1 month 
visits. Additionally the subjective ratings completed on days 7 , 14 and 28 of each phase will be 
compared. A binomial test will be used to analyze the results for the count data of subjective 
preferences and experience responses. Where relevant, the number of “neither agree or disagree” responses will be evenly distributed to the two options on the basis they would be equally likely to choose either.  
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  36 time period for download, IP logging and email notification of download.  Files may be encrypted 
prior to transmission at the request of the sponsor. Using this method means that data files are 
only stored on University of Waterloo servers  during the transfer .  
12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by CORE’s L ead I nvestigator.  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. 
Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by CORE on the study 
protocol , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their license to practice 
optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONIT ORING 
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits may be conducted by the sponsor , or sponsor’s designate,  throughout 
the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Princip al Investigator at each site . In 
addition study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the sponsor's designate, the relevant 
research ethics review board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada and the United States, 
namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
Study data review and data monit oring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by two people and the entries will be compared. Data 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  37 queries will be reported to the site within 5 working days of receipt of initial data. A response 
resolv ing the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal  Investigator  and 
CORE . All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site 
Princip al Investigator  and CORE’s  Head of Clinical Research and/ or CORE’s Principal 
Investigator .

– Clinical Trials Committee (HREBA -CTC)  for study site G and the Sterling Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) for all other clinical study sites. Notification of ethics clearance of the application is 
required prior to the commencement of the study  the respective provinces and sites . 
15.3 CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION 
CooperVision will register this study with clinicaltrials.gov  and maintain the information.  
15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received prior sponsor approval and ethics clearance . Protocol dev iations can be major or minor.  
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  38 15.4.1  MAJOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or 
other study materials, usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to ensure the saf ety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of major protocol deviations that require reporting to research ethics 
review boards: : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed 
to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect 
contact lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed); 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design;  
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.2  MINOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations caused by or which originate with research participants are considered minor, and normally are not reported to the research ethics review board  unless these result in 
increased risk to the participant (s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are 
considered minor and do not require reporting to the research ethics review board: : 
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed 
appointment, change in appointment date) ; 
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during a session that is  not considered critical for the study).  
15.4.3  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROT OCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations must be reported to the site Principal Investigator and CORE’s contact 
below . CORE will inform the sponsor within 7 days of any major protocol deviations that 
occurred during the study.  Major protocol deviations must be reported by the site Principal 
EX-MKTG -110 DINGO Protocol v1. 7 21dec2020  39 Investigator, overseen by CORE’s contact, to the  research ethics review board via the IRB 
specified method (by fax, mail/ delivery, phone or email)  within 7 days  of the deviation occurring 
(or its discovery)  unless otherwise specified by the IRB.   
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and 
included in the final report . 
   
   
   
   
 
15.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
The sponsor, CORE  or the relevant r esearch ethics review board  may terminate the study at any 
time for any reason.  
15.6 STUDY PARTICIPANT RECORDS  
Study participant  record s will be completed to comply with GCP guidelines . Records will contain : 
• Unique study acronym and/or code; 
• Participant  ID;

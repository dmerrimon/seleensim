Title  A Randomized, Blinded, No-Treatment  control, Multicenter, Prospective Clinical Study of 
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity for the Treatment of Moderate to Severe  Perioral Rhytids  
Sponsor  TEOXANE  SA, Rue de Lyon 105, CH - 1203 Genève, Switzerland . 
Study 
Duration  52 to 58 weeks for subjects randomized 
to TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity 
treatment group,  and  
60 to 66 weeks for  subjects randomized 
to the “ No-Treatment ” control group  Number of 
Subjects  At least  200 subjects, 150 treated 
and 5 0 No-Treatment  controls  
Treatment 
Groups  Subjects will be randomized (3:1 ratio) to one of the following groups:  
• TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  
• No-Treatment  control  
Study Design  This is a randomized, blinded, No-Treatment  control, multicenter, prospective clinical study, to 
identify whether TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is more effective than No-Treatment  in the 
correction of moderate to severe perioral rhytids  at Week 8 after last treatment.  
The Treating Investigator  (TI) at screening will evaluate the subject’s perioral rhytids  severity 
using the Peri oral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale  (PR-SRS) for eligibility of the subject for the 
study.  
The Blinded Live Evaluator  (BLE) at screening will evaluate the subject’s perioral rhytids severity 
using the PR-SRS in order to confirm eligibility and to establish a pre-treatment score  for 
assessment of effectiveness . This will be done independently of the TI, and exact concordance 
between the BLE and the TI is not necessary  for eligibility of the subject for the study . 
Enrolled subjects will be randomized to either the TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity treatment group 
or the “No-Treatment ” control group. The TI will administer study device, and if necessary, 
subjects will receive a touch -up treatment 14 days following the initial treatment to optimize the 
results. The TI will conduct safety and effectiveness evaluations at study  visits, which will occur 
at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 52 after the last treatment, and 4 weeks after a repeat treatment.  
A Blinded Live Evaluator (BLE) will conduct assessments of efficacy during the trial, including 
assessment of the primary endpoint at Week 8  after the last treatme nt. The BLE will conduct 
effectiveness evaluations at Week  8, 12, 16 , 24, 36, and 52 after the last treatment.  
All s ubjects will be followed for 52 weeks after initial treatment or touch -up, at which point they 
will be  offered retreatment  (provided that the TI deems the treatment to be appropriate and the 
subject agrees)  and will then be followed for 4 weeks after retreatment  before exiting the study . If 
a subject has returned  to his pre -treatment PR -SRS score at Week 1 2 or Week 16 or Week 24 or 
Week 36 after initial treatment or touch up (as assessed by the TI), s ubject will be eligible for 
optional early retreatment if necessary at 12 or 16 or 24 or 36 weeks after baseline  (provided that 
the TI deems the treatment to be appropriate, and the subject agrees) . The subject will then be

Subjects receiving optional early retreatment at Week 12 or Week 16 or Week 24 or Week 36 after 
the after initial treatment or touch -up, will be offered  retreatment at Week 52 . 
Subjects randomized to the “ No-Treatment ” control group will receive their first treatment after 
the primary endpoint evaluation  (Week 8 after randomization ) and will then follow the same 
schedule as the initial treatment group.  
Hypothesis  TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity will be superior to No-Treatment  control for the correction of 
moderate to severe perioral rhytids  as determined by the PR -SRS at Week 8 after the last treatment. 
An improvement  in the PR -SRS of ≥1 -grade compared to pre-treatment  will be considered 
clinically meaningful.

Device 
Administration  Depth of injection:  Study device will be administrated into the dermis, including the superficial 
dermis.  
Injection technique:  The injection technique (e.g., linear threading, cross hatching, fan like 
administration, multiple puncture , etc.) , injection direction (e.g., retro -grade, or ante-grade ), and 
how the wrinkle was injected (e.g., following the wrinkle, right angle to the wrinkle, etc.) , will be 
at the discretion of the TI, and will be record ed. 
Injection area:  For the purposes of this study, the lip will be defined as the structures within the 
vermilion border. The focus of this study is to treat perioral rhytids , and there will be no 
augmentation of the lips , but the vermilion border may be  treated to ensure a satisfactory result of 
the treatment of the perioral rhytids.  
Amount of device to administer:  The maximum volume per administration of the study device 
into the perioral rhytids (upper and lower) is 6.0 mL per treatment session (max 3.0 mL for upper, 
and max 3.0 mL for lower).   
Blinding  The BLE will be blinded to the treatment allocation. Furthermore, to ensure that they remain 
masked and unbiased when making their assessments throughout the study, the BLE, TI and 
subject will n ot be allowed to refer to each other’s efficacy assessments.  
All subjects will be instructed to not discuss their study treatment, AEs, or CTRs with the BLE.

Primary 
Endpoint  The primary endpoint will be a co -primary endpoint. A responder will be defined as a subject who 
has a ≥1-grade improvement on the PR -SRS as assessed by the BLE before initial treatment and 
at Week 8 after initial treatment or touch -up.  Only data from the first 8 -week phase will be taken 
into account.  The No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be pooled for the primary 
endpoint.  
The effectiveness of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  will be demonstrated if:  
• The responder rate for su bjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is statistically 
superior to the responder rate for the No-Treatment  control, and ; 
• The responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is ≥70%, and;  
• The difference between the responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity  and the No -Treatment group  must be ≥50 points.  
Secondary 
Endpoints  For the Secondary Endpoints, like for the Primary Endpoint, only data from the first 8-week phase  
will be taken into account, and will compare TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity to No-Treatment  (the 
No-Treatment control group after treatment will not be pooled):  
• FACE -Q at Week 4 and Week 8  after last treatment  
• Proportion of subjects with a Global Aesthetic “improved” or “much improved”, as assessed 
by subject  at Week 8 after last treatment, using the GAI scale.  
• Proportion of subjects with a Global Aesthetic “impro ved” or “much improved”, as assessed 
by BLE at Week 8 after last treatment, using the GAI scale.  
• Proportion of subjects “satisfied” or “very satisfied” at Week 8 after initial treatment or 
touch -up, using the Subject Satisfaction Scale.  
Sample Size  The estimated responder rate for subjects treated for perioral rhytids is set at 70%. First level risk 
error alpha will be set to 2.5%. 
In order to have the study able to detect any AE that has an incident rate of 2.5% or more  in the 
sub-population of subj ects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI , at least 160 subjects should be enrolled 
and treated with the investigational  device in the two pooled arms.  With an anticipated 20% drop -
out rate throughout the entire study , a minimum total sample of 200 subjects (160 / 0.8 = 200), 
who will each receive TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  are required in order to detect a sufficient AE 
rate. 
Using an unbalanced 3:1 ratio, a sample size of a minimum of 150 subjects in the treatment group, 
and a minimum of 5 0 subjects in the control group, assuming a 20% drop -out rate throughout the 
entire study , will provide a >99.9% power for a 1 -sided 2 -group Fisher’s exact test at the 2.5% 
significance level to demonstrate statistical superiority of the treatment group ove r the control 
group, assuming a rate of responders in the treatment group of 70% and a rate of responders in the 
No-Treatment control group of 20%.  
Statistical 
Methods  Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint will be analyzed in a superiority statistical mo del using 
the PR -SRS as rated by the BLE. A responder is defined as a subject with  a ≥1-grade improvement 
on the PR -SRS as assessed by the BLE  at Week 8 after initial or touch -up compared with the pre -
treatment assessment (baseline)  by the BLE . Only data from the first 8 -week phase will be taken 
into account (the No -Treatment control group after treatment will not be pooled for the primary 
endpoint).  
The efficacy analysis will be based on a co -primary end -point:

v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                         Page 8 of 72 • The rate of responders treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity will be compared to the rate 
of responders in the No -Treatment group, using an independent -testing based on a 2 -group, 1 -
sided, Fisher’s exact statistic. For achieving superiority, the observed p -value must be ≤ 0.05;  
• At least 70% of the subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  must be responders ; 
• The difference between the responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity and the No -Treatment group must be ≥50 points . 
 
A two -sided 9 5.0% Confidence Interval will be calculated for the estimated responder rates.  
Analysis will be performed on the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population.  
Secondary Endpoints :  For the Secondary Endpoints, like for the Primary Endpoint, only data 
from the first 8 -week phase will be taken into account and will compare treatment to No -Treatment 
(the No -Treatment control group after treatment will not be pooled for the secondary endpoint) : 
Secondary effectiveness analysis will be performed only if the primary endpoint a nalysis is 
significant. Each test will be performed at the same significance level ( ) of 0.0 25, using one -sided 
tests. For achieving superiority of the treatment group over the group without treatment, each of 
the observed p -value must be ≤ 0.0 25.  
For categorical variables, the two groups will be compared using an independent -testing based on 
a 2-group, 1 -sided, Fisher’s exact statistic.  For continuous variables, the two groups will be 
compared using an independent Student t -test. 
Safety Analysis:  Safety population will be used to summarize the safety of TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity and will consist of all treated subjects. The primary safety analysis is the calculation of 
incidence of CTRs and adverse events in the study period.  Point estimates for all  CTRs, AEs and 
SAEs will be presented and two -sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the 
overall incidence of AEs and SAEs. Tables will be generated which summarize AEs by 
investigator assessments of both relationship to treatment and severity.  
The safety data of the two groups will be pooled, which will increase the power to observe AEs 
after treatment with the investigational device, and a separate analysis will be provided to compare 
the safety profile between the investigational gro up and the No -Treatment control group with 
delayed treatment once they have been treated.  
The study will be able to detect any AE that has an incident rate of <1.0% (0.625%) or more 
(assuming 160 subjects will be treated with the investigational device in the two pooled arms , and 
taking account of an anticipated 20% drop -out rate ). 
When performing the analysis for the sub -group of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI ( 40 
subjects, or 2 5% of subjects who received treatment ), the study will have the power to detect an 
AE with an incident rate of 2. 5% or more . 
Safety results after repeat treatment (4 week follow up period) will also be compared between the 
initial treatment group and the No -Treatment control group, then if approp riate, the repeat 
treatment CTR, AE and SAE data will be pooled.

1.1 Background  
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a long -chain, repeated dimer, N -acetyl glucosamine and D -glucuronic 
acid polymer and is a major component of the extracellular matrix. HA is widely present in all 
animal species and does not differ from one species to another. Due to this extended compatibility, 
HA can be used in humans without unacceptable adverse effects.  Due to its natural viscoelastic 
and hydrogel properties, HA is widely used as matrix in tissue regeneration and particularly in 
dermal defect reconstruction.  
It was demonstrated that by chemically crosslinking the molecule, HA becomes resistant to 
degradation  and its persistence in tissues is increased.1,2 This does not affect the carboxylic and N-
acetyl functions of the molecule and allows modification of the rheological and physical properties 
of HA while maintaining the biocompatibility of the basic polymer .3 
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  dermal filler  is a device containing colorless, biodegradable, sterile, 
biocompatible,  crosslinked HA of non -animal origin (i.e., bacterial fermentation using 
Streptococcus zooepidemicus ). Crosslinking is performed using 1,4 -butanediol diglycidyl ether 
(BDDE) to form a gel. This RHA device contains 0.3% w/w of lidocaine hydrochloride, a dru g 
substance widely used in dermatology for its anesthetic properties (i.e., it blocks the origin and 
transmission of nervous influx at the point of injection by stabilizing the neuronal membrane).  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity is indicated for injection in the d ermis  and superficial  dermis of the 
face to correct moderate to severe perioral rhytids . 
Table 3.  Characteristics of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  
 RHA Redensity  
Molecular weight of crosslinked HA  4 MDa  
Total HA concentration  15 mg/g  
Concentration of lidocaine hydrochloride by mass  0.3%  
Syringe volume  1mL volume per syringe  
Gauge needle for injection  30G ½ inch needle  
1.2 Rationale for Study  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is an investigational device that has not yet been approved by the 
FDA. In the current study, th is device  is being compared to  a No-Treatment  control  in a superiority 
pivotal study designed t o support a PMA applicat ion (FDA) for TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity . 
1.3 Hypothesis  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity will be superior to No-Treatment  control for the correction of 
moderate to severe perioral rhytids as determined by the PR -SRS at 8 weeks after initial or touch -
up treatment . An improvement  in the PR -SRS of ≥1 -grade from pre -treatment will be considered 
clinically meaningful .

The study objectives are to establish the safety and effectiveness of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity 
in the treatment of moderate to severe perioral rhytids : 
1. To demonstrate the superiori ty of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  versus the No-Treatment 
control at 8 weeks for the correction of moderate to severe  perioral rhytids.  Assessment 
of superiority will be based on the Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale (PR -SRS) as 
rated by the Blinded Live Evaluator (BL E) at each investigative site.  
 
2. To evaluate the safety of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity for the treatment o f moderate to 
severe perioral rhytids. Safety will be determined by the rates of Adverse Events (AEs) 
associated with the use of the study device. Subjects will be observed for up to 
approximately 52 weeks following initial treatment or touch -up treatment with the study 
device. Safety will also be evaluated for 4 weeks following any retreatment.

v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 19 of 72 3 COMPLIANCE STATEMENT  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Declaration of Helsinki, United 
States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) applicable to clinical studies (45 CFR Part 46, 21 
CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, and 21 CFR Part 312 ). In addition, the study will be conducted in 
compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements relevant to the use of new medical 
devices  in the United States  and in Canada . 
The sites’ Principal Investigator  (also referred to as the  Treatin g Investigator [TI] , both terms are 
used interchangeably) is responsible for ensuring the privacy, safety and welfare of the subjects 
during and after the study, and must ensure that personnel trained in its proper use are immediately 
available in case of a medical emergency. The Investigator s (BLE and TI) must be familiar with 
the background and requirements of the study and with the properties of the study device as 
described in the Investigator ’s Brochure and  package inserts.   The Principal Investigator at each 
site has the overall responsibility for the conduct  and administration of the study at their site, and 
for contact with study site management, and local authorities.  The ethica CRO Inc . will facilitate 
and manage all interactions between the site and the IRB.   
3.1 Variations to the Protocol  
No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior approval 
of the FDA , Health Canada, and the IRB except  1) when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards 
to the subjects o r when the change involves only logistics or administration , or 2) minor 
administrative or typographical corrections.  The sites’ Principal Investigator s and the Sponsor 
must sign any protocol amendments.  
3.2 Investigational Sites  
Up to ten  (10) U.S. and Canadian  investigational sites will participate in this study. Each site will 
obtain written approval from a Central  IRB prior to recruitment and enrollment of any subject into 
the study. Any changes to the study procedures must be made with the mutual agr eement of the 
Principal Investigator and the Sponsor, documented in an amendment to protocol, and approved 
by the reviewing IRB.  
Each site will have at least one TI who will be responsible for administering all study treatments,  
assess ing safety, and cond ucting live assessments of eff icacy secondary endpoints, a nd a single 
BLE  who will conduct live PR-SRS, GAI and Glogau assessments  at select ed visits . TIs will be 
specialists in the fields of cosmetic dermatology or plastic surgery and will have extensive 
experience with dermal fillers. The TI will function as the site’ s Principal Investigator.  
Additionally, each site will have a study coordinator.  
3.3 Training and certification on the Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale  (PR-SRS)  
The study will use a validated 4-grade photonumeric scale  measuring the  appearance of perioral 
rhytids. All assessors (BLEs , TIs, and IPRs ) will be certified on the use of th e PR-SRS.  
Specifically, a ll assessors will be trained on the scale then tested  using a photo  booklet with a 
broad range of perioral rhytid s severity. An assessor (BLEs, TIs, and IPRs) will be considered 
certified once his /her percentage of agreement with the true values is ≥80%.

v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 20 of 72 There will be a single BLE for each site; however, an additional BLE(s) may be certified at a given 
site to ensu re continuity of subject follow -up in cases of sickness or unavoidable absence.  
3.4 Independent Panel Review (Photographs)  
Three independent experts, that are not Investigators in the clinical study, will be selected and 
trained to conduct PR -SRS assessments on photographs. Prior to conducting the Independent Panel 
Review (IPR), each memb er of the panel will be certified  regarding the conduct of PR -SRS 
assessments  as described in Section 3.3.  
3.5 Medical Monitor  
A Medical Monitor will provide safety oversight for this clinical study. The Medical Monitor, in  
consultation with the Sponsor’s team , will review and evaluate AEs/SAEs/UADEs  monthly , 
review safety reports, and will provide consultation and recommendations  with regard to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomitant medications/treatments,  and subject discontinuations.  
The Medical Monitor will follow the Safety Management Plan and report the trends of AEs, and 
address specifically SAE, UADE with the Sponsor.  
3.6 Photography  
Set-up of photographic equipment, as well as training and quality control processes, will be 
provided and will be managed by a dedicated professional third party (i.e., Canfield Scientific 
Inc.).

4.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, blinded, No-Treatment  control, multicenter, prospective clinical study, to 
identify whether TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity is more effective than No-Treatment  in the 
correction of moderate to severe perioral rhytids  at Week 8 after initial or touch -up treatment . 
The Treating Investigator  (TI) will evaluate subjects for eligibility of the subject for the study. 
The Blinded Live Evaluator  (BLE) at screening will evaluate the subject’s perioral rhytids  
severity using the Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale (PR -SRS) in order to confirm eligibility 
and to establish a pre-treatment  score. This will be done independently of the T I, and exact 
concordance between the BLE and the T I is not necessary.  
Enrolle d subjects will be randomized to either the TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity treatment group 
or the “No-Treatment ” control group. The TI will administer study device, and if necessary, 
subjects will receive a touch -up treatment 14 days following the initial treatmen t to optimize the 
results. The T I will conduct safety and effectiveness evaluations at study subject visits, which will 
occur at Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 52 after initial or touch -up treatment , and 4 weeks after a 
repeat treatment.  
The BLE  will conduct assessments of efficacy during the trial, including assessment of the primary 
endpoint  at Week 8  after initial or touch up  treatment . The BLE will conduct effectiveness 
evaluations at Week 8, 12, 16 , 24, 36,  and 52 after initial or touch -up treatment . 
Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks from initial or touch up  treatment , at which point they will 
be offered a repeat treatment  (provided that  the TI deems the treatment to be appropriate, and if 
the subject agrees) . The subject will then be followed for an additional 4 weeks after the treatment 
before exiting the study.  
Should a subject return to his/her pre -treatment PR-SRS level before Week 52, as assessed by the 
TI, he/she will be eligible to receive an early repeat treatment (provided that the TI deems the 
treatment to be appropriate, and if the subject agrees) at Week 12, or Week 16, or Week 24, or 
Week 36 after initial or touch -up treatment . . 
Subjects randomized to the “ No-Treatment ” control group will receive their first treatment after 
the primary endpoint evaluation  (8 weeks after randomization ) and will then follow the same 
schedule as the initial treatment group.  
4.2 Study Design Rationale  
4.2.1 Study Population  
At least 200 subjects will be enrolled  and randomized .  At least  150 subjects will receive treatment 
with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity , and at least 50 subjects will be enrolled as No-Treatment  
controls.  
The study population includes female and male subjects that are 22 years old.    
The study will ensure that subjects meeting the inclusion criteria will be representative  of the U.S. 
population that may use TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity.  Specifically, enrolment will be comprised 
of at least 25% subjects of Fitzpatrick skin IV to VI. The randomization algorithm will ensure an

• ≥25% of subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Type IV to VI  
- ≥18% of subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Type IV (i.e., ≥36 subjects);  
- ≥7% of subjects with Fitzpatrick Skin Type V  or VI (i.e., ≥14 subjects ). 
A full descr iption of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Section  5. 
4.2.2 Primary Effectiveness Outcome Measure ment  
The primary endpoint will be a co -primary endpoint. A responder will be defined as a subject who 
has a ≥1-grade improvement on the PR -SRS as assessed by the BLE before initial treatment 
(baseline) and at Week 8 after initial or touch -up treatment .  The effectiveness of TEOSYAL® 
RHA Redensity  will be demonstrated if:  
• The responder rate for subjects treated wi th TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is statistically 
superior to the responder rate for the No-Treatment  control, and ; 
• The responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is ≥70%, and;  
• The difference between the responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity and the No -Treatment group must be ≥50 points .

All subjects who have signed an ICF will receive a 4-digit subject number, starting at 0001. Subject 
numbers will be assigned in ascending order and will be coupled with the site identification number 
for unique identification of each subject . The subject number will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the study. Subjects withdrawn from the study will retain their subject number; new 
subjects will be allocated a new subject number.  
Upon qualifying for treatment, subjects will be randomi zed to a study group utilizing a 
randomization algorithm embedded into the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
Subjects will be randomized ( 3:1 ratio) to one of the following group s: 
• TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity ; 
• No-Treatment  (untreated control).  
The TI will secure the treatment allocation and any other record of study treatment from potential 
discovery by the BLE . Any instance where the blind is opened to the BLE will be documented in 
writing.  
Subjects will be considered “enr olled” at the time of consent, and will be considered “enrolled and 
randomized” at the time of randomization.  The required sample size is based on “enrolled and 
randomized” subjects.  If an enrolled subject withdraws from the study prior to being randomiz ed, 
he/she may be replaced.

7.1 Study Devices  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity : A sterile, biodegradable, biocompatible, viscoelastic, clear, 
colorless, homogenized gel implant. It consists of cross -linked hyaluronic acid produced by 
fermentation of Streptococcus zooepidemicus , formulated to a concentration of 15  mg/g and 0.3% 
w/w lidocaine in a physiologic buffer. It is supplied in individual treatment syringes with 30G ½ 
inch disposable sterile needles.  
For additional information regarding study device, please refer to TEO -RHA -1501  Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
7.2 Injection o f Study Devices  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity will be administrated into the dermis, including the superficial 
dermis.  The injection technique (e.g., linear threading, cross hatching, fan like administration, 
multiple puncture, etc.), injection direction (e.g., retro -grade, or ante -grade), and how the wrinkle 
was injected (e.g., following the wrinkle, right angle to the wr inkle, etc.), will be at the discretion 
of the TI, and will be documented and recorded .  
Devices will be injected using the  needle that is provided within the standard packaging of the 
device; the TI is not permitted to use a needle of different gauge or l ength.  
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity contain s lidocaine.  Treating Investigators may select the additional 
pre-procedure aesthesia to be used  for pain or discomfort (e.g., EMLA), and its use must be 
recorded in the eCRF, if any. Any topical anesthesia should be on label, and no compounding 
formulation will be used. Post -procedure  ice packs shall be applied to the treatment area as per the 
Inves tigator’s standard of care. Use of ice will be recorded as a concomitant treatment on the 
Concomitant Treatment eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the lip will be defined as the structures within the vermilion border. 
The focus of this study is to treat  moderate to severe perioral  lines, and there will be no 
augmentation of the lips.   TI may inject at the level of the vermilion border when they feel it is 
required to achieve a satisfactory result of the treatment of the perioral rhytids.  
7.2.1 Initial Treatment (Visit 1)  
Each  subject randomized to treatment will receive injections of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity .  
Subject s randomized to the No-Treatment  control  arm of the study will not receive any injection . 
Subjects randomized to the “No-Treatment” control group will receive their first treatment after 
the primary endpoint evaluation (i.e., Visit 4; 8 weeks after randomization) and will then follow 
the same schedule as the initial treatment group.  
7.2.2 Touch -up Treatment (Visit 2; Week 2)  
If deemed necessary by the TI, additional touch -up correction with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  
will be performed after 2 weeks.

on Visit 1 (i.e., from the last study treatment) . If a touch -up injection is administered, the 
scheduling of subsequent study visits will be based on Visit 2.  
7.2.3 Optional Early Retreatment (Visit 5, 6, 7 or 8; Week s 12, 16, 24 or 36)  
In order to reduce subject dissatisfaction, optional * early retreatment will be offered at Visit 5 
(Week 12) or Visit 6 (Week 16) or Visit 7 (Week 24) or Visit 8 (Week 36) in case of significant 
loss of correction as per the following criteria:  
• Correction of perioral rhytids has returned to pre -treatment le vels. 
Any o ptional retreatment will be performed with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  to achieve optimal 
correction.  
Subjects who receive optional early retreatment at Visit 5 may not receive additional early optional 
retreatment at Visit 6, Visit 7, or Visit 8 . 
Subjects who receive optional early retreatment at Visit 6 may not receive additional early optional 
retreatment at Visit 7, or Visit 8.  
Subjects who receive optional early retreatment at Visit 7 may no t receive additional early optional 
retreatment at Visit 8.  
Subjects that receive optional early retreatment at either Visit 5 or Visit 6 or Visit 7 or Visit 8 are 
eligible to receive retreatment at Visit 9.  
Subjects who receive optional retreatment at Visit 5 or Visit 6 or Visit 7 or Visit 8 will be followed 
up by telephone at 3 days  after retreatment , complete a 14 -day patient CTR diary and will return 
for safety evaluations 4 weeks after optional early retreatment ( Visit 5x = Visit 6 or Visit 6 x, Visit 
7x or Visit 8 x). 
* “Optional early retreatment” ≠ “retreatment”.  “Optional early retreatment” is reserved for subjects dissatisfied by loss of effect 
and at high risk of study d/c prior to attaining 1 -year (52 weeks) post -treatment safety follow -up.  “Retreatment” is provided to all 
subjects at Visit 9/Week 52 to encourage subject part icipation  and to evaluate the safety of retreatment.  All subjects who will have 
received optional early retreatment will continue with all following visits, up and included Visit 9/Week 52. . 
7.2.4 Retreatment (Visit 9; Week 52)  
Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks from initial or touch up  treatment ), at which point they will 
be offered  a repeat treatment , provided that the TI deems the treatment to be appropriate, and the 
subject agrees. The subject will then be followed for an additional 4 weeks before exitin g the study.  
7.2.5 Treatment Volume Allowance  
The maximum volume per administration of the study device into the perioral rhytids (upper and 
lower) is 6.0 mL per treatment session (max 3.0 mL for upper, and max 3.0 mL for lower).

7.3.1 Relabeling  
Real-time aging testing is in progress for TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity . As new test data will 
become available throughout the course of the study, the shelf life of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  
may be extended through the course of the study.  The site monitor will be responsible for 
relabeling the  Tyvek lid  with the new e xpiry date.  The site monitor will follow a specific procedure 
to perform and verify the product relabeling with the extended expiry date  (to be provided in a 
separate guidanc e document) . The relabeling process will be documented.  TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity  may also be returned to the Sponsor to be relabeled . When TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  
has reached the expiry date as indicated on its label, the PI should segregate them and follow the 
instructions from the site monitor as to awaiting for relabeling b y the site monitor or returning the 
devices to the Sponsor.   
It is the responsibility of the TI to verify that a device is within its expiry date before being used.  
The initial shelf life of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  will be approximately 6 months . However, 
as devices being subjected to real time aging are being tested periodically, the shelf -life could  be 
extended . 
7.4 Study Device Supply and Accountability

hammam, etc.) during the week following treatment.  Wax or chemical hair removal around the 
lips is prohibited for 7 days before treatment and 14 days after treatment.  
All treatment/procedures received by the subject within 30 days prior to the baseline visit and 
throughout the treatment period, including the name of the treatment/ procedure, must be recorded 
in the eCRF with end dates, if applicable. Use of prohibited tr eatment/procedures must be recorded 
in the eCRF up to the extent of the prohibited time period indicated above.  Furthermore, previous 
use of facial aesthetic treatment/procedures must be recorded for up to 1 year prior to the baseline 
visit.  
In the event s uch prohibited therapies are administered during the study period, the Medical 
Monitor  will be contacted to discuss the details of the event. Subject participation will not 
automatically be discontinued. At a minimum, the event will be documented by the si te staff as a 
protocol deviation, as instructed by the Medical Monitor . Depending upon the nature of the 
prohibited therapy and the timing relative to the determination of the primary endpoint, the 
Medical Monitor  may make a decision to discontinue the sub ject. 
The decision to administer a prohibited medication/treatment is done with the safety of the study 
participant as the primary consideration. If the permissibility of a specific medication/treatment is

8.1 Electronic Case Report Form  
Treatment and follow -up of subjects will be recorded in a 21 CFR part 11 compliant eCRF.  Data 
will be first recorded in to the medical record and  study specific source document worksheets prior 
to entry into the eCRF.  
A paper CRF will be used to capture additional demographics and social history.  
Two sets of worksheets will be used to capture study specific information (i.e., efficacy 
assessments, injection volumes, injection technique, etc.); one set for the BLE  and study 
coordinator, and one set for the TI and study coordinator. This will allow the BLE  and TI to remain 
blinded to each other’s  assessments.  The study coordinator will refer to these worksheets in 
conjunction with the medical record in order to complete data entry into the eCRF.  Study 
Investigator s will not disclose their opinion regarding treatment outcomes  with subjects in order 
to, 1) prevent subjects from sharing such opinions  between the TI and the BLE , and 2) avoid 
biasing subject  reported outcomes . 
In order to review and electronically sign the eCRF, the BLE and T I will have i ndividual login  
passwords that will al low them to view only the data that they have  generated.  The BLE  and TI 
must ensure that they electronically sign for completed eCRF s on a timely basis.  
8.2 Subject Diary and Questionnaires  
Subjects will complete paper -based subject 14-day diaries and questionnaires. Data recorded in 
these documents will be entered into the eCRF by the study coordinator.  
8.3 Photography  
Calibrated photographs will be taken at each in -clinic study visit (and if applicable, before and 
after study treatment), according to a standardized protocol incorporating appropriate quality 
control processes  (i.e., Canfield Scientific Inc.) .

9.1 Informed Consent  
The Principal Investigator (or designate) will expl ain the benefits and risks of participation in the 
study to each subject and will obtain written informed consent. Written informed consent must be 
obtained prior to the subject entering the study (before initiation of any study related procedure 
and injec tion of study devices).  
(*) To ensure the unbiased assessment, the perioral  rhytids severity  rating  scale  (PRS -RS) assessment  will be performed 
first at all visits that require PRS -RS evaluations.  Once this evaluation is complete, then the forms will be removed 
and the materials will be brought in for the investigator to perform the dynamic evaluations such as the GAI 
assessmen t.

9.5 Efficacy  
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Variable  
The primary efficacy variable will be assessed at rest  by the BLE at Visit 4 (Week 8 after initial 
or touch -up treatment ) using the validated 4 -grade PR -SRS photo -numeric scale and text as 
detailed in Table 4 below:  
Table 4.  Perioral Rhytids Severity Rating Scale (PR -SRS) 
Category  Grade  Description  
Absent  0 No lines  
Mild  1 Shallow lines  
Moderate  2 Deeper lines  
Severe  3 Deepest lines  
To qualify for the study, a subject must have PR -SRS grades of 2 or 3 (at rest by the BLE  and the 
TI). Half -point grades will not be accepted.  
9.5.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables

treatment ), as well as assessed by the TI at all study visits, will serve as secondary and exploratory 
efficacy variables.  
9.5.2.2  Modified Glogau Classification Scale  
The seve rity of wrinkling will be assessed by the BLE and TI using the Modified Glogau 
Classification scale as detailed in Table 5 below:  
Table 5.  Modified Glogau Classification Scale  
Group  Classification  Description  
I Mild  No Wrinkles while the subject is at rest or while moving  
II Moderate  Wrinkles only in motion, visible when the person is talking, laugh ing, frowning, and so on  
III Advanced  Wrinkles at rest; you see the wrinkles when the person is not moving  
IV Severe  Wrinkles as predominant characteristic; you see only wrinkles  
 
9.5.2.3  Global Aesthetic Improvement  
GAI will be assessed by the TI, BLE and the subject using the Visit 1 pre -injection photograph 
and the subjective 5 -grade scale as detailed in Table 6 below. Subjects will be instructed: 
“Compare the baseline photograph of your lips to the current photograph of your lips and rate the 
degree of aesthetic improvement by using the following scale”. The TI and BLE will complete the 
assessment using the same pre -injection photograph.  
Table 6.  Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale  
Grade  Description  
1 Much improved  
2 Improved  
3 No change  
4 Worse  
5 Much worse  
 
9.5.2.4  FACE -Q 
Subjects will complete the Perioral Rhytids domain of the validated FACE -Q scale . The subject 
will be instructed as follows: “These questions ask about how you look right now. For each 
question, circle only one answer. With the area around your lips in mind, in the past week, how 
much have you been bothered by :”, and will provide resp onse as per Table 7 below:

9.5.2.7  Treatment Volume  
The number of treatment sessions and total volume to obtain OCR  will be collected for 
TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity . Treatment volume will be measured to an accuracy of 0.1 mL.  
9.6 Safety  
Safety will be evaluated through a 14 -day patient Common Treatment Response ( CTR ) diary 
capturing post -injection signs/symptoms  following study injections (including touch -up treatments  
and retreatments ), and AE assessments at each visit.  
9.6.1 14-Day Patient Common Treatment Response Diary  
The subject will receive a diary booklet and instructions for recording his/her observations of the 
Common Treatment Responses (CTRs) of the study treatments for the first 14 days after each 
treatment (initial, touch -up, retreatment (s)). The diary will be dispensed 30 minutes after each 
treatment and will be discussed during each telephone follow -up visit . Subjects should complete 
the diary at approximately the same time each day  (i.e., AM or PM ). 
The s ubject diary will capture the following CTRs  that typically occur following the injection of a 
dermal filler ; specifically, redness, pain, tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps /bumps, bruising,

the presence and the severity  of each observed sign/symptom as: none, mild, moderate, or s evere . 
The 14 -day patient CTR will capture the daily occurrence of each CTR.  The 14 -day patient CTR 
diary will in clude a detailed glossary describing all signs/symptoms listed in the diary.  
9.6.2 72-Hour Telephone Follow -up 
The subject will be contacted by telephone by the investigational site approximately 72 hours 
following study injections and will be queried regarding health status and AEs. Information 
gathered will be documented in the progress notes and upon confirmation at the next clinic visit, 
data will be entered into the eCRF.  The investigational s ite should attempt at least twice to contact 
the subject. All failed attempts will also be documented in the study notes.  
9.6.3 Assessment of Injection Site Pain  
Pain at the injection sites will be self -assessed by the subject using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS).  
The VAS is a straight, 100 mm long line with the left end representing “no pain” and the right end 
representing “worst pain”. Subjects will be asked to mark the location on the line that represented 
their level of pain. The distance along the line from th e no pain end to the marked location will be 
measured and expressed in units of mm.  
Injection site pain is typical following the administration of a dermal filler. The occurrence of 
injection site pain is not to be considered an AE unless it is in excess t o that typically observed 
following injection of a dermal filler, as determined by the TI . 
9.6.4 Lip Functionality  
Lip functionality testing will be conducted by the TI at each follow -up visit  and pre and post 
injection at each injection . The lip functionality t esting will include the following Yes/No 
evaluations:  
• Lip function: Ability to suck liquid through a straw . TI will be asked to capture Yes or No 
with the following question : “Can the subject drink/suck through a straw effectively? ” 
• Lip Sensation: Ability to feel the change  in the lip sensation to touch, using the two 
following tests:  
1) the monofilament test (i.e., a subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a 0.4G 
monofilament at three points on the upper lip and three points on the lower lip) and  
2) the cotton wisp test (i.e., a subject’s ability to feel the sensation of a cotton w isp at three 
points on the upper lip and three points on the lower lip).  
The 6 different points will be randomly tested for each of the two tests.  Subjects will wear 
a blindfold and will be asked to acknowledge sensation at each of the points  by answering 
Yes or No.  
• Lip Movement: Ability to pronounce specific letters and words . TI will be asked to capture

9.6.5 Pregnancy  
A female of childbearing potential must present a negative UPT prior to any injection (initial, 
touch -up, retreatment) of the study device.  
Subjects who are pregnant are excluded from the study. Female subjects of childbearing potential 
are expected to pr event pregnancy occurring whilst on treatment by using effective birth control 
methods (e.g., oral contraceptive, condom, IUD, injectable contraceptive, or diaphragm). Male 
subjects have no contraceptive restrictions.  
9.6.6 Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to 
the study device (s) will be recorded in the eCRF . Subjects  will be questioned for the occurrence 
of any new or worsening signs or symptoms at each visit by the following methods:  
• Information volunteered by the subject  
• Open ended and non -leading questions such as: Have you had any health problems since 
your last visit?  
• Observation by the investigational team, other care providers or relatives  
9.6.6.1  Adverse Event Rep orting  
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be monitored and reported through the AE eCRF .  
If an AE occurs, the first concern will be the safety of the study participants . All Device Related 
AEs occurring after study device administration will be followed until the event has resolved or 
stabilized or until follow -up is no longer possible.  
If a Device Related AE(s) is ongoing at the final study visit, the  TI will determine which action 
should be taken and should schedule a cli nic visit  (if appropriate; i.e., if the event is clinically 
significant)  within 4 weeks to verify that the AE has resolved.  
9.6.6.2  Definition  of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered the study device and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
TEOXANE SA                        Protocol TEO -RHA -1501  
CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 48 of 72 with th e device . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  or unintended sign (for example an 
abnormal laboratory finding), a symptom or disease temporally associated with the use the study 
device, whether or not considered related to that device . 
AEs may include, but are not limited to, subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered 
by the subject, solicited via the diary and subject interviews, uncovered by review of concomitant 
medications or therapies, and/or observed by the study site staff . The TI will determine the 
description (sign, symptom, or diagnosis), onset, resolution, seriousness, severity, cause and action 
taken for any event .   
CTRs will not be considered Adverse Events unless the duration and/or severity are in excess of 
that ty pically observed following injection of a dermal filler and  are clinically significant as 
determined by the TI.   CTRs that persist longer than 14 days will be recorded as AEs (Device 
Related AE) and followed to resolution.  CTRs will be reviewed by TI to ensure that CTRs are 
elevated to the status of an AE as appropriate.  The severity of each AE that is the result of a CTR 
persisting beyond 14 days will be determined by the TI. The subject assessment of CTR severity 
will NOT  be used to determine AE severity.    
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study injections are not considered AEs. 
Recurring symptoms associated with pre -existing conditions are not considered AEs unless they 
have a clinically significant i ncrease in severity and/or frequency.  
Clinically significant a bnormal clinical laboratory tests (if applicable) must be recorded as an AE.  
Changes resulting from normal growth and/or development occurring at a physiologically 
appropriate time that do not v ary significantly from the frequency or severity expected, for 
example the onset of menses or menopause, are not to be considered AEs. 
9.6.6.3  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Unexpected Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
A SAE  is defined as any unfavorable medical o ccurrence that meets any of the following:  
1. Results in death . 
2. Is life -threatening:  “L ife-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe . 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization:  Planned and 
routine hospital admissions for pre -existing conditions are not considered SAEs and do not 
require reporting as an AE unless t he condition has worsened beyond what would reasonably 
be expected for that subject. If a subject experience s an addition al AE that prolongs a pre -
planned hospitalization this is considered to be an SAE and should be reported as an SAE. 
Pre-planned admissi ons must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
5. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
6. Is an important medical event:  Important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require

serious.  
A UADE  is defined as any device -related AE that meets any of the following:  
1. Is not identified in nature, severity or frequency in current literature on the product . 
2. Is life threatening, even if temporary in nature . 
3. Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
4. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure . 
5. Any device malfunction that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
if the malfunction were to recur.  
9.6.6.4  Causality Assessment  
The TI’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to the study device is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event will be reported. The TI will assign 
the causality assessment according to his/her clinical experience  and the subject’s description of 
the event . The Sponsor will be responsible for the final causality judgment.  The causal relationship 
should be classified according to the follo wing criteria (not all variables need to be present to be 
indicative of relationship to the device):  
Definitely related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE is more likely explained by the study device or procedure than by another cause . 
• The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the study device . 
Probably related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE is more likely e xplained by the study device or procedure than by another cause . 
Possibly related:  
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is reasonable . 
• The AE could have been due to another equally likely cause . 
Probably not related : 
• There is another more likely cause of the AE.  
Definitely not related : 
• The temporal sequence of AE onset relative to injection of study device is not reasonable . 
• There is another obvious cause of the AE . 
9.6.6.5  Severity Assessment  
For events reported on the AE eCRF, the TI will determine the severity classification based on 
his/her clinical experience and by using the following definitions of severity (n ote: a “severe” AE 
is not the same as a  SAE):

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 50 of 72 • Mild:  Symptoms are barely noticea ble or do not make the subject uncomfortable. The AE 
does not influence performance or functioning. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed 
for relief of symptom(s).  
• Moderate: Symptoms are of sufficient severity to make the subject uncomfortable. 
Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment of symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
• Severe:  Symptoms are of sufficient severity to cause the subject severe discomfort. 
Performance of daily activities is compromised. Treatment for symptom(s) with prescription 
drugs or therapies may be needed.  
The maximal severity for the AE will be recorded, even if the AE presented as being less severe 
at some point during the event.  
9.6.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
9.6.7.1  All Adverse Events  
All AEs, whether serious or not, will be re corded from the time of informed consent until the last 
study visit, or until 1 month following the last study treatment. The TI will assess all AEs and 
record details of seriousness, severity, dura tion, and action  taken with study device, and 
relationship to the study device. The Sponsor is responsible for reporting AEs to the relevant 
governing authorities in the time frame  applicable according to international and local law.  
9.6.7.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Unexpected Adverse Device Effects (UADEs)  
All SAEs and UADEs that occur after the time of informed consent through to 7 days after a 
subject’s completion of study participation, or within 1 month following the last study treatment, 
must b e reported to the ethica CRO Inc . within 24 hours of awareness. Initial reports must be made  
by contacting ethica CRO Inc . as per the following:  Contact the ethica CRO Inc . ethica C linical 
Project Manager  by telephone  and complete the SAE/UADE Form and sub mit by fax (514 -336-
1142). If outside of office hours, or if unable to contact the ethica CRO Inc . Clinical Project 
Manager , use the 24 -hour number (514.262.9398 ).  It is the  site’s responsibility to perform the 
following:  
• Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records, information, and medical judgments from 
colleagues who a ssisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject.  
• Provide ethica CRO Inc . with  a complete, written cas e history, including copies of 
supporting reports (e.g., progress notes, laboratory reports) and a statement as to whether the 
event was or was not related to the use of the study device.  
• With the assistance of ethica CRO Inc ., notify the governing IRB of the SAE or UADE in 
accordance with the requirements of SAE reporting stipulated by the governing IRB.  
Reporting Timelines  
• UADEs:  The site must report the UADE to ethica CRO Inc . within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event.  Within 24 hours of receiving the UADE report from the site , ethica CRO 
Inc. must report the UADE to the Sponsor.  As required by 21 CFR 812.46 (US) and 
Subsection 59(1) of the Med ical Device Regulations ( SOR /98-282) (Canada), the Sponsor

10 working days† of receiving the report from ethica CRO Inc . 
• SAEs:  The site must report the SAE to ethica CRO Inc . within 24 hours of becoming aware 
of the event.  Within 24 hours of receiving the SAE report from the site, ethica CRO Inc . 
should  report the SAE to the Sponsor .  The Medical Monitor will investigate the SAE. SAEs 
will be reported to the IRB as per the regulations of  the IRB . SAEs will be reported to FDA 
in study annual and final reports.  
† note: , Health Canada to be notified within 72 hours  after the qualified investigator becoming aware of the 
information  if the event  has led to the death or a serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user 
or other person, or could do so were it to recur. . 
 
Study Hold Due to UADEs  
• If the Medical Monitor  determines that an UADE(s) presents an unreasonable risk to 
subjects, the Sponsor shal l put on hold all investigation or parts of investigations presenting 
that risk as soon as possible. The study hold shall occur no later than 5 working days  after 
the Sp onsor makes this determination and not later than 15 working days after the Sponsor 
first received notice of the effect. The Sponsor will not resume a n on hold  investigation 
without IRB , Health Canada  and FDA approval.  
9.6.7.3  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not considered  an SAE or AE. The site will inform ethica CRO Inc . immediately of 
any case of pregnancy and collect information on any subject who becomes pregnant during the 
study using the Unexpected Problems Report Form     
Subjects who become pregnant will not receive further treatments with the study device(s), but 
will continue to be followed up for scheduled  efficacy  and safety assessments for the duration of 
the study . All pregnancies should be followed to term and the outcome reported to ethica CRO Inc  
to determine the outcome of pregnancy .

10.1 Completion  
A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all the 
assessments or has experienced an event that precludes further participation in the s tudy.  
10.2 Discontinuation of Treatment  
A subject will be  discontinued from further applications of the study devices if they become 
pregnant; however, they will continue all other assessments as per protocol.  
10.3 Withdrawal  
A subject will be  withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
- Loss to follow -up; 
- Withdrawal of consent;  
- The Principal Investigator believes that for safety reasons (e.g. , AE, concurrent illness) that 
it is in the best interests of the subject to be withdrawn  from study participation;  
- The subject’s attending physician requests that the subject be withdrawn from the study;  
- The Principal Investigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the study or stops the 
subject’s participation in the study.  
Should a subject decide to decline repeat treatment, this will not be considered as  a withdrawal, 
but the reason will be documented.  
Protocol deviations will not lead to automatic withdrawal unless they indicate a significant risk to 
the subject’s safety. All major protocol deviations must be discussed promptly with the Medical 
Monitor . 
A subject may be  withdrawn from the study, in consultation with the Medical Monitor , for any of 
the following reasons:  
- Lack of compliance to study procedures;  
- A significant protocol deviation or violation;  
- Poor visit attendance.  
Should a subject decide to withdraw after administration of a study device(s), or should the 
Principal Investigator decide to withdraw the subject , the Principal Investigator (or designate) will 
complete and report the observations up to the time of withdrawal.  
All subjects who are withdrawn from the study will be requested to come in to complete their next 
scheduled clinic  visit. The next scheduled  visit may be brought forward to facilitate this. A 
complete evaluation at the time of the subject ’s withdrawal should be made.  Additionally, subjects 
who withdraw from the study will be requested to allow continued safety monitoring , either via 
telephone  interviews  or clinic visits, whichever is more appropriate.  
The reason and date of withdrawal must be noted on the eCRF. If the reason for withdrawal is 
an AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will continue until resolution or until

11.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be a co -primary endpoint. A responder will be defi ned as a subject who 
has a ≥1-grade improvement on the PR -SRS as assessed by the BLE at Week 8 after initial or 
touch -up treatment , compared with the pre -treatment assessment (baseline) by the BLE .  Only data 
from the first 8 -week phase will be taken into account.  The No-Treatment  control group after 
treatment will not be pooled for the primary endpoint.  
The effectiveness of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  will be demonstrated if:  
• The responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is statistically 
superior to the responder rate for the No-Treatment  control, and ; 
• The responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  is ≥70%, and;  
• The difference between the responder rate for subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA 
Redensity and the No -Treatment group is ≥50 points.  
11.2 Secondary Endpoints  
For the Secondary Endpoints, like for the Primary Endpoint, only data from the first 8 week phase 
will be taken into account, and will compare TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity to No-Treatment  (the 
No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be pooled for the secondary endpoint s): 
• FACE -Q at Week 4 and Week 8  after initial or touch -up treatment . 
• Proportion of subjects with a Global Aesthetic “improved” or “much improved”, as 
assessed by subject  at Week 8 after initial or touch -up treatment , using the 5 -grade Global

treatment , using the 5 -point scale assessing subjects’ satisfaction with study treatment.  
11.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
For the following Exploratory Endpoints, like for the Primary Endpoint, only data from the first 8 
week phase will be taken into account and will compare TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity  to No-
Treatment  (the No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be pooled for the se exploratory 
endpoint s): 
• Proportion of subjects with ≥1-grade improvement from pre-treatment on the PR -SRS as

11.4 Analysis Populations  
Three subject analysis populations are defined: Per Protocol (PP) Population, Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
Population, and Safety (SAFT) Population. All analysis populations will be defined and 
determined prior to unblinding and database closure for the final ana lysis.   
11.4.1  Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT Population will consist of all subjects that were randomized. The ITT principle will be 
followed in that subjects will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized, 
whether or not they re ceived treatment. Furthermore, all subjects in the ITT Population will be 
included in the analysis, regardless if they have missing data at the time point of interest. The ITT 
Population will be the primary population used for efficacy analyses.  
11.4.2  Per Protoc ol (PP) Population  
The PP Population will consist of all study subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
who completed 8 weeks of post -treatment follow -up (i.e., up to Visit 4) with no major protocol 
violations/deviations that could affect effi cacy assessments. The decision whether a protocol 
violation/deviation is relevant for the exclusion of subjects from the PP Population will be made 
prior to breaking the study blind on a case -by-case basis in a data review meeting.   
11.4.3  Safety (SAFT) Populatio n 
The SAFT Population will consist of all study subjects that were randomized and received at least 
one treatment with the study device . 
11.5 Sample Size Considerations  
The estimated responder rate for subjects treated for moderate to severe perioral  rhytids is set at 
70%.  First level risk error alpha has been set to 2.5%. 
The study will ensure that enrolled subjects are representative of U.S. population ethnicity and wi ll 
be comprised of at least 25% subjec ts of Fitzpatrick skin IV to VI.  In order to be able to detect a 
sufficient AE rate  (i.e., maximum  2.5%  in the sub -population of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type 
IV to VI), the number of subjects must be increased be yond that required for achieving statistical 
power for the primary efficacy outcome; specifically:

𝑛×0.25↔𝑛=400
𝐴𝐸%↔𝑛=400
2.5=160

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 57 of 72  
Where:  
• AE% is the AE threshold detection in the subpopulation of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI  
• n is the number of subjects needed in the overall population to be included in the study (n 
x 0.25 is the number of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI)  
In order to have the study able to detect any AE that has an incident rate of 2.5% or more  in the 
sub-population of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI , at least 160 subjects should be enrolled 
and treated with the investigational device in the two pooled arms. With an anticipated 20% drop -
out rate throughout the entire study , a minimum total sample of 200 subjects (160 / 0.8 = 200), 
who will each receive TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity are required in order to detect a sufficient AE 
rate (i.e., 2.5% or more in the sub -population of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI, and 
<1.0% (0.625%) or  more in the overall population).  
Using an unbalanced 3:1 ratio, a sample size of a minimum of 150 subjects in the treatment group  
and a minimum of 50 subjects in the control group , assuming a 20% drop -out rate throughout the 
entire study , will provide a >99.9% power for a 1 -sided 2 -group Fisher’s exact test at the 2.5% 
significance level to demonstrate statistical superiority of the treatment group over the control 
group, assuming a rate of responders in the treatment group of 70% and a rat e of responders in the 
No-Treatment  control group of 20%.  
11.6 General Considerations  
Data will be listed by treatment group and subject number. The safety and efficacy data will be 
summarized by treatment allocation. Descriptive statistics will consist of valu es, tables, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables, and frequency and percent 
for discrete variables.  
A full description of the statistical methods planned for this study will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SA P). All programs for data output and analyses will be written in SAS version 9. 3 
or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  
Missing Values  
For subjects lost -to-follow -up (LTFU), or not present at a visit, missing  data will be imputed using 
last observation carried forward (LOCF)  for the primary endpoint (PR -SRS, ITT population) .  
Various statistical procedures to confirm the impact of missing data (e.g., Tipping Point Analysis) 
will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  No imputations will be performed for secondary 
endpoints; analyses will utilize  available data as observed . 
Discontinuation and Drop -Outs  
Dropouts will not be replaced. All available data from dropouts will be included in the ITT 
analysis.  Subject disposition will be summarizing the number of subjects enrolled in the study and 
those that discontinued the study and their reason.  
Interim Analysis  
There will be no interim efficacy analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL  
v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 58 of 72 Due to the potential impact on safety and effectiveness, the variation in data across baseline 
demographics will be accounted , and heterogeneity across the two countries ( US and Canada) will 
be investigated  to establish if the data for safety and effectiveness can be  combined.   
To assess the homogeneity of the baseline characteristics across the two countries, and to 
determine if data from both countries could be pooled,  statistical hypothesis tests will be performed 
with their null hypotheses as the absence of difference between US and Canada . All observed two -
sided p -value must be > 0.05 to pool data from the two countries.  If the two -sided p -value is less 
or equal to 0.05, then, data collected from subjects of both countries will not be pooled . Percentages 
of each characteristic of the demographics will be compared using a Fischer’s Exact test, and 
continuous data will be compared using a Student t test.  The full details will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
11.7 Efficacy Analysis  
Primar y Endpoint:  The primary endpoint will be analyzed in a superiority statistical model using 
the PR -SRS as rated by the BLE. A responder is defined as a subject with a ≥ 1-grade  improvement 
on the PR -SRS at 8 weeks after initial or touch -up treatment , as rated by the BLE , compared with 
the pre -treatment assessment (baseline)  by the BLE . Only data from the first 8 -week phase will be 
taken into account (the No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be pooled for the 
primary endpoint) .  The efficacy analysis will be based on a co -primary end -point:  
• The rate of responders treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity will be compared to the 
rate of responders in the No -Treatment group, using an independent -testing based on a 2 -
group, 1 -sided, Fis her’s exact statistic. For achieving superiority, the observed p -value 
must be ≤ 0.0 25; 
• At least 70% of the subjects treated with TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity must be responders ; 
• A difference of at least 50 points  in TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity and no-treatment  control 
group  responders must be  observed  to demonstrate  a clinically  significant  difference  in 
product  performance  
A two -sided 95.0% Confidence Interval will be calculated for the estimated responder rates.  
Analysis will be performed on the Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population.  
Secondary Endpoints :  For the Secondary Endpoints, like for the Primary Endpoint, only data 
from the first 8 we ek phase will be taken into account and will compare treatment to No-Treatment  
(the No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be pooled for the secondary endpoint) . 
Secondary effectiveness analysis will be performed only if the primary endpoint a nalysis is 
significant. Each test will be performed at the same significance level ( ) of 0.05, using one -sided 
tests. For achieving superiority of the treatment group over the group without treatment, each of 
the observed p -value must be ≤ 0.0 25.  
For cat egorical variables, the two groups will be compared using an independent -testing based on 
a 2-group, 1 -sided, Fisher’s exact statistic. For continuous variables, the two groups will be 
compared using an independent Student t -test. 
Exploratory Endpoints: Exploratory effectiveness analysis will be descriptive, and statistical test

v.1.2; 27 -Oct-2017                        Page 59 of 72 will be informative only.  
For the Exploratory Endpoints to be compared between the two groups , only data from the first 8 -
week phase will be taken into account (the No-Treatment  control group after treatment will not be 
pooled for the se exploratory endpoint s). For categorical variables, the two groups will be compared 
using an independent -testing based on a 2 -group, 1 -sided, Fisher’s exact statistic. For continuous 
variables, the two groups will be compared using an independent Student t -test. 
For the other exploratory Endpoints, unlike for the Primary and Secondary Endpoints, data from 
the TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity treatment group and from the No-Treatment  control group after 
treatment will be pooled (if deemed comparable). To determine if data from both groups could be 
pooled,  groups will be compared using a test of homogeneity at the significance level ( ) of 0.05. 
Each observed p -value must be >0.05 to pool data from the two groups for the considered variable. 
If a p -value is ≤0.05, it will indicate a learning curve, and data from the two groups will not be 
pooled and presented separately for the considered variable.  Methods will be detailed in t he 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
11.8 Safety Analysis  
The SAFT P opulation will be used to summarize the safety of TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity and 
will consist of all treated subjects. The primary safety analysis is the calculation of incidence of 
CTRs and adverse event s in the study period.  Point estimates for all CTRs, AEs and SAEs will be 
presented and two -sided exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the overall incidence 
of AEs and SAEs.  Tables will be generated which summarize AEs by investigator as sessments of 
both relationship to treatment and severity.  
The safety data of the two groups will be pooled, which will increase the power to observe AEs 
after treatment with the investigational device, and separate analysis will be provided to compare 
the safety profile between the investigational group and the No-Treatment  control group with 
delayed treatment once they have been treated.  
The study will be able to detect any AE that has an incident rate of <1.0% (0.625%) or more 
(assuming 200 subjects will be treated with the investigational device in the two pooled arms  and 
taking account of a 20% drop -out rate throughout the entire study ): 
𝐴𝐸%=100
𝑛×𝐷𝑂%↔𝐴𝐸%=100
200×0.8↔𝐴𝐸%=100
160=0.625%  
 
Where:  
• AE% is the AE threshold detection in the overall treated population  
• n is the number of subjects needed  to be included in the study  
• DO% is the drop -out rate throughout the entire study  
When performing the analysis for the sub -group of subjects of Fitzpatrick skin type IV to VI ( 40 
subjects, o r 25% of subjects who received treatment , taking account of a 20% drop -out rate 
throughout the entire study ), the study will have the power to detect an AE with an incident rate 
of 2.5%

initial treatment group and the No-Treatment  control group, then if appropriate, the repeat 
treatment CTR, AE and SAE data will be pooled.  
11.8.1  Adverse Events (A Es) 
Safety outcomes will be incidence rate of A Es, including UADEs, types of AEs and their 
relationship to study treatment. All safety data will be tabulated with descriptive group statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, number of valid cases).  Severity and relationship 
to study treatment w ill be assessed  and recorded.  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. 
These events, irrespective of relationship to study medication, will be summarized by MedDRA 
system organ class  (SOC)  and MedDRA pre ferred term  (PT). The number of subjects reporting an 
AE, the number of A Es, and percentages of subjects in each category will be summarized. A Es by 
severity and relationship to study will be summarized in a similar way. Serious A Es will be 
summarized sepa rately.  Specifically, t he following AE incidence tables will be provided:  
• All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• All and possibly * related A Es sorted by decreasing frequency  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related A Es sorted by seriousness criterion  
• SAEs: All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• UADEs: All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• Death: All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
• Discontinuation: All and possibly * related A Es sorted by SOC  
* definitely , probably, possibly  
AE incidence rates with exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each safety variable 
at each post -treatment; confidence intervals will be used to confirm whether distribution of 
subjects with events is homogeneous between the study arms.  
Statistical analysis will also be performed to evaluate the potential imp act of the injection 
technique on the safety data.

Sponsor. Should an amendment be necessary, the reviewing IRB , Health Canada  and FDA may 
require review and approval prior to its implementation.  
13.2 Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
13.2.1  Information to Study Personnel  
The Principal Investigator , with the assistance of ethica CRO Inc ., is responsible for ensuring that 
all study personnel are qualified for their designated roles and for provid ing information about the 
study to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of subject management, both 
before starting the practi cal performance of the study and during the course of the study (e.g. , when 
new staff become involved).  
The ethica CRO Inc . site monitor is responsible for initiating the site, for ensuring site compliance 
with the protocol and for closing out the site at the end of the study. Additional information 
available during the study should be given as agreed upon, either by the Principal Investigator or 
the site monitor, and always when new staff members become involved in the study.  
13.2.2  Study Monitoring  
Clinical monitors of ethica CRO Inc . will visit the study site periodically to ensure adherence to 
the protocol and applicable regulations, to ensure compliance with ICH -GCP, to ensure safety of 
the subjects, and to ensure  maintenance of adequate and accur ate clinical records.  
Monitoring functions will be performed in compliance with recognized GCP  and as per the study 
specific Monitoring Plan . The Principal Investigator agrees to allow the site monitors, and other 
authorized Sponsor personnel, access to the clinical supplies, the investigational agent dispensing 
and storage area, subject medical records, laboratory data, and other source documentation of the 
study subjects.  Approximately seven  on-site interim monitoring visits will be conducted at each 
site, and a dedicated close -out visit will also be conducted at each site.  
Source Document worksheets for all  subjects and eCRFs  will be reviewed in detail by the site 
monitor to ensure data integr ity.  If errors or omissions are found in the course of a data audit, or 
if clarification of data is required, the eCRFs and/or worksheets in question will be corrected by 
the study coordinator and confirmed /signed for by the BLE or TI, as appropriate . Data clarification 
or query forms may be generated for omissions or clarifications, to be completed and returned to 
the site monitor.  
The dates of monitoring visits will be recorded by the site monitor in a sig n-in log to be kept at the 
site. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the study coordinator and Principal 
Investigator will be available, the source documentation will be available, and a suitable 
environment will be provided for review of s tudy-related documents.  
The TI and assisting staff must agree to cooperate with the site monitor to resolve any problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning any data discrepancies detected in the course of

monitor on visits to the study site.  
13.2.3  Audit and Inspection  
According to ICH Guidelines on GCP, the Sponsor (or its designate) may audit the investigational 
site to compare raw data, source data, and associated records with the interim (if applicable) or 
final report of the study to assure that data have been accurately reported  
The Principal Investigator must accept that regulatory authorities may conduct an inspecti on to 
verify compliance of the study with GCP.  The Principal Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
and ethica CRO Inc . no later than 24 hours upon notification of being audited by the FDA , Health 
Canada  or IRB.  
13.3 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, GCP, or Manual of 
Procedures requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the Principal 
Investigator,  the Blinded Live Evaluator,  or the study site staff. As a result of devia tions, corrective 
actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and promptly report 
deviations to ethica CRO Inc . 
All deviations from the protocol must be addr essed in study subject source documents. A 
completed copy of the ethica CRO Inc . Protocol Deviation Form must be maintained in the 
regulatory file, as well as in the subject’s source document. Protocol deviations must be sent to the 
IRB per its guidelines.  
The protocol must be rigorously adhered to; however, exceptions will be made in emergency 
situations when the protection, safety, and well -being of the subject requires immediate 
intervention based on the judgment of an Investigator (i.e., BLE or TI).

14.1 Source Data  
Source documentation is generally considered to be the document on which the information or 
data point was first recorded. Source documentation may include a subject ’s medical records, 
hospital charts, clinic c harts, and the site’s  study files as well as the results of diagnostic tests such 
as X-rays, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms.   
The site is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate medical records designed to 
record all observations a nd other data pertinent to the study for each study subject. Source 
Document Worksheets will be prepared by ethica CRO Inc . for this purpose and serve as part of 
the source record for a subject ’s study -related data. The worksheets will allow for the collection 
of the following information and allow for  verification of subject identity throughout the study : 
a. Subject’s name ; 
b. Subject’s contact information ; 
c. The date that the subject entered the study and the subject number assigned ; 
d. The study title and/or the protocol number of the study and the Sponsor’s name ; 
e. A statement of the informed consent process and the date that informed consent and HIPAA ; 
f. Records of previous and current dermatological treatments and/or therapies ; 
g. Dates of all subject visits ; 
h. PR-SRS, GAI , Glogau , FACE -Q, satisfaction  assessments , and pa in during injection ; 
i. 14-day patient CTR diaries and questionnaires ; 
j. Study device injection volumes and injection techniques ; 
k. All prescription and non -prescription concurrent medications, therapies, and treatments (up 
to 1 month prior to enrollment through the final visit of the study) and any changes to the 
list of medications ; 
l. Occurrence and status of any A Es; 
m. Lip functionality  assessments  
n. The date the subject exited the study, and a notation as to whether the subject completed the 
study or reason for discontinuation ; 
o. The results of urine pregnancy testing, if performed . 
Two sets of worksheets will be used to capture study specific information (i.e., efficacy 
assessments, injection volumes, injection technique, etc.);  one set for the BLE  and study 
coordinator, and one set for the TI and study coordinator. This will allow t he BLE  and TI to remain 
blinded to each other’s assessments.  The study coordinator will refer to these worksheets in 
conjunction with the medical record in order to complete data entry into the eCRF.  
Pertinent records  related to the study (e.g., the subjec t’s medical chart) will be made available to 
the Sponsor representative on request with due precaution to protect the privacy of the subject. If 
applicable (i.e., SAE  reporting ), personal identifying information (except subject initials) will be 
redacted on any photocopies of relevant medical records and replaced with the unique subject 
number before submission to the Sponsor. The Principal Investigator will protect the

A subject identification code list will be maintained in order to allow unambiguous identification 
of each subject included in the study. This list should contain the  subject’s full name, date of birth, 
dates of participation and identification number as per local  regulations.  
The Principal Investigator must agree to supply all details to Sponsor auditor(s) and/or regulatory 
authorities, ensuring the data is held confi dentially at the site after completion of the study. A note 
will be made in the hospital or clinical medical records, if appropriate, that the subject is 
participating in a clinical study.  
The eCRF and the subject’s medical records pertinent to the study will be reviewed by ethica CRO 
Inc., representatives from TEOXANE  SA, the IRB and regulatory bodies such as the FDA and 
Health Canada  to the extent permitted by regulations.  
14.2 Case Report Form  
In this study the case report form will be an eCRF. The study coordinator must complete the eCRF 
for each subject within a timely manner of the visit occurring.  
The site monitor will review the completed eCRF  for accuracy, completeness and cons istency with 
source documentation  (i.e., medical records, source document worksheets, etc.) . The site monitor 
will submit requests for correction/clarification of data (e.g., queries) to the study coordinator 
when inconsistencies are identified during monitoring and source data verification or during the 
edit check process.   
All corrections and alterations  of eCRF data must be made by the study coordinator in a timely 
manner and according to the instructions provided. Completed eCRFs  for each visit  (i.e., those 
reviewed by ethica CRO Inc . and with no remaining queries) should then be reviewed and 
electronic ally signed by the  appropriate Investigator  (i.e., BLE or TI). In order to review and 
electronically sign the eCRF, the BLE  and TI will each have their own login that  will allow them 
to view only the data that they have generated.  
A full audit trail detailing corrections and alterations made to the eCRF will be maintained.  
Upon study completion, a hardcopy of the eCRF for each subject will be provided to the site. 
14.3 Arch iving of Study Documentation  
Essential documents are any records that demonstrate the compliance of the subject, Investigator s, 
Sponsor, and site monitor with the study protocol, with standards of GCP, and with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. Essen tial documents (including but not limited to study -related 
correspondence (including emails), subject records, subject privacy documentation, records of the 
distribution and use of all TEOSYAL® RHA Redensity , and copies of eCRFs should be retained

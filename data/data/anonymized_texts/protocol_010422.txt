1 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Study Design:  Open label single -arm, single -institution  study  to evaluate the efficacy  
and safety  of SGI -110 in Philadelphia chromosome negative  (Ph-) Myeloproliferative 
Neoplasms (excluding PV, ET and primary/secondary myelofibrosis) . While this study 
would begin as a  single institution study, it may be open later as a multi institutional 
study.  
 
1.2 Primary Objective: Determine the efficacy of SGI -110 in improving hematological 
and/or quality of life outcomes in patients  with Ph - MPN  
 
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives :  
Determine whether  SGI-110 has increased efficacy in specific morphologic, cytogenetic 
and/or molecular subgroups of MPN  
Perform correlative scientific studies to assess potential epigenetic or other biomarkers 
predictive of response  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 SGI-110 
 
2.1.1  SGI -110 Background  
 
For further information on SGI -110 please refer to the most up to date version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB). 
 The active metabolite of SGI -110 (2’ -deoxy -5-azacytidylyl -(3’→5’) -2’-deoxyguanosine sodium 
salt), a dinucleotide, is decit abine , an FDA -approved agent for the treatment of myelodysplastic 
syndromes . SGI -110 is resistant to modifi cation by cytidine deaminase, a common pathway of 
decitabine metabolism and deactivation [1]. The molecular weight of SGI -110 and decitabine are 
580 Da and 228 Da, respectively. Therefore, the molar equivalent dose of  1 mg of decitabine is 
approximately 2.5 mg of SGI -110. SGI -110’s activi ty was demonstrated  with the same preclinical 
pharmacodynamic assays used to demonstrate decitabine’s efficacy  e.g., re -expression of p15, p16, 
and MLH1 and induction of fetal hemoglobin, in vivo . In xenograft studies, SGI -110 demonstrates 
promising preclinical activity in both hematologic and  solid tumors. 
 In vitro evidence suggests that SGI -110 has a longer half -life than deci tabine in the presence of 
cytidine deaminase. These promising observations suggest that SGI -110 may have  improved  
pharmaceut ical properties and biological activities that could extend  decitabine’s current clinical 
utility. SGI -110 has shown to be better tolerated in mice than decitabine and is as effective in  vivo 
in inducing p16 expression, reducing DNA  methylation at the p16 promoter  region, and retarding 
EJ6 human bladder cancer t umor growth in athymic mice [2].

SGI-110 has been developed for subcutaneous administration. SGI -110 is pharmacologically 
active both in vitro and in vivo in a variety of tumor cells a nd murine xenograft models when 
administered  subcutaneously. Treatment is well tolerated via t he subcutaneous route in murine 
xenografts. When administered subcutaneously to non- human primates, SGI -110 releases  
decitabine slowly compared to other species, possibly prolonging the effect over longer p eriods. 
SGI-110 has been developed as a non- aqueous formulation to ensure formulation stability.  
 
2.1.2 Nonclinical pharmacokinetics  
 The overall pharmacokinetic characteristics of SGI -110 are summ arized as follows. The relative 
bioavailability of  SGI-110 dosed subcutaneously in rats is clo se to 100%. Circulating SGI -110 
levels were very low in the m ice, rat s and rabbit s. However, higher levels were observed in 
monkeys  post subcutaneous dosing. Rapid decline in systemic exposure of SGI -110 with 
elimination plasma half -life (T1/2) in the range of 0.4- 1 hours in rat s and monkey s was observed. 
High levels of decitabine were observed after a subcutaneous dos e of SGI -110 in  m ice, rat s, and 
rabbit s (maximum in rat, 54 μg/mL). Levels in monkey s (maximum 463 ng/mL)  were substantially 
lower. Rapid decline in systemic exposure of dec itabine with elimination plasma T
1/2 of 3.7 hour 
in rats and 1 hour in monkey s was observed.  
 In monkey s, pharmacokinetic parameters were similar on Day 1 and Day 15 of a study in which  
they were dosed once weekly for three consecutive weeks suggesting no significant accumulation of the parent or the active metabolite, decitabine.  
 The metabolic characteristics of SGI -110 are summarized as f ollows. SGI -110 was more stable in 
humans , dog s and m ice and was less stable in rat s and rabbi t plasma. Incubation of SGI -110 with 
liver microsomes from mouse, rat s, rabbit s, dog s and humans  showed little apparent  metabolism 
of the compound. Incubation of SGI -110 with human hepatocytes also showed littl e apparent 
metabolism of the compound, based on disappearance of the parent. SGI -110 does not significantly 
bind to human plasma proteins; in vitro unbound fr action was estimated to be 91%. SGI -110 has 
poor in vitro bidirectional permeability which cor relates well with its poor oral absorption in vivo . 
SGI-110 shows no appreciable induction of CYP1A1/2, CYP2C9 and  CYP3A4 in human 
hepatocytes. SGI -110 does not have any CYP450 inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  
  2.1.4 Nonclinical safety of SGI -110 
 
SGI-110 toxicity findings in rat and rabbit studies are similar to the non- clinical study f indings of 
decitabine in New Drug Application (NDA) supporting Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology studies. Myelosuppression, decreases in thymus weig ht, and testicular atrophy, the 
main study findings of the SGI -110 studies, were also observed as t he main study findings in repeat 
dose toxicity studies with decitabine in mice, rats, rabb its, and dogs. As with SGI -110, 
myelosuppres sion and thymus toxicities after decitabine administration were reversible during 
recovery periods while testicular atrophy persisted. Myelosuppres sion, particularly neutropenia, 
has been reported as a dose- limiting toxicity for decitabine in h uman clinica l studies. Signs of

3 testicular toxicity have  not been observed in any of the published cl inical studies of decitabine to 
date.  
 
No studies have been performed to evaluate the genotoxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic or  
reproductive and developmental toxicity of SGI -110. Decitabine may have genotoxic potential; 
decitabine is mutagenic and in preclinical studies in mice and rats, decitabine was teratogenic,  
fetotoxic, and embryotoxic . 
 
  2.1.5 SGI -110 Clinical Data  
 
SGI-110 has been  studied in a first -in-human, sing le-agent study (SGI -110-01).5 This study was a 
Phase 1/2, dose escalation, multicenter study of two subcutaneous regimens of SGI -110 in subjects 
with intermediate or high -risk myelodysplastic s yndromes (MDS) or a cute myeloid leukemia 
(AML). This study had  two parts, a Dose Escalati on Segment and a Dose Expansion Segment. The 
study evaluated the biological activity, preliminary safety, and efficacy of SGI -110 with two 
dosing schedules in intermediate to high ris k MDS or relapsed or refractory AML subjects, while 
the Dose Expansion Segment further evalu ated safety and efficacy at the recommended dose. The 
study was based on a 3 + 3 design within each regimen. Eligible subjects were  randomized to 
receive 1 of 2 dosing  regimens of SGI -110 with the following starting doses: Regimen 1: 3 
mg/m2/day subcutaneously on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day course, Regimen 2: 6 mg/m2 subcutaneously 
Weekly x 3 on Days 1, 8, 15 of a 28- day course. The minimum dose achieving maximal biological 
activity or biologically  effective dose (BED) for the daily regimen was  reached at 60 mg/m2 daily 
on Days 1- 5. 
 
2.1.6  Human pharmacokinetics  
 
The PK of SGI -110 and decitabine are being evaluated in Study SGI -110-01. Decitabine forms 
from SGI -110 as it undergoes cleavage by phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes. SGI -110 after SC 
injection undergoes efficient conversion to decitabine and d elivers decitabine exposures as 
measured by AUC that are equivalent or higher than those achieved by IV d ecitabine infusion at 
20 mg/m2, while maintaining significantly lower decitabine C max. It is hypothesized that lower 
Cmax may be associated with less toxicity.  
 Due to slower release of decitabine from SGI -110, the effective half -life of decitabine after S C 
SGI-110 is prolonged and the observed decitabine exposure window is longer (8+ hrs) compared 
to IV (3 -4 hrs). At Cohort 6, doses of 90 mg/m
2 for the daily regimen and 125 mg/m2 for weekly, 
the observed decitabine AUCs were approximately 1.41 and 1.77 fol d higher than with IV 
decitabine at the approved dose of 20 mg/m2 IV, whereas C max levels were only at 0.35 and 0.44-
fold for the daily and weekly regimens, respectively. It is hypothesized that longer exposure to decitabine may allow more drug to be incor porated into t he DNA thus resulting in better 
hypomethylation and better biological activity. Clinical drug -drug interaction studies have not 
been conducted with SGI -110. In vitro , SGI -110 does not inhibit the activity nor induce levels of 
major human CYP enzymes, hence, the likelihood of CYP -mediated drug -drug interactions with  
SGI-110 is remote.

Based on PD assessment of global hypomethylation from the fi rst 7 cohorts in Study SGI -110-01 
Dose Es calation Segment , the LINE -1 demethy lation data show dose dependent hypomethylation 
induction in t he daily schedule reaching a plateau at 60 mg/m2 SC daily x5. The hypomethylation 
of the weekly schedule was inferior to the daily schedule and plateaued early  (Figure 1 ). The 
Biologically Effective Dose or BED was therefore established as 60 mg/m2 dailyx5. 
 
 
   
 
Figure 1: LINE -1 Demethylation  
 
 
 
There have been 5 documented major responses (2 CRs and 2 CRi, 1 CRp) all in heavily -pretreated 
refractory AML  subjects regardless of  prior hypomethylating agents (HMA) treatment : 1 CR and 
CRp with weekly (60 mg/m
2 and 125mg/m2, respectively ) and 2 CRi and 1 CR with daily (36/ 60 
mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2 respectively). The major responses were observed in 5/19 refractory AML 
patients when adequate hypomethylation (>10%) was achieved. Five MDS patients who all 
received prior treatment with HMAs had hematolog ical improvements or marrow CR.  Since these 
initial data were reported, SGI -110 has shown further response s in patients with MDS and acute 
myeloid leukemia, phase II data have been reported and the agent is currently being  tested in a phase II I trial compared to decitabine in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia.  
2.4 Study disease: MPN  
 Philadelphia chromos ome negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( PHN- MPN)  comprise  a 
group of myeloid neoplasms with  varying clinical, morphologic and laboratory features and a 
wide range of survival. According to 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the MDS/MPN  overlap syndromes include chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), atypical 
chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(JMML) and myelodyspla stic/myeloproliferative neoplasm unclassifiable (MDS/MPN -U). In a recent 
retrospective study from MD Anderson Cancer Center, the median survival of patients with a 

IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016

5 diagnosis of MDS/MPN unclassifiable was 12.4 months [3] .There is no effective therapy for 
PHN- MPN  and this represents an unmet medical need.  
 
 The MDS/MPN overlap syndromes can present with a wide range of hematological and clinical manifestations  and individual patients may exhibit a combination of features characteristic of 
both MDS and MPN. For example, while transfusion- dependent anemia is generally present, 
other hematological laborator y abnormalities can range from leukopenia to  leukocytosis and 
from thrombocytopenia  to thrombocytosis.  Unlike  with MDS, significant splenomegaly is often 
present in patients wi th PHN- MPN. Also, patients  may have a constellation of constitutional 
findings, including fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats and other unpleasant symptoms that lead generally to poor quality of life. Thus , while improving overall survival is a critical goal 
of therapy, effective therapy for this group of patients will inclu de also agents that can be 
demonstrated to improve as many of the disease -related clinical issues as possible.  
 
2.5 Rationale  
 
2.5.1 Both decitabine and SGI -110 have  demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with 
MDS, AML and CMML. Based on these data, substantial clinical experience  and the 
lack of an effective treatment option  in PHN- MPN , we hypothesize that treatment 
with SGI -110 will  result in improved hematological and quality of life outcomes in 
patients with these diseases. SGI -110 will be adminis tered subcutaneously at the 
dose level of 60mg/m
2 for 5 days to be repeated every 28 days . If the treating 
physician feels that SGI -110 needs to be started before 28 days for subsequent 
cycles, SGI -110 can be started before the 28 days in those clinical si tuations after 
getting permission from the study PI. To capture the potential ability of SGI -110 to 
improve both hematological and QOL measures, we will utilize a recently published 
composite endpoint for response assessement based on IWG -MDS, IWG -
myelofib rosis and MFSAF (Myeloproliferative N eoplasm Symptom Assessment 
Form)  tools: Savona et al., An international consortium proposal of uniform 
response criteria for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) in adults. Blood,125(12):1857- 65. 
  
3. PARTICIPANT SELECTION  
 
3.1 Eligibility Criteria  
 
Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible to 
participate in the study : 
 
3.1.1 Participants must have co nfirmed diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome negative 
MPN  neoplasm bas ed on WHO classification [5] including Chronic Neutrophilic 
Leukemia (CNL), atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (aCML), Chronic 
Myelom onocytic Leukemia (CMML), M yelodysplastic /myeloproliferative 
IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016

6 neoplasm unclassifiable  , accelerated phase myelofibro sis and MPN unclassifiable  
(defined as peripheral and or bone marrow blasts of 10- 19%). Patients with early 
stages of Polycythemia Vera or Essential Thrombocytosis will be excluded from 
the study.  
 
 
3.1.2  Age minimum of 18 years.  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of SGI -
110 in participants <18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but may  
be eligible for future pediatric trial s. 
 
3.1.3 ECOG performance status < 3 
  
3.1.4 Particip ants must have normal organ function as defined below:  
• Total bilirubin < or = 1.5 X  institutional upper limit of normal unless 
attributable to underlying disease, hemolysis or documented Gilbert’s syndrome  
• AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) <  2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal  
unless attributable to underlying disease  
•   Creatinine < 1.5add < or = 1.5X  institutional upper limit of normal or  
creatinine clearance add  using Cockcroft Gault  > 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 
subjects with creatinine l evels above  institutional normal.  
• LVEF < 40 % is allowed as  long as there is no NY class III/IV heart failure or 
uncontrolled arrhythmias.  
3.1.5 The effects of SGI -110 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this 
reason and because oncological agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child -bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception 
(hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pre gnant or suspect 
she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.  
 3.1.6 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent docum ent. 
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for 
admission into the study.  
 
3.2.1 Participants who have had any chemotherapy  (investigational or FDA approved)  
(hydroxyurea is permitted)  or radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study entry or 
IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016    
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
7 those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered 
more than 2 weeks earlier.   
 
3.2.2 Participants may not be treated with any other investigational agents  while on this 
study unless approved by the principal investigator AND the sponsors of BOTH investigational agents . 
 
3.2.3 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to decitabine or SGI -110. 
 
 
3.2.4 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to , infection , 
symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SGI -110 is a  hypomethylating 
agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with SGI -110, breastfeeding should be discontinued.  
 
3.2.5 Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease- free for at least 3  years and are deemed by the investigator  
to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3  years: cervical cancer 
in situ , and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  
  
 
3.3 Inclusion of Wome n, Minorities and Other Underrepresented Populations  
 
Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.  
 
 
4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines  
 
 Eligible patients will be en tered on study centrally at Weill Cornell Medical College  
by the Lead Study Coordinator. A record of patients who fail to meet entry criteria ( i.e. 
screen failures) will be maintained.  Patient consent must be obtained prior to 
performing any study -related  activities  and registration must be completed prior to 
treatment.

4.3  Patient assignment  
Each subject who satisfies the eligibility criteria and is accepted for the study will be 
assigned a unique identification number. The subject number will be used to identify the 
subject throughout the study and will be entered on all study documents.  Onc e the subject 
identification number has been assigned, a confirmation email will be sent to all site personnel.  
This is an open- label study. There will be no blinding of treatment assignment.  
 
  
5. TREATMENT PLAN
  
 
5.1 Overall Study Design  
 This is a single arm, open- label study of SGI -110 in patients with MPN.  
SGI-110 will be administered subcutaneously at a  dose of 60 mg/m
2 on days 1- 5, repeated every  
28 days. Toxicity will be evaluated using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events Active Ver sion 4.  The frequency of toxicities per organ system will be tabulated using 
descriptive statistics. All patients who receive any amount of the study drug will be evaluable for toxicity.

5.3.1 SGI-110 
 
• SGI-110 administered at dose level of 60  mg/m2 SC daily on Days 1 -5 of a 28 -day cycle . 
However, treatment delays are allowed per section 6.3.1 
SGI-110 is administered by SC injection preferably in the abdominal area. The total amount (in 
mg) of SGI -110 to be administered will be determined based on the body surface area (BSA). In 
calculating the BSA, actual heights and weights should be used. The re will be no adjustments to 
“ideal” body weight. The institutional standard for calculating BSA is acceptable. Dose adjustment 
should be made for a +/ - 10% weight change at the beginning of each cycle  
The site(s) of SGI -110 SC injections will be captured on the dosing CRF.  
Investigators are prohibited from supplying SGI -110 to any subjects not properly enrolled in this 
study or to any physicians or scientists except those designated as sub -investigators on Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) Form 1572. The investigator must ensure that subjects receive SGI -
110 only from personnel who fully understand the procedures for administering the study treatment.  
 
 
5.4 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
In general, concomitant medications and  therapies deemed necessary for the supportive care and 
safety of the subject are allowed, provided their use is documented in the subject records and on the appropriate case report form. If toxicity occurs, the appropriate treatment will be used to amelio rate signs and symptoms (including antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, anti -diarrheals for 
diarrhea and anti -pyretics and anti -histamines for drug fever). All supportive measures for optimal 
medical care will be given during the period of study.  
5.5.1 Antibiotics  
Antibiotics may be utilized to prevent or manage febrile neutropenia based on institutional standard practice. Febrile neutropenia is defined as temperature at least 38.5ºC when the ANC is < 1000 µL. Febrile subjects should be evaluated by physic al examination, complete blood count 
(CBC) with differential, and blood culture. Subjects with febrile neutropenia or suspected sepsis on the basis of the physical examination are to be hospitalized for appropriate broad spectrum antibiotic coverage, consi stent with local pathogen sensitivities.  
5.4.2 Hematopoietic Growth Factors  
Granulocyte -colony stimulating factor (GCSF) may be administered per ASCO guidelines.
25 Use 
of other white blood cell stimulating  factors after C ourse  1 can be employed according to accepted

11 practice or institutional guidelines, at the discretion of the treating physician. RBC transfusions 
can be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
5.4.3 Prohibited Medications  
The administration of any other anticancer agents including chemotherapy and biologic agents is NOT permitted , with the exception of hydroxyurea . Similarly, the use of other concurrent 
investigational drugs is not allowed  unless specific approval has been obtained from the principal  
investigator AND the sponsors of BOTH investigational products . Red cell and platelet stimulating 
agents are not allowed on protocol. In life threatening situations, these can be given after permission from study PI. 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease 
progression and tolerance. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression  to acut e leukemia unless, in the opinion of the 
principal investigator, the subject is experiencing clinical benefit from SGI -
110 despite laboratory evidence of progression to acute leukemia.  
• Intercurrent  illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Participant demonstrates an inability or unwillingness to comply with the medication regimen and/or documentation requirements  
• Participant deci des to withdraw from th e study  
• General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant  
unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the treating investigator . 
 
5.6 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Participants will be followed monthly for six m onths after removal from study or 
until death, whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
Post-study case report forms will capture information includ ing subsequent treatments, 
response to subsequent therapy, and survival . 
  
 
5.7 Criteria for Removal from Study  Treatment  
 
Participants will be removed from study treatment for:  
• Unacceptable adverse events that the in the opinion of the investigator is 
harmful  to the participant 
• Violation of the study plan or for administrative and/or other safety reason 
after discussion with the sponsor  
IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016    
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
12 • Progression to Acute Myeloid Leukemia  unless patient is deriving clinical 
benefit and it is in the opinion of the treating ph ysician that the subject 
continue on the drug after discussion with the study PI.  
• Progression of underlying disease (without  transformation to AML)  as 
specified in table 3.  
The reason for study removal and the date the participant  was removed must be 
documented . Alternative care options will be discussed with the partic ipant.  
 
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable 
activities for the final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation  (after 
28 days  from last day or drug administration or before starting alternative treatment, 
whichever happens first). Any adverse experiences which are present at the time of discontinuation/ withdrawal should be followed.  
 
If a patient withdraws for non- medical reasons the followi ng procedures will be followed:  
  
• Physical examination will be performed.  
• Safety assessment ( physical examination, vital signs, hematology and serum 
chemistry), performed 30 days after last treatment  
 
6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES AND DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Dose delays and modifications will be made using the following recommendations. Toxicity assessments will be done using the CTEP Active Version 4.0 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events (CTCAE ). 
 
If possible, symptoms should be managed symptomatically. In the case of toxicity, appropriate medical treatment should be used (including anti -emetics, anti -diarrheal , etc.).  
 
All adverse events experienced by participants will be collected from the time of the first dose of study treatment, through the study and until the final study visit. Participants continuing to experience toxicity at the off study visit may be contacted for additional assessments until the toxicity has resolved or is deem ed irreversible.  
   
6.1 Antic ipated Toxicities  
 
6.1.1 Adverse Event List(s) for SGI -110 
 
The most common AEs suspected by the investigators in Study SGI -110-01 to be 
related to the drug and observed to date in the MDS/AML population are: injection 
site pain, fatigue, nausea, thrombocytopenia, anemia  and diarrhea. Based on the 
mechanism of action of the drug and its active form decitabine, myelosuppression (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and a nemia) and the related consequences such as 
IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016    
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
13 infection  (e.g. pneumonia) , sepsis, and bleeding are the most likely risks for the 
drug. Mucositis has also been reported.  
Pain and burning at the injection site has been reported that are related to dose and 
volume of injection as well as the speed of injection. Care must be taken to avoid intradermal injection . Ice packs will be applied prior to injection of SGI -110 and 
the drug will be injected slowly, over 30 -60 seconds. If the injection site events are 
repor ted at subsequent injections despite slow injection and the use of ice packs, 
pre-treatment with topical or systemic analgesics can be considered.  
 
6.2 Dose Modifications  for adverse events  
  
All adverse events should be reported and considered as part of the overall safety evaluation of SGI-110. The Investigator should try to the best of his/her ability to assess whether an adverse 
event is related or unrelated to SGI -110. Dose modifications are not required for hematologic 
toxicities, but may b e considered at the investigator’s discretion, in collaboration with the Sponsor. 
In general, SGI -110 should be held for  any:  
1. Grade ≥ 3 non- hematologic toxicity (except nausea/vomiting, diarrhea) that fails to resolve to < 
grade 2 within 72 hours despit e appropriate management.  
2. Persistent grade ≥ 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia beyond day 56 of cycle 1 in the setting 
of a hypocellular bone marrow biopsy and absence of residual disease   
3. Other clinically significant adverse event which , in the opinion of the Safety Review Committee 
(SRC) , would place subjects at undue safety risk.  
After resolution of toxicity, t reatment with  SGI-110 may be resumed at  dose level of 45 mg/m
2.  
Retreatment at the original dose level may be considered, depen ding on the nature of the AE, and 
after discussion with the principal investigator . If the same toxicity that led to the dose reduction 
occurs again at this dose level, SGI 110 can be resumed at 30mg/m2 after the toxicity has resolved 
to Gr ade ≤ 2 or baseline levels.  Missed doses will be replaced at the investigator’s discretion. Dose 
modifications for drug- related hematological toxicities will be managed on a case -by-case basis, 
depending on the patient’s disease status and response to grow th factor support, in collaboration 
with the principal investigator . There is no mandatory dose reduction or delay for hematological 
toxicity, but delays up to 14 days and dose reductions down to 30 mg/m2 will be permitted 
depending on clinical circumstances , after discussion with the principal investigator. Additional 
delay s or dose  reduction s may be considered after discussion with the principal  investigator at 
Weill Cornell M edical C enter .

10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
As epigenetic agents may take many months to show their benefit as seen in MDS/AML studies, 
subjects  receiving SGI -110 may continue receiving their assigned treatment if th eir disease 
progresses to leukemia or progression as discerned by the clinical investigator criteria if 1) the patient is clinically stable, 2) the pa tient is informed of their clinica l results and agrees to 
continue therapy, and 3) the patient provider agrees that remaining on study would be appropriate for the patient.

   ↵* Presence of dysplastic changes, which may be interpreted within 
the scope of normal range of dysplastic changes, may still exist in the 
presence of CR as allowed in MDS IWG. Marrow should exhibit age -
adjusted normocellularity in CR.  
   ↵† If there is no significant fibrosis present on the initial bone 
marrow biopsy, a second biopsy is not required to prove resolution of 
fibrosis. Grading of fibrosis in measurement of treatment response should be according to the European Consensus System.

   ↵‡ Given the  current lack of a validated tool to assess complete 
resolution of symptoms in MDS/MPN, “CR with resolution of 
symptoms” (a complete resolution of disease -related symptoms as 
noted by the MPN -SAF TSS in presence of CR) will be a provisional 
category of disease response.

19 karyotyping) known to adversely affect prognosis is required to reach 
complete cytogenetic remission. Decrease in the cytogenetic burden of disease must be by ≥50% (via FISH or classic karyotyping) to be 
indicative of a partial cytogenetic response. Given variability of 
fluorescent probes used in FISH, cytogenetic normalization via FISH 
will depend on the performance characteristics of the specific probes used.  
   ↵|| Resolution of abnormal peripheral blood counts must persist for 
at least 2 separate analyses over at least 8 wk. In the case of proliferative MDS/MPN, CR will include resolution of thrombocytosis to a normal platelet count (150- 450 × 10
9/L) and 
resolution of leukoc ytosis to WBC ≤10 × 10 9 cells/L but ≥1.5 × 
109/L. Hgb should be maintained >11 g/dL and platelets ≥100 × 10 9/L 
without the support of transfusions. Clinical benefit may occur when these changes occur in absence of other changes required for CR or marrow response. Platelet and packed red blood cell TI would be considered for clinical benefit, and duration of TI should be monitored.

23 11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure s pecified in the protocol, even if the event is not 
considered to be related to the study.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagn ostic tests.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at 
immediate risk of de ath from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not 
include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it 
occurred in a more sever e form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24 -hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the 
expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical 
operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or  disease existed before 
the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and  require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospitalizations for:  
IST-ASTX -SGI 110 -MPN  November 22, 2016    
CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
24 • routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deter ioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen  
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatie nt admission  
• respite care  
 
11.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
11.1.3.1 Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected  when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
 
Refer to Section 7  for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study agent(s). 
11.1.3.2 Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.   
11.1.4  Attribution  
 Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse eve nt 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Related – There is reasonable evidence that the AE is related  to the study 
treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Recording and Reporting  
 
Participating investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all participant evaluation time points during the study.

27 11.6 Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
 
The Principal Investigator  Dr. Desai , as holder of the IND, will be responsible for all 
communication with the FDA. Dr. Desai  will report to the FDA, regardless of the site 
of occurrence, any adverse event that is serious, unexpected and  related  to the study 
treatment  (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions or SUSARs) according 
the regulatory -defined timelines (7 -day or  15-day reports). Dr. Desai  will copy Astex 
pharmaceuticals (SGI -110 manufacturer) on any such reports.  
   
In accordance with the regulation 21 CFR § 312.33, the IND Sponsor shall within 60 
days of the anniversary date that the IND went into effect submit a brief report of the adverse events and progress of the investigation. All IND annual reports will be submitted to the FDA by the IND Sponsor.  
 Events will be reported to the FDA using Form FDA 3500A (Mandatory Reporting Form for investigational agents) o r FDA Form 3500 (Voluntary Reporting Form for 
commercial agents). Forms are available at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm
.  
 
7 Calendar -Day Telephone or Fax Report :   
The IND Sponsor is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life -threatening adverse 
event that is unexpected and assessed by the investigator to be possibly related to the investigational agent.   Such reports are to be telephoned or faxed (301-  796- 9845) to the 
FDA within 7 calendar days of first learning of the event.   
 15 Calendar -Day Written Report :   
The IND Sponsor is required to notify the FDA of any serious adverse event that is unexpected and possibly related to the investigational agent in a wr itten IND Safety 
Report.   
 
Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32.  All safety reports previously filed with the IND 
concerning similar events should be analyzed.  The new report should contain comments 
on the significance of the new event in light of the previous, similar reports.  Written IND 
safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be submitted to the FDA within 15 
calendar days of first learning of the event.  
11.7 Reporting to Hospital Risk Management  
 
Participating investigators will report to their local Risk Management office any subject safety reports or sentinel events that require reporting according to institutional policy.  
11.8 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
 
All adverse events, both serious and non- serious, and deaths that are encountered from 
initiation of study intervention, throughout the study, and within 30 days of the last study intervention should be followed to their resolution, or until the participating

28 investigator assesses them as stable, or the participating investigator determines the 
event to be irreversible, or the participant is lost to follow -up. The presence and 
resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate case report form and recorded in the participant’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
 For some SAEs, the study sponsor or designee may follow -up by telephone, fax, and/or 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case d etails deemed necessary to appropriately 
evaluate the SAE report (e.g., hospital discharge summary, consultant report, or autopsy report).  
 Participants should be instructed to report any serious post -study event(s) that might 
reasonably be related to participation in this study. Participating investigators should notify the Overall Principal Investigator and their respective IRB of any unanti cipated 
death or adverse event occurring after a participant has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to the study.   
 
12. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
12.1 Data Reporting  
  12.1.1  Data monitoring of this protocol will occur on a regular basis with the frequency 
dependent on the rate of subject accrual and the progress of the study. The protocol will be monitored internally at Cornell by Dr. Pinkal  Desai  and externally by the Cornell  CRO QA Office 
and the Coordinating C enter i n accordance with the Cornell  Data Safety Mo nitoring Plan. All trial 
monitoring and reporting will be done through the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) at Cornell.  
Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of these audits or inspections is to systematically and independently examine all trial -related activities and documents to determine 
whether these activities were conducted and data were reco rded, analyzed, and accurately reported 
according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
  12.1.2  Dr. Desai  will be holding the IND for this study.  She will comply with all 
regulated reporting requiremen ts to the FDA.  
  Weill Cornell Medical College requires that all research approved by the WCMC IRB 
include an appropriate plan for the monitoring of data to ensure the safety of human subjects. Research supported by Federal agencies will be monitored accor ding to all regulations and 
guidelines of the relevant Federal agency. The WCMC Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the IRB approved protocol, informed consent documents, and data and safety monitoring plan prior to study initiation. After the first fifteen patients have been treated and observed for 28 days, the DSMB will perform an initial safety analysis. After the initial safety analysis period, the DSMB will review the cumulative study data semiannually to evaluate safety, efficacy, stu dy conduct, and scientific validity and integrity of the trial. Due to the nature 
of the underlying diseases of the subjects on this study and the prolonged duration of therapy that

CONFIDENTIAL  
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.  
29 may be required in order to observe clinical benefit with the proposed tre atment, there will be no 
assessment of efficacy until at least 25 patients have been treated for at least 4 cycles of therapy. 
If, at that point, there are fewer than 10% responses, as defined in the protocol, the study will be stopped for futility. The WC MC DSMB may also convene as needed if stopping criteria are met 
or other safety issues arise that the Principal Investigator and/or IRB would like the WCMC DSMB to address.  
 Stopping criteria also include:  
- The early death of more than three of the first ten subjects, as defined by death within 28 days  of beginning therapy.  
- If there is an unacceptable rate of Grade 4 toxicities, as judged by the investigation team, study  sponsor, or the WCM C DSMB.  
  
The study PI will submit all written DSMB recommendations to the IRB upon receipt.

32 14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The hypothesis of this study is that  SGI-110, a demethylating agent , will lead to at least a 25% 
response rate in any one or more of the following response assessments:  IWG -MDS , IWG -MF 
criteria or MF -SAF scores . Based on historical data, there is approximately a 10% hematological 
respons e rate with standard therapies and there is no precedent for quality of life response with 
any current therapy  
 
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 This is an open- label, single -arm phase II study designed to explore the clinical activity of SGI -
110, a demethylating agent, in patients with MPN.  The hypothesis of this study is that SGI -110 
will lead to at least a 25% response rate in any one or more of the following response assessments: IWG -MDS, IWG -MF criteria, or MF -SAF scores.  Based on historical data, there is approximately 
a 10% hematological response rate with standard therapies and there is no precedent for quality of life response with any current therapy.  
 Sample size considerations:  
 This is a phase II trial with 50 patients in the study arm;  a 95% confide nce interval for the 
hematological response rate can be constructed to be within ± 12.0% of the observed response rate.  This calculation assumes a hematological response rate of 25%.  The primary endpoint is the 
hematological response proportion, as measur ed by any one or more of the following response 
assessments: IWG -MDS, IWG -MF criteria or MF -SAF scores.  Based on historical data, the 
hematological response proportion based on standard therapies is approximately 10%.  Sample size recommendations for the current design are determined according to A’Hern’s exact single-stage phase II design (A’Hern, RP, 2001).  We project a hematological response proportion of 10%, below which the regimen will be unacceptable, and a hematological response proportion of 25%, above which the regimen will be considered worthy of further exploration.  The null 
hypothesis that the hematological response proportion is less than or equal to 10% will be tested against the alternative hypothesis that the hematological response propor tion is greater than or 
equal to 25%.  The sample size computations were performed assuming a 5% level of significance and 85% power.  Patients will be continuously accrued throughout the study up to a maximum of 47 patients.  The new regimen will be decla red effective and worthy of further testing if 9 or more 
patients respond among the 47 patients entered into the study.  This exact single -stage design yields 
a ≥ 0.85 probability of a positive result if the true hematological response proportion is ≥ 25%.  It 
yields a ≥ 0.95 probability of a negative result if the true hematological response proportion is ≤ 10%.   A one -sided 95% confidence interval constructed around the expected hematological 
response proportion of 25% will extend 10.4% from the observed hematological response 
proportion.  Assuming that approximately 5%  of patients will be unevaluable/ineligible, we 
anticipate that a total of 50 patients will be enrolled in the study (Reference:  A’Hern AP. Sample size tables for exact single- stage phase II designs. Statistics in Medicine 2001;20:859- 866.)

The primary endpoint of the hematological response proportion will be calculated and a 95% confidence interval will be estimated via binomial proportions .  Descriptive statistics will be 
utilized to describe the parameter proportion defined above (i.e., frequency, percent).  Estimated differences in the hematological response proportion between categories of demographic and treatment variables of interest (evaluated by the two -sample t -test, Wilcoxon rank- sum test, 
Fisher’s exact test, and chi -square te st, as appropriate) will serve as preliminary data (i.e., 
hypothesis -generating) for future studies.  Similar analyses will be conducted for secondary 
outcomes of quality of life.  Exploratory analyses of the hematological response rate and quality of life  outcomes will be also be stratified by specific cytogenetic and/or molecular subgroups of 
MPN.  
 All p -values will be one -sided with statistical significance evaluated at the 0.05 alpha level.  One -
sided ninety -five percent confidence intervals will be  calculated to assess the precision of the 
obtained estimates.  All analyses will be performed in SAS Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata Version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  
Safety Analyses:  
 
The frequency of subjects experien cing toxicities will be tabulated.  Toxicities will be assessed 
and graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0 terminology.  Exact 95% confidence intervals around the 
toxicity proportions will be calculated to assess the precision of the obtained estimates.  
14.2 Reporti ng and Exclusions  
 
14.2.1  Evaluation of toxicity. All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
14.2.2  Evaluation of response.  All participants included in the study must be assessed 
for response to treatment .  Each participant  should be assigned one of the following 
categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unk nown (not assessable, 
insufficient data). By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually designates the "unknown" status of any type  of data in a clinical database.

 SCHEMA  
 
This is a Pilot open label trial to establish the feasibility of CPI -613 in combination with high dose 
cytarabine and mitoxantrone : 
 
Salvage Induction : CPI-613 at dose s of 1,500  mg/m² /day will be given  over 2 hours  on days 1 -5. 
Cytarabine will be given at 3gm/m2 for age <60 or 1.5 gm/m2 for age >60 in 500  mL NS over 3 
hours every 12 hours for 5 doses starting on day 3. Mitoxantrone will be given at 6mg/m2 daily for 
3 doses given in 50 m L NS over 15 min utes after 1st, 3rd and 5th  doses of Cytarabine . A day 14 
marrow will be obtained to assess disease response. If there is a response to therapy but residual 
disease remains patients may receive either a  repeated courses identical to the above or a  shortened 
3 day course with CPI -613 on days 1 -3, cytarabine starting on day 2  for 3 total doses and 
Mitoxantrone after 1st and 3rd doses at the discretion of the treating physician . 
 
 There will be 20 patients recruited at a CPI -613 dose of 500mg/m2/day following the same 
treatment guidelines outlined above. Individuals recruited to this dose level of CPI -613 will remain 
on this dose level for consolidation and maintenance therapy.  
 
Salvage Consolidation : All responding patients are eligible for consolidation therapy with up to 2 
cycles of the shortened 3 course of CPI -613 (same dose as induction cycle) , high dose cytarabine 
and mitoxantrone. Responding patients can be removed from trial at any time to receive a  stem cell  
transplant at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients can move to maintenance following 1, 
2 or no cycles of consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician.     
 
Maintenance Therapy : Any patient who has completed all planned consolida tion therapy  (i.e. 0, 1 or 
2 cycles)  and is not eligible  for, faces a significant delay  or refuses  a stem cell transplant may 
receive maintenance therapy with CPI -613 at a dose of 2,500 mg/m²/day over 2 hours on days 1 -5 
of a 28 day cycle . Patients treated  during induction and consolidation at the 500 mg/m2 dose will 
receive  that dose during maintenance therapy. Patients may continue on maintenance therapy until 
evidence of disease progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.0 Introduction and Background  
1.1 Proposed Mechanism of Action  
CPI-613, the investigational drug, is a novel anti -tumor compound presumably 
with a novel mechanism of action that does not belong to any existing 
pharmacological class of anticancer agents currently used in the clinics. 
Specifically, CPI -613 is referred t o as an Altered Energy Metabolism -Directed 
(AEMD) compound, and it is selective against tumor cells (but not normal cells) 
according to preclinical studies. The anti -tumor effects of CPI -613 are believed to 
be exerted by the inhibition of the pyruvate dehy drogenase complex (PDC).  
 
In both normal and tumor cells, energy is derived from glucose, first by breaking 
down glucose to pyruvate via the glycolytic cycle in the cell cytoplasm. Once 
formed in mammalian cells, pyruvate is then converted by PDC to acety l-CoA 
that is in turn metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the 
mitochondria.  
 
Most tumor cells display profound perturbation of energy metabolism that tightly 
correlates with malignant transformation (Baggetto 1992). The PDC is regulated 
by the phosphorylation state of the E1 subunit. When phosphorylated by the PDC 
kinase the enzyme is inhibited and the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl -CoA is 
inhibited. Preclinical studies have shown that CPI -613 causes phosphorylation of 
the E1 subunit in tumor cells with little to no effect on normal cells. As a result of 
this phosphorylation ATP levels in tumors cells fall and cancer cell death ensues.  
 
Consistent with the proposed mechanism is the fact that CPI -613 has been shown 
to have anti -tumor acti vity in cell culture and animal tumor models against 
diverse cancers independent of multiple drug resistance, cell cycle phase and 
activated signal transduction pathways. The novelty in the presumed mechanism 
of action for CPI -613 is further supported by t he results from an ex vivo study 
demonstrating that CPI -613 is effective against various types of tumor cells 
excised from patients that were resistant to different anti -cancer drugs currently 
used in the clinics.  
 
The significance of CPI -613 having a nov el mechanism of action that is not 
shared by any existing pharmacological class of anti -cancer agents currently used 
in the clinics is that CPI -613 may be effective not only against naive tumors that 
have never been treated with any anti -cancer agents, but  also effective against 
tumors that are resistant to anti -cancer agents currently used in the clinics. This is 
an important aspect because tumors frequently develop resistance to anti -cancer 
agents, rendering a shortage of treatment options. The availabili ty of a novel anti -
cancer agent would provide a new tool to treat cancer.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.2 Background on Preclinical Studies  
CPI-613 is being developed as an anti -tumor agent for the treatment of cancer. A 
number of preclinical anti -tumor efficacy studies; Administration, Distribution, 
Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) studies; safety pharmacology studies; and 
toxicity studies of CPI -613 have been conducted. These studies are briefly 
described below, and the Investigator’s Brochure provides detailed information 
regarding t hese preclinical studies.  
 
In Vitro and Animal Efficacy Studies  
In vitro cell culture studies have shown that CPI -613 is effective against a 
variety of tumor cell lines such as human BxPC -3 pancreatic tumors, human 
AsPC -1 pancreatic tumors, human H -460 non -small cell lung carcinoma 
(NSCLC), and human A2780 ovarian tumors, as well as explants of different 
types of fresh human tumors including NSCLC, colon, breast, and pancreatic 
tumors. Additionally the drug has activity against human AML cell lines 
includin g MV4 -11 and HL60.  Additional work has shown that the 
immortalized NIH 3T3 cell line is not affected  by CPI -613.  Once these cells 
have been transformed by oncogeneic RAS expression they become sensitive. 
This is a mutation commonly found in hematologic m alignancies including 
the acute leukemias. Consistent with the in vitro studies are animal efficacy 
studies, which showed that CPI -613 was effective against xenograft of human 
BxPC -3 and AsPC -1 pancreatic tumors, and human H -460 NSCLC.   
 
Additionally, in vitro cell culture studies have shown that CPI -613 was 
equally effective against tumor cell lines with well -characterized mechanisms 
of drug resistance and their parental tumor cell lines. The equal effectiveness 
against resistant and parental tumor cell l ines is consistent with the proposed 
novel mechanism of action of CPI -613 that is not shared by any 
chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the clinics. The drug -resistant 
tumor cell lines and the parental studied are listed below:  
 
Parental Tumor Cell Lines  Drug -Resistant Derivative  
MCF -7 breast carcinoma line  NCI/ADR -RES adriamycin -resistant derivative(Recently 
reclassified as an Ovarian Cancer derivative of OVCAR -8 
FYI)  
A2780 ovarian carcinoma cell line  A2780DX doxorubicin -resistant derivative  
NCI/H69 small cell lung cancer cells  H69-AR anthracycline -resistant derivative  
MES -SA uterine sarcoma cells  MES -SA/MX2 mitoxanthrone -resistant derivative  
 
Pharmacokinetic Studies  
In rats, the toxicokinetic  profile of CPI -613 administered 2x weekly for 3 
weeks by IV administration at dose levels of 25, 30 or 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 
180 or 210 mg/ m2, respectively) was characterized by an apparent biphasic 
profile – an initial distribution phase followed by an el imination phase.

10 
Revision Date: 06/04/18  Systemic exposure was proportional to dose level, and there was no evidence 
of test article accumulation or sex differences in exposure. In minipigs, the 
toxicokinetic profile of CPI -613 administered 2x weekly for 3 weeks by IV 
administrat ion at dose levels of 45, 42 and 46 mg/kg (i.e., 1575, 1470 and 
1617 mg/m² , respectively) was also characterized by an apparent biphasic 
profile.There was also no evidence of test article accumulation or sex 
differences in exposure.  
 
ADME Studies  
A PK study in minipigs showed that the log scale of the half -life (t1/2) values 
tended to be directly and linearly related to the log of the dose. Specifically, 
t1/2 was ~1hour at 3 mg/kg (105 mg/m²), ~1.7 hours at 10 mg/kg (350 
mg/m²), and 10 hours at 30 mg/kg (1050 mg/m²).  
 
The tissue distribution pattern of radioactivity, after an intravenous (IV) 
administration of 14C-labeled CPI -613 in rats showed that:  
1. The liver might be involved in the metabolism of CPI -613 and/or 14C-
containing  metabolites of CP I-613. 
2. Both the GI tract and the kidneys might be involved in the elimination 
of CPI -613 and/or 14C-containing metabolites of CPI -613. 
3. CPI -613 and 14C -containing metabolites of CPI -613 were mostly 
present in the  extracellular space in the circulation .  
 
An in vitro human plasma protein binding study showed that CPI -613 
exhibited 99.7% binding to human plasma proteins, a value that was similar to 
warfarin. These results are consistent with findings from tissue distribution 
studies (see above) which sho wed CPI -613 was mostly present in the 
extracellular space in the circulation, consistent with findings of extensive 
plasma protein binding.  
 
An in vitro human CYP450 enzyme inhibition study showed CPI -613 does 
not significantly inhibit various CYP450 isoz ymes, including 1A2, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.  
 
An in vitro human liver S9 fraction hepatocyte study showed that CPI -613 
was oxidized to form a sulfoxide metabolite rapidly, with a half -life of <19 
minutes. CPI -613 was also glucuronidated  rapidly at the terminal carboxyl 
group, with a half -life of <15 minutes. Due to oxidation and glucuronidation, 
potential metabolites are a sulfoxide, a metabolite with glucuronidation in the 
terminal carboxyl group; and/or a metabolite with combination of  
sulfoxidation and glucuronidation.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  In Vitro and Animal Pharmacology Safety Studies  
An in vitro study showed that CPI -613 did not inhibit Ether -a-Go-Go-Related 
Gene (hERG) channels. Since hERG channel inhibition is the predominant 
cause of QTc interval prolongation which has been linked to Torsades de 
Pointes conditions such as sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmia, 
this study suggested that CPI -613 may not induce Torsades de Pointes 
conditions. This is consistent with the subsequent animal tox icology studies 
showing that CPI -613 did not induce abnormal ECG pattern.  
 
The potential influence of air in the dead space of an IV catheter on the acute 
toxicity of CPI -613 in rats has been evaluated. The results suggested that 
standard drug administrat ion procedures in the elimination of dead air space 
within indwelling IV catheters should be followed, since air in the catheter air 
space may enhance the acute toxicity of CPI -613 at supra -antitumor doses.  
 
The acute toxicity of CPI -613 administered IV as  a bolus vs. by infusion has 
been compared in a preliminary study in rats. The results suggested that CPI -
613 at supra -antitumor doses might be less toxic when administered as a 1 -hr 
IV infusion than as a 1 -min IV bolus.  
 
Animal Toxicology Studies  
 
Single Dose : A toxicology study involving a single IV administration of CPI -
613 in mice has been conducted. The results indicated that 0.3 -3 mg/kg (0.9 -9 
mg/m²) of CPI -613 did not induce any toxicity, whereas 10 -100 mg/kg (30 -
300 mg/m²) also did not induce toxici ty, except inflammatory reactions at or 
around the site of injection with intensity that was dose -related.  
 
Twice Weekly for 1 Week Dosing : Animal toxicology studies involving IV 
administrations of CPI -613 twice weekly for 1 week have been conducted in 
mice and minipigs. In mice, CPI -613 at 100 mg/kg (300 mg/m²) induced 
mortality in all female mice but not male mice. Also, CPI -613 at 30 and 75 
mg/kg (90 and 215 mg/m², respectively) did not induce any toxicity, except 
inflammation around the site of injectio n and a small increase in the spleen 
weight in mice treated with 75 mg/kg (215 mg/m²) and in the surviving mice 
treated with 100 mg/kg (300 mg/m²) of CPI -613.  
 
In minipigs, when given 2x weekly for 1 week, CPI -613 at doses up to 30 
mg/kg (1,050 mg/m²), th e highest dose investigated in this study, did not 
induce toxicity, other than local inflammatory reactions at and around the site 
of injection. These results are consistent with those observed with the mouse 
study (see above).

Revision Date: 06/04/18  Twice Weekly for 3 Weeks D osing : Animal toxicology studies involving IV  
administrations of CPI -613 twice weekly for 3 weeks have been conducted in 
rats and minipigs, as described below.  
 
In rats, when administered at dose levels of 25, 30 or 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 180 
or 210 mg/m², r espectively), CPI -613 enhanced inflammatory responses in the 
body in a dose related manner, as reflected by dose -related exaggeration in the 
incidence and severity of granulomatous or acute, chronic, or chronic active 
inflammation at the administration sit e inguinal vein), skin and subcutaneous 
tissue near the port, and inguinal skin and subcutaneous tissue near the 
inguinal vein, when compared to control treatment. CPI -613 at the 
toxicological doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m²) in rats induced dose -
related incidence of mortality. The cause of death was due to significant 
systemic inflammation, and might be related to an over enhancement of the 
inflammatory responses induced by  CPI-613. Deaths due to significant 
systemic inflammation were also observed in  minipigs treated with the 
minipig toxicological dose of 46.2 mg/kg (i.e., 1617 mg/m²) of CPI -613 in 
another toxicology study. CPI -613 at 25, 30 and 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 180 and 
210 mg/m², respectively) elevated GGT levels in a dose -dependent manner in 
rats. This elevation is not associated with histopathology findings or other 
parameters of kidney or liver functions, and therefore not related to toxicity of 
the kidney or liver. However, it may be related to systemic inflammation 
(Yamada J, Tomiyama H, et. al. 2006), since systemic inflammation was 
observed in CPI -613 treated rats in this study. Finally, CPI -613 at the rat 
toxicological doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg (i.e., 180 and 210 mg/m², 
respectively) increased reticulocyte levels, which appeared to be associa ted 
with hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen, and sternal bone marrow 
hyperplasia that were secondary to inflammation initiated at the 
administration site or port in rats. The no -observable -adverse effect levels 
were 25 mg/kg (150 mg/m²) CPI -613. The LD10 or STD10 is approximately 
35 mg/kg (210 mg/m²).  
 
In minipigs, when administered at dose levels of 42, 45, 46.2, 50 and 55 
mg/kg (i.e., 1470, 1575, 1617, 1750 and 1925 mg/m², respectively), CPI -613 
at all dose levels induced transient vomiting t hat was transient and reversible. 
Mortality (2 of 8 minipigs) was observed in minipigs treated with CPI -613 at 
46.2 mg/kg (i.e., 1617 mg/m²), due to significant systemic inflammation. 
Significant systemic inflammation was also observed in rats treated with  CPI-
613, resulting in dose -dependent incidence of mortality at the toxicological 
doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m²) and might be due to an over 
enhancement of inflammatory responses induced by toxic doses of CPI -613, 
as supported by dose -related exagger ation in inflammatory effects according 
to gross necropsy and  histopathology findings (see below).

Revision Date: 06/04/18   
Overall Summary of Preclinical Studies  
Preclinical efficacy studies, ADME studies, tissue distribution studies, and 
toxicology studies on CPI -613 have been conducted. The efficacy studies 
demonstrated the anti -tumor effects of CPI -613, whereas the ADME studies  
provided PK, biodistribution, metabolism and plasma protein binding 
information on CPI -613 in the body. Finally, for the toxicology studies, CPI -
613 wa s administered in a way that mimicked that in the proposed cl inical 
study, which involved IV administration given twice weekly. The results of 
the animal toxicology showed that CPI -613 is sufficiently non -toxic.  
1.3 Background on Clinical Studies  
Six single -patient physician -sponsored clinical studies have been conducted for 
compassionate use.  Three of these single -patient studies were conducted in the 
US, whereas the other 3 were conducted in Israel.  
 
Additionally, a Phase I clinical study involv ing CPI -613 as a single agent in 
patients with solid tumors and lymphomas is ongoing.  A phase I clinical study 
involving CPI -613 as a single agent in patients with advanced hematologic 
malignancies is ongoing. A phase I study of CPI -613 in combination wit h high 
dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone has recently been completed. This trial 
established the MTD of  CPI-613 as 2,500 mg/m2. A Phase I/II clinical study 
involving CPI -613 in combination with Gemcitabine is ongoing.   
1.4 Rationale  
Chemotherapy resistance is a  major cause of death in patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML . CPI-613 can increase the sensitivity of leukemia cells to 
chemotherapy in petri dishes and mice. As a single agent in a phase I clinical trial 
several relapsed/refractory AML patients had a n objective response. Additionally, 
a phase I study of CPI -613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and 
mitoxantrone has recently been completed. This trial established the MTD ofCPI -
613 as 2,500 mg/m2. Preliminary analysis of the study revealed an ove rall 
complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery rate of 
45%. This compares favorably with our historical experience of this regimen 
without CPI -613. In this trial patients with poor risk cytogenetics had a 46% 
response rate, fa r superior to the 19% response seen with historical data. This trial 
established that CPI -613 can be safely administered at 2,500 mg/m2 in this 
combination and results in superior response rates. The novel mechanism of 
action, non -cross resistance with che motherapeutic agents, lack of CPI -613-
related myelosuppression cl inically  and increase response rate  make this regimen  
a suitable candidate for the proposed pilot study .

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.5 Justification of the Dose of CPI-613 
WFUCCC 22112, a phase I study of CPI -613 in combination with high dose 
cytarabine and mitoxantrone given exactly as proposed in the current study 
established the MTD of CPI -613 to be 2,500 mg/m2.  A detailed analysis of the 
response data indicated that similar response rates were seen at the 2 ,000 m g/m2 
dose with less toxicity.  Further studies have indicated a dose of 1500 mg/m2 has a 
similar efficacy profile as 2,000 mg/m2 but with even less toxicity . The rationale 
behind using a dose of 500mg/m2 is supported by three lines of evidence: 1) pre-
clinical evidence in mice suggesting lower doses may be more efficacious 
overtime than higher doses , 2) a traditional dose response effect of CPI -613 is not 
observed in AML patients thus far , and 3) a previous study in pancreatic cancer 
that showed remarkable s ynergy between CPI -613 at 500mg/m2 in combination 
with standard chemotherapy . 
2.0 Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To determine the feasibility  of CPI -613 when administered with high dose 
cytarabine, and mitoxantrone  in all three phases of salvage therapy (induction, and 
maintenance) . The regimen will be considered feasible if ≥50% of patients 
eligible for maintenance therapy complete at least 3 cycles.  
2.2 Secondary Objective s 
To observe the response rate (CR, and CRi) of CPI -613 in combination with high 
dose cytarabine  and mitoxantrone . 
 
To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination 
with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone  in induction, consolidation and 
maintenance .  
 
To monitor tox icities experienced by patients treated with CPI -613 in 
combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, 
consolidation and maintenance.  
3.0 Patient Selection  
 
This clinical trial can fulfill its objective only if patients appropriate for this trial are 
enrolled. All relevant medical and other considerations should be taken into account 
when deciding whether this protocol is appropriate for a particular patient. Physicians 
should consider the risks and benefits of any therapy, and therefore  only enroll patients 
for whom this treatment i s appropriate.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  5.2 Pre-Enrollment Medical Screening  
Informed consent must be obtained prior to pre -enrollment medical screening. 
Investigators who are listed on US “Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form 
1572” or Canadian “Clinical Trial Site Information Form” are authorized to 
obtain informed consent. Pre -enrollment medic al screening is used to determine 
the eligibility of each candidate. All enrollment evaluations must be performed 
within the time frame listed below, prior to CPI -613 treatment and include:  
 
Within 2 weeks:  
- Bone marrow biopsy  or cytologic evidence of rel apsed or refractory AML or 
granulocytic sarcoma  
- Optional blood, plasma and bone marrow biopsy sample for biomarker 
evaluation  
- a complete medical history  
- physical exam, including vital signs, height, and weight  
- ECOG PS  
- baseline  evaluation of symptoms and medications  
- clinical chemistry (including renal function), hematology and coagulation (see 
Section 5.6 for specifics)  
 
Within 1 week:  
- a pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential (performed within 1 week 
prior to CP I-613 treatment)  
5.3 CPI-613 Dosing  
This is a Pilot trial to determine the feasibility of CPI-613 given with high dose 
cytarabine and mitoxantrone  in salvage induction, consolidation and maintenance . 
This is an open -label study, and investigators and subjects are not blinded to the 
treatment. The reason this is an open -label study is because this is a feasibility  
trial, and the investigators need to determine whether this regimen is feasible to be 
tested in larger clinical trials . The assignment of patients wil l not be randomized, 
since this is a feasibility  trial. The dose s of CPI -613 for the induction and 
consolidation phases of treatment in this study are 500 mg/ m2 or 1,500 mg/m2 
with 20 patients in each cohort for both 500 and 1,500 the study has already 
accrued 17 patients at 2,000 mg/ m2 cohort ; the dose for the maintenance phase of 
treatment in this study is 2,500 mg/m2 except for patients who received 500mg/m2 
at induction.  P atients receiving 500mg/m2 at induction  will continue wi th this 
dose for all ph ases of therapy including maintenance.  
 
CPI-613 must be diluted from 50 mg/mL to 12.5 mg/mL with D5W (i.e., 1 
portion of CPI -613 diluted with 3 portions of D5W) and must be administered IV 
at a rate of ~0.5 mL/min via a central venou s catheter with D5W running at a rate 
of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  Please refer to Section 5.4 for methods of administering 
CPI-613.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  5.4 CPI-613 Administration Guidelines  
Since information on the use of CPI -613 in humans is limited, investigators 
should be aware of potential AEs and toxicities observed in preclinical studies, as 
described below.  
 
According to animal toxicology studies, IV administration of CPI -613 can induce 
reactions at and around the site of administration.  These reactions are consistent 
with l ocal inflammation, which include red/purple/black color, swelling, necrosis, 
warm to touch, etc.  These local reactions occurred more severely when there was 
accidental leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space during IV 
administration.  This is possi bly because of low perfusion in the perivascular 
areas, causing prolonged exposure of local tissues to CPI -613.  Therefore, care  
must be taken to avoid perivascular leakage of CP -613. 
 
CPI-613 must be administered IV by infusion (not bolus), via a central venous 
catheter that is free flowing, with D5W running at a rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr, 
and free of air in the dead space of the IV catheter.  This is to minimize vascular 
irritation, inflammation and acute toxicity of CPI -613.  Accidental co -
administrati on of extra air that is present in the dead space of an IV catheter has 
been shown to induce excessive acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal 
studies (Study NCL -049).  
 
CPI-613 must be diluted prior to administration, as described in Section 5.3.  
Dilution of CPI -613 prior to administration reduces the rates of delivery of CPI -
613 to the body, thus minimizing the acute toxicity of CPI -613. 
 
Accordingly, the following procedures in administering CPI -613 should be taken 
to minimize local reactions and a cute toxicity of CPI -613: 
 
A. Confirmation of the placement of the IV line to ensure that there is a lack 
of leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space.  
B. Confirmation that the IV line is free flowing and with D5W running at a 
rate of about 125 -150 mL /hr. 
C. Confirmation that the IV line is free of air in the dead space.  
D. If necessary, r otate the site of administration for different doses of CPI -
613. 
E. Dilute CPI -613 drug product with D5W, as instructed in the study 
protocol.  
F. Administer CPI -613 b y infusion, not bolus, as instructed in the study 
protocol.  
G. Upon completion of administering CPI -613, “slowly” flush the IV line 
with ~10 mL of D5W to remove residual CPI -613.

24 
Revision Date: 06/04/18  Investigators should be aware of the following toxicity observed in animals 
treated with toxic doses of CPI -613: 
1. CPI-613 at the toxicological doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m² ) 
induced dose -related incidence of mortality in rats.  The cause of death in 
most rats was due to significant systemic inflammation, and might be 
related to an over enhancement in the inflammatory responses induced by 
CPI-613.  Deaths due to significant systemic inflammation were also 
observed in minipigs treated with the minipig toxicological dose of 46.2 
mg/kg (i.e., 1617 mg/m² ) of CPI -613.  Additional ly, CPI -613 at 30 and 35 
mg/kg (i.e., 180 and 210 mg/m² , respectively) in minipigs increased 
reticulocyte levels, which appeared to be associated with hematopoietic 
cell proliferation of the spleen, and sternal bone marrow hyperplasia that 
were secondary t o inflammation initiated at the administration site or port.  
Therefore, investigators should be aware of significant increases in 
reticulocyte levels, which can be used as an indication of severe 
inflammation.  
 
2. CPI-613 at 42 -55 mg/kg (i.e., 1470 -1925 mg/m²) induced transient 
vomiting in minipigs.  
 
3. CPI-613 at 42 -46.2 mg/kg (1470 -1617 mg/m² , respectively) induced 
transient and  reversible increases in troponin I and creatine kinase (CPK) 
isoenzyme.  The transient and reversible nature of the troponin and CPK 
isoenzyme results were consistent with  necropsy exam and 
histopathology, which indicated that there was no cardiac damage  after the 
3-week treatment of different doses of CPI -613. 
5.5 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care 
Guidelines  
Patients will receive standard prophylactic treatment for drug -related symptoms. 
Supportive treatment s may include anti -emetic, anti -diarrhea, anti -allergic, anti -
hypertensive medications, analgesics, antibiotics, allopurinol, and others such as 
blood produc ts and bone marrow growth factors. The treating physician may 
utilize  marrow growth  factors, or blood or platelet transfusions at their discretion.  
For patients with an ANC ≥  500/mm3 at the time of CPI -613 administration 
loperamide can be administered as a  premedication at a dose of 2 to 4 mg PO  30 
minutes prior to CPI -613.   
5.6 Study Procedures – Assessment of Safety, Plasma 
Concentration, and Possible Anti -Tumor Efficacy  
Safety Assessment : The safety of CPI -613 will be assessed based on:  
- physical ex ams 
- vital signs  
- clinical pathology

Revision Date: 06/04/18  • clinical chemistry  
• renal function  
• hematology  
For physical exams and vital signs, they are to be performed during screening 
(performed within 2 weeks prior to treatment with CPI -613) and after CPI -613 
administration  in Cycle 1.  Beyond Cycle 1, physical exam and vital signs will be 
assessed within 5 days of the next cycle doses .  
 
For clinical pathology (i.e., clinical chemistry, renal function, hematology and 
coagulation), they are to  be performed during screening (performed within 2 
weeks prior to treatment with CPI -613), and within 24 hrs prior to dosing . 
Creatinine results within the last 24 hours must be reviewed prior to CPI -613 
dosing .  For Day 1 of Treatment Cycle 1, pre -dose ass essments of clinical 
pathology are not needed because the pre -enrollment results can be used.  
Beyond cycle 1, laboratory assessments will be assessed on at least day 1 and  5 
of each cycle  rather than prior to beginning each cycle.  
 
For left ventricular ej ection fraction  assessments, they are evaluated during 
screening  and prior to consolidation therapy. Additional assessments can be 
made at the discretion of the treating physician.   
 
Anti-Tumor Efficacy – A Secondary Endpoint:  Baseline anti -tumor efficac y (i.e., 
bone marrow biopsy ) will be obtained within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of 
treatment cycle 1.   Follow -up anti -tumor efficacy will be obtained on day 14 of 
cycle 1 .  In patients treated with additional treatment cycles beyond Cycle 1, 
anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed upon count recovery (defined as 
ANC>1000, freedom from RBC transfusions and platelets>100k)  or day 42 
from the first day of the cycle whichever comes first. Anti-tumor efficacy 
assessment will also be based on investigator and institutional routine 
monitoring of the disease progression of the patients, together with baseline 
evaluations performed prior to treatment with CPI -613. During maintenance 
thera py anti -tumor efficacy will be assessed after eve ry 4th cycle.  
 
Optional Sampling  and “Banking” of Blood, Plasma , urine  and Bone Marrow 
Biopsy Samples:   Optional blood samples ( 5 mL),  urine  (5-10 ml)  as well as 
bone marrow via biopsy  (if deemed appropriate  by physician) , will be obtained

5.9 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Listed below are criteria for the discontinuation of the study. However, patients 
who fail to return for the follow -up visits will be contacted and queried as to the 
reason they have failed to complete the study with special  attention to health 
status.  
 
A. Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
 
B. The investigator has the right to withdraw patients from the study according to 
his/her discretion, if the investigator determines that cont inued participation is 
not in the patient’s best interest. As an excessive rate of withdrawals can 
render the study not interpretable, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should 
be avoided. When a patient discontinues investigational treatment, the 
investig ator should make every effort to contact the patient and to perform a 
final evaluation. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be recorded. Criteria for 
terminating subject's participation in the study are listed below:  
 
- Protocol defined d isease progression significantly greater than expected  
- Unacceptable toxicity of the investigational product  
- Patient withdrawal of consent  
- Investigator’s discretion  
- Undercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the 
intended disease for which the s tudy is investigating, that renders 
continuing the treatment unsafe or regular follow -up impossible  
- General or specific changes in the patient's condition that renders the 
patient ineligible for further investigational treatment  
- Non-compliance with inv estigational treatment, protocol -required 
evaluations or follow -up visits  
- Termination of the clinical trial by the sponsor  
6.0 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  for CPI -613 
 
The occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not generally require dose modification for 
subsequent doses for that patient.  However, if Grade 2 non-hematologic, non -infectious 
toxicity develops  attributed as at least probably related to CPI -613, treatment can resume 
only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been reduced to Grade 1 or below, and  the dose level 
for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 25% of the dose at which such 
Grade 2 toxicity occur.  If Grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic, non -infectious toxicity  
develops, dosing of that patient will be withheld and the patient shall  be monitored for 
recovery from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity.  To resume treatment for a 
patient who has had Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 toxicity must be reduced to 
Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced

613 results in no toxicity, patients may be dose escalated to the prior dose at the 
discretion of the treating physician.   
 
Dose adju stments during maintenance therapy will be done as described above with the 
addition that should patients experience hematologic toxicity ≥ Grade 2 attributed to CPI -
613 the next dose of maintenance therapy must be held until the  Grade 2 toxicity has 
been reduced to Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient 
will be reduced by 25% of the dose at which such Grade 2 toxicity occur red.  If Grade 3 
or 4 hematologic toxicity develops, dosing of that patient will be withheld and th e patient 
shall be monitored for recovery from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 hematologic  
toxicity.  To resume treatment for a patient who has had Grade 3 or 4 hematologic  
toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 hematologic  toxicity must be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and 
the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced to 50% of the dose at 
which such Grade 3 or 4 hematologic  toxicity occur red. If the reduced dose of CPI -613 
results in no toxicity, pati ents may be dose escalated to the prior dose at the discretion of 
the treating physician.

subjects or others to t he IRB.  The Principal Investigator is also responsible for 
ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and others which they 
receive are reviewed to determine whether the report represents a change in the 
risks and/or benefits to study part icipants, and whether any changes in the 
informed consent, protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a 
site where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (int ernal events) 
must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or 
other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at 
another site conducting  the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS 
IRB (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar 
days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outc ome that alters the risk versus potential 
benefit of the research and as a result warrants a substantive change in the 
research protocol or informed consent process/document in order to insure the 
safety, rights or welfare of research subjects.

Code Name:      CPI-613 
Trade Name:      Bylantra (tentative)  
Generic Name:     None  
 
Description of CPI -613 Drug Product  
 
CPI-613 is provided in 10 -mL amber glass vials. Each 10 -mL vial contains 10 mL 
of CPI -613 at a concentration of 50 mg/mL (in 1M triethanolamine [TEA, also 
called trolamine]), which is equivalent to 500 mg of CPI -613.  The drug product 
of CPI -613 is a clear  and colorless solution that is free of any particulate matter.  
 
Handling of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 is an investigational drug and the toxicity in humans is not fully 
understood. All necessary precautions in handling potentially toxic chemicals 
must be strictly adhered to. Gloves and protective clothing must be worn when 
handling CPI -613.  Avoid contact by all modes of exposure.  If the solution 
contacts the skin, it must be washed immediately and thoroughly with soap and 
water.  If the solution comes in contact with mucous membranes, the membranes 
must be flushed thoroughly with water. Spills should be picked up with absorbent 
material and the area must be washed at least 3 times with ethyl alcohol followed 
by water.  
 
CPI-613 drug product is slightly photosensit ive (Study# PHO -001). Therefore, 
after removal of CPI -613 drug product from the amber vials, CPI -613 drug 
product should be protected from excessive light before administration to patients.  
 
Storage of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 should be stored under refrigeration,  at 2°-8°C (36° -46°F), except when 
being prepared for administration.  
 
If CPI -613 is to be transferred from one storage area to another, or is to be 
prepared for dosing, care must be taken to maintain appropriate product 
temperature.  
 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD CPI -613 BE FROZEN.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  CPI-613 must be administered IV by infusion, via a central IV catheter with D5W 
running at a rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  Subsequent  sections describe the 
appropriate types of IV catheters, IV bags, syringes and clinical solutions that can 
be used in mixing and administering CPI -613 to patients.  
 
Leaching of Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP) :  CPI -613 can cause leaching of 
DEHP from IV in fusion sets and IV bags (Study COM -003).  Therefore, 
DEHP -containing IV infusion sets, IV bags or syringes should not be used in 
mixing or administration of CPI -613.  Examples of syringes and extension set 
for syringe pump that do not contains DEHP (and th erefore can be used in the 
administration of CPI -613) are:  
 
Syringes:  Kendall Monoject syringes, all  mono -ject syringes are DEHP free.  
 
Extension Set for Syringe Pump Use:  All extension sets from MED -RX do not 
contains DEHP.  
 
IV Infusion Sets :  A compati bility study has been conducted showing that CPI -
613 is compatible with 4 commonly used IV infusion sets (Study# COM -001).  
Therefore, these 4 types of IV infusion sets, and IV infusion sets that are made 
with the same materials, can be used to administrat e CPI -613.  These IV 
infusion sets are:  
 
PVC material - ADDitIV Primary IV Set with Universal Spike, Backcheck 
Valve, 2 Injection Sites, DEHP -Free and Latex -Free, 15 drops/mL, REF 
V14453, B Braun Medical Inc.  
Latex material - Interlink System Secondary Medication Set, 10 drops/mL,

Polyethylene material - Interlink System Paclitaxel Set by Baxter HealthCare, 
Non DEHP:   Polyethylene tubing with a 0.22 microfilter Item # 2C7558 10 
drops/mL  
 
Syringes :  Compatibility studies (Studies# COM -001 and COM -002) have shown 
that CPI -613 drug product (50 mg/mL), and dr ug product diluted with D5W to 
various concentrations (1.6 -25 mg/mL) are compatible with various types of 
syringes, as listed below.  Therefore, any of these types of syringes, and 
syringes that are made with the same materials, can be used to administer C PI-
613.  Also, glass syringes can also be used, since glass (such as glass 
containers) is compatible with CPI -613 drug product.

Reconstitution and Administration of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 must be diluted from 50 mg/mL to 12.5 mg/mL with 5% Dextrose Water 
or D5W (i.e., 1 portion of CPI -613 diluted with 3 portions of D5W) prior to 
administration.  The diluted drug product should be visually inspected for clarity.  
If haziness or preci pitate is observed, do not use the diluted drug product for 
dosing.  After dilution with sterile D5W, the solution is clear and has a pH of 8.4 -
8.8. The diluted CPI -613 drug product has been found to be stable for 24 hrs at 
room temperature and refrigerati on temperature (Studies STA -010).  
 
CPI-613 must be administered IV, via a central venous catheter that is free 
flowing, free of air in the dead space, and with D5W running at a rate of about 
125-150 mL/hr. This is to minimize vascular irritation, inflamma tion and acute 
toxicity of CPI -613 (Study NCL -049). Accidental co -administration of extra air in 
the dead space of IV catheters during administration of CPI -613 has demonstrated 
the potential to induce acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal studies 
(Study NCL -049). Also, accidental leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space 
during IV administration, which prolongs exposure of perivascular tissue to CPI -
613, can induce significant local inflammation according to animal studies 
(Studies NCL -027 and  NCL -030).  
 
CPI-613 must not be administered as a bolus, but by infusion via a central venous 
catheter, over a total of 2 hours.  All doses of CPI -613 will be administered over 2 
hours to simplify PK/PD analysis. The infusion will also minimize potential acute 
toxicity of CPI -613, according to animal studies (Study NCL -049). The following 
precautions must be taken when administering CPI -613: 
 
A. Confirmation of the placement of the IV line to ensure a lack of leakage of 
CPI-613 into the perivascular space.  
B. Confirmation that the IV line is free flowing, and with D5W running at a 
rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  
C. Confirmation that the IV line is free of dead air space.  
D. Rotate the site of administration for different doses of CPI -613. 
E. Dilute CPI -613 dru g product with D5W, as instructed in the study protocol.  
F. Administer CPI -613 by infusion, not as a bolus.

Alternatively, destroy the used CPI -613 vials according to institutional policy 
after documentation of the number of used CPI -613 vials and remaining 
volume in each used vial.  
- At the end of the study, deface the label (both used and unused vials) with a 
permanent marking pen.  
- For used CPI -613 vials (if not already destroyed according to institutional 
policy), after documentation of the number of used C PI-613 units and 
remaining volume in each container, the used containers should be destroyed 
at the site according to the institutional procedures for destroying toxic 
chemicals.  A certificate documenting the destruction of used vials must be 
kept on file .

Revision Date: 06/04/18  2010;115:453 -474). Peripheral blood (PB) cell counts and samples of bone 
marrow aspirates  will be  assessed for changes in disease status. Hematologic  
improvement (HI) requires  improvement in one of the three  hematopoietic 
lineages compared with baseline measurements, and  stable disease ( SD) requires  
the absence of objective disease progression for at least  2 mo nths. Relevant 
responses have to be confirmed by a repeat measuremen t at least 1 wk later. 
Assessments will be  done as described above .  
9.1.1 Definitions   
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the 
time of their first treatment with CPI-613. 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have 
measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of 
therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for response.  These patients will have their response classified 
accor ding to the definitions stated above .  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be 
considered evaluable.)  
Overall Survival (OS) : Time from enrollment on trial to death from any 
cause.  
 
10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
This is a pilot trial investigating three doses of CPI -613 (500, 1500, and 2,000 
mg/m2. We plan to accrue between 10 and 15 patients per year for a total of 67 
patients (20 at 500 , 1,500 mg/m2  and 3 additional patients  at 2,00 0 mg/m2 ). Of 
note 17 patients at 2,000 mg/m2 and 7 patients at 2,500 mg/m2 were already 
accrued .  
  
Analysis Plan:  
 The primary objective of determining the feasibility  of administering CPI-613 
in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone during induction, 
consolidation and maintenance therapies will be completed by determin ing the 
percentage of patients eligible for maintenance therapy who complete at least 3 
cycles . If ≥50% of eligible patients complete 3 cycles of maintenance therapy  we 
will consider this regimen feasible for future study. Given an estimated response 
rate of 50% and a 25% attrition to stem cell transplant , if we enroll 60 patients we 
should be able to assess feasib ility of maintenance in approximately 22 patients.  
With 22 evaluable patients,  a two -sided 95.0% confidence interval using the large 
sample normal approximation will extend 22% in either direction  from the 
observed value when the ex pected value is 50%.   Within a dose we should be able 
to estimate feasibility in 7 patients with a 95% confidence interval extending 36% 
in either direction.

Revision Date: 06/04/18   Participants will also be followed and analyzed for secondary outcomes of 
response rate and overall survival  both overall and by dose .  Participants will be 
monitored for survival through routine follow -up visits .  Confidence intervals will 
be calculated around the estimate s of the response rate (CR and CRi ).  Assuming 
a response rate of 0.5, with 60 participant s, we would be able to create 95 percent 
confidence intervals with a 0. 13 margin of error ( 0.37, 0.63).  We will use 
Kaplan -Meier estimation to analyze overall survival.   The frequency of toxicities 
experienced by the participants will be presented by type  and grade in an effort to 
monitor and report safety of the treatment.  
 In exploratory analysis we plan to compare both complete response and early 
mortality (death within 60 days of beginning of treatment) to the observed rates in 
a historical cohort of subjects (CCCWFU 22111) , both overall and by dose .  In 
the historical cohort the response rate was estimated to be 41%.  Using a one -
sided chi -square test, a 0.05 significance level, null hypothesis of 41%, and 
assuming 70% power, we would be able to show significant improvement in 
response if we are able to achieve a response rate of 56% or higher.  Early 
mortality in the historical cohort was estimated to be 29% at 60 days.  We will use 
a one -sided exact test for a single proportion, a 0.05 significance l evel, a null 
hypothesis of 29%, and 70% power.  To show a significant decrease in early 
mortality in this study we would need to observe a 60 day mortality rate of 16.8% 
or lower.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  APPENDIX  B – Safety and Toxicity Review Committee SAE Reporting 
Guidelines  
 
 
Safety and Toxicity Review Committee  
(STRC ; previously known as CROC )  Serious 
Adverse Event ( SAE) Notification SOP       Date: 11/17/2016  
 
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements  
 
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form that is 
submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any  grade 5 (death during protocol intervention ) SAEs 
on CCCW FU Institutional  interventional  trial patients . There are multiple entities that require 
reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for what is reported, and how it is reported.  
 
Rules used by other e ntities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), Ad EERS, MedWatch, etc.) should 
NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI Data Table 4  reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional  Interventional  
studies covered by these reporting requirements are defined as: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the 
center is a primary contributor to the design, implem entation, and monitoring of the trial, or 
participation in a multi -site trial initiated by an institutional investigator at another center.   
Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional 
protocols are labeled  NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative 
group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Interventional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these 
trials be reported to the STRC  for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management  (CPDM) 
staff members assisting a PI in documenting and  reporting an SAE that qualif ies for STRC 
reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone  (or in -person) , 
followed by informing the entire committee via the required email notification.  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team 
for a CCCWFU Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it is the 
responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.  
 
What is considered an SAE  under this mandatory procedure ?

50 
Revision Date: 06/04/18  Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention ) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study 
treatment or if they occur within 30 day s of last study treatment (even if patient begins a new 
treatment during the 30 days). This window of 30 days should be the standard window to be 
used in all protocols unless a specific scientific rationale is presented to suggest that a shorter 
window can  be used to identify events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is 
unexpected it should be reported.  
Table 1: Summary of STRC Reporting Requirements for Institutional Pilot, Phase 1, Phase 2  
and Phase 3 Interve ntional Trials  
STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. In 
those situations the adverse events that will not require STRC reporting must be specified in 
the text of the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call  (or speak in person)  to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as 
listed below (page if necessary) —see note 2 below  
2. Submit the  STRC Notification Form WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the event. This 
form is  found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to 
http://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team 
members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your 
confirmation.  (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, consult the help 
page for further instructions .)  ADVERSE EVENT

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted does not respond to the phone call 
or page within a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact with their backup.  Give the 
back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call  or page before contacting 
another member. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical 
research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to 
when it is appropriate to contact backup clinicians.  If the event occurs near the end of day, 
then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC 
notification form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and 
document that y ou have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical members 
of STRC.  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as 
they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the 
members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there 
may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made  
and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the 
right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator . 
STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there a ny immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the 
information provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment 
should take place.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply a ll pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email that 
was received by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list date 
of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional 
information which you are reporting.

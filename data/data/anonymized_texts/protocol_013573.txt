 4  1. Précis 
This single center clinical pilot study will in vestigate the effects of niacin on blood lipids and 
lipoprotein composition in huma n subjects who are healthy.   Niacin (vitamin B3 or nicotinic 
acid) is a common nutrient found in  many foods and is currently sold over the counter as a 
nutritional supplement.  Extende d-release versions of niacin are available over the counter 
(e.g., Slo-Niacin®) or by prescription (Niaspan®)  and help to alleviate symptoms of flushing 
associated with larger doses of the vitamin.  Studies of the effects of niacin therapy on 
clinical lipid measures consistently indicate a sh ift toward a healthier lipoprotein profile with 
increased HDL-C and decreases in both triglyceride and LDL-C.  Despite this favorable shift 
in lipid profile, cardiovascular outcome st udies on patients receiving niacin alone or in 
combination with statin therapy have resulted  in mixed results crea ting uncertainty of the 
value of niacin therapy. The proposed study will  examine in detail th e effects of niacin 
therapy on lipoprotein composition and function, while also tracki ng measures of vascular 
health.     
2. Introduction 
Despite numerous academic and therapeutic a dvances, CVD remains the leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality in developed countries1.  Clinical strategies for assessment of CVD 
risk involve the measurement of specific lipop rotein associated lipid levels including low 
density lipoprotein associated cholesterol (LDL-C ), and is positively correlated with disease, 
and high density lipoprotein associated chol esterol (HDL-C), which is thought to be 
protective.  The statin classes of drugs redu ces LDL-C and are the current standard of care 
for reducing CVD risk, but only decrease card iovascular events by approximately 30-35%2.  
Thus, even after LDL-C lowering is accomplished with statin therapy there remains significant amount of residual cardiovascular ri sk.  One potential avenue for reducing this 
residual risk may be through trea tments that increase HDL-C.  HDL has been demonstrated 
to possess a multitude of beneficial functions, whic h likely contribute to its cardio-protective 
nature.  The most extensively studied of these functions is HDL’s role in the process of 
reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), whereby ex cess cholesterol is removed from peripheral 
tissues and transported to the liver for excreti on.  In addition to RCT, HDL also has various 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and vasodilato r activities, all of which are thought to 
contribute to the overall cardi o-protective role for HDL 
3.  These properties make HDL stand 
out as the obvious next target for prevention of cardiovascular disease.            
While the prospect of raising HDL-C to prev ent CVD is enticing, re cent clinical trials 
involving the raising of HDL-C  have been largely disappointing.  Although a few small 
molecule compounds, which effec tively raise HDL-C ar e still under development, such as the 
cholesteryl ester transfer prot ein (CETP) inhibitors, none of these compounds in early stage 
clinical trials have shown promise.  
The only currently FDA approved drug for raisin g HDL-C is Niaspan ®. Niacin is a water 
soluble vitamin found in many f oods (meat, fish, fruits and ve getables) and has been shown 
15-H-0042: Niacin and lipoprotein composition/function 
PI:  Marcelo Amar, M.D. 
Date: July 10, 2019 
Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 5  to have a favorable impact on plasma lipid m easures, increasing HDL-C by as much as 15 to 
35%, while at the same time decreasing plasma triglycerides (20-50%) and LDL-C (5-25%).  
Early clinical studies performed by the Corona ry Drug Project on the effects of long term 
niacin treatment showed benefi cial effects on overall morta lity in the niacin treated group 4.  
The HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatme nt Study (HATS) combined niaci n with statin therapy to 
determine if any further clinical advantage could be gained by adding a HDL-C modifying 
agent to the standard of care for LDL-C lowerin g.  This study pointed strongly to a beneficial 
effect of niacin in combination with Simvas tatin.  Patients in the Simvastatin-niacin group 
had a 42% reduction in LDL-C and 26% increas e in HDL-C.  Additionally, while stenosis 
progressed by 3.9% in the placebo group, athe rosclerotic regression occurred in the 
combination treatment group and clinical endpoi nts (e.g. myocardial infarction and death) 
were reduced from 24% to 3% (placebo vs. Simvastain-niacin) 5.  These beneficial effects 
were suggested to be a result of a shift in HDL subspecies distribution to  include an increase 
in the level of large Į-1 HDL particles, which have been  shown to be protective against 
CVD6.  However, two recent larg e clinical trials of niaci n, namely AIM-High and HSP2-
Thrive have failed to show cardiovascular benefit from us ing niacin on top of a statin 7,8. 
Although these trials have been cr iticized because of their design 9 they have raised questions 
about the clinical utilit y of niacin and HDL-C as a therapeutic target.  
Plasma lipoproteins, especially HDL, are highly  heterogeneous populations of particles.  
Within the total HDL pool there are subpopulati ons of particles with varying protein and 
lipid compositions.  These distinct subpopulatio ns have varying functionality, which are 
dependent upon their composition, with some be ing more protective and some less protective 
against CVD.  In addition to their lipid and protein cargo, HDL has recently been 
demonstrated to carry microRNAs in the plasma and deliver them to specific cell types where 
they can modulate various functions10.  The detailed characte rization of lipoprotein 
subpopulations and their functional attributes is still a fairly new area of research and the 
effect of pharmacologic compounds in this area is largely unexplored.  To date, most of the 
drug development efforts based on HDL have us ed the cholesterol content of HDL (HDL-C) 
as its target.  Although HDL-C is inversely related to cardiovascu lar disease based on 
epidemiologic studies, other composition or functional attributes of HDL may be more 
closely related to its ather oprotective function and hen ce a better target for drug 
development.  It may also be that although niacin raises HDL-C, it causes other detrimental 
changes in HDL that ultimately diminish its abil ity to protect against car diovascular disease.  
A more thorough understanding of how niacin is affecting the composition and functionality 
of HDL and other lipoproteins would allow us to  better predict its clin ical utility and may 
lead to new insights in how to develop future HDL modifying agents. 
3. Primary Objectives  
x Determine the effect of oral niacin on lipoprotein composition, including but not 
limited to Lipoprotein Profile (NMR), proteome, lipidome and microRNA cargo.

Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 6  x Determine the effect of oral niacin on lipoprotein functionality, as measured by 
ability to efflux cholesterol from cultured macrophage cells. 
x Determine the effect of oral niacin th erapy on inflammatory status and gene 
expression in white blood cell populations. 
x Correlation of above parameters with va scular health, as assessed by CAVI. 
4. Study Design and Methods  
4.1 Study Population and Recruitment  
This novel pilot study will be carr ied out at the NIH Clinical Ce nter outpatient clinic 7 in 
healthy volunteers.  We will screen up to 200 su bjects, males and females, to obtain at least 
32 completed studies.  Participants will be recruited via flyer, and/or recruitment advertisement placed in the NIH Record, th e NHLBI Recruitment website, the Clinical 
Center News and by email/listserv.   
4.2 Study Procedures  
Blood Draw:   In addition to Section 8 blood tests lis ted, subjects will have 4 research blood 
draws of 10 mL each, stored at -80ºC and analy zed when sufficient samples are accumulated.   
Diet & Exercise Assessment:  Subjects will also be asked not to change their routine diet or 
exercise habits, during the study period.  A s hort physical activity assessment will be 
collected with each visit to review  any changes in physical activity.   
Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI):   CAVI is a novel indicator of arterial stiffness.  This 
measurement will be obtained to assess initial st iffness of the arteries and changes during the 
treatment phase. The test is not invasive and consists of measurement of BP in the four 
extremities while monitoring ECG by single lead and the heart sound. 
4.3 Study Visits  
There will be up to 5 visits for this study.  The return visits can be delayed up to two weeks, 
if there are scheduling problems.  The first study day will be the screening and baseline 
followed by three additional vi sits coinciding with study la ndmarks. The study will be 
discussed in detail with interest ed subjects.  Any procedures need ed to assess eligibility (i.e. 
blood laboratory tests, pregnancy test) will be performed after obtaining informed consent.  
Visit 1:   At the first visit (screening and baseline),  the subjects will be consented, and have a 
diet and exercise assessment to determine their nutritional status and a physical examination.  
The subject will have vital signs and Body Ma ss Index measured, and will undergo a history 
and physical examination.  During this visit, fa sting screening and base line laboratory tests 
and a pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential will be obtained. In 
15-H-0042: Niacin and lipoprotein composition/function

Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 7  addition, 10 mL of blood will be stored for research tests.  At the end of the first visit, if the 
subject is not yet excluded from the study, a Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) test will 
be performed. Once eligibility is confirmed, subjects will receive a 4 week supply of the 
dietary supplement of Extended Release Niacin (purchased by the NIH CC pharmacy 
through its vendors such as Rugby/Watson or Major; 250 mg, 500mg or 1000mg/capsule) 
and will be instructed to take 500 mg/day for the first seven days and then increase to 1000 
mg/day, which may be taken bid and/or with other dosing flexibility ) during the following 7 
days. 
Re-screening Visit as applicable:   Repeat laboratory values, including baseline research 
blood, may be needed to reassess el igibility within 40 days of a sc reening failure.  If a subject 
is found ineligible, during or after the first visit, the 10 mL of research blood will be 
discarded.  
Visit 2:   Two weeks after the first visit (+/- 2 week s) the subjects participating in the niacin 
supplementation portion of the study will return for their second visit.  The subject will have 
vital signs and Body Mass Index measured and undergo a brief physical examination. Fasting 
blood will be collected for laboratory and pregnanc y tests (in female subjects of child bearing 
potential) and 10 mL of blood will be stored fo r research tests.  At the end of the 2nd visit, the 
subjects will be escalated to 2000 mg/day (whi ch may be taken bid a nd/or with other dosing 
flexibility) extended release niacin for an additional 14 weeks.    
Visit 3:   The third visit will occur 16 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after starting niacin 
supplementation.  At this visit,  the subject will be given a di et and exercise assessment, a 
repeat CAVI test, and a brief physical examinati on.  A nurse will take the subject's vital signs 
and Body Mass Index and fasting blood will be co llected for laboratory testing, and 10 mL of 
blood will be stored for research. At the end of the 3rd visit, the subjects will be instructed to 
discontinue niacin supplementation. 
Visit 4:   The fourth, and final, visit will occur 4-6 weeks after stopping niacin 
supplementation. A two weeks window extension may be used to accommodate for scheduling problems.  At this visit, the subj ect will be given a fi nal diet and exercise 
assessment.  A nurse will take the subject's vital signs, Body Mass Index measured, and will 
undergo a brief physical examination and fas ting blood will be collected for laboratory 
testing, and 10 mL of blood will be stored fo r research. A repeat CAVI test will be 
performed. 
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the se ven day food record prior to the first and third 
study visits, in order to facilita te the nutritional and exercise assessment.  However, if the 
subject does not complete, or only partially  completed the seven day food record, the 
nutritional and exercise assessment will still ta ke place and it will determine any changes in 
life-style.

 8 Note: The slow increase in niac in dose is standard practice and has been found to minimize 
the incidence and severity of potential adverse events, which usually only occur in the first 
few days of niacin administration.  Should a s ubject require additional time to adapt to the 
dose schedule, they will be allowed to continue to take the current dose  for no greater than 2 
weeks beyond the scheduled dosing period and thei r return date for ne xt visits will be 
adjusted accordingly and will not be cons idered a protocol deviation or AE.

6.2 Dosing Instructions 
The assigned dosing is consistent with earlier clinical trials.  To minimize impact of the 
common side effect of flushing, subjects may be in structed to take niac in with a small snack 
prior to going to sleep.  At each study visit, subjects will be gi ven enough niacin to last them 
until their next visit plus an additional two weeks to allow for continuation of 
supplementation in the event of scheduling issues. 
6.3 Study Agent Compliance 
The subjects will be instructed to return remain ing capsules, in original containers, to NIH at 
each applicable study visit for a pill count.  Betwee n visits a member of the clinical trial team 
may contact subjects to monitor compliance and any side effects, and to provide any 
additional study information, answer ques tions, and motivate participants.   
Participants may receive a Don’t Forget! Instructions and Study Schedule  information sheet 
to help keep track of when they should be gin taking the study drug, the time and date of 
schedules appointments, and when to complete  the seven day food record, which also has 
instructions. 
6.4 Regulatory Status 
Whether an IND is needed for a clinical in vestigation evaluating a dietary supplement is 
determined by the intent of the c linical investigation.  If the c linical investigation is intended 
only to evaluate the dietary supplement’s eff ect on the structure or function of the body, an 
IND is not required. 
7. Research Labora tory Methods 
Approximately 40 mL of fasting blood samples will be collected at each visit and used to 
perform the following routine clinical laboratory tests: Electrolytes, Li pid Panel, Lipoprotein 
Profile analysis by NMR, liver function tests (AST, ALT, bilirubin), ApoA-I, ApoB, Thyroid 
Panel, uric acid, creatinine kinase, hs-CRP , HbA1C, and insulin. In addition, we may 
perform tests for leptin (res earch), adiponectin (research) and other lipid and lipoprotein 
metabolism related markers (research). In a ddition, approximately 10 ml of research blood 
will be used or stored for future testing rela ted to lipoprotein metabolis m.  Routine diagnostic 
tests will be performed in the Department of  Laboratory Medicine on the second floor of 
building 10 in the Clinical Ce nter (CC). The following resear ch tests may be done in the

contact with the physician. 
x On study onset of any of the exclusio n criteria listed above (Section 5.2) 
Routine clinical laboratory data  will be reviewed after each study visit and the study will be 
discontinued, if it is observed that niacin is associated with any significant change in liver

 14  discretion of observing physician), or sustaine d muscle aches (Grade 2, according to CTCAE 
4.03 criteria). 
11. Analysis of the Study 
The primary outcome measurements of this stud y are changes in protein or lipid composition 
of any lipoprotein fraction and changes in vascular compliance as measured by CAVI. 
11.1 Sample Size Determination  
With a sample size of n = 32 completed studies,  the study will have 80% power to detect a 
15% change in plasma HDL cholesterol leve ls between the baseline and niacin treatment 
periods, using a normal approximation to the one-s ample (paired), two-side d t-test at alpha = 
0.05.  A standard deviation of 15 mg/dL was assu med for the paired differences in plasma 
cholesterol levels between the baseline and fi nal treatment period.  Si nce up to a 30% subject 
attrition is expected, a minimum of n = 48 subjects will be recruited for the study.   
11.2 Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum,  and median) will be 
calculated for all variables.  A ll response variables will be assessed for conformance to the 
normal distribution and transformed as need ed to meet the assumptions of normal 
distribution and homogeneity betw een periods.  If necessary, non- parametric analyses will be 
performed. 
The analysis of the data will investigate the eff ects of niacin in the plasma cholesterol levels 
of the pooled genders primarily, but the effect in male and females may also be analyzed 
separately. 
Food records will be analyzed, using the Nu trition Data System for Research (NDSR) 
software developed by the Nutrition Coordi nating Center, University of Minnesota, 
Minneapolis, MN11. 
12. Human Subject Protection 
12.1 Rationale for Subject Selection 
Subjects of both genders will be considered fo r inclusion in this st udy.  There will be no 
racial, ethnic, or gender discrimination.  Cognitively impaired and institutionalized 
persons will not participate in  this study.  Criteria for excl usion or withdrawal from the 
study are based on the presence of other dise ase processes that ma y interfere with the 
interpretation of our results or  situations that may be harmfu l to the health of subjects.

Date: July 10, 2019 
Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 15  12.2 Rationale for the Exclusion of Children 
 Children under 18 years of age will not be c onsidered for inclusion in this study due to 
increased potential for liver toxicity. 
12.3 Rationale for the Exclusion of Pregnant Women 
Subjects must not be pregnant or actively seek ing pregnancy in order to  participate in this 
study. Pregnancy may introduce unpredictable  effects on lipoprotein metabolism and 
influence the results of the study. The specific eff ects of pregnancy in th is context may be the 
subject of a separate study.  Some form of  contraception must be used by subjects while 
enrolled.  Contraception use will be determined  by a questionnaire given to the subjects at 
time of enrollment. 
12.4 Inclusion of NIH Staff 
x NIH staff (employees, NIH contractors, sp ecial volunteers, guest researchers, and 
trainees) may voluntarily part icipate in this protocol. 
 
x Recruitment, enrollment and compensa tion of NIH employee subjects will be 
consistent with the Guidelines for the In clusion of Employees in NIH Intramural 
Research Studies (December 2015) (SOP 14F, Appendix A) and NIH Policy Manual 
Chapter 2300-630-3,”Leave Policy for NIH Em ployees Participating in NIH Medical 
Research Studies” (SOP 14F, Appendix B)  
x If the individual requesting to participate in  the protocol is a co-worker, the consent 
from the NIH staff member (co-worker) wi ll not be obtained by the staff member’s 
direct supervisor but by another resear ch staff member approved for obtaining 
informed consent and who is also not a co-worker.  
x Neither participation nor refusal to participat e as a subject in this protocol will have 
an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant’s employment or position at 
NIH.  
x The consenting staff member will make the NIH Information Sheet on Employee 
Research Participation available to staff members who are considering enrolling in 
research. (SOP 14F, Appendix C)  
x Staff subjects’ privacy and confidentiality  will be respected by protocol and 
consenting staff the same as for all subject s participating in research protocols. 
However, all subjects will be made aware that there are limits to these protections. 
12.5 Evaluation of Benefits  and Risks/Discomforts 
 
15-H-0042: Niacin and lipoprotein composition/function 
PI:  Marcelo Amar, M.D. 
Date: July 10, 2019 
Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 16  As of July 10, 2019, this study is now closed to new subject accrual and continues in data 
analysis only and the le vel of risk is minimal. 
Benefits: 
There are no direct benefits to the patien t, however, increasing HDL -C and decreasing LDL-
C and triglyceride le vels in the general population is thought to be beneficial 23.   
Subjects will be provided information fr om routine clinical laboratory tests. 
Risks/Benefit Analysis: Risk (45 CFR 46.406): Research involving greate r than minimal risk and no prospect of 
direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield ge neralizable knowledge about the 
condition or disord er under study.  
Study Agent:   One drawback of niacin supplementa tion is the common occurrence of side 
effects, such as flushing and itching of the skin.  These are ex perienced by most patients to 
varying degrees may result in poor adherence to niacin regimens but these side effects have 
not been shown to lead to serious medical problems. To overcome this side effect an 
extended release form of niacin will be empl oyed and extensive guidance will be given to 
each subject on the best times and forms to take the supplement to minimize these side effects. Other side effects may include myositis and changes in liver enzymes, which will be monitored at each visit.    
Blood Draw:  Subjects may feel lightheaded or di zzy after having blood drawn.  There may 
be pain at the blood draw site and a slight  risk of bruising.  To minimize this risk,  the routine 
blood-drawing protocol will be followed and pr essure will be applied to the site.   
The protocol will follow the NIH Clinical Cent er MAS policy M95-9 guidelines for limits of 
blood drawn for research purpose in the Clinic al Center.  For adults, no more than 10.5 
mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, will  be drawn for research purposes over any 8-
week period. 
Cardio-Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI):   Inflation of blood pressure cuffs may cause transient 
discomfort. Subjects with fragile skin may suffe r minor trauma (as per ABIs, related to usual 
BP measurements).  This procedure involves the use of a VaSera VS-1500N system; an FDA 
approved vascular screening system.  
12.6 Protocol Consent Processes and Documents 
Each subject will receive an oral and written explanation of the goals, procedures, and risks 
of this study. The Principal I nvestigator and those Associate Investigators who are listed on 
the cover page of the protocol with an aste risk next to their name may obtain informed 
consent from research participants.  Consent will  be obtained at the NIH Clinical Center.    
15-H-0042: Niacin and lipoprotein composition/function 
PI:  Marcelo Amar, M.D. 
Date: July 10, 2019 
Version: 14.0 (Amendment M) 
 17  The original, signed informed consent document will be placed in the medical record, and the 
subject will receive a signed c opy of the informed consent document.  A copy will also be 
placed in the shadow chart.  A member of th e protocol team will be available to answer 
questions about the stud y to be performed. 
12.6.1 Consent Processes for NIH Employees If the individual requesting to pa rticipate in the protocol is a co-worker, the consent from the 
NIH staff member (co-worker) will not be obt ained by the research coordinator or the 
employee’s direct supervisor but by another research staff member who is approved for 
obtaining informed consent, and who is also not a coworker. 
12.6.2 Consent Processes for non-English Speaker If there is an unexpected enrollment of a non- English speaking research  participant for which 
there is no translated extant IRB approved c onsent document, the principal investigator 
and/or those authorized to obtain informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent 
Process as described in MAS Policy M77-2, 45 CFR 46.117 ( b) (2). The summary that will 
be used is the English version of the extant IRB approved consent document.  
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form for up to a maximum of 5 
participants in a given language  and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of 
the frequency of the use of the Short Form.  Should we reach the threshold of 5, we will 
notify the IRB of the need for an additional use of the Short Form and that we will have that consent document translated into  the given inherent language. 
13. Conflict of Interest 
None of the investigators have any conflict of interest  to report.   
14. Adverse Event Management 
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study. Adverse events will  be attributed (unrel ated, unlikely, possibly, 
probably or definitively) to study medication and/ or disease and AEs will be graded by 
severity utilizing CTC version 4.0. A copy of the criteria can be downloaded at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/proto colDevelopment/electroni c_applications/ctc.htm . 
All adverse events occurring during the study, including those obs erved by or reported to the 
research team, will be recorded.

 18  14.1 Reports to the IRB 
The PI or designee will refer to HRPP Polic y 801 “Reporting Research Events” and HRPP 
802 “Non-compliance in Human Subject Research” to determine IRB reporting requirements 
and timelines.  
14.2 Reports to the CD 
The PI or designee will refer to NHLBI DIR guidelines to determine CD reporting 
requirements and timelines.  
15. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Safety Monitoring 
Principal Investigator:  Accrual and safety da ta will be monitored by the PI.  The protocol 
will be continuously evaluated for any unusual or  unpredicted complications with the aim of 
detecting and preventing unacceptable increase in morbidity and mortality over and above 
that anticipated from niacin. 
NHLBI IRB 
Accrual and safety data will be monitored and reviewed annually by the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB).  Prior to implemen tation of this study, the prot ocol and the proposed patient 
informed consent document will be reviewed and approved by the properly constituted IRB 
operating according to the 45 CFR 46 Code of  Federal regulations.  This committee must 
approve all amendments to the protocol or informed consent document, and conduct 
continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or follow up of subjects. 
16. Compensation 
Compensation will be provided to the subjec ts for their time and inconvenience of 
participating on this protocol based on the va lues listed below. Comp ensation of NIH staff 
participants will be consistent with the NI H Manual Chapter 2300-630-3: Leave Policy for 
NIH staff.

 21  18. APPENDIX A: NIH INFO RMATION SHEET ON STAFF 
RESEARCH PARTICIPATION (April 2016) 
As an NIH employee, contractor, Special Volu nteer, Guest Researcher , or trainee, you may 
participate in intramural research studies unles s it is prohibited by your Institute or Center 
(IC), or if you are excluded by th e criteria of the protocol in which you want to enroll. The 
inclusion of NIH staff in a part icular protocol must also be approved by the IRB. You may be 
motivated by altruism, a commitment to resear ch in your own or related fields, or want 
access to clinical trials of potential direct therapeutic be nefit. When deciding, you should 
make an informed decision about participation. Th is information sheet offers some points to 
consider for NIH staff who are consider ing research participation at NIH.  
First, similar to any individual who is consid ering research particip ation, you should seek 
adequate information about the study purpose,  what is required of you in terms of 
procedures, interventions and tim e, and the potential risks and be nefits of participation.  
For more information, see the NIH Clinical Cent er’s public website “Are Clinical Studies for 
You?” at http://www.cc.nih.gov/participate/studies.shtml .  
When you are thinking about par ticipation in a research study  that is being conducted by 
your supervisor, or others with whom you work closely in your laboratory, branch, or unit, 
you should consider some additional factors:  
A. Possible bias: Are you confident that you can  be unbiased about repo rting answers, side 
effects, or other information that could in fluence the study outcome or risk to you?  
B. Confidentiality: Has the princi pal investigator (PI) spoken a bout what information will be 
collected from you as part of the study? Ha s the PI discussed what  information will be 
available to those within, a nd outside, the study team? If a pplicable, are you comfortable 
sharing your medical history (i ncluding, for example, mental health history or STDs) and 
your social history (e.g. substan ce use) with study investigator s who may be your coworkers, 
or with the possibility of them discovering so mething about your health during the study (e.g. 
pregnancy status or a new diagnosis)? Although every effort will be made to protect your 
information and keep it private and confid ential, your information may, depending on the 
nature of the protocol, become available in medi cal records or to authorized users outside of 
the study team. Discuss any concerns with the PI.  
C. Pressure: Do you perceive any pressure or expectations from  your supervisor or 
colleagues regarding participation? Could that  pressure influence your decision or make it 
difficult for you to choose whether or not to pa rticipate? Remember that it is your choice 
whether or not to participate and that your deci sion to participate or not should not have an 
effect, either beneficial or adve rse, on your position at NIH.

 22  D. Time and Compensation: Can you take ti me off from work to complete the study 
requirements or participate so lely during non-duty hours? Ca n you receive compensation for 
your participation in this study? Will your supe rvisor give you permission to participate 
during work hours? See the NIH Policy Manual 2300-630-3 “Leave Policy for NIH 
Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies.” 
E. Consent Process: Is the person obtaini ng your consent for the study your supervisor, a 
subordinate, or co-worker? If so, is there an independent pe rson monitoring the consent 
process? If the study PI is a supervisor and intends to obtain consent from you, an 
independent person (e.g., through Bioethics or the NIMH Human Subjects Protections Unit 
[HSPU], or others as approved by the IRB) must  monitor the consent process. If the person 
obtaining consent from you is a co-worker then an independent person (e.g., through 
Bioethics or the NIMH HSPU, or others as ap proved by the IRB) may be required to monitor 
the consent process, as determined by the IRB for the specific study. 
If you are thinking of enrolling as a subject at the NIH Clin ical Center and you have any 
questions or concerns, please contact the O ffice of Human Subjects Research Protections 
(OHSRP) at 301-402-3444 and/ or the Patient Representative if  you are thinking of enrolling 
as a subject at the NIH Clinic al Center on 301-496-2626. If you ar e at a NIH site outside the 
Clinical Center then please contact local site leadership.

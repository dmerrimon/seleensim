Pharmacodynamics , Biomarker, and Pharmacogenomics  Assessments  
In addition to screening, pre -dose FEV 1 and FVC will be assessed at -45 minutes and -15 minutes prior to dosing on 
Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21. Trough FEV 1 will be assessed on Day 22 (ie, 24 hours after the Day 21 dose).  
On Day 1 and Day 21, FEV 1 will be recorded, at the following time points after the mor ning dose: immediately 
post-dose at 5 minutes (± 3 minute s), 15 minutes (±2 minutes), 30 minutes (±5 minutes), 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 
2 hours (120 minutes); and post -dose at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 23 hours15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post dose. The 
window for 1 -hour spirometry and thereafter is ±5 minutes.  
 
Spirometry Effort Start Time  is defined as the time of the end of  the first effort (Test 1) regardless of whether this is 
an acceptab le effort   instead of  “start time of first spirometry effort  ” as described in the protocol.  
 
FEV 1: FEV 1 is the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second as measured by a spirometer.  
Peak FEV 1: It is defined as the maximum FEV 1 over the period of 12 hours post -morning dose.  
Trough FEV 1: It is defined as the mean FEV 1 obtained 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post -morning 
dose of the previous day.  
Baseline FEV 1: It is defined as the average of the pre -dose FEV 1 measured at -45 minutes and -15 minutes at Day  1 
FVC: FVC is the amount of air which can be forcib ly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath 
possible.  
Baseline FVC: It is defined as the average of the pre -dose FVC measured at -45 minutes and -15 minutes at Day  1. 
Safety:  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all A dverse Events (AE s) and serious adverse events  
(SAEs)  including treatment related AEs and SAEs as well as AEs leading to discontinuation , clinical laboratory 
measurements, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, and physical examinations.

    Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, have received at least 1 dose of study medication and have at 
least 1 post -baseline PD assessment. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for the PD endpoints.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study medication. All safety 
endpoints will use the SAF unless otherwise specified.  
Per Protocol Analysis Set (PP)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, received  at least 1 dose of study medication, completed the study 
and do not have exclusionary major protocol deviations.  Major and exclusionary protocol deviations will be defined 
in this SAP and by clinical review prior to unblinding.  
PK Analysis Set (PKAS)  
This will include all subjects who are randomized, received at least 1 dose of study treatment and have at least 1 
quantifiable PK sample and do not have exclusionary major protocol deviations.  The PKAS will be used to analyze 
the PK endpoints unless otherwi se specified in the SAP.  Major and exclusionary protocol deviations will be defined 
in this SAP and by clinical review prior to unblinding.  
Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of 28 subjects per treatment arm will have 90% power to detect a differe nce in mean change from 
baseline in trough FEV 1 of 150 mL between GSP304 and GSP304 placebo assuming a 2 -sided alpha of 5% and a 
standard deviation (SD) of 170 mL. These assumptions are based on available literature from similar studies 
conducted for Spiri va® Respimat®. 
Given the overall 1:1:1:1:1 study  treatment allocation ratio, 140 subjects are required for the analysis of the primary 
endpoint. Assuming a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 155 subjects (31 subjects per treatment arm) will be 
randomized.  
This sample size is also considered to be sufficient for the relative bioavailability endpoint.  
Pharmacodynamics  Analyses  
The PD comparisons will be made between each dose of GSP304 and GSP304 placebo  as well as Spiriva and 
Placebo . 
Analysis of Primary Pharmacodynamics  Endpoint.  
Change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at 24 -hours after the last dose of treatment on Day 21 in comparison to 
GSP304 placebo. The primary endpoint measures the  change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough 
FEV 1 response at approximately 24 hours after the last dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 
minutes post -dose measurements) . This will be analyzed using a Mixed -effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) 
model to produce treatment differences for each dose of GSP 304 vs GSP304 placebo. The MMRM model will 
include  the trough FEV 1 assessment on day 1 and  pre-dose data from all visits (Days 7, 14, and 21 , which are the 
trough FEV 1 assessments on days 6, 13 and 20 ) and fixed terms for treatment, visit, baseline, center, treatment by 
visit and baseline by visit interactions. The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment 
differences for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Multiple 
imputation -based methods will be considered as a sensitivity analysis for missing dat a, with further detail provided.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the FAS and primary inference will be based on Day 21  trough values . 
A sensitivity analysis will be based on the Full Analysis Set . 
Analysis of Secondary Pharmacodynamics  Endpoints  
Analysis of secondary PD endpoints will be performed on the FAS.  
Change from baseline in peak FEV 1 within 12 hours post dose on Day 1 and Day 21: This endpoint measures the 
peak FEV 1 from the serial readings taken through 12 hours post -dose and then calculates the change from baseline. 
The change from baseline will be analyzed using MMRM in a similar way to that of the primary endpoint to 
produce treatment differences for each dose o f GSP304 versus GSP304 placebo.  
Change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at approximately 24 hours after the last 
dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post -dose measurements ) will be analyzed using 
MMRM in a similar way to that of the primary endpoint to produce treatment differences for each dose of GSP304 
versus GSP304 placebo.  
Change from baseline in time -normalized area under the curve for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours on Da y 1 and Day 
21: The endpoint measures a series of FEV 1 readings taken within 12 hours of dosing.  
The trapezoidal rule will be used to calculate AUC 0-12h and then normalized to the length of time. The change from 
Glenmark Specialty SA

 7  
    baseline will be analyzed using MMRM in a si milar way to that of the primary endpoint to produce treatment 
differences for each dose of GSP304 versus GSP304 placebo.  
All PD data will also be displayed in summaries and listings.  
Time to steady -state: This is the time period from the first dose to two consecutive similar trough FEV 1 or FVC  
measurements. The trough values  will be tabulated and plotted  by time  for each active dose and placebo.  
Time to onset of action ( of both a 12% increase and 200 mL increase in FEV 1 within 12  hours of dosing ): This is the 
time period from the first dose to first onset of at least 12  percent and 200 mL improvement in FEV1 over the  
baseline value. The trough values will be tabulated and plotted by time for each active dose  and placebo .  
Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenomics , and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using the PKAS.  
Plasma : Individual subject p lasma PK parameters will be determined from plasma concentrations using non-
compartmental methods for each subject. Actual collection times will be used for the analyses.  
Urine : Amount and fraction of dose of tiotropium excreted in urine during the collected time interval in individual 
subjects will be estimated. Nominal  colle ction times and urine volumes wi ll be used for the estimation.  
Additional parameters may be evaluated depending on the data obtained during the study. The derived PK 
parameters will be listed by treatment, subject and day and summarized by treatment and day. Wherever appropriate, 
data will be visualized by means of graphical representations. For the summaries, descriptive statistics for all 
relevant PK parameters will include: n, arithmetic mean, SD, coefficient of variation (%CV), geometric mean, 
geometric  mean %CV, median, minimum and maximum. The plasma concentrations and amount in urine of 
tiotropium will also be listed by subject , summarized by treatment, and presented  graphically as mean plots, and  
spaghetti  plots.   
Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the ln -transformed PK parameters AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS. 
The ANOVA model will include treatment as fixed effect. The results from the model will be back -transformed and 
the adj usted geometrics means for each treatment and the estimated treatment ratios for the treatment comparisons 
will be p resented together with 90% CIs.  
The ratios and corresponding 90% CIs will be expressed as a percentage.  
The following comparisons will be ma de: 
GSP304 (tiotropium bromide) Inhalation Solution, 10 μg  
GSP304 (tiotropium bromide) Inhalation Solution, 20 μg  
GSP304 (tiotropium bromide) I nhalation Solution, 40 μg  
For GSP304, dose -proportionality of tiotropium C maxSS and AUC 0-tauSS parameters will be  assessed using a power 
model (linear regression relating log -transformed C maxSS and AUC 0-tauSS to the log - transformed dose). Estimates of 
the mean slopes of log -transformed dose will be reported along with corresponding 90% CIs. Dose proportionality 
will also be assessed based on amount of tiotropium excreted in urine .  
Pharmacogenomics , and Other Biomarker Analyses  
Not applicable.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the SAF and will be presented by the study treatment. Safety data will be 
summarized descriptively. Data describing quantitative measures will be summarized as mean, SD, median and 
range (minimum and maximum). Qualitative variables will be presented as counts and percentages.  
All safety data will  also be displayed in lis tings.  
Other Analyses   
Not applicable.

    4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Summary of Study Design  
 
This is a phase 2, rand omized, parallel group, active -and placebo -controlled, 5-arm study to 
compare the PK profile of 3 blinded doses of GSP304 with open label Spiriva® Respimat®. The 
study will also evaluate the dose response PD profile of 3 blinded doses of GSP304 compared 
with blinded GSP304 placebo, using spirometry in subjects with mild to moderate COPD . 
The study will consist of a screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by a 2 -week run -in 
period, a 3 -week treatment period, and a 2 -week post treatment follow -up period.  The total 
duration of study participation will be appro ximately 9 weeks.  
A total of 1 55 male and female subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio  to 1 of 5 
treatment arms. A subject will receive 1 of the 3 double -blind doses of GSP304, or double -blind 
GSP304 placebo, or open -label Spiriva® Respimat®. 
4.2. Definition of Study Drugs  
Table 2 and Table 3 provide a description of the double -blind GSP304, double -blind GSP304 
placebo, and the open label Spiriva® Respimat® comparator to be used in the study.

4.3. Sample Size Considerations  
4.3.1.  Sample Size Justifications  
 
A sample size of 28 subjects per treatment arm will  have 90% power to detect a difference in 
mean change from baseline in trough FEV 1 of 150 mL between GSP304 and GSP304 placebo 
assuming a 2 -sided alpha of 5% and a standard deviation ( SD) of 170 mL. These assumptions ar e 
based on available literature from similar studies conducted for Spiriva® Respimat® (Caillaud  et 
al., 2007) .  Given the overall 1:1:1:1:1 study  treatment allocation ratio, 140 subjects are required 
for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Assuming a dropout rate of 10%, a total of 155 subjects 
(31 subjects per treatment arm) will be randomized.  
This sample size is also considered to be sufficient for the relative bioavailabili ty endpoint . 
 
4.3.2.  Sample Size Re -estimation  
No sample size re -estimation is planned for this study.  
4.4. Randomization  
Randomization and investigational product (IP) assignment will occur in the morning of Day 1  
after all screening procedures have been performed, run -in has bee n completed and eligibility of 
the subject for the study confirmed. Randomization numbers will be issued centrally using  
interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interact ive web response system (IWRS). Randomized 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 19  
    subjects who termi nate their study participatio n for any reason, regardless of whether study drug 
has been taken or not, will retain their randomization number.  
Subjects will be assigned in the ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 to re ceive treatments with either of double -
blind GSP304 at 1  of 3 dose levels, open -label Spiriva® Respimat®, or double -blind GSP304 
placebo based on a computer -generated randomizati on scheme that will be reviewed and 
approved by a statistician. The randomization scheme will  be stored within the IVRS/IWRS 
database until unblinding of this study is requeste d. The randomization scheme and identification 
for each subject will be included in the final clinical study report for this study.  
4.5. Clinical As sessments  
 
The following clinical assessment s will be perf ormed during the study.  
1. Vital signs: vital signs will be taken at screening ( Day -28 to -15), Day -1, Day 1 (1 hour 
pre-dose and 1 hour post -dose) , Day  2, Day 7, Day 14  (1 hour pre-dose and 1 hour post -
dose), Day 20, Day 21  (post -dose) , Day 22 ( ie 24 hours  after Day 21 dose ), and Day 35 
(±2; ie 2 weeks follow -up after last dose date).   
2. Physical Examination: physical examination will be performed at screening ( Day -28 to 
Day -15 (comprehensive physical examination) ), Day  -1 (ie, 24 hours before Day 1 dose), 
Day 7  (pre-dose) , Day 14  (pre-dose) , and Day 20  (pre-dose) . 
3. 12 Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): 12 lead ECG will be performed at screening ( Day -28 
to Day -15), Day 1  (pre-dose)  and Day 21  (pre-dose) . 
4. Laboratory Test s: hematology, biochemistry, and urine anal ysis test s will be performed at 
screening ( Day -28 to Day -15), Day 7  (pre-dose) , Day 14 (pre-dose) , Day 21  (pre-dose) , 
and Day 35 (±2; ie 2 weeks follow -up after last dose date).  Urine analysis for drugs of 
abuse and cotinine and blood alcohol tests will be performed on screening ( Day -28 to 
Day -15), Day -1, and Day 20  (pre-dose) .  Serum pregnancy testing will be performed in 
all female subjects on screening ( Day -28 to Day -15), and urine pregnancy testing will 
be performed in female subjects on  Day -1 and Day 35 (±2).   
5. Other s afety assessments consisting  of monitoring and recording all A dverse Events, 
serious adverse events (SAEs) and Concomitant Medications  will be collected throughout 
the study.  
6. Pharmacodynamics:  The spirometry test will be performed at screening ( Day -28 to Day -
15), Day 1  (pre-dose -45 mins and -15 mins) ,   Day 7  (pre-dose -45 mins and -15 mins) , 
Day 14  (pre-dose -45 mins and -15 mins) , Day 21  (pre-dose -45 mins and -15 mins) , and 
Day 22  (ie 24 hours after Day 21 dose) . Pre-dose FEV 1 and FVC will be assessed   at -45 
minutes and -15 minutes prior to dosing  on Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21 . Trough 
FEV 1 will be assessed on Day 22 ( ie 24 hours after Day 21 dose). On Day 1 and Day 21, 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 20  
    FEV 1 will be recorded, at the following time points  after the morning dose: immediately 
post-dose at 5 minutes (± 3 minute s), 15 minutes (±2 minutes), 30 minutes (±5 minutes), 
60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 2 hours (120 minutes); and post -dose at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 2 3 
hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes pos t-dose. All post -dose timings are relative to 
the end of dosing ( ie, end of nebulization of GSP304/GSP304 placebo or after the second 
actuation of Spiriva®Respimat®). The window for 1 -hour spirometry and thereafter is ±5 
minutes.   
7. Pharmacokinetic P lasma a nd Urine Concentrations: Blood samples (approximately 6 mL) 
will be collected in dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) coated 
vacutainers on Day 1 and Day 21 according to the bel ow schedule: Pre -dose (0 hour), and 
2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 minutes post -dose, as wel l as 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20 
and 24 hours post -dose. All post -dose timings are relative to the end of dosing ( ie, end of 
nebulization of GSP304/GSP304 placebo o r after the second actuation of 
Spiriva®Respimat®).  The pre -dose sample on Day 1 should be colle cted within 30 
minutes prior to dosing while on Days 7, 14, and 21 the pre -dose sample should be 
colle cted within 10 minutes prior to the morning dose.  
On Day 1 and Day 21, samples will be collected within the following  collection 
windows : 
 For the 2 minute sample, within a window of ±30 seconds  
 For the 4, 6, 10, 15, and 30 minute samples, within a window of ± 1 minute  
 For the 45, 60, 75, 90 minute, and 2.0 hour samples, within a window of ± 2 minutes  
 For the 4, 6, 8, 12,  16, 20 and 24 hour samples, within a window of ± 5 minutes.  
In addition, urine will be collected into pre -weighed containers at p re-dose (within 1 hour 
prior to dosing), and at the following intervals post -dose from 0 -6, 6-12, and 12 -24 hours 
on Day 1 and  Day 21.  
Collection times and the accurate volume of urine will be noted. In each urine container, 
approximately 5 mL of 1M citric acid must be added prior to start of collec tion. Plasma 
and urine concentrations of tiotropium will be quantified by a valid ated liquid 
chromatography -mass spectrometry method .  
Plasma: Plasma PK parameters will be determined from plasma concentrations using 
non-compartmental methods for each subject. Actual collection times will be used for the 
analyses.  
Urine: Amount and fract ion of dose of tiotropium excreted in urine during the collected 
time interval in individual subjects will be estimated. Nominal  collection times and urine 
volumes will be used for the estimation .

Subjects or data may be excluded from the PKAS at the discretion of the PK Scientist upon 
consultatio n with the sponsor. Any data excluded will be discussed in the CSR. Any excluded 
subject will have his or her concentration and PK parameter data (if available) listed only. 
Subjects who receive placebo will not be part of the PKAS. The PKAS will be used f or all tables 
and graphical summaries of the PK data  
6.6.  Baseline Definition   
The Baseline value will be defined as the Visit 3 ( Day 1 ) measurement.  If this measurement is 
not available, the Visit 1 (D -28 to D -15) measurement will be used as the baseline value.  Table 
4 below contain s a list of definition s of PD parameters and baseline of parameters covered in this 
SAP.

6.7. Derived and Transformed Data  
6.7.1.  Age  
Age is the subject ’s age in complete years – calculated based on the informed consent date  and 
subject ’s date of birth .  
If the month and day of informed consent is on or af ter the month and day of birth:   
           Age = year of informed consent – year of birth  
If the month and day of informed consent is before the month and day of birth:  
            Age = year of informed consent – year of birth – 1 
6.7.2.  Study Day  
If the date of interest occurs on or after the randomization date:  
Study day = date of interest – randomization date + 1  
If the date of interest occurs before the randomization date:  
 Study day = dat e of interest – randomization date  
There is no study day 0.  
6.7.3.  Change from Baseline  
 
Change from baseline will be calculated by subtracting the baseline  measurement from the post 
baseline measurement.   
Change from baseline = post baseline measurement – baseline measurement.  
6.7.4.  Visit s 
Table 5 contains a list of visit s in the study period . Data will be analyzed based on the nominal 
visit/time.

6.7.5.  Unscheduled Assessments  
Unscheduled  assessments (laboratory data, ECG or vital signs associated with non -protocol 
clinical visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing adverse events) will be 
included in listings, but not in  summaries. If more than one assessment is available for a given 
visit, the first or most valid observation will be used in summaries presented in listings and other 
assessments will be classed as unscheduled measurement.  
6.7.6.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters    
Derivation of PK parameters will be the responsibility of Early Phase, Quantitative Clinical 
Development (QCD), PAREXEL International  and will be conducted either with Phoenix 
WinNonlin® Professional v. 6.3 (or higher) or SAS® v.9.3 (or highe r).  The PK parameters  in 
Table 6 will be determined for  Tiotropium in plasma after administration of the first dose:

6.7.6.1.  Handling of Values Below the Limit of Quantification  
All plasma/urine concentrations below the  lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) or missing data 
will be labeled as below the limit of quantification (BLQ) or missing, respectively, in the 
concentration data listings.  
Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for the generation of plasma PK Parame ters 
and for plotting of individual plasma PK concentration data  
BLQ values will be imputed in the PK concentration dataset used for the derivation of PK 
parameters. The following rules will be applied:  
 BLQs at the beginning of a subject profile (ie before  the first incidence of a 
measurable concentration on the first day of dosing) will be assigned to zero;  
 BLQs at the end of a subject profile (ie after the last incidence of a measurable 
concentration on last day of dosing) will be set to missing;  
 Single o r consecutive BLQs which fall between measurable concentrations will be set 
to missing.  
 Quantifiable concentrations falling between two BLQ values might be set to missing 
if considered anomalous by the PK Scientist after consultation with the sponsor.  
For linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be included in the plot  while missing values will 
be ignored . For log -linear plots, zero concentration value(s) will be assigned a ½ LLOQ value  
with the exception of the pre -dose sample collected on Day 1  while missing concentrations at the 
end of the profile will be ignored .

Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 29  
    Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for summarizing plasma PK concentration 
data  
BLQ values will be imputed for mean concentration -time plots and tabular summaries according 
to the following rules:  
 All BLQ values will be set to zero, except when an individual BLQ falls between two 
measurable values  or one or more BLQs fall at the end of a subject profile , in which  
case  they will be set to missing;  
 Mean values will be reported  only if calculated on a minimum of 3 quantifiable 
concentrations. The number of subjects contributing to the calculation of the mean 
will be specified in a footnote to the mean plots (both in linear and semi -log scales) if 
lower than the t otal amount of s amples available per time point;  
A high proportion of BLQ values may affect derivation of SD; if more than 30% of values at a 
time-point are imputed, then SD will not be displayed.  
Tabular summaries for concentration -time data will report N (number of subj ects who received 
treatment), n (number of subjects with non -missing values) and, if applicable, number imputed 
(number of subjects with imputed values (ie, BLQ assigned zero concentration).  
Considerations in the handling of BLQ data for summarizing urine PK concentration data  
 For instances in which the subject did not void during the specified interval and ‘NS’ 
is present in the listing, the concentration value will be set to missing.   
Considerations in the handling of missing data for the generation of u rine PK Parameters  
 For instances in which the subject did not void during the specified interval the 
concentration will be set to zero to allow calculation of urine PK parameters . 
6.7.6.2.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters Calculation Methods  
PK parameters will be calcula ted by non -compartmental analysis methods from the 
concentr ation -time data following these guidelines:  
 Actual sampling times relative to dosing rather than nominal times will be used in the 
calculation of all derived PK parameters;  
 There will be no imputat ion of missing data;  
 Any subjects with missing concentration data will be included in the PK analysis set 
provided that at least C maxSS  and/or AUC 0-tauSS can be reliably calculated . A decision 
will be taken on a case by case basis by the PK Scientist afte r consultation with the 
sponsor ; 
 Cmax and C maxSS  will be obtained directly from the concentration -time data ; 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 30  
     tmax is the time at which  Cmax or C maxSS  is observed ; 
 λZ will be estim ated at terminal phase by linear regression after log -transformation of 
the concentrations : 
o Only those data points that are judged to describe the terminal log -linear 
decline will be used in the regression  
o A minimum number of three data points in the terminal phase will be used in 
calculation λz with the line of regression starting at any post -Cmax data point  
(Cmax should not be part of the regression slope).  The adjusted correlation 
coefficient (R2 adjusted) in general should be greater than 0.80.  
o The interval used to determine λz should be eq ual or greater than 1.5-fold the 
estimated half -life or otherwise flagged and used at the PK scientist’s best 
knowledge and judgment. The corresponding estimated t1/2 will need to be 
flagged or excluded from statistical analysis accordingly.  
 t1/2 will be calculated as ln2/λ Z; 
 CavSS will be calculated as AUC 0-tauSS/tau; 
 AUC 0-tau and AUC 0-tauSS will be calculated using the linear up/linear down method;  
 CminSS will be obtained directly from the concentration -time data. In the event of a 
minimum concentration during the dosing interval at steady state (C minSS) not 
coinciding with the pre -dose concentration at steady state (C trough on day 21 ), both 
parameters will be reported;  
 Rac(AUC) will be calculated as AUC 0-tauSS/AUC 0-tau;  
 Rac(Cmax) will be calculated as C maxSS /Cmax; 
 Aetau is the c umulative amount excreted over the dosing interval and will be 
calculated as the sum of the products of concentration and urine volume over the 
appropriate collection intervals.  For the calculation of urine PK parameters the 
proto col time intervals should be used. If a subject urinates into the toilet or a urine 
sample is lost any other way, or if no urine volume has been recorded for a sampling 
interval, the cumulative amount excreted starting with this interval cannot be 
calculat ed. If, however, a subject is unable to urinate, no amount excreted has been 
lost and the cumulative amount can continue to be calculated past that collection 
interval. For the affected time interval, the partial amount will be zero ; 
 Fe% is the fraction of  unchanged drug in urine expressed as a percentage and will be 
calculated as Fe%=(A etau/Dose)*100.   
 
If tlast (last time point with measurable concentration) is before 24 hour post -dose in more than

    50% of treated subjects s at any particular dose of GSP 304 or Spiriva® Respimat®, AUC last (area 
under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to last time point with measurable 
concentration) may be estimated and compared between different doses of GSP 304 and Spiriva® 
Respimat® by ANOVA.  
 
Any inconsistency between plasma and urine PK would be will be further investigated and might 
be flagged and/or excluded from the analysis at the discretion of the PK Scientist after 
consultation with the sponsor . 
An exploratory PK/ glomerular filtration rate (GFR) analysis of GSP304 in urine and plasma 
may be performed if deemed appropriate following review of the summary PK and GFR data. 
The decision to perform this analysis will be made by the Sponsor upon review of the tables, 
figures and listings produced at the end of the study. If the decision is made not to proceed with 
the PK/ GFR analysis, this section of the SAP will not be applicable and the outputs described 
herein will not be presented.  
6.7.7.  Pharmacodynamics Parameter Calculat ion: Time -normalized Area under the 
Curve (AUC) for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours  
 
Time -normalized Area under the Curve (AUC) for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours  is defined as 
the area between baseline FEV 1 and the FEV 1 curve from 0 to 12 hours divided by 12 hours.   
12 hour serial spirometry will be performed at Day 1 and Day 21  of each treatment period: 
spirometry will be performed immediately  at 5 minutes (± 3 minute s), 15 minutes (±2 minutes), 
30 minutes (±5 minutes),  60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 2 hours (120 minutes); and post -dose at 4, 
6, 8, 10, 12, 23 hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes.  
 
AUC is calculated from zero time to 12 hours (AUC 0-12), using the trapezoidal method, divided 
by 12 hours to give the   AUC 0-12/12h values in litres.   Non-missing FEV 1 values at the following 
time points are required in order to calculate the normalised AUC 0-12/12h: pre-dose; at least one 
value between 2 hours and 6 hours post -dose (inclusive); and at least one value after 6 hou rs 
post-dose. Otherwise the normalised AUC 0-12/12h will be missing.    
 
AUC 0-12/12h is calculated as follows:  
AUC 0−12/12ℎ= 1
𝑡11−𝑡0∑(𝑡𝑖−𝑡𝑖−1)(𝑑𝑖+𝑑𝑖−1)
211
𝑖=1 
 
Where d i is the spirometry value (FEV 1) obtained at time t i; ti is the time (in hours) for which d i 
is measured: t 0 = 0, t 1 = 0.08 , t2 = 0.25, t3 = 0.5 , t4 = 1, t5 = 1.5, t6 = 2, t7 = 4, t 8 = 6, t 9 = 8, t 10 = 10   
and t 11 = 12. d0 is the mean of the two pre -dose values at Day 1 or Day 21 .

    6.8. Handling of Missing Data  
6.8.1.  Missing Pharmacodynamics Endpoints  
No explicit imputation for missing pharmacodynamics endpoints wil l be performed for this 
study.  If either the baseline or the post -baseline result is missin g, the change from baseline is set 
to missing.  
Section 9.6.2  describes the sensitivity analyses to be performed for the primary endpoint in 
handling  missing data.   
6.8.2.  Missing Start and Stop Dates for Prior and Concomitant Medication  
For the purpose of inclusion in prior and/or conco mitant medication tables, incomplete 
medication start and stop dates will be imputed as follows:  
 If year and month are present and day is missing, then set day to first day of month 
for start date, and set day to last day of month for end date  
 If year and day are present and month is missing, then set month to January for start 
date, and set month to December for end date  
 If year is present and month and day are missing, then set month and day to January 1 
for start date, and set month and day to December 31 for end date  
 Completely missing date will not be imputed  
The partial dates will be provided as such in the subject data listings (with the imputed dates).  
When imputing a start date, ensure that the new imputed date is sensible ie is prior to the end 
date of prior and concomitant medication s. 
 
6.8.3.  Missing Start and Stop Dates for Adverse Events  
Due diligence will be done to obtain accurate AE information. If all planned methods to obtain 
accurate AE information have failed, missing and partial AE onset and end dates will be 
imputed. Imputed dates will be flagged in the in dividual supportive subject listings. Unless 
otherwise specified, the following conventions will be used:  
Missing and Partial AE onset dates  
 If onset date is completely missing, then onset date is set to date of first dose  
 If onset year is present and  
o month and day are missing:

 Subjects who had their blinded randomization code broken.  
 Subjects with overall treatment compliance < 80% or >12 0%. 
 Subjects who used prohibited medications (prior and/or concomitant) that may have 
significant influence on efficacy.  
 Subjects who did not satisfy the inclusion/exclusion that may have significant 
influence on efficacy.  
 Subject s not treated with the treatment assigned a t randomization, but wrongly treated 
in another treatment group . 
A summary of protocol  deviation s, major protocol deviations  and exclusionary major protocol 
deviations  will be produced by treatment arm as well as by type of deviation will be provided. In

demographic data will be listed by treatment and subject.  
7.6. Listing of Subject  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
Subjects who failed any of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be listed along with the 
reason. Any subject withdrawal during the stud y, along with the reason for withdrawal, will be 
documented in listings.   
Failed inclusion/exclusion criteria and withdrawal data will be listed by treatment and subject.   
7.7. Medical History and Medical Conditions Present at Entry  
Medical and surgical history, treatment history, current medical conditions and smoking status 
will be recorded at the Screening visit. Medical history  will be coded by system organ class

(MedDRA™) Version 18.0 or later . Medical history data will be listed by treatment and subject.  
 
7.8. Prior and Concomitant and Rescue Medication  
Any medication (including over -the-counter medications) or therapy administered to the subject 
during the study ( other  than the study drug /treatment, starting at the date of informed consent )    
is considered a concomitant medication. All concomitant medications must be recorded in the 
EDC system.  
Rescue Medication(s)  
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 38  
    Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be permitted throughout the study as rescue medication  and will 
be dispensed to the subjects at Visit 2 or at the start of washout (if the subject requires washout) 
and at subse quent scheduled visits as required, for self -administration as needed, at home . 
Subjects will be trained to abstain from using albuterol/salbutamol MDI, 6 hours prior to start 
ofeach visit. If this is not possible, the visit will need to be rescheduled. An y rescue 
medication(s ) taken will be recorded in the subject diary and appropriate eCRFs.  A summar y 
showing the number of subjects  who used rescue mediation at any time post randomization  
(based on the information reported in the subject diary)  and a descr iptive summary of the amount 
of rescue medication used (based on the information reported in the subject diary) will be 
provided by treatment arm, as change as from baseline in daily and weekly averages.  A by -
subject listing of all rescue  medication used, as reported on the patient diary,  will also be 
provided.  
All concomitant medication will be coded using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
(WHO -DD) 1 June 2009.  
The following information must be recorded in the EDC system for each concomitant 
medic ation: preferred name or trade name , route of administration, start date, stop date, dose 
level, total daily dose, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a concomitant 
medication must be recorded in the EDC system.  
Medications will be assi gned to a time period (prior and/or concomitant) as follows:  
 If both the start and stop date exist and are before the first dose date of study drug, the 
medication will be counted as prior.  
 If the start  date is on or after the first dose date of study drug , the medication will be

 If the start date and stop date is on the first dose date of study drug, the medication 
will be counted as prior.  
 If the start date is before the first dose date of study drug and the stop date is after the  
first dose date of study drug or the medication is continuing, the medication will be 
counted as prior and concomitant.   
 If the start date is missing and the stop date is before the first dose of study drug, the 
medication will be counted as prior.  
 If the  start date is missing and the stop date is after the first dose of study drug or the 
medication is continuing, the medication will be counted as concomitant.  
 If the start and stop dates are missing, the medication will be counted as concomitant.  
Summaries  showing number of subjects and percentage taking each medication will be provided 
for each preferred medication term by treatment arm.  This will be done separately for prior and

    for concomitant medications.  A by -subject listing of all prior and concomita nt medication data 
will also be provided.  
7.9. Total Duration of Therapy, Average Daily Dose, Maximum Daily 
Dose, Final Daily Dose of Study Medication, and Compliance  
 
The number of subjects exposed to each study treatment will be summarized.  
The number of day s on treatment and the number of days on study ( screening  through to end of 
study/follow -up) will be summarized by study treatment.  
Treatment compliance will be calculated (the total number of doses actually taken / total number 
of doses expected*100). Fo r subjects who have completed the study:  
 Compliance Criteria  
Study Period  Duration  Scheduled Doses  Not less than 
80% (doses)  Not more than 120% (doses)  
Randomized Treatment  21 Days  21 17  25 
For subjects who are early terminated, treatment compliance will be determined from their 
duration in the study, up to the time they are considered early terminated. Subjects taking fewer 
than 80% or more than 120% of the required doses will be considered non-compliant with 
dosing.  
In addition, treatment compliance will be classified into four categories (<80%, ≥80% - ≤100%, 
>100% - <120%, ≥120%). Treatment compliance will be summarized by category and study 
treatment.

    8.3. Statement of the Null and Alternative Hypotheses  
No formal hypothesis testing will be conducted for the  primary pharmacokinetic endpoints.  
8.4. Analysis of the Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
The primary endpoint , AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS , will be analyzed using an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA)  model.  An ANOVA will  be performed on the ln -transformed   AUC 0-tauSS, and C maxSS . 
The ANOVA model will include treatment as fixed  effect. The results from the model will be 
back -transformed and the adjusted geometric means for each treatment and the estimated 
treatment ratios for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 90% CIs. The 
ratios and corresponding 90% CIs will be expressed as a percentage. The foll owing comparisons 
will be made:  
 GSP304 10 μg vs Spiriva® Respimat® 
 GSP304 20 μg vs Spiriva® Respimat® 
 GSP304 40 μg vs  Spiriva® Respimat®

The back -transformed and adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment 
differences for the treatment comparisons will be presented together with 9 0% confidence 
intervals  for the treatment comparisons. The adjusted means and estimated treatment differences 
for the treatment comparisons will also be plotted, with corresponding 9 0% confidence intervals . 
8.5. Expl oratory Analysis   
 
Dose -proportionality  
Dose -proportionality of t iotropium C maxSS  and AUC 0-tauSS parameters will be assessed using  an 
ln-transformed power model:  
log 𝑒 Yj =  α+ β log 𝑒dose j +εj, 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 43  
    where  Yj  = CmaxSS or AUC 0-tauSS   at j th dose level. If β=0, then it implies that the response is 
independent from the dose and when β=1, dose -proportionality can be declared .  
 
A mixed effect model can be used to fit the Power Model. Estimates of the mean slopes of log -
transformed dose will be reported along with corresponding 90% CIs. If the  90% confidence 
interval for β is entirely contained within the a priori  equivalence  region, then dose 
proportionality is declared. If not, then dose non -proportionality is declared.   Dose 
proportionality will be declared if the estimate of slope lies between 0.5 - 2. Dose proportionality 
will also be assessed based on amount of tiotropium excr eted in urine.  Finally, dose normalized 
AUC 0-tauSS and C maxSS  will also be evaluated across doses. Dose proportionality will be 
confirmed if the dose normalized parameters remain substantially constant in the range of 
explored doses.

9.1. Overview of Pharmacodynamics Analyses  
The primary analysis of the primary pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performed on both the 
FAS (primary) and the PP (supportive) population. The secondary analysis of the primary 
pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performed on the FAS. The analysis of the secondary 
pharmacodynamic s endpoint will be performe d on the FAS.  
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough FEV 1 
response at approximately 24 hours after the last dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 
hours 45 minutes post -dose measurements), in comparison w ith GSP304 placebo.

    9.2. General Considerations  
All tests will be 2 -sided and at 5% level of significance unless otherwise stated.  
In addition to the analyses described below, all endpoints  will be summarized over time, by 
treatment , as appropriate.  
All endpoints will also  be listed by treatment and subject.  The interpretation of results from 
statistical tests will be based on the FAS. The PP  population  will be used to assess the robustness 
of the results from the statistical tests based on the FAS.  Unless otherwise stated,  ‘treatment’ 
refers to treatment group as randomized, rather than based on the actual treatment received.   
9.3. Testing Statistical Assumptions Including Comparability at Baseline  
All baseline data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. No formal 
hypothesis testing w ill be conducted. Differences may occur by chance.  If there are any 
clinically meaningful differences identified, analyses may be adjusted to account for these 
imbalances through inclusion of additional covariates in the statistical models.  
The PD endpoin ts (FEV 1, FVC) are assumed to be normally distributed and will be analyzed 
under this assumption.  The assumptions of normality and constant variance will be verified 
using diagnostic plots (normal quantile plots and scatter plots of residuals by treatment  group).  
If assumptions are violated , either an appropriate transformation will be used or data will be 
analyzed using non -parametric methods. The methods use will be documented in the clinical 
study report.  
9.4. Statement of the Null and Alternate Hypotheses  
 
A significance test will be made for the primary pharmacodynamics endpoint in order to assess 
for superiority of GSP304 versus GSP3 04 placebo. Demonstration of superiority for this 
treatment comparison will be based on a hypothesis testing approach, whereby the null 
hypothesis is that there is no difference between treatment groups and the alternative hypothesis 
is that there is a dif ference between the treatment groups.  
A 2-sided 5% risk associated with incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (significance level) is 
considered acceptable for this study.  
9.5. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity  
As this is a phase 2 study, no adjustments for multiplicity are planned. The nominal p -values of 
all hypothesis tests will not be adjusted for multiplicity.

    9.6. Analysis of the Primary Pharmacodynamics Endpoint  
9.6.1.  Primary Pharmacodynamics  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint , change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough FEV 1 
response at approximately 24 hours after the last dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 
hours 45 minutes post -dose measurements)  will be analyzed using a mixed -effect repeated 
measures ( MMRM ) model . This model will assume that any missing data is Missing at Random 
(MAR). The model will include trough data from all visits (Days 1, 6, 13, 20 and Day 21) ,and 
fixed terms for treatment, visit, center, baseline, treatment by visit and baseline by visit 
interactions.   If an interaction  term is significant, further ad -hoc analysis may be conducted. 
Subject will be included as a random term to account for the correlation between repeated 
measurements within a subject, and unstructured covariance structure will be used.   If the model 
fails to converge, alternative structures ( VC, AR1 , TOEP1, and CS ) or removing terms will be 
investigated .  The covariance structure that provides the best fit (as determined by the smallest 
AIC value) will be used.   
The statements of a SAS® PROC MIXED analysis would be:  
PROC MIXED   data= dataset method= REML ; 
    CLASS subject treatment center visit ;  
    MODEL change  = treatment center visit baseline treatment*visit   baseline*visit  /s ddfm =kr;  
    REPEATED visit/subject=subject type=UN;  
    LSMEANS treatment*visit /at mean cl  diff e;   
RUN;  
 
The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment 
comparisons will be presented together with 95% confidence intervals , along with p -values for 
the treatment comparisons . The adjusted means and estimated treatm ent differences for the 
treatment comparisons  (each GSP304 vs placebo , total GSP304 vs placebo, and  Spiriva vs 
placebo)  will also be plotted, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
9.6.2.  Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary  Pharmacodynamics  Results  
Sensitivity analyses  will be performed on the FAS only. Subjects with at least one post -baseline 
assessment  will be used  in modeling.  
9.6.2.1.  Pattern -Mixture Model  
 
The Mixed -effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) model will be fitted when some of the 
response values are missing by assuming that they are missing at random (MAR). This will be 
done computationally using Restricted Maximum -Likelihood (REML). However, this 
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 48  
    assumption is unverifiable. It is necessary to perform se nsitivity analyses under different 
assumptions regarding missing data. When the MAR assumptions do not hold, the data are 
assumed to be Missing Not At Random (MNAR). One possible way forward is to model a 
separate distribution for each pattern of missingne ss. A sensitivity analysis for missing data will 
be conducted based on multiple imputation -based methods with a form of pattern -mixture model 
(PMM).  
PMMs will be fitted  based on  multiple imputations  method . In the multiple imputation approach, 
a model will be fitted to the incomplete data and  a pseudo -independent sample drawn from the 
posterior distribution of parameters. Each member of the sample leads to a separate imputed 
dataset, in which the missing values will be  replaced by values drawn randomly from their 
conditional distribution. This distribution is based on the observed data and the covariates for 
that subject using the imputation model and the sampled parameter values. Each dataset is then 
analyzed as if these were real data, leading to a ser ies of estimates for a parameter. These are 
then combined to supply an overall estimate and standard error based on Rubin’s classic rules 
(Rubin, 1987) for combining across imputations.  
The primary endpoint will also be analyzed using a Jump to Reference ( J2R) approach , that is, 
all the patterns have the same profile up to withdrawal (that estimated in the parameter 
estimation model), but after withdrawal the profile jumps to the estimated profile for the 
reference arm. Thisapproach is a multiple imputation  technique and works  under the assumption 
that data is missing not at random (MNAR).    
The J2R approach involves three distinct steps:  
1. The missing data are filled in m times  to generate m complete data sets  (m will be 
selected to provide sufficiently stab le and reproducible results) . 
 In J2R method, all the patterns have the same profile up to withdrawal (that 
estimated in the parameter estimation model), but after withdrawal the profile 
jumps to the estimated profile for the reference arm.  A new model is simulated 
from the posterior predictive distribution of the fitted model and missing values of 
the variable are imputed based on the new model.       
 The MNAR statement together with a MONOTON statement in PROC MI will be 
used. The variables  that have missing values are imputed seq uentially in each 
imputation. If the missing pattern is arbitrary, first the MCMC method will be 
used to partially impute data in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern.  
2. The missing data are filled in m times to generate m complete data sets.  The m complete 
data sets are analyzed by using a procedure.  
 ANCOVA analysis for change from baseline in trough FEV 1 is performed using 
PROC MIXED with LSMEANS statement.  
3. Results of the ANCOVA analysis on m imputed data sets can be combined to derive an 
overall result. PROC MIANALYZE in SAS will be used to combine the results.  
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 49  
    The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the treatment 
comparisons will be presented together with 95% con fidence intervals for the differences and p -
values for th e treatment comparisons.  
9.6.2.2.  Tipping Point  (Region)  Approach  
The primary endpoint will  also be analyzed using a special application of multiple imputation of 
missing values known as the tipping point me thod. The tipping point method assesses the 
possibility that subjects on active drug with missing values have worse outcomes than subjects 
on placebo. This sensitivity analysis involves multiple imputations and is also under the MNAR 
assumption in which one search es for a tipping point  (region)  that reverses the study conclusion.  
This approach is iterative in nature which tests how severe departures from MAR must be in 
order to overturn conclusions from the primary analysis.  If these departures from MAR i n order 
to change the results from statistically significance (p<=0.05) to statistically insignificance 
(p>0.05) are deemed to be implausible, the results will be said to be robust to the departure from 
MAR assumption.   
The tipping point approach will be applied to the analysis of the primary endpoint  using the 
MMRM.  In the MMRM , the dependent variable is change from baseline while the covariates are 
treatment, site, baseline value and study day as the within -subject effect.  
The imputation will be done on the missing cases of change from baseline values for GSP304  
treatment  and Spiriva . Under the MNAR assumption, the imputed values for observations in the 
active treatment group  and Spiriva , as well as placebo , will be adjusted dir ectly using a shift 
parameter.  Missing values are imputed under the assumption that the distribution of the missing 
observations has a lower expected value than  that of the observed only by a shift parameter 
value. The maximum shift parameter  is set at 80 mL for being  about 50% of treatment efficacy 
when assuming that a difference in mean change from baseline at the end of treatment in trough 
FEV 1 between GSP304 and GSP304 placebo is 150  mL. The shift parameter will take on the 
values from -80 mL  to 0 with increment of 20 mL as it is assumed that the tipping point that will 
reverse the study conclusion is those values.  If the tipping point is found to be between two 
increments on the given interval,  a subsequent tipping point procedure will be performed using 
an interval on the neighborhood of the perceived tipping point finer increments for the shift 
parameter. If no tipping po int is found, the shift parameter will be made more stringent  and the 
process repeated.   
Implementing the tipping point approach includes  the following steps with the first three steps 
being the standard multiple imputation (MI) steps using SAS:  
a) The missing data are filled in m times to generate m complete data sets using PROC  MI.  
b) The m complete data sets are analyzed using PROC MIXED .  
c) The results from the m complete data sets are combined for the inference using PROC 
MIANALYZE.    
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 50  
    d) Repeat the steps (a) to generate multiple imputed data sets with a specified shift 
parameter that adjusts the imputed values for observations in the  active treatment and  
placebo group s. 
e) Repeat the step (b) for the imputed data sets with shift parameter applied.  
f) Repeat the step (c) to obtain the p -value to see if the p -value is still <=0.05.  
g) If nee ded, r epeat the  steps (d)-(f) with more stringent shift parameter applied until the p -
value >0.05.  
The iteration for each value of the shift parameter will be summarized in a table where the 
estimated treatment differences for the treatment comparisons wil l be presented together with 
95% confidence intervals for the differences and p -values for the treatment comparisons.  
9.6.3.  Exploratory Analysis     
 
If appropriate, a dose response model will be fitted to the primary endpoint to estimate the dose 
response relati onship.  Dose response models to be evaluated will include E max (3-parameter) and 
linear models.  
 
The E max model will be fitted as follows:  
 
 Endpoint = E0+ Emax Dose
Dose +ED50  +  𝜀 
 
where  E0  = Response at dose 0, E max  = Maximum effect, ED50 = Dose at which 50% of the 
maximum effect is reached and  𝜀  = Residual error.  
 
The linear model will be fitted as follows:  
Endpoint = E0+  βDose +  𝜀 
 
where E 0 = Response at Dose 0, β  = slope and   𝜀  = Residual error  
 
Should thes e models not fit the data appropriately other models may be explored. For all of the 
models, baseline will be included as a covariate at E 0. However, baseline may be fitted at ED50 
or E max  for the E max model depending on how the model fits the data best. Other covariates will 
be explored. Depending upon the adequacy of model fitting some parameters may need to be 
parameterized on the log scale (e.g. variance, ED50, E max). The most appropriate model will be 
assessed visually, by evaluating the AIC and by lo oking at the residuals. To build confidence in 
the chosen model, the null model :  
Endpoint = E0

Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 51  
    will also be fitted to the data and the p -value from a likelihood ratio test will be computed; i.e. 
the change in deviance ( -2 Log Likelihood) between the chos en model and the null model will be 
compared to a chi -squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the 
number of parameters in the two models.  
 
Dose response model parameter estimates, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals , 
from the final dose response model will be presented .   
9.7. Analysis of the Secondary Pharmacodynamics Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Change from baseline in peak FEV 1 within 12 hours post -dose on Day 1 and 21  
 Change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at 
approximately 24 hours after the last dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 
hours 45 minutes post -dose measurements)  
 Change from baseline in time -normalized area under the curve for FEV 1 measured 
over 12 hours on Day 1 and 21  
 Time to onset of response, d efined as at least 12% and 200 mL increase  in FEV 1

The change from baseline for the secondary pharmacodynamics  endpoint  of change from 
baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in trough F VC response at approximately 24 hours after the 
last dose (average of 23  hours 15 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post -dose m easurements)  will 
be analysed using the same model as described above for the anlaysis of the primary endpoint.  
The change from baseline for the secondary pharmacodynamics endpoint s of;  Change from 
baseline in peak FEV 1 within 12 hours post -dose on Day 1  and 21  and c hange from baseline in 
time-normalized area under the curve for FEV 1 measured over 12 hours on Day 1 and 21  will be 
analyzed using a mixed -effect repeated measures (MMRM) model. This model will assume that 
any missing data is Missing at Random  (MAR). The model will include data from Day 1 and 
Day 21  and fixed terms for treatment, visit, center, baseline, treatment by visit and baseline by 
visit interactions.   If an interaction term is significant, further ad -hoc analysis may be conducted. 
Subject will be included as a random term to account for the correlation between repeated 
measurements within a subject, and unstructured covariance structure will be used.   If the model 
fails to converge, alternative structures (CS) or removing terms will be investigated.  The 
covariance structure that provides the best fit (as determined by the smallest AIC value) will be 
used.  The adjusted means for each treatment and the estimated treatment differences for the

values for the treatment comparisons. The adjusted means and estimated treatment differences 
for the treatment comparisons  (each GSP304 vs placebo, total GSP304 vs placebo, and Spiriva 
vs placebo)  will also be plotted, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  
For the secondary endpoint of time to onset of response of both a 12% and 200 mL increase from 
baseline  in FEV 1, the unadjusted mean change from baseline and unadjusted percent mean 
change from baseline will be summarized for day 1.  The unadjusted means will also be plotted 
over time, for day 1. For the secondary endpoints of time to steady state in FEV 1 and FVC, the 
adjusted means from the MMRM model discussed above will be summarized by day (Days 1, 6, 
13, 20 and 21) and also plotted over time.

    10.2. Adverse Event Preferred Term and Body/Organ System Summary 
Tables  
10.2.1.  Summaries of Adverse Event for Al l Subject s 
 
For each AE, the following information is to be recorded; the start date, the stop dat e (or whether 
the AE is ongoing at study completion/discontinuation), the severity and the investigator 
relationship of the AE to study drug, the therapy for the AE, the action taken with study drug, 
and whether or not the AE is considered serious.  
Adverse events will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) Version 18.0 or later.  
Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs (identified by PT) that begins or that 
worsens in severity after at least one dose of study treatment has been administered, and last upto 
the AE stop date or the follow -up visit or the last study participation day.   The n umber and 
percentage of subjects  reporting at least one occurrence of a TEAE for each unique System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term will be tabulated by severity, and by the investi gator  
relationship to study drug. For multiple occurrence of the same TEAE with the different severity, 
the TEAE with the highest severity will be tabulated. For multiple occurrences of the same 
TEAE with different relationship to study drug (related and n ot related), the TEAE will be 
tabulated as related. All TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment will also be tab ulated. All 
AEs for all subjects  will b e presented in a data listing.  
Pre-Treatment AEs  (PTAEs) are defined as AEs (identified by PT) tha t begin or that worsen in 
severity between  study Day -14 and study drug administration, and last up to the AE stop date.     
 
The severity o f AE is classified as follows:  
Mild  The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject.  
The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention  
Moderate  The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic intervention.  
The AE produces no sequelae.  
Severe  The AE results in a mark ed impairment of function and may lead to temporary inability to 
resume usual life pattern.  
  The AE produces sequelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic intervention.  
 
The relationship of AEs to study medication is classified as follows:  
 Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility  
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 55  
     Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility  
A COPD exacerbation is defined as worsening of the  following 2 or more major symptoms for at 
least 2 consecutive days: dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence or a worsening of any 
1 major symptom together with an increase in any 1 of the following minor symptoms for at least 
2 consecutive days: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever without 
other cause, and cough. A COPD exacerbation shall be reported as an AE and may be considered 
serious if it meets the seriousness criteria for SAE reporting.  
All serious AEs that occur after administration of the first dose of study drug will be listed by 
System Organ Class, Preferred Term, and relationship to study drug  as assessed by the 
investigator . In addition to three treatment levels, a GSP 304 total wil l be presented in AE/SAE -
related summary tables.  
10.2.2.  Missing and Partial AE Onset Dates  
Refers to section 6.8.3   
10.2.3.  Summaries of Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Adverse Event Dropouts, and 
Death  
For SAEs that are considered to be related to study drug, the number and p ercentage of subjects  
reporting at least one occurrence of an SAE for each unique System Organ Class will be 
tabulated. SAEs that lead to  study discontinuation  will be tabulated by unique System Organ 
Class, Preferred Term and relationship to study drug. A ll SAEs resulting  in death will also be 
tabulated.  
All SAEs will be p resented for individual subjects  in data listings , as well as premature 
discontinuations due to all causality. Deaths of all causes, study -drug related (occurring during 
study participation and up to 30 days post -treatment) or not, will be presented in a separate 
listing . 
10.3. Concomitant and Other Medications  
Concomitant medication  will be coded by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA™) Version 18.0 or later . 
Medical history data will be l isted by treatment and subject  
All concomitant medications taken since screening until the end of the study will be li sted by 
treatment and subject.

and urinalysis), will be summarized for  Visit 4 to Vi sit 7 (the Final Visit).   Descriptive statistics 
(number of   subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be presented for 
laboratory data as well as change from baseline by treatment and visit.  In addition, values outside 
the respective normal r ange and values deemed as clinically significant by the Investigator will 
be listed.  
The number of subjects with values of potential clinical significance determined by the 
investigator will be tabulated by treatment group and visit.  
Shift tables will pre sent changes from baseline in laboratory data (categorized as normal; 
abnormal, not clinically significant; and abnormal, clinically significant) to end of treatment.  
All laboratory data will be listed by treatment and subject.

examination results by body system, treatment group and visit. In addition, the number of 
subjec ts with values of potential clinical significance determined by the investigator will be 
tabulated.  
All physical examination  data will be listed by treatment and subject.  
10.8. Study Termination Status  
 
If the Investigator  or the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor becomes awa re of conditions or events that 
suggest a possible hazard to subjects if the study continues, the study  may be terminated after 
appropriate consultat ion between the relevant parties. The study may also be terminate d early at 
the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding.  
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
 The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects  
enrolled in the study;  
 Failure to enroll subjects at an acceptable rate;  
 A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or  discontinue development of the 
drug product.     
10.9. Changes fro m Protocol  
 
The following changes from the protocol were made in the SAP.  
 
1) The definition of the primary endpoint was clarified  from change from baseline in trough 
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) at 24 hours after the last dose of treatmen t on 
Day 21 in comparision with placebo to  change from baseline (Day 1) at Day 21 (Week 3) in 
trough FEV 1 response at approximately 24 hours after the last dose (average of 23  hours 15 
minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post -dose measurements . 
 
2) The languag e used for definition of the secondary endpoint of change from baseline in trough 
FVC, and the associated analyses related to this endpoint, was modified to align it with the 
language that has been used for the primary endpoint.  
Glenmark Specialty SA  
Statistical Analysis Plan – Protocol #GSP304 -201 SEPT 12 , 2017  
 
 58  
     
3) The following secondary  endpoints were added;  
 Time to onset of response, defined as at least 12% and 200 mL increase  in FEV 1 
within 12 hours of dosing on Day 1  
 Time to achieving steady state as measured by FEV 1 trough assessments  
 Time to achieving steady state as measured by FVC  trough assessments  
 
4) Spirometry Effort Start Time: will use the first effort (Test 1) regardless of whether this is an 
acceptable effort or not.   Instead of “start time of first spirometry effort” (per protocol), we are 
using the end time of the first s pirometry effort.

[1] LSMD = Least Square Mean Difference  for each GSP304  vs GSP304 placebo:  Missing values are imputed under the assumption that  the distribution of the 
missing observations has a low expected value than that of the observed only by a shift parame ter value; The shift parameter is set at 80 mL  for being  about 50% 
of treatment efficacy when assuming that a difference in mean change f rom baseline at the end of treatment in trough FEV 1 between GSP304 and GSP304 
placebo is 150  mL; Increment = 20 mL; If the tipping point is found to be between two increments  on the given interval, a subsequent tipping point procedure 
will be performed usi ng an interval on the neighborhood of the perceived tipping point finer incremen ts for the shift parameter; The model will include trough

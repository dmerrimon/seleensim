CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 46  1 INTRODUCTION 
This document describes the s tatistical analysis for protocol D 5181C00001, a randomized, 
placebo-controlled, proof of mechanism study to evaluate the sa fety and efficacy of 
MEDI5872 in subjects with p rimary Sjogren’s s yndrome (pSS). 
2 STUDY OVERVIEW 
2.1 Study Objectives 
2.1.1 Primary Study Objective(s) 
To evaluate the effect of AMG 557/MEDI5872 compared to placebo i n reducing objective 
measures of overall disease activity in subjects with pSS. 
2.1.2 Secondary Study Objectives 
1. To evaluate the effect of AMG 557/MEDI5872 compared to placebo o n peripheral blood 
and salivary gland biomarkers in subjects with pSS. 
2. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple subcutaneou s (SC) doses of 
AMG557/MEDI5872 in subjects with pSS. 
3. To evaluate the effect of AMG 557/MEDI5872 compared to placebo i n reducing 
subjective measures of overall disease activity. 
 
2.1.3 Exploratory Study Objectives 
1. To evaluate the effect of AMG 557/MEDI5872 compared to placebo o n individual 
clinical and laboratory components of pSS. 
2. To evaluate the effect of AMG 557/MEDI5872 compared to placebo o n specific 
subjective symptoms of pSS. 
3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics  (PK), immunogenicity, and phar macodynamics (PD) of 
AMG557/MEDI5872. 
 
2.2 Study Design 
This is a Phase 2a, multice nter, randomized, double-blind, plac ebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study to evaluate the clinical and biologic efficacy, as well a s the safety of SC doses of 
AMG557/MEDI5872 in adult subjects with pSS. The study will be c onducted at 
approximately 10 sites in Europe a nd North America. A total of 42 subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to rece ive a fixed SC dose of 210 mg MEDI5872 (n = 21) or 
placebo (n = 21) every week (QW) for 3 weeks (Days 1 to 15) and  then every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) for 9 weeks (Days 29 to 85). Beginning on Day 99, all sub jects (n = 42) will receive a 
MedImmune  Statistical Analysis Plan for Protocol D5181C00001 
MEDI5872  25 September 2017; Amendment 1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 8 of 46  fixed SC dose of 210 mg AMG557/MEDI5872 QW (Days 99 to 113) and  Q2W (Days 127 to 
183) for an additional 12 weeks. 
On Day 106, subjects who had received placebo will receive a bl inded dose of 
AMG557/MEDI5872, and subjects who received AMG557/MEDI5872 will  receive a blinded 
dose of placebo (as these subjects would have already achieved steady-state levels of 
AMG557/MEDI5872). 
Randomization will be stratified by screening cellular immunoph enotyping abnormalities 
(elevated T follicular helper [TFH] cells or elevated plasma bl ast/plasma cell [PB/PC] vs 
normal values for both parameters). 
Subjects will receive investigational product on Days 1, 8, 15,  29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 106, 
113, 127, 141, 155, 169, and 183 during the active treatment pe riod. Subjects will return to 
the study site on Days 197, 225, 253, and 296 during the safety  follow-up period. 
The study flow diagram is shown in Figure 2.1.31.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 9 of 46  2.3 Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
2.3.1 Randomization 
An interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS) will be us ed for randomization to a 
treatment group and assignment  of blinded investigational produ ct kit numbers. Subjects will 
be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive either AMG557/MEDI5872 or placebo. 
Randomization will be stratified b y screening cellular immunoph enotyping abnormalities 
(elevated TFH or elevated PB/PC vs normal values for both param eters). 
2.3.2 Blinding and Planned Analyses 
This is a double-blind study in which AMG557/MEDI5872 and place bo are identically 
labeled and indistinguishable in appearance. As such, neither t he subject/legal representative 
nor any of the investigator staff who are involved in the treat ment or clinical evaluation of 
the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. In additi on, sponsor staff will also be 
blinded up until the time of the primary analysis.  
The primary analysis will be performed when all subjects have c ompleted Day 99 or have 
withdrawn from the study. The primary analysis will include all  assessments on the subjects 
prior to the data cut-off (date of last Day 99/early withdrawal  visit) for the primary analysis. 
The Sponsor staff will be unblinded at the primary analysis (af ter Day 99).  Results from the 
primary analysis may be shared with investigators and presented  at public 
conferences.  Investigators will not be made aware of unblinded  treatment assignments for 
individual subjects ongoing in the open-label phase or follow-u p phase of the study, until these 
subjects have completed the study. 
The final analysis will be performed when all subjects have com pleted the open-label phase 
and safety follow-up or have withdrawn from the study 
2.4 Sample Size 
The planned sample size of 42 subjects (21 subjects per arm) wi ll provide 80% power to 
detect a difference in mean change in European League Against Rheumatism Sjogren’s 
Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) of 4 (assumed standard  deviation (SD) of 5; 
Moerman et al, 2014, Meiners et al, 2012) between two randomize d groups at a two-sided 
0.1 level of statistical significance by using two sample t-tes t. This sample size also provides 
about 80% power to detect 30% relative reduction in plasma cell s (PC) from tissue under 
assumption of coefficient of vari ation (CV) of 0.5. The sample size was calculated by using 
nQuery Advisor 7.0.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 10 of 46  3 STATISTICAL METHODS 
3.1 General Considerations 
Unless stated otherwise, baseline will be defined as the last a ssessment prior to dosing.  
Unless stated otherwise, data from the screening visits will no t be included in the summary 
tables but will be listed.  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment with investigati onal product will complete 
an ‘End of Treatment’ assessmen t at the time of discontinuation . Unless stated otherwise, 
data from the ‘End of Treatment ’ assessment will not be separat ely summarized but will be 
slotted to the closest study visit as described in Section 3.4 . All ‘End of Treatment’ results 
will appear in the listings.  
Unless stated otherwise, descriptive summaries of continuous va riables will include the 
number of observations, mean, SD, and the median, minimum and m aximum values. 
Summaries of categorical variables will include the number and percentage of subjects in 
each category. 
When last observation carried for ward (LOCF) is used to impute for missing post-baseline 
data, only post-baseline data will  be carried forward (i.e. bas eline data will not be carried 
forward). 
All statistical tests will be tw o-sided at an alpha = 0.1 signi ficance level unless stated 
otherwise. 
Data analyses will be conducted using the SAS® System Version 9.3  or higher (SAS Institute 
Inc., Cary, NC). 
 
3.2 Analysis Populations 
The analysis populations are defined in Table 3.2-1. 
Table  3.2-1 Analysis Populations 
Population Description 
Intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population All subjects who are randomized and treated with investigationa l product. Subjects will

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 11 of 46  Table  3.2-1 Analysis Populations 
Population Description 
Open Label As-
treated population All subjects in the As-treated population who enter the open la bel phase (defined in 
Section 3.3) of the study. Subjects will be analyzed according to the a ctual treatment 
received . 
Any Medi5872 
population  All subjects who had at least one dose of MEDI5872 treatment (i n any phase of the 
study ). Subjects will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received. 
  
3.3 Study Phases, Analysis and Reporting Plan  
This study comprises a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, a MEDI5872 open-label 
phase, and a safety follow-up phase . For reporting purposes, th e phases are defined as 
follows: 
Placebo-controlled phase : All assessments from the date and time of the first dose thro ugh 
to pre-dose at Visit 10 (Day 99), or date of withdrawal if this  occurs sooner.  
MEDI5872 Open-label a nd Follow-Up phase:  All visits from post dose at Visit 10 (Day 
99) through to end of study Vis it 21 (Day 296) or date of withd rawal if this occurs sooner.  
The following datasets will be used for analysis and reporting:  
Primary Analysis Dataset:  This dataset comprises data f rom the Placebo-controlled phase 
of the study. It includes data for all subjects from screening and baseline, and all assessments 
from the date and time of the f irst dose through to pre-dose at  Visit 10 (Day 99), (or date of 
withdrawal if this occurs sooner). 
Final Analysis Dataset:  This dataset comprises data from the whole study. It includes data 
for all subjects from screening and baseline, and all assessmen ts from the date and time of 
the first dose through to end of study, (or date of withdrawal if this occurs sooner). 
At the Primary Analysis, all a nalyses will be based on the Prim ary Analysis Dataset. The ITT 
population will be used for the efficacy analyses, and the ‘As -Treated’ population will be 
used for safety analyses.  
At the Final Analysis, the efficacy analyses will be based on t he Final Analysis Dataset using 
the ITT population. Safety Analys es will use the Final Analysis  Dataset, sub-setting on data 
from the Medi5872 Open-Label and Follow- Up Phase. The ‘Open - Label As- Treated’ 
Population will be used for these analyses. Additional safety a nalyses will also be produced

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 12 of 46  based on the Final Analysis dataset using the ‘Any Medi5872’ population, as indicated in 
Section 3.10.1. 
3.4 Visit Windows 
Visit windows will be used for all scheduled assessments (lab d ata, vital signs, efficacy, PD, 
patient reported outcomes data and other additional analyses).  
To allow for unscheduled and disc ontinuation assessments the da ta will be summarized using 
the assessment (whether reporte d as a scheduled or unscheduled visit) closest to the nominal 
visit date, calculated from the first day of dosing.  The visit  result will be missing if no 
assessment was reported within the specified visit window aroun d the scheduled date.  If two 
assessments are equidistant from a scheduled visit, the one wit h the earlier date (and/or time, 
as applicable) will be used.   
The visit windows will be calculated by bisecting the scheduled  visit assessments. The lower 
limit of each window will be the mean of the two adjacent plann ed study days, rounded up to 
the nearest integer, except for the first post-treatment visit,  which will start at Day 2. The 
upper limit of each window will be the mean of the two adjacent  planned study days, 
rounded down to the nearest integer.   
Note, when slotting visits to the Day 99 window, this should on ly occur for assessments prior 
to the date and time  of the nominal Day 99 dose. Assessments after this time  should be 
slotted to the following visit window. This applies for all dat a types except for vital signs.  
Special note for Vital Signs:  For vital signs there are pre and post-dose assessments at the  
Day 99 visit. In this case, the post-dose assessments on the da y of the nominal Day 99 dose 
should be summarized with the D ay 99 data. In other words, when  slotting visits to the Day 
99 window for vital signs, this should only occur for assessmen ts up to and including those 
on the date of the nominal Day 99 dose. Assessments after this date should be slotted to the 
following visit window. 
Here is an example for laboratory data:

253 Day 240- Day 274 
296 Day 275 + 
 
Consider the following example: Subject ID 5678 attends the nominal Day 99 visit on actual stud y day 97. They have an 
unscheduled assessment on actual Day 100.  They attend for the nominal Day 113 visit on 
actual Day 112. For lab data, all results up to pre-dose on Day  97 get slotted to the Day 99 
visit. All results post-dose on D ay 97 (including the unschedul ed visit on Day 100, even 
though it is closer to Day 99) would be slotted to the Day 113 visit. The results closest to the 
nominal day within these windows are then used in the summary t ables, i.e Day 97 is used 
for Nominal Day 99 and Day 112 is used for nominal Day 113. 
Here is an example for vital signs data:

Consider the following example: 
Subject ID 5678 attends the nominal Day 99 visit on actual stud y day 97. They have an 
unscheduled assessment on actual Day 100.  They attend for the nominal Day 113 visit on 
actual Day 112. For vital signs data, all results on Day 97 get  slotted to the Day 99 visit. All 
results after Day 97 (including the unscheduled visit on Day 10 0, even though it is closer to 
Day 99) would be slotted to the Day 113 visit. The results clos est to the nominal day within 
these windows are then used in the summary tables, i.e Day 97 i s used for Nominal Day 99 
and Day 112 is used for nominal Day 113. 
3.5 Study Subjects 
3.5.1 Subject Disposition and Completion Status 
A summary of subject eligibility and randomization, as well as treatment received (including 
summary of subjects randomized but not treated), will be provid ed. In addition, disposition of 
subjects throughout the study with respect to completion of the  placebo controlled phase, 
completion of treatment, and completion of follow-up will be pr ovided. A subject will be 
considered to have completed the  placebo-controlled phase if th ey are still in the study (have 
not been withdrawn or lost to follow up) and complete visit 10 (Day 99).

3.6 Efficacy Analyses 
3.6.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) and Analyses 
3.6.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
The ESSDAI is a validated consensus disease activity index that  is able to capture changes in 
the severity of systemic manifestations of pSS, with 12 domains , with associated weights as 
shown in Table 3.6.1.1-1. 
MedImmune  Statistical Analysis Plan for Protocol D5181C00001

Muscular 6 0-3 
Peripheral Nervous System 5 0-3 
Central Nervous System 5 0,2,3 
Hematological 2 0-3 
Biological 1 0-2 
 
The theoretical range of va lues for the ESSDAI is 0 to 123, wit h the final score being 
calculated as follows: 
Final Score = Sum of all 12 domain scores 
Domain score = Activity level × Domain weight 
For example, the domain score for the Muscular domain, with a d omain weight of 6 and 
levels of activity ranging from 0 to 3 (where ‘0’ indicates ‘no activity’, ‘1’ ind icates ‘low 
activity’, ‘2’ indicated ‘moderate activity’, and ‘3’ indicates  ‘high activity’) can range 
between 0 and 18.  
Higher ESSDAI scores indicate more severe disease. 
ESSDAI is collected at screening, Day 1, 29, 57, 99, 127, 155, 197, 225, 253,296 and End of 
Treatment.  
3.6.1.2 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
For the primary analysis throug h the end of the placebo-control led period (Day 99), missing 
data will be imputed using the LOCF approach. This will be appl ied first to missing domain 
scores, and, in the event that all domain scores are missing, t o the final ESSDAI score. For 
example, consider a subject wi th the following pattern of domai n scores and missing data:

For the analysis of change in ESSDAI over time (using a longitu dinal mixed effects model), 
no imputation will be performed for missing data. If any ESSDAI  domain scores are missing, 
the final score will also be consid ered missing in this analysi s.  
3.6.1.3 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Changes in ESSDAI score from ba seline to Day 99 will be analyse d using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA).   ESSDAI sc ore at baseline will be include d as a covariate, with 
strata (PC and/or TFH elevated vs neither elevated) and treatme nt group included in the 
model as factors. The model may be expressed as below:  
Change from baseline in ESSDAI = Intercept + Baseline ESSDAI+ S trata + Treatment  
From the model, estimates of the  LSMeans for each treatment gro up will be obtained, 
together with the associated standard errors (SE). Additionally , an estimate of the difference 
in LSMeans (MEDI5872 – placebo) will be obtained, together with a two-sided 90% 
confidence interval, SE and p-value). The significance of treat ment effect will be tested by

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 19 of 46  using a two-sided test at significance level α of 0.1. The analysis will be conducted using the 
ITT Population with the LOCF approach for missing data as discu ssed in Section 3.6.1.2.  
To assess the validity of the model assumptions, residual plots  will be produced (not for 
inclusion in the clinical study report [CSR]) and inspected by the statistician. In the event that 
substantial departures from the model assumptions are found, al ternative appropriate 
analyses will be performed, for example ANCOVA using log transf ormed ratio (Day 
99:baseline), or non-parametric methods. 
3.6.1.4 Additional Analyses of t he Primary Effica cy Endpoint(s)  
To assess the effect of MEDI5872 on changes in ESSDAI over time , a longitudinal mixed 
effects analysis of variance mod el will be fitted for the chang e from baseline in ESSDAI, for 
the ITT population using the observed data only, i.e. no imputa tion for missing values, as 
described in Section 3.6.1.2. At th e Primary Analysis, all visi ts up to and including Day 99 
will be included in the model. At the Final Analysis, all visit s up to and including Day 296 
will be included in the model. Onl y the results from the analys is with all visits will be 
included in the CSR.  
The model will include fixed effects for baseline ESSDAI, strat a (PC and/or TFH elevated vs 
neither elevated), visi t, treatment and the baseline by visit  and treatment by visit interactions. 
The following covariance matrix s tructures to describe the corr elations between observations 
on a subject between visits will  be considered: unstructured, a uto-regressive, and compound 
symmetry. The selection of the c ovariance matrix structure for the primary analysis will be 
the one that gives the lowest value for the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). For subsequent 
analyses, the same structure that was used for the primary anal ysis will be used, unless there 
are issues with model fit, in which case the AIC will be used t o determine the most 
appropriate structure. The mode l may be expressed as below: 
Change from baseline in ESSDAI = Intercept + Baseline ESSDAI + Strata +      
          Treatment + Visit + Baseline*Visit  + Treatment*Visit 
Note: The Baseline*Visit inter action is included in the model t o avoid potential over or 
under-correction, should the influ ence of baseline differ acros s visits. However, this term 
may be dropped from the model in t he event that there are diffi culties with model fit, or to 
make more degrees of freedom available for estimation of residu al variability, if there does 
not appear to be evidence that the influence of baseline differ s over visits. A decision on 
whether to exclude this interaction term will be made by the st atistician, upon review of the 
output from the full model.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20 of 46  From the model, estimates of the  LSMeans for each treatment gro up at each visit will be 
obtained, together with the asso ciated SEs. Additionally, an es timate of the difference in 
LSMeans (MEDI5872 – placebo) will be obtained at each visit, together with a two-s ided 
90% CI, SE and p-value. The LSMeans (±SE) for each treatment gr oup will be plotted, for 
each visit.  
In the event that a transformation of the endpoint (e.g. a log transformation) was required for 
the primary analysis (Section 3.6.1.3), the same transformation  will be applied for this 
repeated measures analysis, and t he results will be back transf ormed to the original scale.   
ESSDAI final score and change from baseline in ESSDAI final sco re will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment and visit for the ITT population. A by-treatment listing will also 
be produced.  
3.6.1.5 Subgroup Analyses 
Two subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint are planned.  
(1) Elevated TFH and/or PC/PB at screening vs both parameters n ormal at screening 
(2) (Baseline ESSDAI >=Median)  vs (Baseline ESSDAI < Median) 
A table will be produced showing the amount of overlap between these subgroups.   
For each subgroup analysis, the A NCOVA model described for the primary analysis at Day 
99 will be fitted with the addi tion of the treatment*subgroup i nteraction. From the model, 
estimates of the LSMeans for each t reatment within each subgrou p will be obtained, together 
with the associated standard errors (SE). Additionally, an esti mate of the difference in 
LSMeans (MEDI5872 – placebo) will be obtained within each subgroup, together with a 
two-sided 90% confidence interval and SE). The p value for the interaction of treatment with 
subgroup will be reported.

3.6.2.3 ESSDAI Domains 
ESSDAI Domains are described in section 3.6.1.1. 
3.6.2.4 Analysis of ESSDAI Domains 
A bar chart will be produced showing the proportion of subjects  in each treatment group who 
had a reduction of at least 1 poi nt in activity level for each of the separate domains of the 
ESSDAI at Day 99. For each domain, subjects will only be includ ed if they had activity in 
that domain at baseline.  
3.7 Patient-reported Outcomes 
3.7.1 Change from Baseline in European League Against Rheumatis m 
Sjogren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI)  
Change from baseline to Day 99 in ESSPRI is a secondary endpoin t. ESSPRI is collected at 
Days 1, 29, 57, 99, 127, 155, 197, 225, 253, 296, and End of Tr eatment. The ESSPRI is a 3-
item, subject-completed assessment of SS symptoms. The instrume nt captures subject-rated 
severity of dryness , fatigue , and pain  using 0-10 numeric rating scales anchored as no 
symptom (0) and maximal imaginable symptom (10). The recall per iod is stated in each 
question as “the last 2 weeks.”  The ESSPRI total score is the mean of the 3 items and is 
calculated as follows: 
 
ESSPRI Total Score = (Dryness + Fatigue + Pain) / 3 
 
A subject will be considered an ESSPRI responder if they have a t least a 1 point or >=15% 
reduction in their ESSPRI score from baseline, do not premature ly discontinue IP, and do not 
receive prohibited concomitant medications.

Change in ESSPRI score from base line will be sum marized descrip tively by treatment and 
visit, for the ITT population. Change in ESSPRI score and in ea ch of the ESSPRI domains 
from baseline to Day 99 will be c ompared between MEDI5872 and p lacebo groups using 
ANCOVA. Missing values for Day 99 ESSPRI will be imputed using the LOCF approach. 
Where an individual component score is missing, LOCF will be ap plied for that component 
before calculation of the total s core as described for the prim ary endpoint (see Section 
3.6.1.2). 
To assess the effect of MEDI5872 on changes in ESSPRI and each ESSPRI domain over 
time, a longitudinal mixed effects analysis of variance model w ill be fitted. The LSMeans (± 
SE) for each treatment will  be plotted, for each visit. For thi s analysis, no imputation will be 
performed; the analysis will be based on observed case. 
The details of these analyses will  be the same as those describ ed for the primary endpoint in 
Section 3.6.1.3 and Section 3.6.1.4, ex cept that the baseline t erm will be replaced with the 
relevant baseline ESSPRI (overall score or domain score). 
The number and proportion of ESSPR I responders will be summariz ed by treatment and 
visit.  The proportion of MEDI5872 a nd placebo subjects with an  ESSPRI  response at Day 
99 will be compared using Fisher’s Exact test.  
3.7.3 Subject Global Assessment of Disease Activity (SGA) 
The Subject Global Assessment of Disease Activity (SGA) is a si ngle-item question which 
asks subjects to consider how their illness affects them and re port on how they have felt over 
the last 7 days. Responses range from 0 (very well) to 100 (ver y poor) on a 100-mm visual 
analogue scale. The SGA is completed at Day 1, 29, 57, 99, 127,  155, 197, 225, 253, 296 and 
End of Treatment. 
For the analysis of SGA over time, no imputation will be perfor med; the analysis will be

3.7.5 Short Form 36 Version 2 
The Short Form 36 version 2 (SF-36v2 [acute recall]) is a 36-it em, subject-completed, 
general health status assessment. The instrument captures infor mation regarding 8 health 
domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, Gene ral Health, Vitality, Social 
Functioning, Role Emotional , and Mental Health. The SF-36v2 pro vides scores for each 
domain, as well as two psychometrically-based summary scores: p hysical component score 
(PCS) and mental component score (MCS). The SF-36v2 will be sco red according to Version 
3.0 of the scoring algorithm (2009). Medimmune will provide the  SF-36v2 data from the 
CRF to a vendor who will run the scoring algorithm and then pro vide the derived scores back 
to MedImmune.  
The SF-36v2 is completed at Day 1, 29, 57, 99, 127, 155, 197, 2 25, 253, 296, and End of 
Treatment.   
For the analysis of SF36v2 scores over time, no imputation will  be performed, the analysis 
will be based on observed case.  
3.7.6 Analysis of Short Form 36 Version 2 
Change in the following SF-36v2 scores from baseline will be su mmarized descriptively by 
treatment and time point, for the ITT population: 
• Change from baseline in PCS 
• Change from baseline in MCS 
• Change from baseline in SF-36v2 domain scores 
 To assess the effect of MEDI5872 on changes in SF36v2 scores ov er time, a longitudinal 
mixed effects analysis of varian ce model will be fitted, as des cribed for the primary endpoint 
in Section 3.6.1.4, except that the  baseline term will be repla ced with the relevant baseline 
SF-36 (component or domain score). The LSMeans (± SE) for each treatment over time will 
be plotted. 
A radar plot (spidergram) will be produced for the SF-36 domain s at Day 99 for the overall 
population and for ESSDAI responders. Both treatment groups wil l be shown on the same 
plot.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 24 of 46  3.7.7 Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort-Sicca Symptoms Inventor y-Short 
Form 
The PROFAD-SSI-SF is a 19-item, subject-completed assessment of  symptoms associated 
with pSS (Bowman et al, 2009). The instrument captures informat ion on 8 domains of 
symptoms: somatic fatigue, mental  fatigue, arthralgia, vascular  dysfunction, oral dryness, 
ocular dryness, cutaneous and vaginal dryness. Each symptom dom ain is comprised of one or 
more “facets”. Patient -reported severity in the past 2 w eeks is captured using an 8-p oint 
(0 [no/not] to 7 [as bad as imaginable]) scale.  
The domain scores are calculated as follows (see also Appendix 1 for further details): 
Somatic Fatigue = Item 1 + Item 2 + Item 3 + Item 4 (range 0-28 ) 
Mental Fatigue = Item 5 + Item 6 (Range 0-14) Arthralgia = Item 7 (Range 0-7) 
Vascular Dysfunction = Item 8 + Item 9 (Range 0-14) 
Cutaneous Dryness = Item 10 (Range 0-7) Vaginal Dryness = Item 11 (Range 0-7) [This item is for females  only] 
Ocular Dryness = Item 12 + Item 13 + Item 14 (range 0-21) 
Oral Dryness = Item 15 + Item 16 + Item 17 + Item 18 + Item 19 (range 0-35) 
Additionally, the Profile of fatigue (PROF) score and the Profi le of Fatigue and Discomfort 
(PROFAD) scores will be calculated as follows: 
PROF score = Somatic Fatigue + Mental Fatigue   
PROFAD score = PROF score + Art hralgia score + vascular dysfunc tion score 
The PROFAD-Sicca Symptoms Inventory-Short Form (SSI-SF) is comp leted at Day 1, 29, 
57, 99, 127, 155, 197, 225, 253, 296, and End of Treatment. Whe re an individual item score 
is missing, LOCF will be applie d for that item before calculati on of the domain score, as 
described for the primary endpoint (see Section 3.6.1.2). 
For the analysis of scores over time, if an entire domain or PR OF or PROFAD score is 
missing, no imputation will be perf ormed; the analysis will be based on observed case.

and treatment group  will be in cluded in the model. The model m ay be expressed as below: 
Log(Biomarker at Day 99/Bioma rker at baseline) = Intercept + Lo g(Baseline Biomarker) +  
              Strata + Treatment  
From the model, estimates of the  LSMeans for each treatment wil l be obtained, together with 
the associated SEs. Additionally, an estimate of the difference  in LSmeans (MEDI5872 – 
placebo) will be obtained, together with a two-sided 90% CI, SE  and p-value). These 
estimates will then be back-transformed to provide the geometri c means and their ratio, with 
associated CI. The significance of treatment effect will be tes ted by using a two-sided test at 
significance level α of 0.1. The  analysis will be conducted usi ng the ITT Population with the 
LOCF approach for missing data as discussed in Section 3.8.1.  
To assess the validity of the model assumptions, residual plots  will be produced (not for 
inclusion in the CSR) and inspected by the statistician. In the  event that substantial 
departures from the model assump tions are found, alternative ap propriate analyses will be 
performed. 
To assess the effect of MEDI5872 on changes in peripheral blood  biomarkers over time, a 
longitudinal mixed effects analysis of variance model will be f itted to the log(Value at Visit / 
Value at Baseline), for the ITT population using the observed d ata only, i.e. no imputation 
for missing values. At the Primary Analysis, all visits up to a nd including Day 99 will be

included in the model. Only the re sults from the analysis with all visits will be included in the 
CSR. The model will include fixed effects for log(baseline), st rata, visit, treatment and the 
baseline by visit  and treatment by visit interactions. The same covariance struc ture that was 
used for the primary analysis will be used, unless there are is sues with model fit, in which 
case the AIC will be used to determine the most appropriate str ucture from unstructured, 
autoregressive or compound symmetry.. The models may be express ed as 
Log(Biomarker at visit/Biomarker at baseline) = Intercept + Log (Baseline Biomarker) +   
             Strata + Treatment + Visit + Baseline*Visit   
             + T r e a t m e n t * V i s i t  
Note: The Baseline*Visit inter action is included in the model t o avoid potential over or 
under-correction should the influen ce of baseline differ across  visits. However, this term may 
be dropped from the model in the eve nt that there are difficult ies with model fit, or to make 
more degrees of freedom available for estimation of residual va riability if there does not 
appear to be evidence that the influence of baseline differs ov er visits. A decision on whether 
to exclude this interaction term will be made by the statistici an.  
From the model, estimates of the  LSMeans for each treatment at each visit will be obtained, 
together with the associated SEs and 90% CI. Additionally, an e stimate of the difference in 
LSmeans (MEDI5872 – placebo) will be obtained at each visit, together with a two-s ided 
90% CI, SE and p-value. These es timates will then be back-trans formed to provide the 
geometric means and their ratio, with associated CI. The geomet ric LSMeans (± 90% CI) for 
each treatment will be plotted, for each visit.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 37 of 46  MEDI5872 serum trough concentrations will be summarized by trea tment group at each time 
point using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, g eometric mean, SD, CV, 
median, minimum and maximum).  Serum trough concentrations at e ach visit will be 
displayed in a boxplot, provided there are sufficient quantifia ble concentrations to do this. 
The BLQ observations will be changed to zero for mean concentra tion calculation. However, 
if the calculated mean is less th an the assay LLQ, the mean val ue will be set to BLQ. Missing 
observations will be excluded from the mean calculation and PK data analysis. It is 
anticipated that the PK assay ma y yield some outlier concentrat ion values. The outlier 
concentrations will be identified by the visual examination of individual PK profiles. An 
effort will be made to reanalyze the sample and/or to assess th e potential impact of 
immunogenicity response on PK. However, if the cause of an outl ier observation remains 
unidentified and the inclusi on of the outlier has a profound im pact on the mean profile, the 
outlier observation will be excl uded from PK data analysis. The  exclusion of the outliers will 
be documented in the clinical PK  report. All serum concentratio n measurements will be 
displayed in by-subject listings by visit as recorded (no imput ations). 
The PK data will be analyzed over the ‘As Treated’ population defined earlier in  Section 3.2. 
The PK analyses will be conducted b y Amgen’s Clinical Pharmacol ogy, Mo delling and 
Simulation group and the results will be reported by MedImmune.   
 
4 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
The primary analysis will be perf ormed when all subjects have c ompleted the Day 99 
assessment, i.e. at the end of the double-blind placebo-control led phase. The primary analysis 
will include all assessments on  the subjects prior to the data cut-off for the primary analysis. 
The final analysis will be performed when all subjects have com pleted the open-label phase 
and safety follow-up.

included 
x Section 3.6.1.4 Changed approach to 
selection of covariance matrix, to be 
based on Akaike Information Criteria. 
For analys es of other endpoints, the 
structure used for the primary analysis 
will be applied.  
x Section 3.6 .1.4 Definition and analysis 
of ESSDAI responders moved to 
Secondary efficacy analysis section  
x Section 3.6 .1.5 Additional details of 
subgroup analyses have been added

blood biomarkers has been added 
x Section 3.8 .1 definition of baseline has 
been changed, to be the last 
assessment prior to dosing 
 
 
x Section 3.8.3 Clarification of 
secondary endpoints from salivary 
gland biopsy, and addition of 
exploratory endpoints  
 
x Clarification 
 
 
x Clarification added since inclusion of 
later assessments at the Primary analysis would results in incomplete data which could result in model fit issues and/or 
bias. 
  
x
 Improves model selection. 
 
 
 
  
x
 ESSDAI response is a secondary 
endpoint 
 
x Clarification 
x ESSDAI response definition h as been 
changed to align with anifrolumab 
program. Domain plot added to aid 
exploration of data.  
x ESSPRI response definition has been 
changed to align with anifrolumab 
program. 
x ESSPRI analysis added to align with 
anifrolumab program 
 
x For exploratory endpoi nts this analysis 
is superfluous, since the mixed model will provide results for the full study 
duration. 
x SF-36 scoring algorithm has changed 
and is no longer in the public domain. 
 
x Requested by Clinical team 
 
x Clarification 
 
x Change of analysis model to reflect 
randomization strata so it is now 
appropriate to use the standard baseline 
definition 
 
x Updated information available from 
translational sciences 
 
 
x Salivary flow is an exploratory endpoint 
and subgroup analyses are not required

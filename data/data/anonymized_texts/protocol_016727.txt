L AMENDMENT, VERSION 6: 
RATIONALE
Protocol ML42439 has been amended primarily to update safety information and to 
remove survival follow-up.  Changes to the protocol and a rationale for each change are 
outlined below:
General Updates
 The study objective has shifted to look for short-term treatment response; therefore
overall survival (OS) will no longer be analyzed and has been removed as a 
secondary endpoint (Sections 2.1.1, 5.3.5.8, and 6.4.2).  Furthermore, it has been 
determined that the 1-year follow-up will not provide meaningful additional OS data 
considering the small sample size within each treatment group; therefore, follow-up 
visits/phone calls after the end of treatment (EOT) visit have been removed from the 
Schedule of Activities (SOA; SOA for each study arm). Additional language
regarding survival follow-up has been updated to reflect these changes (Sections 
3.1.1, 3.2, 4.6.1, 4.6.2; Section 4.6.3 was removed).  Death will be reported as a 
safety endpoint.
 Due to the signal seeking nature of the study, tumor assessment images will
no longer be submitted to an independent review facility.  This language has been 
removed from the protocol (Sections 4.5.6 and 9.5).
 The disease control rate definition has been updated to “the proportion of 
patients whose best response is confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed
partial response (PR), or a response of CR, PR, stable disease, or non-CR/non-pro-
gressive disease for a minimum of 98 days for 28-day cycle arms or 70 days for 21-
day cycle arms after the first treatment date” to align with the statistical analysis plan 
(Sections 2.1.2 and 6.4.2).
 To align with previous updates, language regarding rescreening for a different 
treatment arm after disease progression has been removed (Section 3.1.1).  This is
no longer allowed.
 The email address for withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository after site
closure has been corrected (Section 4.5.8.6).
 Personal identifiable information (i.e., name) for the Medical Monitor has been
removed from the protocol (title page).  Sites are provided the Medical Monitor’s 
name separately and can contact the Medical Monitor via the Emergency Medical 
Call Center Help Desk (Section 5.4.1).
 A description of the technical and organizational security measures taken to protect
personal data has been added to align with Clinical Trials Regulation requirements 
(Section 8.4).
 Language was added to reflect that quality tolerance limits for monitoring
patient safety and data integrity were established prior to study enrollment (Section
9.3).
 The URL for the Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Study Information has
been updated (Section 9.6).
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
4/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Definitions of hepatotoxicity grades have been updated throughout to reflect the 
Nationa
l Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version
5 (NCI CTCAE v5; Sections D.5.2.2.5, F.5.2.4.2, J.5.2.4.2, I.5.2.2.5, and I.5.2.3).
     It has been clarified that hematology/complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry tests
for the EOT visit do not need to be repeated if done within 7 days prior to treatment 
discontinuation, unless clinically indicated (SOA for all study arms, except Arm C).
 It has been clarified that the blood sample at disease progression may be drawn
within 7 days after disease progression (SOA for all study arms).
 Language has been clarified to indicate that the end of treatment visit must be done
within 28 days after last study dose (SOA for all study arms).
Arm A: Entrectinib
     Note: because no patients were enrolled in this arm and the enrollment period is
 over, no updates were made to this treatment arm during this amendment
(Appendix 10).
 
Arms D, K, L, M: Ipatasertib -specific Changes   
 To account for ipatasertib’s impact on glucose metabolism, instructions for taking 
ipata
sertib have been updated to indicate it should be taken at least 2 hours after 
the last meal of the day, and patients should refrain from eating overnight (Sections
D.4.2.2, K.4.2.2, L.4.2.2, and M.4.2.2).
 Management guidelines for dyslipidemia were added (Section D.5.2.2.9).
 Dermatologic toxicity guidelines for Arms K and L have been clarified (Sections
K.5.2.2.3 and L.5.2.2.3).
 
Arms E, F, J, K, L, N: Atezolizumab -specific Changes   
 The ad v
erse event management guidelines have been updated to align with the
Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure, Version 19, as well as Addendum 1  and 
Addendum 2 to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure, Version 19 (throughout 
sections and associated subsections of Sections E.5.2, F.5.2, J .5.2, K.5.2, L.5.2, and 
N.5.2).  Adverse event management guidelines for overlapping toxicities were also 
updated accordingly (Sections F.5.2.4.1, J.5.2.4.1, K.5.2.2.3, and L.5.2.2.3).
 The list of identified risks for atezolizumab has been revised to include myelitis,
facial paresis, and pericardial disorders. Additionally, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis has been updated from a potential risk to an identified risk asso-
ciated with atezolizumab, and language has been revised accordingly (Sections 
E.5.1.1, F.5.1.2, J.5.1.2, K.5.1.2,  L.5.1.2, and N.5.1.1).
 The list of adverse events of special interest has been revised to include myelitis
and facial paresis (Sections E.5.3, F.5.3, J.5.3, K.5.3, L.5.3, and N.5.3).
 Appendix 8 has been revised to indicate that caution should be used when
considering atezolizumab for patients who have previously experienced a pericardial 
disorder while receiving another immunostimulatory anti-cancer agent.
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
5/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Appendix 8 has been revised to include autoimmune myelitis.  
 
Arm N: Tiragolumab -specific Changes   
 The r e
quired timing for thyroid function testing has been corrected and aligned to
every 4 cycles (e.g. Cycles 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.)  (Section N.6).
     To align with the Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure, Version 7, the potential ri sks 
for tiragolumab have been updated to include lymphopenia and embryofetal
toxicity (Section N.5.1.2).  Additionally, immune-mediated hepatitis has been updated 
to an identified risk associated with tiragolumab (Section N.5.1.2).
 The dose modifications and treatment interruption sections have been moved to
Section N.5.2.2 to align with combination treatment guidance for atezolizumab plus 
tiragolumab.
 Infusion-related reactions and cytokine-release syndrome management have been 
separated to align with the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab adverse event manage-
ment guidelines (Sections N.5.2.2.7 and N.5.2.2.8). 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.  
Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative 
chan ges to the original protocol.

OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple therapies that are selected based on 
potential predictive biomarkers identified in patients with solid tumors.  
EFFICACY  
PRIMARY EFFICACY OBJ ECTIVE  
The primary objective for this study is to eva luate the efficacy of various treatments and/or 
combinations of treatments in eligible patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic solid 
tumors, on the basis of the following endpoint:  
 The primary endpoint for each arm of this study will be confirmed  ORR (cORR) as 
assessed by the investigator and according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 
version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), or Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology [RANO] Criteria

confirmed best response is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for those 
with measurable disease and CR for those with non -measurable disease.   
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
15/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  SECONDARY EFFICACY O BJECTIVE  
The secondary efficacy objectives for this study are  to evaluate the efficacy of each targeted 
treatment on the basis of the following endpoints:  
 Progression -Free Survival (PFS) defined as the time from start of treatment to the first 
occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occu rs first), as 
determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.  
 Duration of objective response  (DOR), defined as the time from the first occurrence of a 
documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause 
(whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 . 
 PFS rate at 3 months during treatment and every 3 months thereafter for at least up to 1 
year, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression 
or death f rom any cause as determined by the investigator, according to RECIST v1.1.   
 Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients whose best response is 
confirmed CR, confirmed partial response ( PR), or a response of CR, PR, stable disease 
(SD), or non -CR/non -progressive disease ( PD) for a minimum of 98 days for 28 -day 
cycle arms or 70 days for 21 -day cycle arms after the first treatment date .   
 
EXPLORATORY EFFICACY  OBJECTIVE  
Exploratory efficacy objectives are to evaluate efficacy based foll owing the following:  
 Analysis of primary and secondary efficacy endpoints when subgrouped by basket, tumor 
site of origin, and/or self -reported race and ethnicity.  
 
SAFETY OBJECTIVE  
The safety objective for this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerab ility of the study 
medications for the tumor types studied based on the following endpoints:  
 Incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version  5.0 
(NCI CTCAE [v5.0])  
 Change from baseline in targeted clinical laboratory test results  
 
BIOMARKERS OBJECTIVE  
The exploratory biomarker objective for this study is to identify and/or evaluate biomarkers that 
are early surrogates of efficacy or relapse, are  associated with a more severe disease state 
(i.e., prognostic biomarkers), are associated wit h acquired resistance to study drug(s), or can 
increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety, on the basis of 
the following endpoin t: 
 The association of baseline and changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels with 
response and progression to therapy.  
 Determination of baseline and changes in expression or levels of biomarkers in the tumor 
tissue or blood that may be associated wit h response or resistance to therapy.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DE SIGN  
MyTACTIC is a Phase II, multicenter, non -randomized, open -label, multi -arm study designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies as single a gents or in rational, 
specified combinations in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors 
determined to harbor specific biomarkers.  Patients will be enrolled based on local testing 
performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendm ents (CLIA) -certified or equivalently 
accredited diagnostic laboratory.  For all patients whose positive biomarker result is from an 
assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), central 
testing of pre -treatment tissue  (preferably from the most recent block) and blood is required 
after enrollment.  Pre -treatment tissue will be submitted within 21 days after enrollment to a 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
16/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Sponsor -approved laboratory for central testing; this testing will not impact the study 
participat ion of enrolled patients.   
The multi -arm structure of the MyTACTIC study allows patients with solid tumors to be treated 
with a drug or drug regimen tailored to their biomarker identified at screening.  Each study 
treatment arm may have separate endpoints , screening, and treatment requirements, defined 
in the respective appendix.  Futility analyses will be employed on all treatment arms to limit 
enrollment where evidence of very limited or lack of efficacy is observed.  
During the study, the following bioma rker samples will be collected:  
Tumor tissue  
 For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based 
assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples (archival or recent resection or 
biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If 
both archival and recent tissue is available, the recent tissue should b e preferentially 
submitted.  
Blood samples  
 Mandatory blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment, and 
at disease progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA  
 
These samples will be used to evaluate predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers, including but 
not limited to biomarkers related to driver oncogene signaling, response to study treatment, 
tumor pathogenesis, and mechanisms of resistance.  
Treatment will be assigned by the treating invest igator on the basis of relevant specified 
biomarkers, and will continue until radiographic disease progression (per RECIST v1.1; 
Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) Criteria for primary CNS tumors, or loss of 
clinical benefit for specific treatmen t arms, upon Medical Monitor consultation ; unacceptable 
toxicity; patient or physician decision to discontinue; or death, whichever occurs first.  If a 
patient discontinues treatment prior to disease progression (because of adverse event or other 
reason), tumor assessments will continue as specified in the treatment -specific appendix until 
disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or arm/study closure by the Sponsor, 
whichever occurs first.   
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) or the 
timeline for the screening window may qualify for re -screening at the investigator's discretion.  
Patients must re -sign the consent form prior to rescreening.  The investigator will record 
reasons for screen failure in  the screening log.   
 
NUMBER OF PATIENTS  
Approximately 260 patients are anticipated to be enrolled at approximately 60 sites.  Each arm 
will be limited to approximately 25 patients, with the exception of Arms M and O, which will  be

STATISTICAL METHODS  
PRIMARY ANALYSIS  
The primary endpoint for this study will be cORR as assessed by the investigator and 
according to the corresponding assessment criteria (RECIST v1.1 or RANO).  The cORR is 
defined as the proportion of patients whose confirmed best response is a CR or PR fo r those 
 
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
21/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  with measurable disease and CR for those with non -measurable disease.  Confidence 
intervals at both 70% and 95% nominal levels will be reported using the Clopper -Pearson 
method.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be computed for all treatment arms .  If a patient 
receives at least one dose of study treatment and discontinues the study for any reason before 
confirmed response can be assessed, the patient will be considered a non -responder (not PR 
and not CR) and will be added to the denominator of th e computation of cORR.   
DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE   
The focus for this study will be estimation since the study is composed of many single arms 
specific to a targeted therapy.  Estimation of the primary endpoint will be 95% confidence 
intervals using t he Clopper -Pearson method.  As such, the maximum margin of error for 
sample sizes 25, 50, and 75 are 20.7%, 14.5%, and 11.8%, respectively.  On a per arm basis, 
if the lower bound of the confidence interval is larger than a benchmark specific to that arm, 
then we will consider the given treatment as a significant improvement over the benchmark.   
INTERIM ANALYSES  
Non-binding Futility Analyses  
For some arms, limited data are available regarding the efficacy and safety of the treatment 
across the eligible tu mor population(s).  Therefore, data from the first 12  efficacy -evaluable 
patients in a given arm will be used to conduct non -binding interim tumor agnostic futility 
analyses.  Futility analyses for some arms may be conducted with the integration of data fr om 
other ongoing studies (see the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP] for details).  These analyses 
may be used to identify whether a treatment may be ineffective in a tumor agnostic population 
due to limited or lack of efficacy, and further accrual into such an arm may be stopped.  
Enrollment will not be stopped while awaiting results of the tumor agnostic futility analysis.  To 
perform the analysis we will use Bayesian gating with arm -specific gating criteria and non -
informative prior where futility will be d eclared if there is a posterior probability of greater than 
60% that the true cORR is less than an arm -specific unacceptable level.  
Optional Interim Analyses  
Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may choose to conduct 
additional  interim efficacy analyses.  The decision to conduct an optional interim analysis and 
the timing of the analysis will be documented in the Sponsor's trial master file prior to the 
conduct of the interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed and  interpreted by 
Sponsor study team personnel.

60/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1. BACKGROUND  
Oncology is rapidly evolving into a more personalized healthcare approach.  Improved 
understanding of the role of cancer biomarkers, further development of 
molecular -targeted therapies, and the standardization of appropriate targeted treatment 
into treatment guidelines have shifted clinical practice to utilize genomic information as 
an integral component of clinical decision -making (Kris et al. 2014; Barlesi et al. 2016).  
Therapies that specifically target actionable oncogenic drivers have become the 
cornerstone of precision oncology.  
Currently, targeted agents are approved for u se in specific cancer types (as defined by 
primary site), or a subset of that population harboring the specific molecular alteration.  
Usually, targeted agents have been approved in the cancer types that most frequently 
carry the specific molecular target.   However, it is now clear that molecular alterations 
can be found in cancers from other primary sites, although often at low incidence levels.  
The potential therapeutic importance of these abnormalities is not clear, although 
anecdotal reports have docum ented activity with the investigational use of appropriate 
targeted therapy (Cappuzzo et al. 2006; Masago et al. 2009; LoRusso et al. 2011; 
Masago et al. 2011; Kelly et al. 2012; Minor et al. 2012).  With the relative rarity of these 
alterations (usually  5%) in any specific cancer type, it is difficult to identify sufficient 
patients for clinical trials.  
With these recent advancements, numerous platforms have been developed to survey 
the cancer cell genome and detect critical molecular alterations.  With  increased 
molecular profiling, gene alterations for which a targeted agent exists, or are associated 
with improved efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, are being identified more frequently 
in tumor types for which these agents are currently not approved.  These findings 
present a new opportunity to test the efficacy of available targeted agents and 
immunotherapies.  
In addition, there have been recent drug approvals in pan -tumor indications paving the 
way for registration for molecular alterations in multipl e tumor types.  
For example, entrectinib (Rozlytrek ) was approved in the United States based on the 
results in 51 adult patients across three clinical trials.  A pooled analysis of 3 Phase I -II 
studies investigating patients with locally -advanced or metastatic ROS1 fusion -positive 
non-small -cell lung cancer demonstrated that treatment with entrectinib induced a 
durable and clinically meaningful response.  Among the efficacy -evaluable patients, 77% 
had an objective response, with a median duration of r esponse of 24.6 months (95% CI 
11.4-34.8) (Drilon et al. 2020).  The same analysis investigated patients with metastatic 
or locally advanced solid tumors harboring a fusion in the NTRK gene (NTRK1, NTRK2, 
or NTRK3), comprising of 10 different tumor types a nd 19 different histologies.  Similarly, 
treatment with entrectinib demonstrated a durable and clinically meaningful response, 
showing Entrectinib to be a viable treatment option for patients with NTRK 
 
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
61/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  fusion -positive solid tumors.  An objective response w as observed in 57% of the 
evaluable patients (95%CI 43.2 -70.8), with 4 complete responses and 27 partial 
responses.  The median duration of response was 10 months (95% CI 7.1 to NE), 
(Doebele et al. 2019 ).  
Tumor mutational burden has been associated with treatment outcomes with cytotoxic 
Tlymphocyte -associated protein 4  (CTLA -4) and programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -L1) 
inhibitors.  Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) was granted accelerated approval by the FDA for 
the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic tumor 
mutational burden -high (TMB -H) solid tumors, defined as 10 mutations/megabase 
(mut/Mb).  The Phase II basket study of pem brolizumab monotherapy in this patient 
population demonstrated that TMB -H was associated with higher response rates in a 
number of different unresectable or metastatic tumor types, suggesting that tumor 
mutational burden (TMB) may predict efficacy of pembr olizumab treatment.  
In addition to testing targeted therapies in a pan -tumor setting, this study aims to expand 
study access to patients that are traditionally underrepresented in clinical trials.  
Classical registrational clinical trials often underrepre sent patients of color, with data 
indicating that 88% of genetic sequencing/association studies have been done in 
individuals of European decent.  In addition, industry study design standards may 
unintentionally prevent diverse patients from being enrolled , as most studies include 
certain inclusion/exclusion criteria that tend to exclude people of specific ethnicities.  
This study will focus on inclusion of underrepresented, understudied patients with 
broader entry criteria and with an emphasis on recruitin g patients of color to ensure this 
study reflects the US population more accurately.  
Specific biomarkers of interest for this protocol and their respective targeted therapies 
are outlined in Table  1.  Background and rationale for the biomarkers and the associated 
targeted therapies, are provided in the sections below.

64/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE FOR 
MOLECULARLY -TARGETED  THERAPIES  
Cancer treatment is evolving toward a more personalized approach where the 
intersection of genomics, pathology, and cla ssical imaging methods lead to 
individualized cancer care.  As novel genomic alterations and other biomarkers are 
identified, research evolves and leads to customized targeted treatments.  A clinical trial 
matching therapy choice to tumor biomarkers has th e potential to yield valuable clinical 
information and provide meaningful treatment options for patients.  
1.1.1  Arm A:  Entrectinib Treatment for Tumors with ROS1 Gene 
Fusions  
ROS1 belongs to the insulin -receptor superfamily.  Upon activation, it plays a role i n 
relaying cell signals from the extracellular environment to the nucleus thereby promoting 
cell proliferation and cell survival.  ROS1 gene rearrangements create fusion proteins 
with constitutively active kinase domains that then activate downstream cell signaling 
pathways.  These pathways include Ras/ERK for cellular proliferation and the JAK -STAT 
and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase ( PI3K )/AKT pathways, which regulate cell survival (anti -
apoptosis) and proliferation.  ROS 1 fusion proteins may also activate the mammalian 
target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway, which is critical for the regulation  of protein 
translation.  Cancers that have these pathways activated tend to be more aggressive, 
with invasion and metastasis leading to poor survival for patients (Davies an d Doebele 
2013).  
ROS1 fusion partners have been identified in patients with non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and ROS1 gene rearrangements have also been detected in other tumor 
types including glioblastoma multiforme, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer,  gastric 
adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, angiosarcoma, 
and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (Davies et al. 2012; Davies and Doebele 2013; 
Lee et al. 2013; Shaw et al. 2013).  The prevalence of ROS1 gene fusions across  solid 
tumors excluding NSCLC is ~0.05% (Hartmaier et al. 2017; Foundation Medicine 2019).  
Several small -molecule inhibitors have been developed to treat tumors harboring ROS1 
oncogenic fusion kinases (e.g., the ROS1 inhibitors crizotinib and entrectinib, which 
have demonstrated targeted activity against lung cancers harboring ROS1 gene 
rearrangements).  
Crizotinib (Xalkori, Pfizer) was approved in the United States on the basis of results of a 
single -arm study of 50 patients (Shaw et al. 2014).  The majori ty of patients had received 
some prior therapy for the treatment of NSCLC, although 14% were reported to be 
treatment na ïve.  Almost all patients had ROS1 fusions identified using a fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) assay from a tissue sample.  The  objective response rate 
(ORR) in this study was 72% (95% CI: 58%, 84%), with 3 complete responses and 
33 partial responses.  The median duration of response (DOR) was 17.6 months (95% 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
65/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  CI: 14.5, not reached), and the median progression -free survival (PFS) was 19.2 months 
(95% CI: 14.4 months, not reached) (Shaw et al. 2014).  
Entrectinib (Rozlytrek ) was approved for ROS1 -postive NSCLC in the United States 
based on the results in 53 adult patients across three clinical trials.  Entrectinib is a 
potent inhib itor of the ROS1 tyrosine kinase with an IC50 of 0.2 nM (see Entrectinib 
Investigator's Brochure).  In ROS1 fusion -positive NSCLC, patients treated with 
entrectinib had clinically meaningful and durable systemic responses.  The majority of 
patients had rec eived prior therapy for the treatment of their disease.  The ORR was 
77.4% (95% CI: 63.8, 87.7) with a median DOR of 24.6 months (95% CI: 11.4, 34.8).  
Patients with CNS metastases at baseline had an intracranial ORR of 55.0%, with 
4 patients having a comp lete response (20.0%), and a median intracranial DOR of 
12.6 months (Drilon et al. 2020).  
Entrectinib has demonstrated clinical activity across multiple tumor types including 
colorectal, NSCLC, pancreatic, thyroid, breast, sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, mamm ary 
analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC), neuroendocrine tumors, and gynecological 
etiology in NTRK gene fusion -positive cancers (Demetri et al. 2018).  Entrectinib was 
also approved in the United States for adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and  
older who have solid tumors that harbor a NTRK gene fusion, based on the results 
across three clinical trials.  As entrectinib is a potent inhibitor of both NTRK and ROS1 
tyrosine kinase domains, it is hypothesized that therapeutic effects may be observed  in 
patients who harbor ROS1 gene fusions, regardless of tumor type.  Given that multiple 
tumor responses have been observed among different tumor types that harbor NTRK 
gene fusions, and the ability for entrectinib to cross the blood -brain barrier, entrec tinib 
potentially presents a favorable option for patients whose tumors harbor ROS1 gene 
fusions outside of NSCLC.  
1.1.2  Arm B:  Inavolisib (GDC -0077) Treatment for Tumors with 
PI3Kalpha (PIK3CA) Activating Mutations  
Phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3K) is a li pid kinase that upon activation by growth 
factor receptors and integrins regulates cell proliferation, survival, and migration.  PI3K 
catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol -4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2) to 
generate phosphatidylinositol -3,4,5 -triphosphate (PIP 3), a second messenger involved in 
the phosphorylation of AKT and other components in the AKT/mTOR pathway (Cantley 
2002; Guertin and Sabatini 2007).  PI3K and its downstream effectors, AKT and mTOR, 
are major nodes in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signali ng pathway and are critical for cell -cycle 
modulation, cell growth, metabolism, motility, and survival (Cantrell  2001; Hanahan and 
Weinberg 2011; Vanhaesebroeck et al. 2012).  
Dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through multiple different 
mechanisms has been described in solid tumor malignancies, including activating and 
transforming mutations, as well as amplification, of PIK3CA  – the gene that encodes the 
p110 alpha subunit of PI3K (Gustin et al. 2008; Yuan and Cantley 2008; Courtney et a l. 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
66/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  2010).  Activating mutations in the PIK3CA  gene occur primarily in exons 9 and 20 
(“hotspot” regions) that encode the helical and kinase domains of the alpha isoform of 
the PI3K protein (Bachman et al. 2004; Samuels  et al. 2004).  It is estimated that s uch 
activating mutations occur in ~11% of solid tumors (Roche, data on file).  
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) is a potent selective inhibitor of the Class  I PI3K alpha isoform, 
with  300-fold less potent biochemical inhibition for other Class I PI3Ks, including the 
beta, delta, and gamma isoforms, and increased activity in tumor cells bearing mutated 
PIK3CA over wild type (WT) PIK3CA cells.  Inavolisib (GDC -0077)  exerts its activity by 
binding to the ATP binding site of PI3K, thereby inhibiting the phosphorylati on of 
membrane -bound PIP 2 to PIP 3.  Inhibiting the phosphorylation of PIP 2 to PIP 3 decreases 
downstream activation of AKT and S6, resulting in decreased cellular proliferation, 
metabolism, and angiogenesis.  Nonclinical studies demonstrate that inavolisib (GDC -
0077) also induces specific degradation of mutated p110 alpha, inhibits proliferation and 
induces apoptosis of PIK3CA -mutation positive breast cancer cell lines, inhibits tumor 
growth in human breast xenograft models harboring PIK3CA  mutations, and re duces 
downstream PI3K -pathway markers, including pAKT, pPRAS40, and pS6.  
PI3K inhibition is an attractive target for clinical drug development because of the 
frequency of mutations observed across multiple tumor types in the PI3K -AKT-mTOR 
pathway (Massaces i 2016).  Clinical trials, including SOLAR -1 (Phase III, alpelisib) and 
SANDPIPER (Phase III, taselisib), have demonstrated the anti -tumor activity of PI3K  
inhibitors in tumor types including estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers 
harboring PIK3C A mutations.  More recently, a Phase I/Ib study of inavolisib (Study 
GO39374) has shown preliminary, encouraging safety and anti -tumor activity in 
PIK3CAmutation -positive, hormone receptor positive (HR+)/ human epidermal growth 
factor receptor 2 negative ( HER2 –) metastatic breast cancer.  
With increasing evidence for the utility of PI3K  inhibitors in tumors that harbor one or 
more PIK3CA  mutations, further research of this drug class that includes patients whose 
tumors have one or more PIK3CA  mutations is warranted.  
1.1.3  Arm C:  Alectinib Treatment for Tumors with ALK Gene Fusion  
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively activated in 
some cancers due to gene alterations, including chromosomal rearrangements.  Many 
different ALK  fusion partners have been identified in a variety of tumor types including 
but not limited to lung cancer, Spitz tumors, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMT), 
thyroid cancer, digestive tract cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (Cao et 
al. 2019).  The formation of ALK fusion proteins results in activation and dysregulation of 
the gene’s expression and signaling, which can contribute to increased cell proliferation 
and survival in tumors expressing these genes.  ALK gene alterations are gen erally in a 
mutually exclusive relationship with mutations in EGFR or KRAS (Soda et al. 2007; 
Inamura et al. 2008, 2009; Wong et al. 2009), although EGFR mutations may develop as 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
67/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  a resistance mechanism after treatment with crizotinib, an inhibitor of ROS1 activation 
(Doebele et al. 2012).   
While the ALK fusions have been observed in many tumor types, the prevalence of 
these translocations is approximately 5% in NSCLC versus only ~0.1% 0.2% in 
non-NSCLC solid tumors (Hartmaier et al. 2017; Ross et al. 2017;  Foundation Medicine 
2019).  Consequently, ALK inhibitor development has been largely limited to NSCLC.   
Crizotinib, was the first ALK inhibitor approved for ALK -positive NSCLC demonstrating 
improvement in PFS and ORR over chemotherapy; however, no differ ence in overall 
survival (OS) was noted between the two groups (Shaw et al. 2013, Solomon et al. 
2014).   
Next-generation ALK inhibitors were designed to overcome two major limitations of 
crizotinib treatment: the development of resistance because of secon dary 
(e.g.,  gatekeeper) mutations (predominantly in ALK or occasionally in other genes, such 
as EGFR, cKIT, or KRAS) (Katayama et al. 2011; Doebele et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2013) 
and CNS relapse (crizotinib has poor control of brain metastases compared to o ther 
sites).  Thus next -generation ALK inhibitors may offer patients a better chance of 
prolonged remission and minimize the development of CNS metastases and the 
attendant comorbidity.  
Alectinib (Alecensa) is a small -molecule, highly selective, and pote nt oral 
next-generation ALK inhibitor with a benzo[b]carbazole scaffold.  In enzyme inhibition 
assays performed in vitro, this compound has been shown to selectively inhibit ALK and 
RET.  The compound also shows high anti -tumor activity both in vitro and i n vivo against 
tumor cell lines with some type of somatic ALK gene mutation, including NSCLC and 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma lines harboring an ALK translocation and a 
neuroblastoma line harboring an amplified ALK gene.  Alectinib shows good exposure in 
the brain, demonstrated in rodents, and is not a substrate of efflux transporters in the 
blood -brain barrier, such as P -gp, and therefore is able to distribute into and be retained 
within the CNS.   
While ALK fusions are rare in tumors other than non -squamous NSCLC, in vivo studies 
and clinical case reports suggest that ALK inhibition could be an interesting treatment 
approach for such patients.  Cases of clinical responses have also been reported with 
alectin ib treatment in patients with various solid tumors including papillary renal cell 
carcinoma (Pal et al. 2018), metastatic inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (Honda et 
al. 2019; Saiki et al. 2017), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma 
(Huang et al. 2018; Mayesaya et al. 2017), and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma 
(Shimizu et al. 2019).  This promising clinical activity in non -NSCLC tumors supports 
further investigation in this population in which ALK oncogenic fusions are particularl y 
rare. 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
68/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1.4  Arm D:  Ipatasertib Treatment for Tumors with AKT Gene 
Activating Mutations or PTEN Loss or Loss of Function  
AKT is one of the most frequently activated protein kinases in human cancers, and plays 
a critical role in tumor growth, proliferation, met abolism, survival, and resistance to 
therapy (Bellacosa et al. 1995; Manning and Cantley 2007; Jiang and Liu 2008; 
Tokunaga et al. 2008; Robey and Hay 2009).  AKT is encoded by three closely related 
gene isoforms in the mammalian genome, AKT1 , AKT2  and AKT3.  AKT is the central 
node of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and is negatively regulated by the tumor 
suppressor PTEN, a phospholipid phosphatase that negatively regulates the activity of 
PI3K.  Most commonly found alterations in solid and liquid tumors inclu de the loss of 
PTEN, activating and transforming mutations in the p110  subunit of PI3K, deregulation 
of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and oncogenic Ras mutations.  Alterations in AKT 
itself, including overexpression and amplification of individual AKT isoforms, as well as 
an E17K mutation in the PH domain of AKT1  that results in PI3K -independent 
membrane recruitment of AKT1, have been identified in a subset of human cancers 
(reviewed in Bellacosa et al. 2005; Brugge et al. 2007; Tokunaga et al. 2008) .  All of 
these mechanisms of pathway activation ultimately funnel through AKT as the central 
node that drives cell survival, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism, and 
migration (Manning and Cantley 2007).  The prevalence of AKT1/2/3  gene activa ting 
mutations or genomic alterations resulting in PTEN  loss or loss of function has not been 
fully characterized, but may occur in ~13% of solid tumors (Roche, data on file).  
Ipatasertib is a potent, highly selective small -molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of 
the serine/threonine kinase AKT.  Ipatasertib binds to the activated conformation of AKT 
and is ATP competitive.  Ipatasertib binding inhibits the kinase activity of AKT and 
suppresses the phosphorylation of its direct substrates, including PRA S40, and 
additional downstream targets, such as S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), resulting in G1 
arrest and/or apoptosis in human cancer cells (Lin et al. 2012).  In clinical tumor 
samples, robust AKT pathway inhibition by ipatasertib can be achieved at clinic ally 
relevant doses (Yan et al. 2013).  
In nonclinical models with high levels of phosphorylated AKT or PI3K/AKT pathway 
activity (i.e., PIK3CA  mutation, PTEN  alterations), sensitivity to ipatasertib has been 
observed across different tumor models (Lin et a l. 2013).  
Study PAM4743g was an open -label, Phase I, dose -escalation study designed to assess 
the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipatasertib as a single agent in 
patients with refractory solid tumors (Saura et al. 2018).  Fifty -two pat ients across 
multiple tumor types, including metastatic breast cancer, castration -resistant prostate 
cancer, colorectal cancer, chondrosarcoma, and ovarian cancer, were enrolled into 
respective tumor -specific cohorts regardless of mutation status.  Across all dosing 
cohorts, 16 of 47 (34%) of patients had a best overall response of stable disease (SD) or 
incomplete response (IR).  The anti -tumor activity of single -agent ipatasertib in a patient 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
69/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  population whose tumors are AKT mutation positive or exhibit PTEN loss or loss of 
function is currently unknown.  
Additionally, in a Phase II randomized, placebo -controlled study, ipatasertib plus 
paclitaxel as first -line therapy demonstrated improved PFS in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic triple negative adenocarcinoma of the breast ( TNBC ) compared 
to paclitaxel alone (Kim et al. 2017).  In the ipatasertib group, median PFS was 6.2 
months (95% CI 3.8 9) versus 4.9 months (95% CI 3.6 5.4) with placebo (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0.6, 95% CI 0.37 0.98; p=0.037).  In a subset of the study population, patients with 
PTEN -low tumors by immunohistochemistry [IHC] had a median PFS of 6.2 months 
(95% CI 3.6 9.1) with ipatasertib versus 3.7 months (95% CI), median PFS was 6.2 
months (95% CI 3.6 9.1) with ipatasertib versus 3. 7 months with placebo (HR 0.59, 95% 
CI 0.261.32; p=0.18).  These promising results support further investigation in patients 
with tumors harboring activating AKT1/2/3 gene activating mutations or genomic 
alterations resulating in PTEN loss or loss of func tion alterations.  
Based on the scientific rationale that PI3K/AKT/mTOR blockade reduces survival signals 
and acceptable safety profile observed to date, treating patients with solid tumors that 
harbor such alterations with ipatasertib warrants further inve stigation.  
1.1.5  Arm E:  Atezolizumab plus Chemotherapy for Tumors with 
Tumor Mutational Burden 10/Microsatellite Instability High 
/Deficient Mismatch Repair  
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can 
result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies (Hodi et al. 
2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012).   
The PD -L1 pathway serves as an immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune 
responses in states of chronic antigen stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer.  
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that dow nregulates immune responses through binding 
to its two receptors, programmed cell death protein  1 (PD -1) and B7 -1.  PD -1 is an 
inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation, and expression is 
sustained in states of chronic stimulatio n (Blank et al. 2005; Keir et al. 2008).  B7 -1 is a 
molecule expressed on antigen -presenting cells and activated T cells.  Binding of PD -L1 
to PD -1 and B7 -1 inhibits T -cell proliferation and activation, cytokine production, and 
cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells (Butte et al. 
2007; Yang et al. 2011).  Therefore, interruption of the PD -L1 pathway represents an 
attractive strategy for restoring tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 mo noclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), 
both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizum ab has been shown to enhance the magnitude 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
70/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  and quality of tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity 
(Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab has minimal binding 
to Fc receptors, thus eliminating dete ctable Fc -effector function and associated 
antibody -mediated clearance of activated effector T cells.  
In recent years, PD -L1/PD -1 inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in patients 
with advanced malignancies who have failed standard of care therap y and agents have 
shown activity across a broad range of tumor types.  For example, in patients treated 
with atezolizumab, objective responses have been across a broad range of tumor types, 
including urothelial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, co lorectal cancer, head 
and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma (see Atezolizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure for detailed efficacy results).  Additionally, pembrolizumab has 
been approved in a tumor -agnostic setting based on mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) 
or microsatellite instability high (MSI -H) as well as TMB  10 mutations per megabase.  
A growing body of evidence points to higher TMB and MSI -H/dMMR being correlated 
with better clinical outcomes with checkpoint inhibitor therapies.  Th e higher mutational 
burden in these tumors likely produces an array of immunogenic neoantigens that 
renders greater sensitivity to the effects of the immune system (Schumacher and 
Schreiber 2015).  Evidence in a variety of cancer types suggests that patien ts with a 
high burden of somatic mutations derive significant clinical benefit from anti -PD1/PD -L1 
therapy.  Multiple clinical studies have reported that high TMB is associated with 
response to several immunotherapeutic agents, including anti - CTLA -4 in me lanoma 
(Snyder et al. 2014; Johnson et al. 2016), anti PD-L1 therapy in bladder cancer 
(Rosenberg et al. 2016), and anti PD-1 therapy in lung and colorectal cancers (Le et al. 
2015; Rizvi et al. 2015; Fehrenbacher et al. 2016).  In a Phase II signal -seekin g study, 
patients with advanced solid tumors who had progressed on or were intolerant to 
standard therapy, were treated with pembrolizumab.  The ORR was 30.3% in patients 
with tissue TMB elevated tumors compared with 6.7% in patients with non -high TMB 
(Marabelle et al. 2019).   
Combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy has been demonstrated to have a 
synergistic effect and enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes beyond those 
achieved with each therapy alone.  It is thought that tumor cell killing by  cytotoxic 
chemotherapy may expose the immune system to increased levels of tumor antigens, 
and unblocking tumor -specific T -cell immunity in this setting by inhibiting PD -L1/PD -1 
signaling may result in synergistic activity.  Anti PD-L1/PD -1 therapies have  been 
approved in the United States across a broad range of indications including in 
combination with taxane or fluorpyrimidine chemotherapies.  Given the promising activity 
of checkpoint inhibition in MSI -H/dMMR and TMB -H tumors and the synergistic effect s 
and acceptable safety profile observed in combination with chemotherapy, further study 
of atezolizumab in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capecitabine is warranted in 
a tumor -agnostic setting.

71/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1.6  HER2 Targeted Therapy for HER2 -Positive Tumors  
The ERBB2 gene, which encodes HER2, a member of the erbB family of receptor 
tyrosine kinases, has been described as a key proto -oncogene  in solid tumors (Slamon 
et al. 1989; Slamon et al. 1987).  Approximately 6% of all solid tumor samples tested at 
Founda tion Medicine have demonstrated amplification or activating alterations in HER2 
(Foundation Medicine database, Q1 2020).  Until recently, development of HER2 -
targeted therapies has been focused in HER2 -overexpessing tumors, with approved 
indications in bre ast and gastric cancers.  More recently, there has been interest in the 
potential oncogenic effect of HER2  somatic mutations and targeting of HER2 -mutation 
positive tumors (Bose et al. 2013; Cousin et al. 2018; Li et al. 2015).   
HER2 activating mutations including insertions/deletions and point mutations in the 
kinase, transmembrane, and extracellular domains occur across solid tumors and have 
been identified as oncogenic drivers (Connell & Doherty 2017; Cousin et al. 2018; 
Wen et al. 2015).  HER2 mutation s occur at a prevalence of 1.48% in solid tumors 
(Hartmaier et al. 2017; Foundation Medicine 2019), and the majority of tumors do not 
have co -occurring HER2  mutations and HER2  amplification.  HER2  mutations occur in 
as many as 10% of bladder cancers and at  meaningful frequencies in more common 
tumors including lung, breast, gastric and colorectal cancers, among many others.   
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated activity of HER2 -targeted therapies in HER2  
mutation -positive solid tumors including of neratin ib, afatinib, dacomitinib, and 
trastuzumab in HER2  mutation -positive lung and breast cancer cell lines (Engelman et 
al. 2007; Greulich et al. 2012; Lee et al. 2006; Li et al. 2008; Shimamura et al. 2006; 
Wang et al. 2006).  Nonclinical models have shown th e inhibitory effects of single -agent 
trastuzumab on HER2  mutation -positive lung cancer cell lines (Greulich et al. 2012; 
Wang et al. 2006) and clinical series of patients with HER2 mutation -positive lung cancer 
have reported high response rates from trastu zumab -based therapy (Cappuzzo et al. 
2006; Mazieres et al. 2013).  
In the clinical setting, responses have been seen in patients with HER2  mutation -positive 
solid tumors who were treated with HER2 -targeting therapies including epidermal growth 
factor recep tor (EGFR) -targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (summarized in Connell and 
Doherty 2017) and trastuzumab emtansine (Li et al. 2018).  An ORR of 44% was 
observed in patients with HER2  mutation -positive lung cancers treated with trastuzumab 
emtansine (Li et a l 2018).  
Activating HER2 mutations have demonstrated increased tumorgenicity, invasiveness 
and survival compared with non -HER2 amplified cells (Wang et al. 2006; Bose et al. 
2013).  HER2  amplification and activating mutations occur across tumor types and 
nonclinical and clinical evidence suggests that tumors that harbor these alterations may 
be vulnerable to HER2 -targeted therapy.  This evidence, combined with the relatively 
low prevalence of HER2  alterations outside of breast, supports further assessment of the 
efficacy of HER2 -targeted therapies in a tumor -agnostic fashion.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
72/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1.6.1  Arm F:  Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Atezolizumab for 
HER2 -Positive Tumors (without knownTMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR)  
Trastuzumab emtansine (known as ado -trastuzumab emtansine in the United States ) is 
a novel antibody -drug conjugate (ADC), specifically designed for the treatment of 
HER2 -positive cancer.  It is composed of the following components:  trastuzumab, a 
humanized antibody directed against the extracellular region of HER2; DM1, an 
anti-microtubule agent derived from maytansine; and succinimidyl 4[ -Nmaleimidomethyl] 
cyclohexane -1-carboxylate (SMCC), a thioether linker molecule used to conjugate DM1 
to trastuzumab.  Trastuzumab emtansine binds to HER2 with an affinity similar to that of 
uncon jugated trastuzumab.  It is hypothesized that after binding to HER2, trastuzumab 
emtansine undergoes receptor -mediated internalization, resulting in intracellular release 
of DM1 and subsequent cell death.  DM1 is an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization; it binds 
to tubulin competitively with vinca - alkaloids.  It is thought that trastuzumab emtansine 
provides a dual mechanism of action providing both HER2 targeted inhibition from the 
trastuzumab component along with chemotherapy from DM1.  
Trastuzumab Emtansi ne (T -DM1) therapeutic activity may be accentuated by enhancing 
anti-tumor immunity.  Recently, it was shown that the precursor of DM1, ansamitocin P3 
may potentiate antitumor immunity by inducing maturation of dendritic cells, facilitating 
antigen uptake and the migration of tumor -resident dendritic cells to tumor -draining 
lymph nodes (Martin et al. 2014; Müller et al. 2014).  A HER2 -positive murine model has 
suggested therapeutic efficacy was dependent on T -DM1 induced infiltration by effector 
T-cells.  A fter T -DM1 treatment, tumors became more T -cell–inflamed with an increase 
in γδT -cells that may cooperate with cancer immunotherapy, natural killer (NK) -cells and 
expansion of CD45+ cells.  In addition, paired samples from 28 HER2 -positive breast 
cancer pa tients treated with T -DM1 prior to surgery demonstrated increases in 
tumor -infiltrating T -cells after treatment (Müller et al. 2015).  
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and its  receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), 
both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude 
and quality of tumor -specific T -cell respons es, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity 
(Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab has minimal binding 
to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector function and associated 
antibody -mediated clearance of activated eff ector T cells.  
Evidence suggests that treatment with atezolizumab plus an anti -HER2 therapy could 
have greater anti -cancer activity than either agent alone.  Nonclinical studies have 
shown that trastuzumab inhibition of HER2 -positive tumors could upregula te PD -L1, 
suggesting that trastuzumab and anti -PD-L1 therapy could be more effective against 
HER2 -positive tumors than trastuzumab alone (Chaganty et al 2018) . 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
73/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Superior effectiveness of treatment with T -DM1 plus atezolizumab is also suggested by 
data from clinical studies.  In the KATE2 trial, T -DM1 plus atezolizumab was compared 
to T-DM1 alone in the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer previously treated 
with trastuzumab and a taxane.  In the final safety and clinical activity analysis, overall 
survival was numerically greater in the T -DM1 plus atezolizumab arm over the T -DM1 
only arm (stratified HR 0.74; 95% CI: 0.42 –1.30) (Emens et al. 2019).  This suggests 
that T -DM1 plus atezolizumab alone could have greater anti -tumor activity than T -DM1 
alone.   Furthermore, in KATE2, the safety profile of the combination was consistent with 
the known safety profile of each drug, suggesting tolerability for the combination (see 
treatment -specific appendix for more on risks and adverse event management of the 
treatment combination).  
The presence of TMB -H and/or MSI -H/dMMR status is known to enhance the activity of 
anti-PD-L1/PD -1 targeting agents, but the impact of these biomarkers on the 
combination of T -DM1 plus atezolizumab is not yet well characterized.  Howev er, the 
body of available data suggests that there may be therapeutic benefit to the addition of 
atezolizumab to T -DM1, even in the absence of TMB -H and/or MSI -H/dMMR status.  
With these considerations, and taking into account the acceptable safety profile  
demonstrated in the KATE2 trial, further study of the combination in a tumor -agnostic 
setting is warranted.  
1.1.6.2  Arms G & H:  PH FDC SC with or without Chemotherapy for 
HER2 -Positive Tumors  
The fixed dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab administered 
subcutaneously (PH FDC SC) represents a combination of both anti -HER2 monoclonal 
antibodies along with hyaluronidase in a single drug product and is approved in the 
United States for the  treatment of HER2 positive early stage and metastatic breast 
cancer in combination with chemotherapy.  
Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2 and, 
thereby, blocks ligand -dependent heterodimerization of HER2 with ot her HER family 
members, including EGFR, HER3, and HER4.  As a result, pertuzumab inhibits 
ligand -initiated intracellular signaling through two major signaling pathways, 
mitogen -activated protein (MAP) kinase and PI3K.  Inhibition of these signaling 
pathway s can result in cell growth arrest and apoptosis, respectively.  
Trastuzumab binds to subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein to 
inhibit the ligand -independent, HER2 mediated cell proliferation and PI3K signaling 
pathway in human tumor  cells that overexpress HER2.  
Both pertuzumab and trastuzumab -mediated antibody -dependent cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC) have been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 
overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress  HER2.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
74/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Clinically, dual HER2 inhibition with both pertuzumab and trastuzumab has 
demonstrated superiority over regimens containing trastuzumab alone.  
Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing 
hyaluronan, a polysacc haride found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous 
tissue.  In the doses administered, hyaluronidase in PH FDC SC acts transiently and 
locally.  
The safety profile for HER2 inhibition in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel, or 
capecitabine chem otherapy is known to be acceptable.  Trastuzumab and pertuzumab 
are approved for use in combination with either docetaxel or paclitaxel in HER2 positive 
early stage and metastatic breast cancer and trastuzumab is further approved in 
combination with a regi men containing capecitabine in HER2 positive metastatic gastric 
cancer.  
As noted above, HER2  amplification and activating mutations occur across tumor types 
and nonclinical and clinical evidence suggests that tumors that harbor these alterations 
may be vu lnerable to HER2 -targeted therapy.  The wealth of efficacy and safety data 
supporting HER2 inhibition with or without chemotherapy, along with the relatively low 
prevalence of HER2  alterations outside of breast, supports further assessment of the 
efficacy of dual HER2 -targeted therapies with or without docetaxel, paclitaxel, or 
capecitabine chemotherapy in a tumor -agnostic fashion.  
1.1.6.3  Arm I:  Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Tucatinib for HER2 -
Positive Tumors  
Trastuzumab emtansine (known as ado -trastuzumab emtansin e in the United States) is 
a novel ADC, specifically designed for the treatment of HER2 -positive cancer.  It is 
composed of the following components:  trastuzumab, a humanized antibody directed 
against the extracellular region of HER2; DM1, an ant -microtub ule agent derived from 
maytansine; and SMCC, a thioether linker molecule used to conjugate DM1 to 
trastuzumab.  Trastuzumab emtansine binds to HER2 with an affinity similar to that of 
unconjugated trastuzumab.  It is hypothesized that after binding to HER2 , 
trastuzumab - emtansine undergoes receptor -mediated internalization, resulting in 
intracellular release of DM1 and subsequent cell death.  DM1 is an inhibitor of tubulin 
polymerization; it binds to tubulin competitively with vinca alkaloids.  It is though t that 
trastuzumab emtansine provides a dual mechanism of action providing both HER2 
targeted inhibition from the trastuzumab component along with chemotherapy from DM1.  
Tucatinib is a kinase inhibitor approved in the US in combination with trastuzumab an d 
capecitabine for treatment of adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic 
HER2 -positive breast cancer with or without brain metastases who have received one or 
more prior anti -HER2 -based regimens in the metastatic setting.  Tucatinib prevents  
phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain of the HER2 receptor, preventing 
activation of MAPK and PI3K -AKT signal transduction pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
75/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis.  In addition to the approved indication in 
breast cancer, preclinical data show activity of tucatinib in a variety of tumor type models 
as a single agent and in combination with other HER2 -targeting agents and 
chemotherapy (Peterson et al, 2020).  
The combination of trastuzumab emtansine and tucati nib was examined in a Phase 1b 
study of 57 HER2 positive breast cancer patients (Borges et al, 2018).  The combination 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile at doses of 3.6mg/kg for trastuzumab 
emtansine every 21  days and 300  mg for tucatinib twice per  day.  Additionally, promising 
anti-tumor activity was observed with a response rate of 48%.  
The available clinical and preclinical data support the continued investigation of a dual 
inhibition approach in HER2 positive cancers beyond breast cancer.  The combination of 
trastuzumab emtansine and tucatinib represents a unique opportunity to study the safety 
and efficacy of dual targeting of HER2 with an ADC and kinase inhibitor in a 
tumor -agnostic setting.  
1.1.6.4  Arm J: Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Atezolizumab for HER2 -
Positive and TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR Tumors  
Trastuzumab emtansine (known as ado -trastuzumab emtansine in the United States) is 
a novel ADC, specifically designed for the treatment of HER2 -positive cancer.  It is 
composed of the following components:  trastuz umab, a humanized antibody directed 
against the extracellular region of HER2; DM1, an ant -microtubule agent derived from 
maytansine; and SMCC, a thioether linker molecule used to conjugate DM1 to 
trastuzumab.  Trastuzumab emtansine binds to HER2 with an af finity similar to that of 
unconjugated trastuzumab.  It is hypothesized that after binding to HER2, trastuzumab 
emtansine undergoes receptor -mediated internalization, resulting in intracellular release 
of DM1 and subsequent cell death.  DM1 is an inhibitor  of tubulin polymerization; it binds 
to tubulin competitively with vinca -alkaloids.  It is thought that trastuzumab emtansine 
provides a dual mechanism of action providing both HER2 targeted inhibition from the 
trastuzumab component along with chemotherapy  from DM1.  Overall response rates in 
patients with NSCLC whose tumors contain HER2 amplification, HER2 mutation, and 
HER2 mutation plus amplification have been reported to be similar (approximately 50%) 
when treated with trastuzumab emtansine (Li et al. 2 020).  
Trastuzumab Emtansine (T -DM1) therapeutic activity may be accentuated by enhancing 
anti-tumor immunity.  Recently, it was shown that the precursor of DM1, Ansamitocin P3 
may potentiate antitumor immunity by inducing maturation of dendritic cells, fac ilitating 
antigen uptake and the migration of tumor -resident dendritic cells to tumor -draining 
lymph nodes (Martin et al. 2014; Müller et al. 2014).  A HER2 -positive murine model has 
suggested therapeutic efficacy was dependent on T -DM1 induced infiltratio n by effector 
T-cells.  After T -DM1 treatment, tumors became more T -cell–inflamed with an increase 
in γδT -cells that may cooperate with cancer immunotherapy, NK -cells, and expansion of 
CD45+ cells.  In addition, paired samples from 28 HER2 -positive breast cancer patients 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
76/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  treated with T -DM1 prior to surgery demonstrated increases in tumor -infiltrating T -cells 
after treatment (Müller et al. 2015).  
Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits 
the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), 
both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells.  Therapeutic 
blockade of PD -L1 binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude 
and quality of tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity 
(Fehrenbacher et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab has minimal binding 
to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector function and associated 
antibody -mediated clearance of acti vated effector T cells.  
Evidence suggests that treatment with atezolizumab plus an anti -HER2 therapy could 
have greater anti -cancer activity than either agent alone.  Nonclinical studies have 
shown that trastuzumab inhibition of HER2 -positive tumors could  upregulate PD -L1, 
suggesting that trastuzumab and anti -PD-L1 therapy could be more effective against 
HER2 -positive tumors than trastuzumab alone (Chaganty et al. 2018) . 
In the KATE2 trial, the addition of atezolizumab to T -DM1 did not demonstrate a 
meanin gful PFS benefit in the intent -to-treat (ITT) population; however, an exploratory 
analysis  suggested a PFS benefit for the combination in the PD -L1+ (PD -L1 IC 1%) 
subgroup (HR, 0.60 [95% CI: 0.32, 1.11]) [L. Emens et al, SABCS 2018].  Additionally, at 
the second planned interim OS analysis, a lthough the number of OS events were small, 
the results suggested an OS benefit with atezolizumab plus T -DM1 in the PD -L1 immune 
cells positive (IC+) subgroup (1 -year survival rate of 94% vs 88%) (Emens et al. 
2019).   While  the magnitude of the benefit is uncertain given the limited number of 
patients in this subgroup, and the corresponding wide confidence intervals, these results 
suggest that T -DM1 plus atezolizumab could have greater anti -tumor activity than 
T-DM1 alo ne in patients with PD -L1+ (PD -L1 IC  1%) metastatic breast cancer.   The 
incidence of Grade 3 to 5 adverse events was generally similar between the 2 arms.  
Overall, the safety profile of the combination was consistent with what is already known 
about the  individual drugs, with no new safety signals,  suggesting tolerability for the 
combination (see treatment -specific appendix for more on risks and adverse event  
management of the treatment combination).  
The presence of TMB -H and/or MSI -H/dMMR status is known to enhance the activity of 
anti-PD1/PD -L1 targeting agents, but the impact of these biomarkers on the combination 
of T-DM1 plus atezolizumab is not yet well characterized.  The occurrence of dual 
positive biomarkers across tumor types is known to be low (Roche internal analysis) and 
therefore, taking into account the acceptable safety profile demonstrated in the KATE2 
trial, a tumor -agnostic approach to further investigate the combination of these agen ts is 
warranted in this study.

77/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1.7  Arms K and L: Ipatasertib Plus Atezolizumab for PI3K 
Activating Mutations or AKT Activating Mutation and/or PTEN 
Loss/Loss of Function  
AKT is the central node of the PI3K -Akt-mTOR signaling axis and represents a major 
downst ream effector of receptor tyrosine kinases.  Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway 
results in essential cellular functions including cell survival, growth, and proliferation, 
which are properties that underlie human cancers.  The PI3K/Akt pathway can be 
activated through loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) 
(Li et al. 1997), through activating mutations and/or amplifications in PIK3CA (Bachman 
et al. 2004), or through activating mutations in AKT1 (Carpten et al. 2007).  
The PD -L1 pathway serves as an immune checkpoint to temporarily dampen immune 
responses in states of chronic antigen stimulation, such as chronic infection or cancer.  
Blockade of the pathway has shown to be effective in many cancer types.   
Ipatasertib (GDC -0068) is  a novel, selective, ATP -competitive small molecule inhibitor of 
all three isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and the mechanism of action and 
rationale for use as a single agent is described in Section  1.1.4 .  Atezolizumab is a 
humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits the interaction 
between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), bo th of which 
function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T  cells.  Therapeutic blockade of PD -L1 
binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of 
tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity (Feh renbacher 
et al. 2016; Rosenberg et al. 2016).  Atezolizumab  has minimal  binding to Fc receptors, 
thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector function and associated antibody -mediated 
clearance of activated effector T  cells.  
The combination of ipatasertib and atezolizumab in tumors driven by activation of the 
Akt/PI3K pathway has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit by simultaneously 
addressing multiple nodes in the cancer immunity cycle (Chen and Mellman 2013), 
including release of cancer antigens via cancer cell death and recognition by T -cells. 
Additionally, preliminary evidence suggests that inihibtion of the Akt/PI3K pathway may 
modulate the immune microenvironment, reducing regulatory T -cells and increasing the 
trafficking of CD8 positive effector T-cells into the tumor microenvironment (Lopez et al. 
2020b), potentially further supporting cancer immunity.  
There are several clinical trials investigating combinations of ipatasertib and 
atezolizumab which include an ongoing Phase Ib in metastatic horm one-receptor -
positive, HER -negative breast cancer (CO39611), metastatic TNBC (CO40115) and 
NSCLC (BO39610).  On the basis of these results, combination treatment with these two 
agents can be safely investigated and is expected to have promising therapeutic  
potential in solid tumors.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
78/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.1.8  Arm M: Ipatasertib Plus Paclitaxel for Co -mutations in the 
PI3K/AKT Pathway  
The PI3K/Akt pathway is more frequently activated by genomic aberrations than any 
other signaling pathway in cancer (LoRusso  2016).  The most common genetic 
alterations in this pathway are activating mutations of phosphatidylinositol -4, 
5bisphosphate 3 -kinase, catalytic subunit, alpha (PIK3CA), loss -of-function alterations 
of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), deregulation of 
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, and amplification and mutations of receptor tyrosine 
kinases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012; Millis et al. 2015).  Alterations in Akt 
itself, including amplification and overexpression of individual Akt isoforms, as w ell as 
activating mutations in Akt, have been identified in a subset of human cancers 
(Bellacosa et al. 2005; Brugge et al. 2007; Tokunaga et al. 2008).  All of these 
mechanisms of pathway activation ultimately funnel through Akt as the central node that 
drives cell survival, growth, proliferation, angiogenesis, metabolism, and migration 
(Manning and Cantley 2007).  
Genes that encode intracellular signaling proteins of the PI3K/AKT pathway are some of 
the most commonly mutated genes in tumor cells.  Whereas PI3K inhibitors can 
modulate PIK3CA  mutation -driven activation of the pathway, mutations in additional 
genes for this pathway (e.g. PTEN or AKT) may lead to worse prognosis and resistance 
to PI3K targeted therapies (Jhaveri e t al. 2021).  Pharmacologic modulation of this 
pathway downstream of PI3K may provide a more effective treatment alternative for 
patients whose tumors harbor PIK3CA /PTEN  or PIK3CA /AKT co-mutations.  
Upregulation of Akt signaling (whether intrinsic or induce d following chemotherapy) 
represents a potentially important survival pathway in response to genotoxic/mitotic 
stress (Xu et al. 2012).  Activation of Akt signaling following chemotherapy (including 
taxanes) may promote cell survival and chemoresistance ac ross several cancer models, 
including breast cancer (Clark et al. 2002 ).  Conversely, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt 
pathway in diverse cancers leads to radiosensitization and/or chemosensitization  
(Brognard et al. 2001 ; Solit et al. 2003; Wallin et al. 2010).   
Ipatasertib is a potent, highly selective small -molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of 
the serine/threonine kinase Akt.  Ipatasertib binds to the activated conformation of Akt 
and is ATP competitive.  Ipatasertib binding inhibits the kinase activity  of Akt and 
suppresses the phosphorylation of its direct substrates, including PRAS40, and 
additional downstream targets, such as S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), resulting in G 1 
arrest and/or apoptosis in human cancer cells (Lin et  al. 2012).  In clinical tum or 
samples, robust Akt  pathway inhibition by ipatasertib can be achieved at clinically 
relevant doses (Yan  et al. 2013).  
There are several clinical trials investigating combinations of ipatasertib and paclitaxel 
including a Phase Ib study in HER2 -negative breast cancer (STUDY PAM4983g, Arm 
C), a randomized Phase II (GO29227, LOTUS) comparing ipatasertib + paclitaxel versus 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
79/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  placebo + paclitaxel as first -line treatment for patients with inoperable locally advanced 
or metastatic TNBC and a randomized Phase III  (CO40016) comparing ipatasertib + 
paclitaxel versus placebo + paclitaxel in patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered 
tumors. In GO29227, results from this study showed improvement in PFS in the intent -
to-treat (ITT) population (hazard ratio = 0.60; 6.2 mont hs in the ipatasertib arm 
compared with 4.9 months in the control arm) and more pronounced in the pre -specified 
patient population with  PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN -altered tumors (hazard ratio = 0.44; 
9  months vs 4.9 months).  
On the basis of these results, combinat ion treatment with ipatasertib and paclitaxel in 
tumors with co -mutations of PIK3CA and AKT or PIK3CA and PTEN -alteration status 
can be safely investigated and has the potential to offer therapeutic benefit in solid 
tumors driven by activation of this path way.

T-cell immunoreceptor with I g and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is a novel immune inhibitory 
receptor that is a member of the Ig super family (Yu et al. 2009; Manieri et  al. 2017 ).  
TIGIT is expressed on the surface of activated T -cell and natural killer (NK) -cell subsets 
and interacts with high affinity with CD155 (also known as the poliovirus receptor [PVR]) 
(Yu et al. 2009).  Genetic ablation of TIGIT in T cells in mice results i n exacerbated 
T-cell responses in nonclinical models of autoimmune and viral infections, demonstrating 
the role of TIGIT in inhibiting T -cell responses (Joller et al. 2011; Johnston et al. 2014).   
TIGIT expression is elevated in the tumor microenvironment  in many human tumors, is 
coordinately expressed with other checkpoint immune receptors such as programmed 
death1 (PD -1), and is associated with impaired T -cell function and anti -tumor immunity 
(Johnston et al. 2014).  Activation of TIGIT on T cells and N K cells limits cellular 
proliferation, effector cytokine production, and killing of target tumor cells (Stanietsky et 
al. 2009; Yu  et al. 2009; Johnston et al. 2014; Wang et al. 201 5; Manieri  et al. 2017 ). 
Therefore, in the context of the tumor microenviro nment, TIGIT acts to limit anti -tumor 
immune responses.  Interference with TIGIT PVR interaction may enhance the 
magnitude and quality of the  tumor -specific T -cell responses by means of increased 
expansion of T  cells as well as improved T -cell priming and/ or effector function.   
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that downregulates immune responses through binding 
to its two receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1, described in detail in Section  1.1.5 .  Targeting the 
PD-L1 pathway with atezolizumab has demonstrated activity in patients with advanced 
malignancies who have failed standard -of-care therapies.  Objective responses have 
been observed across a br oad range of malignancies, including NSCLC , urothelial 
carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, 
gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma (see Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure 
for detailed efficacy results)  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
80/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Because TIGIT and PD -1 are coordinately expressed by infiltrating T cells in several 
human tumors, inhibition of the TIGIT/PVR pathways may complement and potentiate 
the anti -tumor activity of a PD -L1 pathway inhibitor such as atezolizumab.   
In preclinical models, concomitant blockade of TIGIT and PD -L1/PD -1 pathways 
demonstrated superior efficacy over the respective single -agent treatments.  In one such 
preclinical model, tumor -infiltrating T cells demonstrate increased interferon (IFN) - 
expression (a hall mark of activation and anti -tumor activity of T cells) only when both 
TIGIT and PD -1 are blocked concurrently and not when each individual pathway is 
blocked by the respective single -agent treatment.  Notably, co -inhibition of TIGIT and 
PD-L1 in this synge neic tumor model was not associated with loss of body weight or any 
other observable adverse responses.  On the basis of the results of these studies, it is 
hypothesized that the combination of an anti -TIGIT antibody with anti PD-L1/PD -1 
antibody may resul t in activation of anti -tumor immune responses leading to enhanced 
killing of T cells and improved clinical responses than with either agent alone.   
Tiragolumab is a fully human IgG1/  monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to TIGIT and 
prevents its interac tion with PVR.  Refer to the Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure for 
details on nonclinical and clinical  studies.  Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 
monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits the interaction between PD -L1 and 
its receptors, PD -1 and B7-1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory 
receptors expressed on T cells.   Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for 
details on nonclinical and clinical  studies.  
In the primary analysis of the Phase II study GO40290 (CIT YSCAPE) investigating 
atezolizumab in combination with tiragolumab or placebo, 48.7% of patients in the 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab group versus 27.9% of patients in the placebo plus 
atezolizumab group were still receiving study treatment in the ITT popu lation.  In the 
tumor proportion score ( TPS)  50% population, 65.5% of patients in the tiragolumab 
plus atezolizumab group relative to 24.1% of patients in the placebo plus atezolizumab 
group were still receiving study treatment.   
In all randomized patients with TPS 1% (n   135), the confirmed ORR was higher in the 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm (31.3%) than in the placebo plus atezolizumab group 
(16.2%);  investigator -assessed PFS was improved in the tiragolumab plus atezolizuma b 
group (n   67) relative to placebo plus atezolizumab (n   68) group (stratified HR 0.57; 
95% CI: 0.37 to 0.90; median PFS 5.4 vs. 3.6 months, respectively).  Consistent with the 
Phase Ib portion of Study GO30103, the combination of tiragolumab with atezo lizumab 
was well tolerated in the Phase II study.  
Taken together with the growing evidence for TMB and MSI -H/dMMR being correlated 
with better clinical outcomes with checkpoint inhibitor therapies in general and the 
acceptable safety profile of tiragolumab  plus atezolizumab observed to date, further

agnostic setting.  
1.1.10  Arm O: Pralsetinib for RET fusion positive Tumors  
Increasing evidence implicates aberrant activation of the rec eptor tyrosine kinase RET 
(rearranged during transfection) as a critical driver of tumor growth and proliferation 
across a broad range of solid tumors (Mulligan 2014).  RET, along with glial cell 
line-derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF) and GDNF family rec eptors - (GFR), 
normally mediates development, maturation, and maintenance of several neural, 
neuroendocrine, and genitourinary tissue types.  Oncogenic RET activation occurs via 
gain-of-function mutations which constitutively activates RET, promoting 
ligand-independent tumor growth.  Oncogenic RET activation was initially described in 
hereditary and sporadic thyroid cancers, and subsequently in NSCLC adenocarcinoma 
(Mulligan 2014).  However, as next -generation DNA sequencing has become more 
prevalent, it has become apparent that oncogenic RET mutations occur in a variety of 
solid tumors.   
1.1.10.1  RET-altered Thyroid Cancer  
The main histologic types of thyroid cancer are localized differentiated thyroid cancer 
(DTC; ~90% of cases), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC; ~ 2% of cases) and anaplastic 
thyroid cancer (  1% of cases).  DTC arises sporadically from thyroid follicular cells and 
consists of papillary thyroid cancer (~90%), follicular thyroid cancer (~5%), and Hürthle 
cell neoplasm (~2%)  (NCCN 2020).  In contrast,  MTC arises from parafollicular C cells 
and occurs in both hereditary and sporadic forms.  Oncogenic RET activation has been 
implicated as a driver for both DTC and MTC.  
Gene rearrangements involving RET and a dimerization domain -encoding gene have 
been i dentified in ~10% of sporadic papillary tumors in adults, and in ~50% 80% of 
papillary tumors that occur after radiation exposure or arise in childhood.  RET fusion 
alterations are more prevalent in radiation -exposed populations (Li et al. 2019).  The 
dime rization domain provided by the fusion partner allows for constitutive association of 
RET kinase domains, leading to aberrant kinase activation that promotes tumorigenesis.   
In December 2020, pralsetinib received accelerated approval from the FDA for the 
treatment of adults and pediatric patients  12 years of age with advanced or metastatic 
RET-mutated MTC who require systemic therapy, and adults and pediatric patients 
 12 years of age with advanced or metastatic  RET fusion –positive thyroid cancer who 
require systemic therapy and who are  radioactive iodine  (RAI)-refractory (if RAI is 
appropriate)  (GAVRETO [pralsetinib], U.S. Prescribing Information).   
1.1.10.2  Other RET -driven Cancers  
Emerging genomic and functional data implicate RET as a potential driver in several 
cancers beyond thyroid cancer and NSCLC (Borrello et al. 2013; Mulligan 2014).  
Upregulation of RET, GDNF, and/or GFR  has also been detected across solid tumor 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
82/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  indications, and this may promote RET activation, tumorigenesis, and drug resistance 
(Nakashima et al. 2007; Yang and Horten 2014; Platt et al. 2015).  Thus, it is possible 
that other advanced solid tumors are dependent on RET activity and could respond to 
RET inhibition.   
At present, it is unclear how much of the clinical efficacy associat ed with multikinase 
inhibitors ( MKIs ) is caused by RET inhibition, as MKIs do not inhibit RET completely.  
Furthermore, MKIs are associated with significant off -target toxicities.  Thus, there is a 
need for precision therapies that provide durable clinical  benefit by selectively targeting 
RET alterations and anticipated resistance mechanisms.  
1.1.10.3  Pralsetinib Activity  
Pralsetinib (previously known as BLU -667) is a potent and selective oral inhibitor of RET 
fusion proteins and oncogenic RET mutants. Pralsetinib s hows potent antitumor activity 
in RET -driven tumor models, and demonstrates tolerability at pharmacologically active 
doses in non clinical toxicology assays.   
Study BLU -667-1101 (ARROW) is an ongoing Phase I/II study of pralsetinib in patients 
with thyroi d cancer, NSCLC, and other advanced solid tumors.  As of 13 February 2020, 
11 of 13 response -evaluable patients with RET fusion -positive thyroid tumors had an 
objective response (ORR: 91% (95% CI: 59% to 100%) (Blueprint Medicines 
Corporation Press Release  2020).  Amongst 48 NSCLC patients, 28 (58%) showed an 
objective response, while 100% experienced disease control.  Of those, patients 
previously treated with platinum agents (n=35) showed a 60% objective response rate, 
while 5 of the 7 patients (71%) with out prior treatment achieved confirmed partial 
responses. Pralsetinib once per day (QD) dosing at dose levels  400 mg demonstrated 
acceptable tolerability, as most adverse events were of low grade and reversible. For 
more details about the clinical safety of pralsetinib, please refer to the Pralsetinib 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
Adult patients with RET fusion -positive cancers other than thyroid cancer or NSCLC are 
poorly served by standard of care treatments, which have limited efficacy and/or 
significant off -target toxicity.  Thus, there is a need for personalized therapies that 
selectively target RET a lterations to provide lasting clinical benefit.  Given the evidence 
of pralsetinib's clinical efficacy and the unmet medical need, pralsetinib has the potential 
to provide significant benefit to tumor -agnostic, RET positive adults.  As pralsetinib is 
gener ally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile, the benefit -risk assessment for 
this cohort is considered to be favorable.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
83/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.2 STUDY RATIONALE   
This Phase II, multicenter, non -randomized, open -label, multi -arm study will evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of several agents in patients with advanced unresectable or 
metastatic solid tumors.  Treatment will be based on each patient’s tumor biomarker 
profile, and the trial will aim to include a broad patient population, inclusive of 
demo graphic populations under -represented in traditional clinical trials and rare tumor 
types.  This will, in turn, broaden patient access to personalized treatments for otherwise 
excluded clinical trial patient populations.  
In order to ensure the study popula tion is diverse in underrepresented groups in clinical 
research, including patients of color, special attention  has been paid to the selection of 
eligibility criteria appropriate for consideration of more diverse enrollment while still 
ensuring safety.  An  analysis by self -identified race and ethnicity is included to explore 
differences in therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes by ancestral groups.  
The study will focus on the following actionable biomarkers and the corresponding 
targeted agents as sho wn in Figure  1.

1.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT 
The conventional tumor histology -specific approach to drug development is not always 
appropriate in the era of prec ision oncology.  For therapies targeting rare genomic 
alterations that are observed across a variety of tumors, enrolling a large, randomized 
study for each alteration or biomarker in individual tumor types is not feasible because of 
the significant amount  of time required to identify a sufficient number of eligible patients.  
New clinical trial designs, including basket and umbrella studies, have been developed 
to overcome these barriers and provide for more efficient development of targeted 
therapies.  Re cently, several basket trials have led to health authority approvals of 
pembrolizumab, larotrectinib, and entrectinib in tumor -agnostic indications.  
While these trials and subsequent approvals represent important steps towards 
personalized oncology treatm ent, many patients still have no targeted therapy options.  
Approximately 75% of oncologists report using n ext generation sequencing  (NGS) 
testing to guide treatment decisions (Barroso -Sousa et al. 2019; Freedman et al. 2018).  
Despite this, only 26.8% of oncologists responded that NGS test results often informed 
treatment recommendations (Freedman et al. 2018), substantiating the need for 
additional drug and diagnostic development for widespread use of precision medicines 
and more personalized healthcare t o become a reality.  Of note, in an international 
survey, the barrier most frequently reported by oncologists was the inability to find a 
suitable trial (Barroso -Sousa et al. 2019).  
Patients considered for enrollment in this study will have advanced unrese ctable or 
metastatic solid tumors and their treating investigator must consider treatment in a 
clinical trial an appropriate option for their care.  This will include patients for whom no 
current available standard therapy exists, or for whom therapies tha t will convey clinical 
benefit are not available and/or not suitable options per the treating physician’s 
judgment.  
Additionally, the respective safety plan for each arm has been designed to ensure 
patient safety by utilizing inclusion and exclusion crite ria that are consistent with the 
known safety profiles of the investigational agents along with treatment -specific toxicity 
management guidelines.  A Steering Committee composed of multidisciplinary members 
of Roche/Genentech and external experts will be s et up to review safety data at periodic 
intervals in order to identify the emergence of new or increased safety signals.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
85/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  1.3.1  Risk/Benefit Assessment during COVID -19 
1.3.1.1  All Treatment Arms  
In the setting of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, patient s with 
comorbidities, including those with cancer, are a more vulnerable population.  Infection 
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) has been 
associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer in some 
retros pective analyses.  It is unclear whether or how cancer therapies such as 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy impact the incidence or severity of 
COVID -19.  It is not known whether any of the agents being investigated in this study will 
increas e the risk of infection with SARS -CoV-2 (see Section  1.3.1.2 ) for additional 
information regarding atezolizumab).  Patients with a serious infection requiring 
intravenous (IV) antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment or any 
active infection that, in the opinion of the investigator, could impact patient safety will be 
excluded from study participation, and patients will be carefully monitored for infections 
during the study.  
1.3.1.2  Immunotherapy Treatment Arms (Arms containing 
Atezolizum ab:  E, F, J, K, L & N)  
In the setting of the  COVID -19 pandemic, patients with comorbidities, including those 
with cancer, are considered a more vulnerable population, with the potential for more 
severe clinical outcomes from severe acute respiratory syndr ome coronavirus 2 
(SARS -CoV-2) infection.  However, it is unclear whether or how systemic cancer 
therapies, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, impact the 
incidence or severity of SARS -CoV-2 infection . 
A possible consequence of inhibi ting the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway may be the modulation of 
the host immune response to acute infection, which may result in immunopathology or 
dysregulated immune system defenses.  In nonclinical models, PD -1/PD -L1 blockade 
appears to be associated with seriou s exacerbation of inflammation in the setting of 
acute (as opposed to chronic) viral infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus 
(Clone 13) ( Frebel  et al. 2012).  However, there are insufficient and inconsistent clinical 
data to assess if out come from SARS -CoV-2 infection  is altered by cancer 
immunotherapy.  
Severe SARS -CoV-2 infection  appears to be associated with a cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) involving the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10, IL -2, and 
interferon (IFN) - (Merad and Martin 2020).  While it is not known , there may be a 
potential for an increased risk of an enhanced inflammatory response if a patient 
develops acute SARS -CoV-2 infection while receiving atezolizumab.  At this time, there 
is insufficient evidence for causal association between atezolizumab and an increased 
risk of severe outcomes from SARS -CoV-2 infection . 
There may be potential synergy or overlap in clinical and radiologic features for 
immune -mediated pulmonary toxicity with atezolizumab and clinical and radiologic 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
86/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  features for SARS -CoV-2related interstitial pneumonia.  Thus, investigators should use 
their clinical judgment when evaluating and managing patients with pulmonary 
symptoms.  
There a re limited data concerning the possible interactions between cancer 
immunotherapy treatment and COVID -19 vaccination, and it is recognized that human 
immune responses are highly regulated and that immune -modifying therapies may 
positively or negatively imp act the efficacy and safety of COVID -19 vaccination (SITC  
2020 ).  
Per recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) 
COVID -19 vaccination advisory committee, COVID -19 vaccination is recommended for 
all patients with cancer receiving a ctive therapy (including immune checkpoint inhibitors) 
with the understanding that there are limited safety and efficacy data in such patients 
(NCCN  2021 ). Given the lack of clinical data, currently no recommendations can be 
made regarding the optimal sequ ence of COVID -19 vaccination in patients who are 
receiving  cancer immunotherapy ( SITC 2020 ).  For patients enrolling in this study and 
receiving atezolizumab  treatment , a decision to administer the vaccine to a patient 
should be made on an individual basis by the investigator in consulation with the patient.  
In alignment with clinical practice procedures, factors to consider when making the 
individualized decision for patients receiving atezolizumab treatment to receive 
COVID -19 vaccination include the following:  the risk of SARS -CoV-2 infection and 
potential benefit from the vaccine, the general condition of the patient and potential 
complications associated with SARS -CoV-2 infection, underlying disease, and the 
severity of COVI D-19 outbreak in a given area or region.   
SITC and NCCN recommendations along with institutional guidelines should be used by 
the investigator when deciding on administering COVID -19 vaccines.  When 
administered, COVID -19  vaccines must be given in accord ance with the approved or 
authorized vaccine label.  Receipt of the COVID -19 vaccine is considered a concomitant 
medication and should be documented as such  (see Concomitant Medications section in 
each atezolizumab -specific appendix) .  
Given the mechanism of action for atezolizumab and other combinations within the study 
(Arm E: atezolizumab and chemotherapy [docetaxel, paclitaxel and capecitabine], Arms 
F and J: atezolizumab with trastuzumab emtansine, Arms K and L; atezolizumab plus 
ipatasertib, and Arm N : atezolizumab with tiragolumab), immune mediated adverse 
events are potential overlapping toxicities and should be monitored closely by the 
investigator and site personnel.  
For Arm E (atezolizumab plus chemotherapy), neutropenia and lymphopenia associate d 
with chemotherapy may increase the risk for developing an infection in patients receiving 
atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy . 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
87/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple therapies that are selected 
based on potential predictive biomarkers identified in patients with solid tumors.  
2.1 EFFICACY  
2.1.1  Primary Efficacy Objective  
The primary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of various treatments 
and/or combinations of treatments in eligible patie nts with advanced unresectable or 
metastatic solid tumors, on the basis of the following endpoint:  
 The primary endpoint for each arm of this study will be confirmed ORR (cORR) as 
assessed by the investigator and according to response evaluation criteria in  solid 
tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), or Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
[RANO] Criteria for primary CNS tumors [ Wen et al. 2017 ].  The cORR is defined as 
the proportion of patients whose confirmed best response is a complete response 
(CR) or part ial response (PR) for those with measurable disease and CR for those 
with non -measurable disease.   
 
2.1.2  Secondary Efficacy Objective  
The secondary efficacy objectives for this study are to evaluate the efficacy of each 
targeted treatment on the basis of the f ollowing endpoints:  
 PFS, defined as the time from start of treatment to the first occurrence of disease 
progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the 
investigator according to RECIST v1.1.  
 DOR, defined as the time from  the first occurrence of a documented objective 
response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), 
as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 . 
 PFS rate at 3 months during treatment and every 3 months thereafter for at least up 
to 1 year, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease 
progression or death from any cause as determined by the investigator, according to 
RECIST  v1.1.   
 Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients whose best 
response is confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or a response of CR, PR, SD, or non -
CR/non -progressive disease ( PD) for a minimum of 98 days for 28 -day cycle arms 
or 70 days for 21-day cycle arms after the first treatment date .  DCR will be 
summarized in the same fashion as the primary efficacy endpoint except, for  DCR 
we will limit analysis to the subgroup in the efficacy population consisting of those 
with measurable disease.   
 
2.1.3  Exploratory Efficacy Objectives  
Exploratory efficacy objectives are to evaluate efficacy based following the following:

The safety objective for this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study 
medications for the tumor types studied based on the following endpoints:  
 Incidence and severity of adverse events, with severity determined according to 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
version  5.0 (NCI  CTCAE v5.0)

2.3 BIOMARKERS OBJECTIVE  
The exploratory biomarker objective for th is study is to identify and/or evaluate 
biomarkers that are early surrogates of efficacy or relapse, are associated with a more 
severe disease state (i.e.,  prognostic biomarkers), are associated with acquired 
resistance to study drug(s), or can increase th e knowledge and understanding of 
disease biology and drug safety, on the basis of the following endpoint:  
 The association of baseline and changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels 
with response and progression to therapy.  
 Determination of baseline an d changes in expression or levels of biomarkers in the 
tumor tissue or blood that may be associated with response or resistance to 
therapy.  
 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY  
3.1.1  Overview of Study Design  
MyTACTIC is a Phase II, multicenter, non -randomized,  open -label, multi -arm study 
designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies as single agents or in 
rational, specified combinations in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic 
solid tumors determined to harbor specific biomarke rs.  Patients will be enrolled based 
on local testing performed at a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 
(CLIA) -certified or equivalently accredited diagnostic laboratory.  For all patients whose 
positive biomarker result is from an assay other than  a tissue -based assay conducted by 
Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), central testing of pre -treatment tissue (preferably from 
the most recent block) and blood is required after enrollment.  Pre -treatment tissue will 
be submitted within 21 days after enrollm ent to a Sponsor -approved laboratory for 
central testing; this testing will not impact the study participation of enrolled patients.   
The multi -arm structure of the MyTACTIC study allows patients with solid tumors to be 
treated with a drug or drug regimen  tailored to their biomarker identified at screening.  
Each study treatment arm may have separate endpoints, screening, and treatment 
requirements, defined in the respective appendix.  Futility analyses will be employed on 
all treatment arms to limit enrol lment where evidence of very limited or lack of efficacy is 
observed.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
89/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  During the study, the following biomarker samples will be collected:  
Tumor tissue  
 For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -
based assay conducted b y FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples (archival or recent 
resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for 
central testing.  If both archival and recent tissue is available, the recent tissue 
should be preferentially submit ted.  
 
Blood samples  
 Mandatory blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first 
treatment, and at disease progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for 
analyses including ctDNA  
 
These samples will be used to evaluate predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers, 
including but not limited to biomarkers related to driver oncogene signaling, response to 
study treatment, tumor pathogenesis, and mechanisms of resistance.  
The requirements for tissue and blood samples for screening and standardized  testing 
purposes are described in Section  4.5.7  
Treatment will be assigned by the treating investigator on the basis of relevant specified 
biomarkers, and will continue until radiographic disease progression (per RECIST v1.1 
[Eisenhauer et al. 2009]; RANO Criteria for primary CNS tumors [Wen et al. 2017] ), or 
loss of clinical benefit for specific treatment arms with Medical Monitor consultation (see 
Section  3.1.2 for treatment beyond disease progression ), unacceptable toxicity , patient 
or physician decision to disco ntinue , or death, whichever occurs first.  If a patient 
discontinues treatment prior to disease progression (because of adverse event or other 
reason), tumor assessments will continue as specified in the treatment -specific appendix 
until disease progressio n, death, withdrawal of consent, or arm/study closure by the 
Sponsor, whichever occurs first.   
Patients who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) or the 
timeline for the screening window may qualify for re -screening at the investigator's 
discretion.  Patients must re -sign the consent form prior to rescreening.  The investigator 
will record reasons for screen failure in the screening log.   
Figure  1 presents an overview of the study design.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
91/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Steering Committee  
A Steering Committee will be formed of multidisciplinary members from 
Roche/Genentech, and external experts to provide clinical and methodological expertise 
to the oversight of the study.  The Steering Committee will review data and pro vide 
consultation in evaluating efficacy and safety data for each study arm; and, 
subsequently, make recommendations regarding the eligibility of patients, appropriate 
treatment decision, statistical analyses, and clinical trial design.  The committee will  
operate according to a pre -specified charter.  
Safety will be reviewed by the Steering Committee to identify the emergence of new or 
increased safety signals.  The Steering Committee will also review efficacy data and 
advise on an arm’s continued accrual of patients with specific tumor types to targeted 
therapy at interim analyses.  Genentech will consider the Steering Committee’s 
recommendations in any decisions regarding the study conduct.  
3.1.2  Dosing of Study Treatment beyond Disease Progression  
In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, dosing of study treatment beyond radiographic 
disease progression may be permitted for patients in specific treatment arms upon 
consultation with the Medical Monitor , if evidence of persistent clinical benefit is 
determined by the investigator and documentation is provided to the Sponsor.  
If the above criteria are met, dosing of study treatment will continue until unacceptable 
toxicity, loss of clinical benefit (as determined by the investigator), or withdrawal of 
patient consent.  Loss of clinical benefit is defined as the following:  
 Appearance of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory values) 
indicating disease progression  
 Decline in ECOG performance status  due to disease progression  
 Presence of rapid  progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical 
anatomical sites (e.g. cord compression) requiring alternative medical intervention  
 
3.1.3  Number of Patients  
Approximately 260 patients are anticipated to be enrolled at approximately 60 sites.  
Each a rm will be limited to approximately 25 patients or 10 patients, as indicated in the 
Study Schema ( Figure  1).   
3.2 END OF STUDY AND LEN GTH OF S TUDY  
The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV), 
occurs or the date at which the last data point required for statistical analysis or safety 
follow -up is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later.  LPLV is expected to 
occur approximately 1 year after the last patient is enrolled.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
92/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
This modular basket study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
targeted therapies or immunotherapy as single agents or as part  of rational combinations 
in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic solid tumors determined to harbor 
specific biomarkers.  Thus, patients are assigned to treatment arms based on the 
presence of tumor mutations or other biomarkers that are known  or expected to be 
predictive of response and/or outcomes.  
The patient population selected for this trial is based on the unmet medical need of 
patients with advanced solid tumors possessing rare oncogenic alterations that may be 
addressed by therapy targ eted against these alterations.  Current and potential future 
treatment arms involve biomarkers present across a variety of tumors.   
Targeted or biomarker -driven therapy for patients has proven to be safer and more 
effective compared with conventional che motherapy (Rosell et al. 2012; Solomon et al. 
2014).  While tissue testing is common for certain markers in some tumor types, a 
multitude of other potential targets have been identified for which testing may not 
routinely be performed.  Further, a signific ant portion of patients never have their tumor 
tissue molecularly profiled and therefore may receive cytotoxic chemotherapy or 
supportive care only, depending on performance status and other clinical factors.   
Many of the genomic alterations of interest a re considered rare, making the ability to 
identify enough patients to conduct an adequate randomized trial very challenging, even 
within a tumor -agnostic umbrella trial design.  Additionally, randomization would be 
challenging not only due to rarity of pop ulations, but in the variability of standards of care 
between tumor types and even between lines of treatment within a tumor type.  A 
single -arm, open -label design is optimal to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy of a 
personalized biologically direct ed treatment, as compared with conventional 
chemotherapy or Phase I clinical trials, in the context of biomarker -selected rare -disease 
populations.  
Rationale for the individual treatment arms are contained in the treatment -specific 
appendices.  
3.3.1  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments   
Cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but selection of patients based on the presence of 
oncodriver alterations allows for more specific targeting of the driver of disease.  Within a 
given treatment arm, the genomic biomarkers under  study in this trial may lead to 
variability of clinical responses among the different tumor types enrolled, based on 
relative differences in patient/prognostic factors, oncogenicity of individual alterations 
(e.g., fusion partner), and the presence or abs ence of intrinsic resistance mechanisms 
(Hartmaier et al. 2017).  Therefore, patients may not benefit equally from study treatment 
in one or more of the study arms.   
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
93/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  The goal is to study treatments based on the biomarkers present in a patient’s 
tumoragno stic to tumor type and to ultimately determine the population(s) that 
benefit from targeted therapy based on biomarkers previously associated with clinical 
response.  This may be fully tumor/tissue -agnostic or may represent a more limited 
patient populatio n within a biomarker -defined indication.   
A second goal is to better define the reason(s) for observed variations in clinical 
response to alteration -targeted agents among tumor types.  Tissue and blood collected 
prior to dosing will be assessed in an effo rt to identify those patients with 
biomarker -driven pathogenesis who are most likely to respond to study treatment in the 
assigned study arm, as well as to study potential mechanisms of primary resistance 
where lack of or limited efficacy is observed.  Bio marker samples will be collected at 
disease progression in an effort to monitor recurrence and to identify acquired resistance 
mechanisms to the assigned study treatment arm (blood is mandatory; tissue optional).  
Additionally, the sample(s) may be used fo r molecular testing.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
97/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT   
4.2.1  Treatment Assignment  
All patients will be assigned to a specific treatment arm by the treating investigator 
based  on the biomarker results of a qualifying assay.  
An interactive voice - or web -based response system (IxRS) will be used to manage 
patient screening, enrollment, and tracking.  Patients who are diagnostic positive for a 
treatment arm, meet the general and applicable treatment -specific eligibility criteria, and 
have provided arm -specific written informed consent will be registered via IxRS.  
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT AND OTHER TREATMENTS REL EVANT 
TO THE STUDY DESIGN  
The study treatment arm designs are provided separate ly in the appendices.   
Details of each study treatment, recommended concomitant medications, and prohibited 
medications are also contained in the treatment -specific appendices.  
See Table  1 for a full list of treatment arms and the associated appendices.  
4.3.1  Study Treatment Formulation and Packaging  
Refer to the treatment -specific appendices for details.  
4.3.2  Study Treatment Dosage, Admi nistration, and Compliance  
The treatment regimens are summarized in the treatment -specific appendices (see 
Table  1). 
Details on treatment a dministration (e.g., dose and timing) should be noted on the 
Study  Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of overdose, 
medication error, drug abuse, or drug misuse, along with any associated adverse 
events, should be reported as des cribed in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Patient compliance with self -administration of orally administered study treatment will be 
assessed by medi cation diary and standard pill counts.  Patients will be required to 
record the time and date they took each dose in a medication diary; missed doses will 
also be recorded.  Patients will be instructed to bring all unused study medication and 
their medicat ion diaries at specified study visits.  
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation for 
patients who experience adverse events are provided in the treatment -specific 
appendices.  
4.3.3  Investigational Medicinal Product Handling  and Accountability  
All investigational medicinal products  (IMPs) required for completion of this study will be 
provided by the Sponsor.  The study site (i.e.,  investigator or other authorized personnel 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
98/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  or mobile nurse, if applicable]) is responsible for m aintaining records of IMP delivery to 
the site, IMP inventory at the site, IMP use by each patient, and disposition or return of 
unused IMP, thus enabling reconciliation of all IMPs received, and for ensuring that 
patients are provided with doses specified  by the protocol.  
The study site should follow all instructions included with each shipment of IMP.  The 
study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs supplied by the Sponsor, using the IxRS to 
confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipmen ts will be replaced.  
The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit,  either by time monitoring (shipment arrival date and 
time) or temperature monitoring, for all IMPs received and tha t any discrepancies have 
been reported and resolved before use of the IMPs.  All IMPs must be stored in a 
secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions, with access limited to  the investigator 
and authorized staff.  
Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMPs, and only authorized staff may 
supply or administer IMPs.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site's institutional 
standard op erating procedure or be returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate 
documentation.  The site's method of destroying Sponsor -supplied IMPs must be agreed 
to by the Sponsor.  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before 
any Sponsor -supplied IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on 
the appropriate form.  
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of 
by the study site should be recorded on the drug accountability log.  
Refer to the  pharmacy manual and/or the study drug’s Investigator's Brochure or local 
prescribing information for information on IMP handling, including preparation and 
storage, and accountability.  
4.3.4  Continued Access to Study Treatments  
Currently, the Sponsor (Genentec h, a member of the Roche Group) does not have any 
plans to provide Genentech IMPs as listed in Table  1 or any other study treatments to 
patients who have completed the study.  The Sponsor may evaluate whether to continue 
providing IMPs in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to 
Investigational Medicinal Product, available at the foll owing website:  
http://www.roche.com/policy_continued_access_to_investigational_medicines.pdf  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
99/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY PROHIBITED FOOD, AND  
ADDITIONAL RESTRICTI ONS  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7  days 
prior to initiation of study treatment  until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.  
All such medications s hould be reported to the Investigator and recorded on the 
Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
Patients who use oral contraceptives or hormone -replacement therapy and do not have 
breast cancer may continue these medications under the supervision of their 
physicia n.  Androgen blockage may be continued for male patients with prostate 
cancer.   Other medications may be continued unless otherwise indicated in the specific 
study drug appendix.   
Unless noted otherwise in the arm -specific appendix, palliative radiotherapy  (e.g., 
treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic relief of pain), is permitted 
provided it does not interfere with the assessment of tumor lesions (e.g., the lesion being 
irradiated is not a target lesion for response assessments, because that wou ld render 
the patient not evaluable for response by tumor assessments according to RECIST v1.1 
or RANO [for patients with  patients with primary CNS tumors]).  
Supportive care, including antiemetic medications, may be administered at the discretion 
of the i nvestigator.  For details on regimen -specific concomitant therapy, prohibited food, 
and additional restrictions; please refer to the appropriate treatment arm -specific 
appendices (see Table  1 for full list of appendices).  
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS   
The treatment -specific assessments and schedules of activities to be performed during 
the study are provided in the treatment -specific appendices (see Table  1).   
All activities should be performed and documented for each patient.   
Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolera bility throughout the study.  
Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the 
clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable.  
4.5.1  Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any  study -related procedures (including screening evaluations).  Informed 
Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled 
will be maintained at the stu dy site.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
100/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any  study -related procedures (including screening evaluations).  Informed 
Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enro lled 
will be maintained at the study site.  
Screening evaluations are to be performed within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment or as indicated in the schedule of activities.  All screening evaluations must be 
completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before 
enrollment.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients 
screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
4.5.2  Medical History, Ba seline Conditions, Concomitant Medication, 
and Demographic Data  
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history 
and use of alcohol  and drugs of abuse, will be recorded at baseline.  In addition, all 
medications (e.g.,  prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or 
homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior 
to initiation of study treatment will be recorded.  At the time of each follow -up physical 
examination, an interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in 
medications and allergies should be recorded.  Demographic data for both enrolled and 
screen -failed pat ients, as well as reasons for screen failure (if applicable) will be 
captured in the IxRS.  
4.5.3  Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination, performed at screening and other specified visits, 
should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, e yes, ears, nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be 
recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline  Conditions eCRF.  
Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed as clinically 
indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  
New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorde d as adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF . 
4.5.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs should be performed at each visit in accordance with standard clinical 
practice, but the associated data do not need to be recorded on the eCRF (except in the 
case of an adverse event) unless noted in the arm -specific Schedule of Activities.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
101/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  4.5.5  ECOG Performance status  
Performance status will be assessed according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended , where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
4.5.6  Tumor and Response Evaluations  
All known sites of disease must  be assessed and documented at screening and 
reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation according to the arm -specific schedule 
of assessments (see arm -specific appendices) until investigator -determined radiographic 
disease progression or loss of clinic al benefit (in the case of treatment beyond disease 
progression in applicable arms), withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study 
arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.  Tumor assessments performed as 
standard of care prior to o btaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation 
of study treatment do not have to be repeated at baseline.  Tumor assessments must be 
performed independently of changes to the study treatment administration schedule (i.e., 
when treatment i s withheld).  If a tumor assessment has to be performed early or late, 
subsequent assessments should be conducted according to the original schedule based 
on the date of first study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  At the 
investigator’s discr etion, tumor assessments may be repeated at any time if progressive 
disease is suspected.  Objective response (complete response or partial response) must 
be confirmed by repeat assessment at least 4  weeks after initially documented 
response.  
Tumor assessm ents should be performed using the same modality as baseline 
throughout the course of treatment, unless contraindicated by evolving patient condition.  
Screening assessments must include computed tomography (CT) scans (with oral or IV 
contrast) or magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, 
and head.  Bone scan and CT scans of the neck should be performed if clinically 
indicated or if required as specified in the arm -specific appendices.  In  the event a 
positron emission tomography  (PET)/CT scanner is used for tumor assessments, the CT 
portion of the PET/CT must meet criteria for diagnostic quality.  If a CT scan with 
contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT  scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the 
abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI scan of the head must 
be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is 
required to confirm or refute the di agnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of 
an equivocal scan.   
All measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed at each subsequent tumor 
evaluation.  Patients without brain or bone disease at baseline do not need brain or bone 
scans a t subsequent tumor assessments unless clinically warranted or if required as 
specified in the arm -specific appendices.  The same radiographic procedure used to 
assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (e.g., the same 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
102/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  contrast p rotocol for CT scans).  Assessments should be performed by the same 
evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  
Response will be assessed by the investigator on the basis of physical examinations, CT 
scans, and MRI scans accordin g to RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix  3) or RANO (see 
Appendix  4), if applicable.  Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator to 
ensure internal consistency across visits.  Results must be reviewed by the investigator 
before dosing at the next cy cle.   
Deidentified imaging data may also be used for exploratory research purposes including 
digital image analysis.   
4.5.7  Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples   
In addition, treatment -specific laboratory assessments will be performed as describ ed in 
the specific appendix for each study drug (See Table  1 for list of appendices ). 
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be se nt to the study site's local laboratory 
for analysis:  
 Hematology/CBC ( WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, 
differential count ) 
 Chemistry panel (serum or plasma) (glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, 
chloride, calcium, carbo n dioxide (CO 2), ALP, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, direct 
bilirubin, total protein, and albumin)  
 Pregnancy test  
All women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at 
screening.  Pregnancy tests will be performed at specified subsequent visits.  
If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy 
test. 
The following samples will be sent to one or several central laboratories or to the 
Sponsor or a designee for analysis:  
 Blood samples for somatic tumor -specific  genetic testing including ctDNA will be 
collected  from all patients participating in the trial.  These samples will be used for 
research purposes to identify biomarkers that correlate with treatment response or 
resistance and may be used for diagnostic as say development.  
 For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a 
tissue -based assay conducted by FMI:  Archival or recently collected tumor tissue 
sample obtained  prior to study treatment must be submitted within 21 days of 
enrollm ent for central testing, including exploratory research on biomarkers and 
biomarker assay development. In exceptional circumstances, enrollment may be 
allowed without sufficient tissue with Medical Monitor approval.  
– A representative formalin -fixed paraffi n embedded ( FFPE) tumor specimen 
(obtained prior to study treatment) in a paraffin block (preferred) or at least 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
103/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  11 slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial sections should be submitted 
within 21 days of Cycle 1, Day 1.  Tumor tissue should be of g ood quality based 
on total and viable tumor content.  Samples collected via core -needle biopsy (at 
least three cores, embedded into a single paraffin block), or any other 
resection/excisional means are acceptable.  Fine needle aspiration (FNA), 
cytology, o r cell pellets from ascites/pleural effusions/lavage samples are 
acceptable with sufficient cellularity to meet tumor content requirements .  
Tumor tissue from bone metastases that are subject to decalcification is not 
acceptable.  
 
Exploratory research on patient tissue or blood samples may involve extraction and/or 
analysis of DNA, cell -free DNA, RNA or proteins for the purposes of addressing 
questions related to biological mechanisms of treatment response and/or resistance, 
oncogenesis and tumor immunity.   Genomic testing may include targeted, whole exome 
and/or whole genome testing methods for assessment of somatic or germline sequence 
variations.  Analysis of gene expression may be tested using RNA and protein 
expression methods such as, but not limited to RNA next generation sequencing and 
immunohistochemistry.  
Screening tumor tissue and blood samples, including those collected from patients who 
do not enroll in the study, may be used for future research and/or development of 
disease -related tests or too ls. 
Central NGS analysis may be performed by Foundation Medicine.  If performed by 
Foundation Medicine, the investigator may obtain results through Foundation Medicine's 
web portal.  If allowed by local laws, the investigator may share and discuss the resu lts 
with the patient, unless the patient chooses otherwise.  The NGS report is generated for 
research purposes and is not provided for the purpose of guiding future treatment 
decisions.  Results will not be available for samples that do not meet criteria f or testing.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.  
Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for 
optional exploratory research (see Section  4.5.8.3 ), biological samples will be destroyed 
no later than the time of completion of the final Clinical Study Report, with the following 
except ions:  
 Blood and tissue samples collected for biomarker research and biomarker assay 
development will be destroyed no later than 5 years after  the final Clinical Study 
Report has been completed.   
 For enrolled patients, remaining tissue blocks will be retur ned to the site upon 
request or no later than the time of final closure of the study database, whichever 
occurs first.   
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
104/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient s pecifically requests that the 
samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples.  However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  
Data arising from sam ple analysis, including data on genomic variants, will be subject to 
the confidentiality standards described in Section  8.4. 
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law (with the exception of the report from Foundation 
Medicine).  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
4.5.8  Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository   
4.5.8.1  Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The Research Bio sample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities 
used for the long -term storage of human biological specimens, including body fluids, 
solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The 
collection, stora ge, and analysis of RBR samples will facilitate the rational design of new 
pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for 
individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
Samples for the RBR will be collected from  patients who give specific consent to 
participate in this optional research.  RBR samples will be analyzed to achieve one or 
more of the following objectives:  
 To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy or disease progression  
 To identify safety biomarkers that are associated with susceptibility to developing 
adverse events or can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation  
 To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety  
 To study drug response, including d rug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition  
 To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays  
 
4.5.8.2  Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics 
Committee  
Collection, storage, an d analysis of RBR samples is contingent upon the review and 
approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent Form 
by each site's Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if 
applicable, an appropriate regu latory body.  If a site has not been granted approval for 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
105/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  RBR sampling, this section of the protocol (Section  4.5.8 ) will not be applica ble at that 
site. 
4.5.8.3  Sample Collection  
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, 
including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to cancer, diseases, or drug 
safety:  
 Leftover blood, serum, plasma, PBMC, and tumor tissue samples (with the 
exception of remaining archival tissue blocks, which will be returned to sites) and 
any derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides), including leftover 
tissue samples from medically indicated procedures (e.g., br onchoscopy, 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy) performed at the investigator's 
discretion during the course of the study  
 
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis of germline or 
somatic variants via whole genome sequenc ing (WGS), whole exome sequencing 
(WES), or other genomic analysis methods .  Genomics is increasingly informing 
researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology.  WGS and WES provide a 
comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, respectively,  and, along with 
clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developing new 
therapeutic approaches or new methods for monitoring efficacy and safety or predicting 
which patients are more likely to respond to a drug or develop ad verse events.  
Data generated from RBR samples will be analyzed in the context of this study but may 
also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies.  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification and characterization of impo rtant biomarkers and 
pathways to support future drug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the 
laboratory manual.   
RBR samples are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are 
exhausted.   However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC 
approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).  
4.5.8.4  Confidentiality  
RBR samples and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identifi cation 
number.  
Patient medical information associated with RBR samples is confidential and may be 
disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) si gned by the 
patient, unless permitted or required by law.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
106/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses of RBR samples, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law.   The aggregate results of any conducted research will 
be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
Data generated from RBR samples must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburd ened property 
of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.  
4.5.8.5  Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation 
in the RBR.  The investigator or authorized desi gnee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR.  Patients will be 
told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time 
and for any reason during the storag e period.  A separate, specific signature will be 
required to document a patient's agreement to provide optional RBR samples.  Patients 
who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The investigator should document whether or not the pa tient has given consent to 
participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the Sample Informed 
Consent eCRF.  
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
samples and data will continue to be used  as part of the RBR research.  
4.5.8.6  Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository  
Patients who give consent to provide RBR samples have the right to withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  After withdrawal of consent, any remaining samples 
will b e destroyed or will no longer be linked to the patient.  However, if RBR samples 
have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the tes ting of 
his or her RBR samples during the study, the investigator must inform the Medical 
Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject 
Withdrawal Form and must enter the date of withdrawal on the Sample Withdrawal o f 
Informed Consent eCRF.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or 
her RBR samples after closure of the site, the investigator must inform the Sponsor by 
emailing the study number and patient number to the following email address:  
global.rcr -withdrawal@roche.com .  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
107/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  A patient's withdrawal from this study does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of consent 
for testing of RBR samples.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal of consent for testing of 
RBR samples does not constitute withdrawal from this study.  
4.5.8.7  Monitoring and Oversight  
RBR samples will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure complian ce with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of samples as specified in this protocol and in the Informed 
Consent Form.  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate 
parts of records relating to patient partic ipation in the RBR for the purposes of verifying 
the data provided to the Sponsor.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, 
and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and 
documents related to the RBR samples.  
4.6 TREATMENT, PATIENT, STUDY, ARM AND SITE 
DISCONTINUATION  
4.6.1  Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Patients will return to the clinic for an End of Treatment visit at  28 days after last 
treatment.  Patients must permanently discontinue study treatment if they expe rience 
any of the following:  
 Disease progression, unless treatment beyond progression is allowed in the 
applicable arm  
 Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient's safety if he or she continues to receive s tudy treatment  
 Investigator or Sponsor determination that treatment discontinuation is in the best 
interest of the patient  
 Pregnancy  
 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  Patients who discont inue study treatment prematurely will not be 
replaced.  
4.6.2  Patient Discontinuation from the Study  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from  the study at any time.  
Reasons for patient discontinuation from the study may include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  
 Patient withdrawal of consent  
 Study termination or site closure  
 Adverse event  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
108/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Loss to follow -up 
 Patient non -compliance, defined a s failure to comply with protocol requirements as 
determined by the investigator or Sponsor  
 
Every effort should be made to obtain a reason for patient discontinuation from the 
study.  The primary reason for discontinuation from the study should be documen ted on 
the appropriate eCRF.  If a patient requests to be withdrawn from the study, this request 
must be documented in the source documents and signed by the investigator.  Patients 
who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
4.6.3  Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating 
the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients  
 Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory  
 
The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study.   
4.6.4  Study Arm Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to close or restrict  enrollment to a study arm at any time.  
Reas ons for closing or restricting enrollment to a study arm may include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients or a subset of patients  
 Patien t enrollment is unsatisfactory  
 
The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to close any study arm.  
4.6.5  Site Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may 
include, but are not limited  to, the following:  
 Excessively slow recruitment  
 Poor protocol adherence  
 Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
 Non-compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice  
 No study activity (i.e., all patient s have completed the study and all obligations have 
been fulfilled)  
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
109/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this 
study.  Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients  at higher risk for 
toxicities.  Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including 
assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events.  In addition, 
guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage mo dification, if 
applicable, treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided in the 
treatment -specific arms.  Refer to Table  1 for treatment -specific appendices.  
Patients with active infection are excluded from study participation.  In the setting of a 
pandemic or epidemic, screening for infections prior to and during study participation 
should be performed according to local/in stitutional guidelines or those of applicable 
professional societies (e.g., ASCO/ESMO).  
A Steering Committee composed of multidisciplinary members of Roche/Genentech and 
external experts will be set up to review safety data at periodic intervals in order to 
identify the emergence of new or increased safety signals.  
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AN D DEFINITIONS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing protocol -
specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital signs, and 
conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation 
of the study.  
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to  the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section  5.4. 
5.2.1  Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event i s any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:  
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorm al laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
 Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequenc y, or severity of a known condition) (see Section  5.3.5.9  and 
Section  5.3.5.10  for more information)  
 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
110/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug  
 Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of s tudy treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event a ctually causes or leads to death)  
 Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allow ed to continue, might have caused death.  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section  5.3.5.11 ) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient's ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
 Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug  
 Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
(v5.0); see Section  5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions).  
5.2.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Adverse events of special interest are required to be rep orted by the investigator to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
are as follows:  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
111/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Cases of potential drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by  Hy's 
Law (see Section  5.3.5.7 ) 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below  
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical s ymptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in 
a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only when a 
contamination of the study drug is suspected.  
 Please refer to the following treatment -specific appendices in Table  1 for additional 
adverse events of special interest relevant to the respective study treatment.  
 
5.2.4  Selected Adverse Events   
Additional data may be r equired to be collected for selected adverse events.  Please 
refer to the treatment -specific appendices outlined in Table  1 for selected a dverse 
events (where applicable) and their management.  
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING F OR CAPTURING AND ASS ESSING 
SAFETY  PARAMETERS  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section  5.2.1 , 
for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to  the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections  5.45.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section  5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section  5.3.4 ).   
5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All 
adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by  study personnel,  will be 
recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e .g., 
discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see  Section  5.4.2  for instructions for 
reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the 
final dose of study drugs other than atezolizumab and until 90 days after the final dose of 
atezolizumab.  
Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after  the adverse event reporting 
period are provided in Section 5.6. 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
112/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of nondirective 
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed  health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3  Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v5.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  3 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE (v5.0).  
Table  3 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE  
Grade  Severity  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; or intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or 
limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or 
limiting  selfcare activities of daily living b, c 
4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d 
5 Death related to adverse event d 
NCI CTCAE (v5.0)   National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events.  
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE  (v5.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are 
not bedridden.  
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event, " it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
advers e event in Section  5.2.2 . 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section  5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
 
 
5.3.4  Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an 
adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
113/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table  4: 
 Temporal relationship o f event onset to the initiation of study drug  
 Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  
 Known association of the event with the study dru g or with similar treatments  
 Known association of the event with the disease under study  
 Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
 Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
 
Table  4 Causal Attribution Guidance  
Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?  
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant t herapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears upon rechallenge.  
NO An adverse ev ent will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below .   
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g.,  preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, 
or concomita nt medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug).  
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.5  Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only on e adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  
5.3.5.1  Infusion -Related Reactions or Injection -Site Reactions (When 
applicable)   
For applicable study treatments, adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours 
after study  drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion or 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
114/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  injection should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., "infusion -related reaction" or 
"injection -site reaction" "anaphylactic reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, 
avoid ambiguous terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms 
should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction or Injection Reaction 
eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of 
study dru g, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related 
Reaction or Injection Reaction eCRF.  For patients receiving atezolizumab, there may be 
significant  overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and cytokine -release syndrome 
(CRS).  In recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguishing between these two 
events, consolidated guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided 
in the atezoliz umab treatment -specific appendices.  
5.3.5.2  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather t han jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a 
constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single 
diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded 
on the Advers e Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously 
reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that 
corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
5.3.5.3  Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their p rimary cause, with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
 If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  
 If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
 If a severe gastrointe stinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
 If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection , both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
115/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
5.3.5.4  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
A persistent adverse event  is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the even t is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hou rs after learning that the event became serious; see 
Section  5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated 
by changing the event from "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event 
became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.  
A recurrent a dverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.5  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormal ity qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
 Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain a bnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events.  
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified a s an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5   ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e.,  cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adver se Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a 
descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range 
(e.g.,  "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
116/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the 
clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example,  an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section  5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.6  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse e vent.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
 Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
 Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontin uation)  
 Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
 Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertensi on) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section  5.3.5.4  for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.7  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (  3  baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (  2  ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's Law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN (of which   35% is direct bilirubin)  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in comb ination with clinical 
jaundice  
 
5.3.5.8  Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see 
Section  5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of cancer 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
117/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  should be recorded on the Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF.  All other 
deaths that occur during the adverse event reporting period, regardless of relationship to 
study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to 
the Sponsor (see Section  5.4.2 ).  The Steering Committee  will monitor the frequency of 
deaths from all causes.  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse E vent eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes avai lable (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should 
be replaced by the established cause of death.  The term "sudden death"  should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").  
Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
described in Section  5.6. 
5.3.5.9  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical cond ition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequenc y, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the  Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g.,  "more fr equent headaches").  
5.3.5.10  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Cancer  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v 1.1, RANO (for primary CNS tumors).  In rare 
cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic 
deterioration.  However, every effort should  be made to document progression through 
use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to 
disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
5.3.5.11  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization  
Any adverse event  that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse 
event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.   
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
118/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event:  
 Hospitalization for respite care  
 Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study drug administration)  
 Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:  
– The hospitalization wa s planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease  
– The patient has not experienced an adverse event  
 Hospitalization due solely to progression of th e underlying cancer  
 
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:  
 Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  
 
5.3.5.12  Cases of Overdose, Medication Error, Drug Abuse, or Drug 
Misuse  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse 
(hereafter collectively  referred to as "special situations"), are defined as follows:  
 Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
 Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is h igher 
than the assigned dose  
 Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.  
 Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead t o addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm  
 Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not 
qualify as drug abuse  
In cases where drug is to be self -administered by the patient, drug misuse 
could inv olve the drug being administered to someone other than the patient.  
 
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events.  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adv erse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
seriousness criteria  or qualifies as an adverse event of special interest, the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no more than 24  hours after learning of the 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
119/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  event; see Sect ion 5.4.2 ).  For study treatments adverse events associated with special 
situations should be recorded as described below for each si tuation:  
 Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Intentional 
overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the " Drug abuse" box.  If drug 
abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event 
term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter t he adverse event term.  
Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug abuse" box.  
 Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the 
"Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  
Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check 
the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" boxes.  
 
In addition, all special situations associated with study treatments, regardless of whether 
they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as 
described below:  
 Acciden tal overdose:  Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 Intentional overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" box.  If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box.  If drug abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name of the drug 
administered and a description of the e rror (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug 
administered) as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  
 Medication error that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name  and "accidental 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes.  Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.  
 Intercepted medication error:  Enter the drug name and "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term.  Check the "Medication error" box.  Enter a description of 
the error in the additional case details.  
 Drug abuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "drug 
abuse" as the event term.  Check the "Drug abuse" b ox. 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
120/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Drug abuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug abuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug misuse that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "drug 
misu se" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" box.  
 Drug misuse that qualifies as an overdose:  Enter the drug name and "intentional 
overdose" as the event term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" 
boxes.  
 Drug administered to someone other  than the patient:  Enter the drug name and 
"patient supplied drug to third party" as the event term.  Check the "Drug misuse" 
box. 
 
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require two 
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report the accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache.  The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries.  
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPON SOR  
Certain events re quire immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more th an 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list 
of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug:  
 Serious adverse events (defin ed in Section  5.2.2 ; see Section  5.4.2  for details on 
reporting requirements)  
 Adverse events of special interest (defined in Section  5.2.3 ; see Section  5.4.2  for 
details on reporting requirements)  
 Pregnancies (see Section  5.4.3  for details on reporting requirements)  
 
For serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, the investigator must 
report new significant follow -up information to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information 
includes the following:  
 New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
 Significant new diag nostic test results  
 Change in causality based on new information  
 Change in the event's outcome, including recovery  
 Additional significant narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
121/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  
5.4.1  Emergency Medical Contacts  
To ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will 
access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide 
medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical 
Monitor, and track all calls.  The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be 
available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Toll -free numb ers for the Help Desk and 
Medical Monitor contact information will be distributed to all investigators.  
Emergency Medical Call Center Help Des k:  1 (855) 855 -9112  
 
5.4.2  Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.4.2.1  Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The paper Clinical Trial Serious Adver se Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest 
Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the 
Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or 
email address provided to investigators.  
5.4.2.2  Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation  
After initiation of study drug, serious  adverse events and adverse events of special 
interest will be reported until 28 days af ter the final dose of study drugs other than 
atezolizumab and until 90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab.  Investigators should 
record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24  hours after 
learning of the event) on the Adve rse Event eCRF and submit the report via the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A  report will be generated and sent to Safety 
Risk Management by the EDC system.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse 
Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should 
be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emai ling 
the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Once the 
EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the 
EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur  28 days  after the final dose 
of study treatment (or >90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab) are provided in 
Section 5.6. 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
122/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  5.4.3  Reporting R equirements for Pregnancies  
5.4.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed Consent 
Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study 
and for the timeframe specified in the Table  5 after the final dose of study drug.  A paper 
Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the 
Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
pregnancy), either by faxing or by scannin g and emailing the form using the fax number 
or email address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the 
patient, discussing the risks of the pregn ancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious 
adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in 
the mother during or after the pre gnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the 
child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  In addition, the investigator will 
submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the 
course and outcome of the pregnanc y becomes available.

Instructions regarding pregnancy and contraception are provided in Appendix  2. 
5.4.3.2  Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients   
Male patients  will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within the 
timeframe specified in Table  5 after the final dose of study drug.  The investigator should 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
123/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  report the pregnancy on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit 
the form to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., n o more than 24 hours after 
learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using 
the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Attempts should be made to 
collect and report details of the course and outcome o f any pregnancy in the partner of a 
male patient exposed to study drug.  When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner 
would need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy.  I f the authorization has been 
signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with 
additional information on the pregnant partner and the course and outcome of the 
pregnancy as it becomes available.  An investigator who is c ontacted by the male patient 
or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the 
possible effects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the 
treating physician and/or obstetrician.  
Instructions r egarding pregnancy and contraception are provided in Appendix  2. 
5.4.3.3  Abortions  
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, 
and repor ted to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elect ive abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours aft er learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  A therapeutic or 
elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying mate rnal or 
embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.  
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
5.4.3.4  Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child  born to a female patient exposed to study 
drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ).  
The female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a 
serious adverse event and recorded as described in pa ragraph above.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
124/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  5.4.4  Reporting Requirements for Special Situations and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Special 
Situation  
After initiation of study drug, special situations and adverse events associated with 
special situations will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drugs other 
than atezolizumab and until 90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab.  Investigators 
should record all case details that can be gathered on the Adverse  Event eCRF and 
submit the report via the electroni c data capture (EDC) system within 30 calendar days 
of awareness.  A  report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management 
by the EDC system.  
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENT S AFTER ADVERSE  EVENTS  
5.5.1  Investigator Follow -Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient 
is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to 
follow all serious adverse even ts considered to be related to study drug or trial -related 
procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient's medical reco rd to facilitate source data 
verification.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
5.5.2  Sponsor Follow -Up 
For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the 
Sponsor or a designee ma y follow  up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit 
to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g.,  from hospital discharge 
summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent 
medical assessment o f the reported case.  
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVE RSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD 
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 
28 days after the final dose of study drugs other than atezolizumab and 90 days after the 
final dose of atezolizumab), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment.  These events should be reported through use of the Adverse Even t eCRF.  
However, if the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events 
directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the 
paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting 
Form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
125/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTI TUTIONAL REVIEW BOAR DS, 
AND  ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse eve nts and adverse events of 
special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously 
communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRbs, ECs, and applicable 
health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
To deter mine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will

Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
Details of criteria and statistical analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
The efficacy and safety analyses will be performed on the treated study population, 
which includes all enrolled patients who receive at least one dose of study medication.   
Given this study consists of many single arms according to molecular alterations we will 
be estimating (providing confidence intervals and summary statistics) as opposed to 
formal statistical hypothesis testing.   
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
The focus for  this study will be estimation since the study is composed of many single 
arms specific to a targeted therapy.  Estimation of the primary endpoint will be 95% 
confidence intervals using the Clopper -Pearson method.  As such, the maximum margin 
of error for sample sizes 25, 50, and 75 are 20.7%, 14.5%, and 11.8%, respectively.  On 
a per arm basis, if the lower bound of the confidence interval is larger than a benchmark 
specific to that arm, then we will consider the given treatment as a significant 
improvemen t over the benchmark.   
6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT  OF STUDY  
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be 
summarized by arm and, if applicable, by biomarker.  The incidence of study treatment 
discontinuation for reasons o ther than disease progression will be tabulated similarly.  
Protocol deviations, including major deviations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be 
summarized in a similar manner by arm and, if applicable, biomarker . 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BASELINE 
CHARACTERISTICS  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline 
disease characteristics, and medical history, including number of previous regimens) will 
be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, and ra nges for continuous 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
127/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  variables and proportions for categorical variables, as appropriate.  Summaries will be 
presented overall and by treatment arm in the efficacy population (same as safety 
population), which includes all patients with at least one dose of  study treatment.  
6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The efficacy -evaluable population is defined as all enrolled patients who meet arm 
specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and have received at least one dose of study 
treatment.  
6.4.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary endp oint for this study will be cORR as assessed by the investigator and 
according to the corresponding assessment criteria (RECIST v1.1 or RANO).  The 
cORR is defined as the proportion of patients whose confirmed best response is a CR or 
PR for those with mea surable disease and CR for those with non -measurable disease.  
Confidence intervals at both 70% and 95% nominal levels will be reported using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  The primary efficacy endpoint will be computed for all 
treatment arms.  If a patient receives at least one dose of study treatment and 
discontinues the study for any reason before confirmed response can be assessed, the 
patient will be considered a non -responder (not PR and not CR) and will be added to the 
denominator of the computation of  cORR.   
6.4.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for each treatment arm will consist of DCR, PFS, and 
DOR, which are listed and defined below.  All secondary endpoints will be computed for 
all treatment arms and will be computed on th e efficacy evaluable population  
 PFS, defined as the time from start of treatment to the first occurrence of disease 
progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the 
investigator according to the corresponding assessment cr iteria (RECIST v1.1 or 
RANO).  The PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  Median PFS 
and 95% confidence interval will be computed using the Brookmeyer -Crowley 
method.   
 DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objec tive 
response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), 
as determined by the investigator according to the corresponding assessment 
criteria (RECIST v1.1 or RANO).  The DOR will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method.  Me dian DOR and 95% confidence interval will be computed 
using the Brookmeyer -Crowley method.   
 PFS rate at 3 months and every 3 months thereafter for at least up to 1 year, 
defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression 
or death from any cause as determined by the investigator, according to RECIST 
v1.1.  PFS rates will be computed using the Kaplan -Meier method with 95% 
confidence intervals for each rate given by Greenwood’s formula.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
128/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   DCR is defined as the proportion of patie nts whose best response is confirmed CR, 
confirmed PR, or a response of CR, PR, SD, or non -CR/non -PD for a minimum of 
98 days for 28 -day cycle arms or 70 days for 21 -day cycle arms after the first 
treatment dat e.  DCR will be summarized in the same fashion  as the primary 
efficacy endpoint except, for DCR we will limit analysis to the subgroup in the 
efficacy population consisting of those with measurable disease.   
 
6.5 EXPLORATORY EFFICACY   
6.5.1  Exploratory Efficacy Objectives  
Exploratory efficacy objectives are to  evaluate efficacy when subgrouped by tumor site 
of origin, and/or self -reported race and ethnicity.   
6.6 SAFETY ANALYSES  
The safety analysis population will include all patients who received at least one dose of 
study drug.  Safety will be assessed through summaries of exposure to study treatment, 
adverse events, and changes in laboratory test results.  Study treatment expos ure (such 
as treatment duration, total dose received, and number of cycles and dose 
modifications) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  All verbatim adverse event 
terms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
thesaurus terms, and adverse event severity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
(v5.0).  All adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to death, 
adverse events of special interest, and adverse events leading to study treatment 
disco ntinuation that occur on or after the first dose of study treatment (i.e., treatment -
emergent adverse events) will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus 
level, and severity grade.  For events of varying severity, the highest grade will be use d 
in the summaries.  Deaths and cause of death will be summarized.  A shift table of 
selected laboratory tests will be used to summarize the baseline and maximum post 
baseline severity grade.  
6.7 BIOMARKER ANALYSES   
 For all treatment arms, descriptive statist ics of biomarker data will include means 
medians, ranges, and standard deviations, as appropriate.  For categorical 
analyses, frequency distributions will be tabulated as appropriate.  
 Biomarker data in blood and tumor tissue and biomarker data collected o ver time (if 
available) will be used for additional subgroup analyses where primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints and safety will be evaluated.   
 
Although no formal statistical analysis of exploratory biomarkers will be performed, in an 
effort to understand the association of these markers with study treatment response, 
data may be analyzed in the context of this study and in aggregate with data fro m other 
studies.  Results will be presented in a separate report.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
129/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  6.8 NON -BINDING  FUTILITY ANALYSES  
For some arms, limited data are available regarding the efficacy and safety of the 
treatment across the eligible tumor population(s).  Therefore, data from the  first 
12 efficacy -evaluable patients in a given arm will be used to conduct non -binding interim 
tumor agnostic futility analyses.  Futility analyses for some arms may be conducted with 
the integration of data from other ongoing studies (see the Statistica l Analysis Plan 
[SAP] for details).  These analyses will be used to identify whether a treatment may be 
ineffective in a tumor agnostic population due to limited or lack of efficacy, and further 
accrual into such an arm may be stopped.  Enrollment will not  be stopped while awaiting 
results of the tumor agnostic futility analysis.  To perform the analysis we will use 
Bayesian gating with arm -specific gating criteria and non -informative prior where futility 
will be declared if there is a posterior probability  of greater than 60% that the true cORR 
is less than an arm -specific unacceptable level.  
6.9 OPTIONAL INTERIM ANA LYSES  
Given the hypothesis -generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may choose to 
conduct additional interim efficacy analyses.  The decision t o conduct an optional interim 
analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the Sponsor's trial master 
file prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed 
and interpreted by Sponsor study team personne l. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
A contract research organization/Functional Service Provider (CRO/FSP) will be 
responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of the 
data.  Data entered manually will b e collected via EDC through use of eCRFs.  Sites will 
be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event of discrepant data, the 
CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve 
electronically in the EDC system . 
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study.  The Sponsor 
will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to 
be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data and other non -CRF data will b e sent 
directly to the Sponsor and or the CRO, using the Sponsor's standard procedures to 
handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.  
eCRFs and correction will be maintained in the EDC system's audit trail.  System 
backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be 
consistent with the Sponsor's standard procedures.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS   
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Sites 
will receive training and have ac cess to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
130/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.  
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of re ceipt 
of the data is required.  
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site 
personnel are accurate, co mplete, and verifiable from source  documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, labor atory notes, memoranda, evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies  of transcriptions 
that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, 
photographic negatives, microfi lm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records 
kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico -technical departments involved in a clinical 
trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly define d in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and compl eteness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section  7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification and review, the investigators and institutions must 
provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial 
related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC r eview.  The study site must also allow 
inspection by applicable health authorities.  
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS  
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site's computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy recor ds), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An 
acceptable computerized data collection system a llows preservation of the original entry 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
131/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person 
making the change, and date of the cha nge. 
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including  eCRFs, electronic or paper PRO data (if  applicable), Informed Consent 
Forms, laboratory test results, images, and medication inve ntory records, must be 
retained by the Principal Investigator for 15  years after completion or discontinuation of 
the study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, 
whichever is longer.  After that period of time , the documents may be destroyed, subject 
to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or movin g them to another location.  
Roche will retain study data for 25 years after the final study results have been reported 
or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, 
whichever is longer.  
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  AND REGULATIONS  
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice  and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the applicable laws 
and regulations of the country in which the  research is conducted, whichever affords the 
greater protection to the individual.  The study will comply with the requirements of the 
ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting).  Studies conduc ted in the United States or under a U.S. 
Investigational New Drug (IND) Application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and 
applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union or 
European Economic Area will comply with the  E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC) 
and applicable local, regional, and national laws.  
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as an Assent Form or Mobile Nursing Informed Consen t Form, if  applicable) 
will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of 
the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed 
deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Cons ent Forms or any alternate consent 
forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC 
submission.  The final IRB/EC approved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local  requirements.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
132/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  If applicable, the Informed Consent Form will contain separate sections for any optional 
procedures.  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the 
objectives, methods, and potential risks associated with each opti onal procedure.  
Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their 
consent at any time for any reason.  A separate, specific signature will be required to 
document a patient's agreement to participate in optional proc edures.  Patients who 
decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient's legally 
authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history  or 
clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures 
or when  new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be provided to 
the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.  
If the Consent Forms are revised (t hrough an amendment or an addendum) while a 
patient is participating in the study, the patient or a legally authorized representative 
must re -consent by signing the most current version of the Consent Forms or the 
addendum, in accordance with applicable la ws and IRB/EC policy.  For any updated or 
revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall 
document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained 
using the updated/revised Consent Forms for co ntinued participation in the study.  
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient's 
legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in 
each patient's study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study 
monitors at any time.  
Each Consent Form may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure 
of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) of 1996.  If the site utilizes a separate Authorization 
Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information 
under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and  other processes outlined above 
apply except th at IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies.  
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD OR ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, 
and relevant supporting information must be submit ted to the IRB/EC by the Principal 
Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  
In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
133/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of 
the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the 
requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are 
also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any pro tocol amendments (see 
Section  9.7). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the 
local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports 
or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible 
for ensuri ng that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health 
authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and 
archived in the site's study file.  
8.4 CONFIDENTIALITY  
Information technology systems used to col lect, process, and store study -related data 
are secured by technical and organizational security measures designed to protect such 
data against accidental or unlawful loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or 
access.  In the event of a data security breach, appropriate mitigation measures will be 
implemented.  
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique patient identification number.  This means that 
patient names are not i ncluded in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.  
Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed 
to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use an d disclosure of personal health information) signed by the 
patient, unless permitted or required by law.  
Medical information may be given to a patient's personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the patient's welfare, for tr eatment purposes.  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data 
derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or 
patients unless required by law (with the exception of the report fro m Foundation 
Medicine).  The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in 
accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication (see  Section  9.6). 
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators, and  the IRB/EC for  each study site, as appropriate.  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
134/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Study data, which may include imaging data and data on genomic variants, may be 
submitted to government or other health research databases or shared with researchers, 
government agencies, companies, or other groups that ar e not participating in this study.  
These data may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research 
purposes, to advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, and 
commercialization of products to treat and diagnose disease.   In addition, redacted 
Clinical Study Reports and other summary reports will be provided upon request (see 
Section  9.6). 
8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in 
accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the 
course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (see definition of end of 
study in Section  3.2). 
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION,  MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of 
the stud y to be fully documented, including, but not limited to, the protocol, protocol 
amendments, Informed Consent Forms, and documentation of IRB/EC and 
governmental approval.  In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive 
the patient data , including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to 
data.  
9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations.   The investigator 
should promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and 
data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.  The Sponsor will review all protocol deviations and assess 
whether any represent a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice g uidelines and require 
reporting to health authorities.  As per the Sponsor's standard operating procedures, 
prospective requests to deviate from the protocol, including requests to waive protocol 
eligibility criteria, are not allowed.  
9.3 MANAGEMENT OF STUDY QUALITY  
The Sponsor will implement a system to manage the quality of the study, focusing on 
processes and data that are essential to ensuring patient safety and data integrity.  
Prior to study treatment initiation, the Sponsor will identify potential risks associated 
with critical trial processes and data and will implement plans for evaluating and 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
135/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  controlling these risks.  Risk evaluation and control will include the selection of risk -
based parameters (e.g.,  adverse event rate, protocol deviation rate) and the 
establishment of quality tolerance limits for these parameters prior to study treatment 
initiation.  Detection of deviations from quality tolerance limits will trigger an 
evaluation to determine if action is needed.  Details on the establishment and 
monitoring of quality tolerance limits will be provided in a Quality Tolerance Limit 
Management Plan.  
9.4 SITE INSPECTIONS  
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for 
inspection of study data, patients' medical records, and e CRFs.  The investigator will 
permit national and local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators; and the IrBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
9.5 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUC TURE  
This trial will be sponsored and managed by Genentech, Inc.  The Sponsor will provide 
clinical operations management, data management, and medical monitoring.  
Approximately 60 sites will participate to enroll approximately 200 patients.  Enrollment 
will occur through an IxRS .   
Central facilities will be used for certain study assessments throughout the study 
(e.g.,  biomarker analyses), as specified in Section  4.5.  Accredited local laboratories will 
be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges will be collected.  
9.6 DISSEMINATION OF DAT A AND PROTECTION OF TRADE 
SECRETS  
Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providin g 
information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, at scientific 
congresses, in clinical trial registries, and in peer -reviewed journals.   The Sponsor will 
comply with all requirements for publication of study results.  Study data ma y be shared 
with others who are not participating in this study (see Section  8.4 for details), and 
redacted Clinical Study Reports and  other summary reports will be made available upon 
request.  For more information, refer to the Roche Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical 
Study Information at the following website:  
https://www.roche.com/innovation/process/clinical -trials/data -sharing/  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses.  For all 
clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for which a marketing authorization application 
has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a jo urnal 
manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of 
the respective Clinical Study Report.  In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving 
an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has  been filed or approved in any 
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
136/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  country, the Sponsor aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and 
exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.  
The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstract s to the Sponsor prior 
to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other 
studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.  
In accordan ce with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreemen t. 
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication 
of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional 
monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate Sponsor personnel.  
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened 
property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.  
9.7 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance w ith local 
regulatory requirements.  
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to pati ents or changes that involve logistical or 
administrative aspects only (e.g.,  change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

Contraception and Pregnancy Requirements  
CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENT S DURING THE TREATME NT PERIOD 
FOR WOMEN OF CHILDBE ARING POTENTIAL  
Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use effective contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 
 1% per year d uring the treatment period and until the study drug -specific time period 
listed in Table  1.  Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.  
A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not 
reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no 
identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due to surgery 
(i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another cause as determined 
by the investigator (e.g.,  Müllerian agen esis).  The definition of childbearing potential 
may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
CONTRACEPTION REQUIR EMENTS DURING THE TR EATMENT PERIOD 
FOR MEN  
Male patients must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual inte rcourse) or 
use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined 
below:  
 With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are 
not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional 
contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of < 1% per year during 
the treatme nt period and until the study drug -specific time period listed in Table  1. 
 With a pregnant female partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during 
the treatment period until the study drug -specific time period listed in Table  1. 
 
CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S 
Abstinence is defined as true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.   
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of  1% per year include bilateral  
tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -
releasing - intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices.   Note that female 
patients taking pralsetinib must use effective non -hormonal contraceptive metho ds; 
hormonal contraceptive methods must  be supplemented by a barrier method.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence 
(e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and w ithdrawal are

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
Version  1.1 (RECIST v1.1)  
Selected sections from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version  1.1 
(RECIST v1.1) (Eisenhauer et al. 2009) are present ed below, with slight modifications 
from the original publication and the addition of explanatory text as needed for clarity.1 
TUMOR MEASURABILITY  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categ orized as measurable or 
nonmeasurable as described below.  All measurable and non -measurable lesions should 
be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment 
timepoints.  Additional assessments may be performed as clinically in dicated for 
suspicion of progression.  
DEFINITION OF MEASUR ABLE LESIONS  
Tumor Lesions  
Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows:  
 10 mm  by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan 
(CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval  5 mm)  
 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measur able)  
 20 mm by chest X -ray 
 
Malignant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 
 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT  scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be  5 mm).  At  baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be 
measured and followed.  Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided 
below (see "Identification of Target and Non -Target Lesions" and "Calculation of Sum of 
Diameters").  
DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURABLE LESIONS  
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter  10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis  10 mm but  15 mm) as well as truly 
nonmeasurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal

158/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  mass/abdominal organomegaly - identified by physical examination that is not 
measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIO NS REGARDING LESION MEASURABILITY  
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with loc al therapy require 
particular comment, as outlined below.  
Bone Lesions:  
 Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scans, 
and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone 
lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue 
components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as 
CT or MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component 
meets  the definition of measurability described above.  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic Lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts shou ld not be 
considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered 
measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurabil ity described above.  
However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
 
Lesions with Prior Local Treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected t o 
other loco -regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.   
 
METHODS FOR ASSESSIN G LESIONS  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically 
assessed .  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identifi ed and reported lesion at baseline and during the study.  
Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option.  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
159/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  CLINICAL LESIONS  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 
 10 mm in diameter as assessed usi ng calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  For the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size 
of the lesion, is suggested.  
CHEST X -RAY  
Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an  important 
endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions.  
However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  
CT AND MRI SCANS  
CT is the best c urrently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment.  In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on 
CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is  5 mm.  When CT scans 
have slic e thickness of  5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable.  
If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with 
intravenous (IV) contrast because of allergy  or renal insufficiency, the decision as to 
whether a non -contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the 
patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under 
investigation and the anatomic location of the  disease.  For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to 
whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should 
also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic loc ation of the disease, and should 
be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible.  Each case should 
be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the patient should  be considered not evaluable from that point 
forward .  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of 
nontarget disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may 
appear to have a different size using a new  modality.  
ENDOSCOPY, LAPAROSCO PY, ULTRASOUND, TUMO R MARKERS, 
CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be 
used for objective tumor evaluation.  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
160/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN  
To assess objective respo nse or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the 
overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent 
measurements.  
IDENTIFICATION OF TA RGET AND NON -TARGET LESIONS  
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative 
of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one or 
two organ sites involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four lesions (two 
sites), respectively, will be recorded.  Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those o rgans 
will be considered non -target lesions.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and should be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend 
themselves to reproducible repe ated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
Lymph nodes merit special men tion since they are normal anatomical structures that 
may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.  As noted above, pathological 
nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet 
the criterion of a short axi s of  15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes 
will contribute to the baseline sum.  The short axis of the node is the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  Lymph node size is 
normally reported  as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, 
this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, 
sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an 
abdomin al node that is reported as being 20  mm   30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded 
as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis  10 mm 
but  15 mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis of 
 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or 
nonmeasurable),  including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non -target 
lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required.  It is 
possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
161/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  on the C ase Report Form (CRF) (e.g., "multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes" or 
"multiple liver metastases").  
CALCULATION OF SUM O F DIAMETERS  
A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for 
lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each 
subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden.  
Measuring Lymph Nodes  
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anat omical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the node regresses to  10 mm during the study.  Thus, when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even 
if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph  node is defined as having a 
short axis of  10 mm.  
Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure  
During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) recorded at 
baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subseque nt 
evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that 
the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measurement and may 
report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value 
be recorded on the CRF, as follows:  
 If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the 
measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  
 If the l esion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and "too small to measure" should be 
ticked.  (Note:  It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they 
usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat 
such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present 
and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be 
assigned in this circu mstance as well and "too small to measure" should also be 
ticked).  
 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual 
measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is  5 mm, and in that case 
"too small to measure" should not be tic ked. 
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
162/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment  
When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented 
portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters.  Similarly, as 
lesions coalesce, a plane between t hem may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in 
this instance should be the maximu m longest diameter for the coalesced lesion.  
EVALUATION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Measurements are not required for non -target lesions, except that malignant lymph node 
non-target lesions should be monitored for reduction to  10 mm in short axis.  
Non-target lesions should be noted at baseline and should be identified as "present" or 
"absent" and (in rare cases) may be noted as "indicative of progression" at subsequent 
evaluations.  In addition, if a lymph node lesion shrinks to a non -malignant size (short 
axis  10 mm), this should be captured on the CRF as part of the assessment of 
non-target lesions.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
CRITERIA FOR TARGET LESIONS  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions 
are provided below:  
 Complete response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to  10 mm.  
 Partial response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target 
lesions, taking as reference the b aseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR  
 Progressive disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters at prior timepoints 
(including baseline)  
In addition to the rela tive increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of  5 mm.  
 Stable disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD  
 
CRITERIA FOR NON -TARGET LESIONS  
Definitio ns of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non -
target lesions are provided below.  While some non -target lesions may actually be 
measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only 
qualitatively at the ti mepoints specified in the schedule of activities.  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
163/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   CR:  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of 
tumor marker level  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (  10 mm short axis).  
 Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one  or more non -target lesions and/or 
(if applicable) maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
 PD:  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions  
 
SPECIAL NOTES ON ASS ESSMENT OF PROGRESSI ON OF NON -TARGET 
LESIONS  
Patients with Measura ble and Non -Measurable Disease  
For patients with both measurable and non -measurable disease to achieve unequivocal 
progression on the basis of the non -target lesions, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non -target lesions in a magnit ude that, even in the presence of 
SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for  unequivocal progression status.  The 
designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target lesions in 
the face of SD or PR in target lesions will therefore be extremely rare.  
NEW LESIONS  
The appearance of new malignant lesions den otes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for 
the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion 
should be unequivocal, that is, not attri butable to differences in scanning technique, 
change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor 
(for example, some "new" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting 
lesions).  This is particularly import ant when the patient's baseline lesions show PR or 
CR.  For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a 
"new" cystic lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scann ed at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat sca ns confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
CRITERIA FOR OVERALL  RESPONSE AT A SINGL E TIMEPOINT  
Table  1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each response 
assessment timepoint for patients who have measurable disease at baseline.

MISSING ASSESSMENTS AND NOT -EVALUABLE DE SIGNATION  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If measurements are made on only a subset of target 
lesions at a timepoint, usually the case is also consid ered not evaluable at that 
timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the 
individual missing lesions would not change the assigned timepoint response.  This 
would be most likely to happen in the case of PD.  For example, i f a patient had a 
baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and during the study only two 
lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved 
PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion.  
SPECIAL  NOTES ON RESPONSE A SSESSMENT  
Patients with a global deterioration in health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
"symptomatic deterioration."  Every effort shoul d be made to document objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stopping study therapy.  The 
objective response status of such patients is to b e determined by evaluation of target 
and non -target lesions as shown in Table  1.  
Appendix 3:  Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid  Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
165/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  For equivocal findings of progression (e.g., very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.

 Patient does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or 
progression  
 Stable non -enhancin g (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseline  
 Clinical status is stable or improved  
Note:  In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new 
symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on 
neuroimaging, and subsequent follow -up imaging shows that this increase in 
corticosteroids was required because of disease progression, the last scan 
considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the 
corticosteroid dose was equivalent  to the baseline dose.  
 
Response  Criteria for High -Grade Glioma (cont.)  
Progression  Defined by any of the following:  
  25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters 
of enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor 
measurement obtained either at baseline (of no decrease) or best 
response, on a stable or increasing dose of corticosteroids

Note:  Radiation -induced lung disorders are not included in this exclusion criterion.  
A.4.2  Study  Treatment  
Study treatment in this arm will consist of entrectinib.  
A.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Entrectinib will be supplied by the Spon sor as 100 -mg and 200 -mg capsules.   
The study drug will be periodically tested and monitored for its acceptable shelf life.  Any study 
drug that fails to comply with the manufactured specifications will be promptly removed from the 
clinical trial site and  replaced with new supplies by the Sponsor (or designee).  
Each bottle will be labeled with the required regulatory agency warning statement, the protocol 
number, the Sponsor’s name, and directions for patient use and storage.  The investigator 
should ensur e that the study drug is stored in appropriate conditions in a secure location with 
controlled access.  For information on the packaging, handling, and storage, see the Pharmacy 
Manual and Entrectinib Investigator's Brochure.  
A.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Com pliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles.  
Arm A:  Entrectinib in Patients With ROS1 Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
179/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Entre c
tinib will be self-administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days
Section A.6), at the same time each day, on a starting dose of 600 mg/day (three 200-mg 
capsules per day) once a day (QD) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent 
withdrawal.  Modification may be needed in cases of coadministration with moderate or strong 
CYP3A4 inducers (See  Section A.4.3.2 ).  For more specific dosing instructions, refer to the 
pharmacy manual.
The capsules should not be opened and the contents of the capsules should not be dissolved. 
Entrectinib can be taken with or without food.  For patients experiencing fatigue, nausea, or 
other mild tolerability issues, an evening time administration is recommended.
For entrectinib doses to be administered at home, a sufficient number of tablets should be 
dispensed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the investigator’s discretion, through
one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a medication diary the time and date for each 
dose taken.  On Day 1 and on clinic visit days, entrectinib should be taken at the clinic after all 
the predose assessments have been conducted, at the direction of the study research nurse or 
treating physician.
A missed dose can be taken within 12 hours of the scheduled time. After that, patients should 
take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose (including 
vomited doses)
Guidelines for entrectinib dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are 
provided in Section A.5.2.1.
See Section 4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self-administered oral study 
drugs.
Accidental overdose or medication errors should be noted on the Study Drug Administration 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along 
with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as described in Section 5.3.5.12 .
At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused

A.4.3.1  
Permitted Therapy
Seizure prophylaxis with any of the following non-EIAEDs is allowed during the study for pa-
tients with controlled asymptomatic CNS involvement:  levetiracetam, valproic acid, lacosamide, 
gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, zonisamide, clonazepam, clobazam, or 
pregabalin.  Note:  EIAEDs are not allowed (see Section A.4.3.2 ).
Moderate inducers of CYP3A, CYP3A4, or CYP3A4/5, such as dexamethasone or other 
glucocorticoids, may be used at the discretion of the investigator for CNS metastasis.  See 
Appendix 7  for examples of CYP450  inducers, inhibitors, and enzyme-specific substrates.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
180/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  In certain instances, palliative radiotherapy to specific s ites is permitted if considered medically 
necessary by the investigator.  The Sponsor must be notified if palliative radiotherapy is started; 
however, the need for radiotherapy will generally be considered indicative of progressive 
disease.  
It is recommend ed to avoid radiotherapy for at least 5 days after the last dose of entrectinib.  
The irradiated area should be as small as possible and  25% of the bone marrow reserve.  
Entrectinib administration should be withheld during the period of irradiation and f or 2 weeks 
thereafter.  If radiation -related toxicities (other than xerostomia) have not normalized to 
preirradiation levels after 2 weeks of rest, the patient should be discontinued from the study.  
Entrectinib treatment has not been specifically observed to interfere with wound healing; 
therefore, caution is advised on theoretical grounds.  Based upon pharmacokinetic 
considerations, stopping entrectinib treatment is recommended at least 5 7 days prior to major 
elective surgery and 2 3 days prior to minor s urgical procedures.  Postoperatively, the decision 
to reinitiate treatment with entrectinib should be based upon clinical assessment of satisfactory 
wound healing and recovery from surgery.  
No other approved or investigational anti -cancer therapy is permit ted during study participation, 
including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological response modifiers, and/or hormonal 
therapy.  
Bone -sparing agents (e.g., bisphosphonates, denosumab) for palliation of bone metastases or 
for the treatment of osteoporosis or osteopenia are allowed, but initiation of such agents or 
modification of the pre -study bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment regimen should be done 
in consultation with  the Medical Monitor.  
Therapies considered necessary for the patient’s well -being (e.g.,  therapies to manage 
concomitant chronic pathologies or therapies required for life -threatening medical conditions) 
may be administered as per the investigator’s discretion.  For seasonal flu shots, inactivated 
vaccines are allowed.  
Use of concomitant medi cations that increase or possibly increase the risk of QTc prolongation 
and/or induce torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmia must be done with caution or avoided 
if possible during study participation (see  Table  1).

A.4.3.2  Prohibited Therapy  
The following EIAEDs are prohibited during the study and for at least 14 days or 5  halflives 
(whichever is longer) prior to initiation of entrectinib:  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, 
phenytoin, fosphenytoin -, phenobarbital, and primidone.  See Secti on A.4.3.1  above for 
alternative anti -epileptic treatment options.  
Use of herbal medications (e.g., St. John’s Wort) sho uld be avoided when possible.  
Entrectinib is mainly eliminated through hepatic clearance and CYP3A4 plays a significant role 
in the biotransformation of entrectinib.  Co -administration of strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors and inducers should be avoided.   However, moderate inducers of CYP3A, CYP3A4, 
or CYP3A4/5, such as dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids, may be used at the discretion 
of the investigator as clinically indicated per local institutional guidelines.  See Appendix  7 or 
examples of CYP450  inducers, inhibitors, and enzyme -specific substrates.  
In vitro, entrectinib exhibited potential to inhibit and induce the activities of CYP3A, and 
potential for inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6, which suggests a potential for interaction with 
other drugs metabolized by these isoforms.  
Arm A:  Entrectinib in Patients With ROS1 Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
182/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Because of this potentia l, entrectinib should be avoided or, if necessary, administered with 
caution with strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.  Examples of strong and moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors and inducers are listed in  Appendix  7.  If coadministration of strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors with entrectinib is unavoidable, reduce the dose of entrectinib as follows:  
 Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors:  200 mg orally once dail y 
 Strong CYP3A inhibitors:  100 mg orally once daily  
 
A.4.3.3  Prohibited Food  
Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including marmalade 
containing Seville oranges) or star fruit should be avoided during the treatment period.  
A.4.4  Entrectinib -Specific Assessments  
In addition to the study assessments described in Section  4.5, the following assessments are 
required for patients  in the entrectinib treatment arm.  Refer to the schedule of activities 
(Section  A.6) for arm -specific assessment timepoints.  
Local Lab oratory Assessments  
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for 
analysis:  
 Coagulation:  INR and aPTT  
 Lipids:  total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides  
 
Functional Assessments  
 Left-ventricular  ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment:  echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple -
gated acquisition (MUGA)  
 Ophthalmological examinations:  visual acuity and slit -lamp test  
 Single ECG  
 Fall risk factor evaluation and monitoring   
 
A.5 SAFETY PLAN  
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety in this 
study.  Following are further i nstructions specific to Arm A:  entrectinib treatment.  
A.5.1  Risks Associated with Entrectinib  
Entrectinib has been associated with risks such as the following:  cognitive disorders (including 
confusion, mental status changes, memory impairment, and hallucinatio ns), congestive heart 
failure (CHF), bone fractures, and QT prolongation.  Refer to the Entrectinib Investigator’s 
Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for entrectinib.

183/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  A.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events with 
Entrectinib  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or interruption are 
outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than supersede clinical 
judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the invest igator in managing individual 
cases.   
A.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
Adverse events associated with entrectinib can often be managed with concomitant 
medications, supportive care (see Section  A.4.3.1  and  Section  A.5.2.2 ), and/or dose 
modifications as per Table  3. 
If an adverse event is considered unrelated to study treatment and results in dose interruption, 
treatment may resume at the initial dose after the adverse event stabilizes or resolves to Grade 
1 or better, as per the investigator’s discretion.  
If toxicities that are possibly related to entrectinib are not easily managed or corrected, and are 
not tolerable to the patient, or if there are adverse events that are not acceptable in the 
investigator’s judgment, the patient should have stu dy treatment interrupted until the adverse 
event resolves to Grade 1 or better.  If study treatment is interrupted, dose reduction (if 
mandated) should occur when study treatment is resumed.  All dose reductions should be 
based on the most severe toxicity observed that is attributable to entrectinib.  
If needed, dose reductions may occur in decrements of 200  mg and no more than two dose 
reductions will be allowed.  Accordingly, the possible daily doses of entrectinib are shown in  
Table  2.  For patients on an already reduced dose due concomitant CYP3A4 inducer use, 
additional dose modification should be done in consultation with Medical Monitor .  Dose re -
escalation is not permitted for entrectinib.  
Table  2 Entrectinib Dose Reductions  
Dose Level  Dose (mg QD)  
Starting Dose  600 
First reduction  400 
Second reduction  200 
QD   once a day.  
Entrectinib treatment may be interrupted for a maximum of 28 days to allow sufficient recovery 
from any toxicity if a patient is still deriving clinical benefit in the judgment of the investigator.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
186/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  A.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in the subsections below.  
A.5.2.2.1  Nausea and Emesis  
For nausea and emesis , treat with standard antiemetics; prophylactic antiemetics are permitted 
as necessary using institutional guidelines for treatment and/or published guidelines.  Refer to 
Table  1 for concomitant medications that should be administered with caution.  
A.5.2.2.2  Diarrhea  
Treatment with antidiarrheal drugs may be warranted and should follow institutional and/or 
published guidelines.  If no guidelines exist,  then the following recommendations may be 
instituted:  
 For Grade 1 diarrhea, treat with loperamide if needed; no dose modification is necessary.  
 For Grade 2 diarrhea, treat with loperamide (4 mg at first onset, then 2 mg every 2 4 hours 
or after each loose  stool, until symptom free for 12 hours).  No dose modification is 
necessary unless the patient is intolerant or symptom is recurrent.  
 For Grade  3 diarrhea (despite use of loperamide), treatment should be withheld until 
recovery to Grade 1 or better.  
 
A.5.2.2.3  Severe Neutropenia or Anemia  
Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF) or initiation of erythropoietin 
may be instituted according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines in patients 
who are having difficulty with se vere neutropenia or anemia.  Patients who have been treated 
for  4 weeks with erythropoietin prior to enrolling in the study may continue on the existing 
treatment.  
Patients with neutropenic fever or infection should be hospitalized promptly for intraveno us (IV) 
antibiotic therapy and may receive therapeutic colony stimulating factors as appropriate.  
Red blood cell and platelet transfusions should be administered as warranted.  
A.5.2.2.4  Pneumonitis or Pneumonia  
Investigators must thoroughly evaluate patients who dem onstrate potential signs and symptoms 
of pneumonitis or pneumonia.  If a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or study 
drugrelated lung injury, the following evaluations and procedures should be considered to 
assist or exclude the diagnosis of  pneumonitis during this period:  
 A sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) for bacteria, viruses, fungi, 
protozoa, and mycobacteria  
 Blood culture for febrile patients  
 Thoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (examined for same pathogens a s sputum)  
Arm A:  Entrectinib In Patients with ROS1 Fusion -Positive Tumors  
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
187/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), if appropriate.  BAL fluid should be sent 
for culture and cytology (examined for same pathogens as sputum)  
 Lung biopsy (e.g., open or thorascopic preferable; bronchoscopy with transbronchial 
biopsy) , if appropriate  
 A plasma sample for B -type natriuretic peptide to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart 
failure  
 For Asian patients, a blood sample for -D-glucan to evaluate for the presence of protozoal 
pneumonia (e.g., Pneumocystis jiroveci ) 
 
If clinically appropriate, high -dose corticosteroid treatment should be initiated.  Should the event 
be fatal, an autopsy is highly recommended to confirm or to exclude the diagnosis.  For any 
case of suspected pneumonitis, please contact the Sponsor.  See Table  3 for appropriate dose 
modifications.  
A.5.2.2.5  QT Interval Prolongation  
In cases of Grade 2 or 3 QT interval prolongation, assess and correct elect rolytes and 
concomitant medications and follow dose modification guidelines in Table  3.  In cases of Grade 
4 QT interval prolongation, entrectinib should be permanently discontinued.   
A.5.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
Section  5.2.3  describes adverse events of special interest that are required to be reported by 
the investigator to the Sponsor immediately for all study treatments, and Section  5.4.2  provides 
reporting instructions.  In addition to the adverse events of special interest specified in 
Section  5.2.3 , the following adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator 
immediately for patients in the Entrectinib treatment arm:  
 Bone fractures:  All grades  
 Cognitive disturba nces:  Grade  2 
 Congestive cardiac failure:  Grade  2 
 QT prolongation:  Grade  2 
 Syncope:  All grades

b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatmen t for end -of-treatment 
follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this vi sit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may 
take place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to co llect AE data and 
any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed  
Arm A:  Entrectinib In Patients with ROS1 Fusion -Positive Tumors

190/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  c Required follow -up information will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinic visits every 3  months for up to at least 1 year, until death, loss 
to follow -up, or study termination by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first.  
d Informed consent must be documen ted before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive ROS1 gene fusion status should occur prior to performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) 
used by the patient within  7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory,  gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinic ally indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h All performance status will be assessed accord ing to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be  performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, p regnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.   
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO2, alkaline phosphatas e, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequ ent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophi ls, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m Lipids include total cholesterol, triglyce rides, LDL, and HDL.  
n LVEF assessment by ECHO or MUGA to be performed at screening, Cycle 3 Day 1 ( 7 days), as clinically indicated, and at the end of 
treatment (if patient experienced Grade 2 or higher ejection fraction decrease at Cycle 3 or at any tim e during treatment, or if clinically 
indicated).  The end -of-treatment LVEF is not necessary if the last LVEF assessment was performed within 1 week prior to the end of treatment 
visit and if the investigator deems it is not clinically indicated.  Evaluati on of LVEF must be performed by the same method (ECHO or MUGA) 
for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO/MUGA scan for each individua l patient.  
o At study treatment visits (Day 1 of a given cycle), per form pre -dose and 4 hours [  15 min] post -dose for Cycles 1 3, and pre -dose every 2 
cycles thereafter.  Patients should be resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes prior to ECG recording.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
191/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  p Ophthalmologic examinations including at least visual acuity and slit -lamp tests (which may be performed by an optometrist) will be required at 
Screening, Cycle 2 Day 1, at the end of treatment, and as clinically indicated.  Note: The time window for ophth almologic examinations is 1 
week.  
q Fall risk evaluation and monitoring: at every visit, patients will be asked about risk factors of fall, weight, nutritional i ntake, nutritional 
deficiencies, impaired cognition and health deterioration. Relevant finding s will be recorded as adverse events.  Additional assessments may be 
performed at the discretion of the treating physician.  
r All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor  
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contras t allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
s At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographi c procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
t For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If b oth archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
u Blood samples will be collec ted at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week of the first tumor assessment), and at tumor 
progression for analyses including ctDNA.   
v Study drug compliance will be reviewed with the patient.  
w After informed consent has been obtain ed but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.  
All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  After this period, all 
deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if th e investigator becomes aware of any 
serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
x Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days af ter the final dose of study drug.  
y After treatment discontinuation, information on survival follow -up and new anti -cancer therapy (including targeted therapy) will be collected via 
telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits approximately every 3 months for at least up to  1 year or until death (unless the 
patient withdraws consent, is lost to follow up or the Sponsor terminates the study), whichever comes first.  If a patient re quests to be withdrawn 
from follow -up, this request must be documented in the source documents a nd signed by the investigator.  If the patient withdraws from the 
study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status  only.

B.4.2  Study Treatment  
Study treatme nt in this arm will consist of inavolisib (GDC -0077).  
B.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) will be supplied by the Sponsor as an immediate -release tablet 
formulation (3 -mg and 9 -mg).  
The 3 -mg and 9 -mg tablets should be stored at or below 86°F ( 30°C) and protected from 
light.  Patients should be cautioned to keep the tablets in the foil -protected cards 
supplied, and to NOT remove them except immediately prior to consumption.  
For information on the packaging, handling and storage, see the Pharmacy  Manual and 
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) Investigator's Brochure.  
B.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 28 -day cycles.  
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) will be self -administered by patients orally at home (except on 
clinic days) at the same time each day, on a starting dose of 9  mg/day (one 9 -mg tablet 
per day) once a day (QD) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or conse nt 
withdrawal.  For more specific dosing instructions, refer to the pharmacy manual.  
The tablets will be swallowed whole (not chewed) with 8 ounces (240 mL) of fluid, 
preferably water.  
For inavolisib (GDC -0077) doses to be administered at home, a sufficien t number of 
tablets should be dispensed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the 
investigator’s discretion, through one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a 
medication diary the time and date for each dose taken.  
A missed dose can be  taken within 9 hours of the scheduled time.  After that, patients 
should take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose 
(including vomited doses).  
Guidelines for inavolisib (GDC -0077) dosage modification and treatment inter ruption or 
discontinuation are provided in Section  B.5.2.1 .  
See Section  4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self -administered oral 
study drugs.

Tumors  
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
196/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Accidental overdose or medication errors should be noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Rep ort Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or 
medication error, along with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as 
described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused study drug.  
B.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
B.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients who experience tox icities should be treated symptomatically as clinically 
indicated.    
Patients treated with antiseizure medications or warfarin should have levels monitored 
regularly.  
Patients who use oral contraceptives or other allowed maintenance therapy as specified 
in the eligibility criteria (see Section  B.4.1.1  and Appendix  2) should continue their use.  
Anti-emetics and anti -diarrheal medications should not be administered prophylactically 
before i nitial treatment with study drug.  At the discretion of the investigator, prophylactic 
anti-emetic and anti -diarrheal medication(s) may be used as per standard clinical 
practice before subsequent doses of study drug.  
Pain medications administered per stand ard clinical practice are acceptable while the 
patient is enrolled in the study.  
Bisphosphonate and denosumab therapy for bone metastases or 
osteopenia/osteoporosis is allowed.  
Multivitamins, calcium, and vitamins C, D, and E supplements are allowed.  Howe ver, 
due to the potential for drug -supplement interactions, and variability among suppliers 
and batches, the use of other dietary supplements is cautioned.  
B.4.3.2  Prohibited Foods and Therapies  
Use of the following foods and therapies is prohibited during the st udy and for at least 
7 days prior to initiation of study treatment, unless otherwise specified below:  
 Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or experimental, including 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, herbal therapy, or 
hormonal therapy, except for those administered as study treatment.

Tumors  
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
197/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   Primary prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., erythropoietins, 
granulocyte colony -stimulat ing factor [G -CSF], and granulocyte -macrophage 
colony -stimulating factor [GM -CSF]) is not permitted, however, they may be used to 
treat treatment -emergent neutropenia or anemia as indicated by the current 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidel ines or as secondary 
prophylaxis if dose reduction or delay is not considered a reasonable alternative 
after discussion  with the  Sponsor.  
 
Patients who require the use of any prohibited therapies will be discontinued from study 
treatment and followed for safety outcomes for 28  days after their last dose of inavolisib 
(GDC -0077), or until they receive another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
In vitro data suggest that inavolisib (GDC -0077) is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and that t here is a low to moderate potential for a drug -drug interation (DDI) 
with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces this enzyme.  Therefore, 
strong/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers  should be avoided (see Appendix  7).  
If use of one of these medications is necessary, the  risks and benefits should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to its concomitant administration with i navolisib 
(GDC -0077).  
In vitro data also suggest that inavolisib (GDC -0077) is a substrate of the efflux 
transporter P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and concomitant use of inhibitors of P -gp is not 
recommended in this study.  
 Inhibitors of P -gp include, but not limited to:  ritonavir, cyclosporine, verapamil, 
erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, quinidine, elacridar, valspodar, grapefruit 
juice, grapefruit supplements, and Seville oranges   
 
The above lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive.  T hus, the 
investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication 
as well as the Internet references provided below when determining whether a certain 
medication strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A4, or inhibits P -gp.  In addit ion, the 
investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications 
not listed above.

B.5 SAFETY PLAN  
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety 
in this study.  Following are further instructions specific to Arm B:  inavolisib (GDC -007) 
treatment.  
B.5.1  Risks Associated with Inavolisib (GDC -0077)  
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) has been associated with risks such as the following:  
hyperglycemia, stomatitis /mucositis, gastrointestinal inflammation, rash, lung 
inflammation/pneumonitis, immunosuppression with increased risk of infection, potential 
permanent reproductive sterility, ocular toxicity, and potential drug -drug interaction with 
CYP3A4, as their conce ntration may be decreased with concomitant administration.  
Refer to the Inavolisib (GDC -0077) Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of 
anticipated safety risks for inavolisib (GDC -0077).  
B.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events wi th 
Inavolisib (GDC -0077)  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assesse d by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.  In general, for the management of specific adverse 
events of Grade   3 outlined below, inavolisib (GDC -0077) administration should be 
interrupted.  
B.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
Any dose modification  should be noted on the corresponding Study Drug Administration 
eCRF.  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along with any associated  
adverse events, should be reported as described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Patients may hold  the inavolisib (GDC -0077) for up to 28  consecutive  days  in order to 
recover from toxicity or an adverse event related to the study drug.

Tumors  
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
199/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  If neede d, dose reductions may occur in decrements of 3  mg and no more than two dose 
reductions will be allowed.  Accordingly, the possible daily doses of inavolisib 
(GDC -0077) are shown in Table  1. 
If the patient continues to experience specified drug -related adverse events after the 
second reduction, the treatment should be discontinued.  Dose re -escalation is not 
permitted for inavolisib (GDC -0077). 
Table  1 Inavolisib (GDC -0077) Dose Reductions

First dose reduction  6 mg QD  
Second dose reduction  3 mg QD  
Third dose reduction  Not permitted  
QD   once a day.  
Inavolisib (GDC -0077) treatment may be temporarily interrupted in patients who 
experience toxicity considered to be related to study drug.  If inavolisib (GDC -0077) has 
been withheld for > 28 consecutive days because of treatment -related toxicity, the 
patient should be discontinued from inavolisib (GDC -0077).  Inavolisib (GDC -0077) may 
be suspended for reasons other than toxicity (eg, surgical procedures), however 
inavolisib (GDC -0077) should be interrupted at least 48  hours in advance of surgery and 
resume d only upon resolution to baseline of any sequelae of the procedure, including 
adequate wound healing.  If, in the judgment of the investigator, the patient is likely to 
derive clinical benefit from resuming study treatment after a hold of  28 consecutive  
days, study drug may be restarted upon  consultation with  the Medical Monitor.  
B.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are provided in the subsections

a High-risk factors for diabetes include pre -diabetes, overweight, obese, BMI  30 kg/m2, hemoglobin A 1C 
 5.7%, over 45 years of age, family history of diabetes, certain ethnicities, inactive lifestyle, and history 
of gestational diabetes  
b Fasting glucose should be checked by finger stick or lab value (if patient has scheduled appointment) 
PRIOR  to dosing.  Oral anti -diabetic medications should be titrated to the maximum allowed dosages 
to achieve control of blood glucose to  160 mg/dL or 8.9  mmol/L.  For example, metformin may be 
administered to a maximum dose allowed as per local prescribing information, given in divided doses, 
as tolerated.  Please see local pr escribing information of individual oral anti -diabetic agent for dosing 
guidelines  
c There is a risk of hypoglycemia if insulin or sulfonylureas are used, particularly if these agents are 
started during periods of inavolisib (GDC -0077) exposure and doses a re not adjusted appropriately 
during periods of treatment interruption, during which patients’ insulin sensitivity may increase rapidly.  
Short term insulin is allowed to control blood glucose levels, but goal should be to maintain on oral 
agents once acut e episode resolves.  
d It is recommended that the patient is re -assessed within 24 hours and preferably the same day for 
assessments of hydration status and renal function.  
e A maximum of two dose reductions will be allowed.  
f If, in the investigator’s opi nion, the benefit -risk assessment favors continued inavolisib (GDC -0077) 
dosing without interruption, inavolisib (GDC -0077) may be continued without interruption upon 
discussion with Medical Monitor once patients are managed on anti -diabetic agent(s) and f asting 
glucose  200 mg/dL or  11.1 mmol/L.  It is recommended that patients be instructed to utilize a 
glucometer to monitor fasting glucose and to call the clinic if fasting glucose  200 mg/dL or  11.1

202/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  The anti -hyperglycemic agent metformin should be used first -line for the management of 
sustained Grade 2 and Grade 3 hyperglycemia.  Investigators should exercise caution in 
the dosing and management of patients receiving metformin in combination with 
inavolisib (GDC -0077) and must be vigilant for signs of renal impairment and metformin 
toxicity.  In the event metformin is not tolerated or not sufficient, another 
anti-hyperglycemic medication(s) may be added to or used in place of me tformin.  
Preferred agents include sodium -glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, 
pioglitazone, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, where available and 
considered appropriate by investigators.  
Patients at risk for developing hyperglycemi a, such as obese and pre -diabetic patients, 
may initiate treatment with metformin on Day 1 of the study at the treating investigator’s 
discretion.

B.5.2.2.4  Stomatitis/Oral Mucositis  
Guidelines for management of stomatitis/oral mucositis are summarized in Table  5. 
For any grade stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, aggressive mouth care that includes 
mouthwash formulations (e.g., combinations of corticosteroid, local anesthetic, 
antihistamine, antacid, antifungal and/or antibiotics) may be implemented to help 
manage sym ptoms.  Diet should be modified (e.g., avoidance of spicy foods) and harsh 
mouth washes (e.g., Listerine) should be avoided.  
A compounded alcohol -free mouthwash of dexamethasone (0.5 mg in 5 mL) is 
recommended for prophylaxis or treatment of stomatitis/mucositis.  As per the SWISH 
study (Rugo et al. 2017), patients may use 4 times daily for 8 weeks (10 mL swished for 
2 minutes and spat) started concurrently with study treatment, and/or used reactively 
with the first appearance of symptoms.  No  food or drink should be consumed for at least 
1 hour after swishing and spitting the dexamethasone mouthwash.  Additional 
mouthwash formulations (e.g., combinations of local anesthetic, antihistamine, 
corticosteroid, antacid, antifungal and/or antibiotics ) or topical corticosteroids 
(e.g.,  triamcinolone acetonide 0.05 0.5%, fluocinolone acetonide 0.025 0.05%, 
clobetasol propionate 0.025%) may be implemented.  Patients should avoid alcohol -,

a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treatment.  However, if 
the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 1, with the 
exception of glucose.  Scans to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed   4 weeks prior to 
initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the stu dy center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment for end -of-treatment 
follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  If the patient’s  worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may 
take place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to co llect AE data and 
any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated .

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
210/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  e Confirmation of positive PIK3CA activating mutation  status should occur prior to performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) 
used  by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, and 
throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculo skeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any 
abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -
directed physical examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient 
notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h All performance status w ill be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indi cated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.  Patients 
who have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.     
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT,  
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to ad ministration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  With the exception of fasting blood glucose, results that are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 do not have to 
be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1; fasting blood glucose must be assessed within 24 hours of Cycle 1, Day 1.  Subsequent chemistry  evaluations 
should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to  3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).  If results are obtained within 7 days  of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m Fasting lipid panel (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL) and amylase and lipase.  Patients must have been fasting 8 h ours prior to blood 
draw.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
n Repeat HbA1c should be performed after 3 months if the last value was more than 7.5% or as clinically indicated.

overnight fasting, with weekly phone visits with site staff to review results and assess any potential signs or symptoms of h yperglycemia.  For 
Cycle 2, fasting glucose should be measured twice weekly at home.  Patients should notify their physician if any abnormal val ues are 
measured.   Additionally, fasting plasma glucose should be checked in -clinic (or at an offsite lab if in -clinic is not f easible) for Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle, as well as Day 15 of cycles 1 and 2 and recorded in the CRF.  If an offsite lab is used to assess glucose, a phone visit 
should be conducted to review results and assess any potential signs or symptoms of hyperg lycemia.  For Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, samples should 
be drawn within 24 hours;  for all other subsequent cycles, samples should be drawn within 48 hours prior to study drug administration at the 
clinic; glucose results must be available and reviewed prior to dosing.  In addition, patients may be instructed to monitor fasting glucose more 
frequently via use of home glucometer.  
p Ophthalmologic examinations including at least visual acuity and slit -lamp tests (which may be performed by an optometrist) will be re quired at 
screening, at Cycle 6, at the end of treatment, and as clinically indicated.  Note: The time window for ophthalmologic examin ations is 1 week.  
q All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subse quent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated ( i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to a ssess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
r At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -asses sed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or R ANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
s For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre-treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If b oth archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
t Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.  
u Study drug compliance will be revie wed with the patient.  
v Patients on anti -hyperglycemic agents for the treatment of hyperglycemia during the study treatment and those patients with events of 
hyperglycemia ongoing at the end of the 28 -day safety follow -up, will undergo additional safety f ollow -up assessments monthly until resolution 
of their fasting glucose to baseline levels, complete down -titration of their anti -hyperglycemic medications, or up to approximately 3 months 
after the final dose of study treatment, even if the patient initiat es another anti -cancer therapy.

C.4.2  Study Treatment  
Study treatment in this arm will consist of alectinib.  
C.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Alectinib will be supplied by the Sponsor as 150 -mg capsule.  Each capsule contains 
150 mg of alectinib hydrochloride (as free base), lactose monohydrate, 
hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), magnesium stearate and 
carboxymethylcellulose calcium, encapsulated in a capsule shell consisting of 
hypromell ose, carrageenan, potassium chloride, titanium dioxide, and carnauba wax.  
The formulation contains SLS as a surfactant excipient.  This excipient is known to be 
associated potentially with gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, and abdominal pain.  
For information on the packaging, handling and storage, see the Pharmacy Manual and 
Alectinib Investigator's Brochure.  
C.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles.  
Alectinib will b e self -administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days), at the 
same times each day, on a starting dose of 600 mg (four 150 -mg capsules) twice a day 
(BID) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.  For more 
spec ific dosing instructions, refer to the pharmacy manual.  
Arm C:  Alectinib in Patients with ALK Gene Fusion -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
217/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  The capsules should not be opened and the contents of the capsules should not be 
dissolved.  Alectinib should be taken with food.  
For alectinib doses to be administered at home, a sufficient number o f capsules should be 
dispensed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the investigator’s discretion, 
through one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a medication diary the time and date 
for each dose taken.  
A missed dose can be taken wi thin 6 hours of the scheduled time.  If the missed dose time 
is greater than 6 hours, or if the patient vomits the dose, the patient should wait until the 
next scheduled time and take the next scheduled dose.  Patients should not take two 
doses at the same  time to make up for a missed dose.  
Guidelines for alectinib dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation 
are provided in Section  C.5.2.1 .  
See Section  4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self -administered oral study 
drugs.  
Accidental overdose or medication errors should be noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Repor t Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or 
medication error, along with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as 
described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused study drug.  
C.4.3  Concomitant Therapy  
C.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
The medications and/or treatments below are permitted:  
 Local therapy (e.g., stereotactic radiotherapy or surgery) may be given in patients with 
isolated asymptomatic CNS progression (e.g., new CNS oligometastases) after 
discussion with the Sponsor.  
 
Caution should be exercised when the following medications are co -administered wi th 
alectinib:  
 For medications that are substrates of P -gp transporter or breast cancer resistance 
protein transporter, the investigator should carefully assess the risks against the 
benefits when considering concomitant use of alectinib.  Alectinib has bee n shown to 
have potential for inhibition of these transporters.  Substrates with a narrow 
therapeutic index (e.g., methotrexate, digoxin) should be avoided.  If co -administration 
Arm C:  Alectinib in Patients with ALK Gene Fusion -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
218/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  cannot be avoided, it is recommended that drug levels and/or signs for toxici ty are 
carefully monitored.  
 
C.4.3.2  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following therapies (e.g. prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or 
homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) is prohibited during the study and for at 
least 14 days prior to init iation of alectinib treatment, unless otherwise specified below.  
Exceptions to restrictions of the concomitant therapies listed below may be made if the 
rationale is discussed and documented between the investigator and the Sponsor’s 
Clinical Pharmacologi st. 
 Systemic immunosuppressive drugs, cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agents (other 
than study drug treatment), ergot derivatives, probenecid, and bile acid -binding resins 
while on study treatment  
Note: The use of systemic corticosteroids for the management of CNS 
metastases may be permitted upon discussion with the Sponsor.  
 Systemic chemotherapy  
 Radiotherapy/radionuclide therapy except for palliative radiotherapy to bone lesions or 
for pain contro l  
If palliative radiation is indicated, palliative radiation may start within 24 hours of 
the last dose of alectinib, unless, in the judgment of the investigator, patient 
safety will require a longer washout period prior to palliative therapy.  Dosing of 
alectinib may resume with the resolution of any radiation toxicity to Grade 1 or 
better.  
 Additional investigational drug (except during the follow -up period)  
The list of medications provided above is not necessarily comprehensive.  Thus, the 
investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication as 
well as the Internet reference provided below when determining whether a certain 
medication may interact with alectinib.  In addition, the investigator should contact the 
Sponsor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.

C.4.4  Arm-specific Assessments  
Arm-specific assessments for patients receiving alectinib are displayed in the Schedule of 
Activities (see Section  C.6). 
Local Laboratory Assessments  
 Chemistry: blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK)   
 Liver Function: ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin  
Arm C:  Alectinib in Patients with ALK Gene Fusion -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
219/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   
Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
while the patient is in a seated position , and temperature .  
Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
Single ECG recordings will be obtained at specified timepoints, as outlined in the 
schedules of activities (see Section  C.6), and may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints 
as indicated.  
All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high -quality, high -fidelity digital 
electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements.  Lead 
placement should be as consistent as poss ible.  ECG recordings must be performed after 
the patient has been resting in a supine or semi -supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
The same recording position (supine or semi -supine) should be used for each patient 
throughout the study.  All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at 
that same time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and should not be obtained 
within 3 hours after any meal.  Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, 
including environmental distra ctions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be 
avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording.  
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copies of ECG tracings will b e kept as part of the patient's permanent 
study file at the site.  Digital recordings will be stored at the site.  In the event that the ECG 
machine does not directly provide results for RR and/or QTcF, these parameters can be 
derived using the following f ormulae:  
 QTcFFridericia’s correction for QTc measurement (if not provided directly by the ECG  
machine):  
𝑄𝑇𝑐𝐹  (𝑚𝑠)= 𝑄𝑇 (𝑚𝑠)
√𝑅𝑅 (𝑚𝑠)/10003 
 RR Interval Formula (if not provided directly by the ECG machine):  
 RR (ms) = 60000/heart rate (bpm)  
Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities must be documented on 
the eCRF.  If considered appropriate by the Sponsor, ECGs may be analyzed 
retrospectively at a central laboratory.  
If at a particular postdose timepoint the mean QTcF is  500 ms  and/or  60 ms longer 
than the baseline value, another ECG must be recorded, ideally within the next 5 minutes, 
and ECG monitoring should continue until QTcF has stabilized on two successive ECGs.  
Standard -of-care treatment may be instituted per the disc retion of the investigator.  The 
Arm C:  Alectinib in Patients with ALK Gene Fusion -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
220/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  investigator should also evaluate the patient for potential concurrent risk factors 
(e.g.,  electrolyte abnormalities, co -medications known to prolong the QT interval, severe 
bradycardia).  
C.5 SAFETY PLAN  
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety in 
this study.  Following are further instructions specific to Arm C: alectinib treatment.

examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
g Includes respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure while the patient is in a seated position, a nd temperature . 
h All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening, within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in t he schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be d one Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study  drug.  Patients who 
have a posi tive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.  
Arm C:  Alectinib in Patients with ALK Gene Fusion -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
229/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Sc reening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations shoul d be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k On Day 15 of the first 3 cycles, only ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin need to be assessed.  
l  Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1  they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
m A single 12 -lead ECG should be performed as specified, and additionally if clinically indicated during the study treatment period.  Patie nts 
should be resting in a supine position for at least 10 minut es prior to ECG recording.  
n Study drug compliance will be reviewed with the patient.  
o All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance) , a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confi rm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
p At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable, and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3  evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays  or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of  an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
q For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biops y) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
r Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression (within 7 days after progression) for analyses including ctDNA.   
s After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug. 
All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities re solve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  After this period, all 
deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becom es aware of any 
serious adverse event that i s believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
t Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs , vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.

233/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   
D.4.2  Study Treatment  
Study treatment  in this arm will consist of ipatasertib.  
D.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Ipatasertib will be supplied by the Sponsor as 100 -mg and 200 -mg tablets.   
The study drug will be periodically tested and monitored for its acce ptable shelf life.  Any 
study drug that fails to comply with the manufactured specifications will be promptly 
removed from the clinical trial site and replaced with new supplies by the Sponsor (or 
designee).  
Each bottle will be labeled with the required re gulatory agency warning statement, the 
protocol number, the Sponsor’s name, and directions for patient use and storage.  The 
investigator should ensure that the study drug is stored in appropriate conditions in a 
secure location with controlled access.  
For information on the packaging, handling and storage, see the Pharmacy Manual and 
Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure.  
D.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles.  
Ipatasertib will be self -administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days), at 
the same time each day, on a starting dose 400  mg/day (two 200 -mg tablets per day) 
once a day (QD) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or consent withd rawal.  
For more specific dosing instructions, refer to the pharmacy manual.  
The tablets will be swallowed whole (not chewed) with 3 ounces (90 mL) of fluid.  
Ipatasertib is recommended to be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day, 
and patients should refrain from eating overnight .  Patients are required to receive 
prophylaxis (see Section  D.5.2.2.1 ) with loperamide thr oughout the first cycle and at 
subsequent cycles as clinically indicated.  
For ipatasertib doses to be administered at home, a sufficient number of tablets should 
be dispensed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the investigator’s discretion , 
through one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a medication diary the time and 
date for each dose taken.  
A missed dose can be taken within 8 hours of the scheduled time.  After that, patients 
should take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose 
(including vomited doses).

234/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Guidelines for ipatasertib dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation are provided in Section  D.5.2.1 . 
See Section  4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self -administered ora l 
study drugs.  
Accidental overdose or medication errors should be noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or 
medication error, along with any associated adverse events, should also be reporte d as 
described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused study drug.  
D.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by a pat ient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days 
prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  All such 
medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.  
D.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Oral contraceptives, as allowed per local guidelines  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below :  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for a preexisting lesion, provided it does not 
interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be 
irradiated must not be a site of measurable disease).  Study treatment should 
be suspended during palliative radiotherapy (see Section D.4.3.3 ).  Treatment 
with ipatasertib should be temporarily held for at least 7 days before and after 
the procedure (at least 14 days after radiation is recommended).  For a single 
fraction of radiotherapy, this hold may be shorter, if discussed by the 
investigator with the Medical Monitor.  The patient may continue ipatasertib 
treatment after tr eatment holding has been completed and the patient has 
sufficiently recovered.  
 Prophylaxis use of loperamide is mandated in the first cycle and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea.  Patients who experience 
diarrhea should be o n treatment doses of loperamide per the management 
guidelines provided in Section D.5.2.1 ; please refer to that section for additional

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
235/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  details.  Patients should be educated/reminded to be cognizant of the onset, 
duration, severity, and frequency of symptoms and the medications administered.  
 Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor treatment is permitted.  The primary 
prophylaxis should be ad ministered per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 
and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines; namely, in patients 
who are  60 years of age and/or with como rbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et al. 
2011)  
 Bisphosphonate therapy or RANKL inhibitor therapy (e.g., zolendronic acid and 
denosumab) used specifically to prevent skeletal events (e.g., bone metastasis, 
osteoporosis) is allowed.  Both types of agents h ave potential immunomodulatory 
properties, but may be used as clinically indicated.  
 Luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone or gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
agonists for ovarian function preservation are allowed.  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulatio n therapy (such as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin)  
 Inactivated influenza vaccinations  
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant after initiation of study 
treatment  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)  
 Inhaled corticosteroids administered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 
asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with support ive therapies as 
clinically indicated and per institutional practice.  For example, patients who experience 
infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., fa motidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed w ith supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen 
and β2 -adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
D.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy   
Patients who require radiation or surgery as part of medical treatment in the absence of 
radiographic disease progression must exercise caution, and all study treatment should 
be temporarily held for at least 7 days before and after the procedure (at lea st 14 days 
after radiation is recommended).  For minor surgeries or single -day radiotherapy, this

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
236/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with  the Medical Monitor.  After the 
temporary treatment hold is complete, study treatment may be re -initiated when the 
patient has sufficiently recovered.  Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events (refer to 
Section  D.5.2.2.6  and Section  D.5.2.2.7  for details).  All study treatment should be 
temporarily held during systemic corticosteroids treatment  
D.4.3.2.1  Medications Given with Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by CYP3A and may be a time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A 4.  A clinical drug−drug interaction (DDI) study with 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) showed a 2.2 -fold increase in midazolam 
exposures in presence of steady -state ipatasertib dosed at 600 mg QD.  Therefore, 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow t herapeutic window should be avoided.  Given 
that ipatasertib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, there is a high potential for 
drug−drug interactions of ipatasertib with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces 
CYP3A.  Data from a clinical study sho wed that ipatasertib exposures were reduced by 
~50% when co -administered with enzalutamide, a strong CYP3A inducer.  Strong 
CYP3A inhibitors are expected to increase ipatasertib exposures significantly.  
Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers or  CYP3A4/5 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index should be avoided or used with caution (see  Appendix  7).  
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all stud y 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients are permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 with caution.  
Patients should be closely monitored.  Refer to the following information for furt her 
guidance on CYP450−drug interactions and a list of common substrates, inhibitors, and 
inducers:

and Inducers (U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA]): 
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentReso
urces/ DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm  
The above lists of medications are not comprehensive.  The investigator should consult 
the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication ca n be 
safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should contact the 
Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.

MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
237/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  D.4.3.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because thei r 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug−drug interactions (DDIs) are 
generally unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
D.4.3.3  Prohibited Thera py 
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Investigational therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) is prohibited 
within 21 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment.  
 Concomit ant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy) is prohibited  
 Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A 
subst rates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not permissible by the 
Medical Monitor after enrollment (refer to the guidance in Section  D.4.3.2.1 ) 
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment,  
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients should be closely m onitored.  Patients who require short -term use of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may continue study treatment with caution.

D.5 SAFETY P LAN 
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety 
in this study.  Following are further ins tructions specific to Arm D: ipatisertib treatment.  
D.5.1  Risks Associated with Ipatasertib  
Ipatasertib has been associated with risks such as the following: nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, asthenia/fatigue, hyperglycemia, erythema 
multiforme, and rash.  Ipatasertib’s potential risks include hematologic or 
immunosuppressant effects, hyperlipidemia, hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis, colitis, and 
developmental toxicity.   Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed 
descrip tion of anticipated safety risks for ipatasertib.  
D.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events with 
Ipatasertib  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are int ended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.   
D.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or disco ntinuation are 
provided below.  
Dose modifications will be performed as clinically appropriate based on the investigator’s 
medical judgment.   Details in this section can be used as guidance; however, only the 
specific dose levels shown should be used ( Table 1).

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC Study —Genentech, Inc.  
239/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Any dose modification  should be noted on the corresponding Study Drug Administration 
eCRF.  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along with any associated  
adverse events, shou ld be reported as described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Patients may hold  the ipatasertib  for up to 28 consecutive  days  in order to recover from 
toxicity or an adverse event related to the study drug.  
If the patient does not tolerate the QD dosing of ipatasertib, dosing with food may be 
used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhe a.  
No more than two dose reductions of ipatasertib per patient (i.e., doses below 
200 mg/day of ipatasertib) will be allowed (see Table 1).  Dose re -escalation is not 
permitted for ipatasertib.  
If needed, dose reductions may occur in decrements of 100  mg and no more than two 
dose reductions will be allowed.  Accordingly, the possible daily doses of ipatasertib are 
shown in Table 1. 
If the patient continues to experience specified drug -related adverse events after the 
second reduction, the treatment should be discontinued.  
Table 1 Ipatasertib Dose Reductions  
Dose Level a Ipatasertib Dose  
Starting dose  400 mg 
First dose reduction  300 mg 
Second dose reduction  200 mg 
Third dose reduction  Not permitted  
 
Ipatasertib treatment may be temporarily interrupted in patients who experience toxicity 
considered to be related to study drug.  If ipatasertib has been withheld for 
28 consecutive days because of treatment -related toxicity, the patient should be 
discont inued from ipatasertib.  Ipatasertib may be suspended for reasons other than 
toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) in consultation with the Medical Monitor.  If, in the 
judgment of the investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from resu ming 
study treatment after a hold of  28 consecutive days, study drug may be restarted in 
consultation with  the Medical Monitor.

240/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  D.5.2.2.1  Diarrhea  
Specific guidelines for managing diarrhea to improve safety and tolerability are provided 
in Table  2.  In this study, all patients should receive loperamide (2  mg oral twice a day or 
4 mg once a day) as prophylaxis for diarrhea in the first cycle if allowed by local 
guidance.  Investigators are encouraged to continue this dosing for the remainder of the 
study, and the prophylaxis dose may be adjusted as necessary, using their discretion 
based on clinical judgment and per local guidance.  
Treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, should be instituted as 
early as pos sible.  Guidelines for treatment of diarrhea following the prophylactic dose of 
loperamide (where allowed) includes use of loperamide 2 mg every 4 hours or after each 
loose, watery stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16 mg/day or per institutional 
guide lines and standard of care, including, but not limited to, additional therapy with 
Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), codeine, or octreotide.  Duration of diarrhea may 
be minimized by taking ipatasertib with food, avoiding lactose -containing foods, and 
hydrating with 8 10 glasses per day (~12 oz/glass) of electrolyte -containing clear liquid,  
such as broth or low -calorie drinks.   
For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despite treatment with anti -diarrheal 
agent(s) and/or withholding dosing of ipatasertib, gastroenterologists should be 
consulted to rule out the risk of colitis and in fection (e.g., obtaining computed 
tomography (CT) images or a stool culture for infectious workup [ Clostridium difficile , 
enteric bacteria, cytomegalovirus]) .  Patients should be educated on the symptoms and 
importance of early reporting of diarrhea to rec eive instructions of treatment and 
prevention of dehydration so that patients can be promptly and appropriately managed.  
Educational materials will be provided to investigators and patients outlining these 
guidelines.  
Dose reductions of ipatasertib will be by one level at a time (e.g., 400 to 300 mg; 300 to 
200 mg) as outlined in Section  D.5.2.1  and Table 1.  If Grade   2 diarrhea persists 
following dose reductions of ipatasertib to 200 mg daily and with maximum treatment for 
diarrhea, ipatasertib should be discontinued.

Prevention   All patients are mandated to receive loperamide (2 mg BID 
or 4 mg QD) as prophylaxis for diarrhea in the first cycle, if 
allowed by local guidance.  If there are clinical concerns 
that preclude the use of loperamide prophylaxis in Cycle 1, 
discussion with the Medical  Monitor is required.  
Loperamide dose adjustment may be made per 
investigator discretion after discussion with the Medic al 
Monitor.  
 After the first cycle, investigators are encouraged to 
continue this dosing for the remainder of the study using 
their discretion as clinically indicated.  
Grade 1  
Increase of   4 stools per day 
over baseline; mild increase 
in ostomy output com pared 
with baseline   Continue study drugs at the current dose level.  
 Manage with loperamide 4 mg initially and then 2 mg every 
4 hours or after every unformed stool until after 12hour 
diarrhea free interval.  
 Dietary modifications, such as avoiding any 
lactosecontaining foods and eating small meals.  
 Hydration with 8 10 glasses per day (~12 oz/glass) of 
clear liquid, such as broth or lowcalorie - drinks with 
electrolytes.  
 Upon resolution, loperamide prophylaxis can be 
considered and continues as clinically indicated, if allowed 
by local guidance.  
Grade 2  
Increase of 4 6 stools per 
day over baseline; moderate 
increase in ostomy output 
compared with baseline   Rule out infectious etiology.  
 Manage with loperamide as early as possible 4 mg initially 
and then 2 mg  every 4 hours or after every unformed stool 
until after 12 -hour diarrhea free interval.  
 Dietary modifications, such as avoiding any 
lactosecontaining foods and eating small meals.  
 Hydration with 8 10 glasses per day (~12  oz/glass) of 
clear liquid, such as broth or lowcalorie - drinks with 
electrolytes.  
 For non -infectious diarrhea lasting more than 48 hours 
despite optimal loperamide treatment, manage with 
second -line anti -diarrheal agents, including, but not limited 
to Lomotil, codeine, or octreotide, or  as per institutional 
guidelines.  
 Interrupt ipatasertib until diarrhea improves to Grade  1 or 
better.  Ipatasertib can be resumed at the same dose or 
one dose lower per investigator's evaluation upon 
improvement to Grade  1 or better.  
 Reduce ipatasertib by one (or one additional) dose level 
(see Table 1) for recurrent Grade 2 diarrhea.  
 When study treatment is resumed, lo peramide 
prophylaxis should also be resumed and continues as 
clinically indicated, if allowed by local guidance.

D.5.2.2.2  Fasting Hyperglycemia  
Fasting is defined as abstaining from food and drink (with the exception of water) for at 
least 8 hours.  
Dose modification guidelines for fasting hyperglycemia attributable to study treatment 
are outlined Table  3 and are intended to provide gu idance for fasting glucose 
measurements assessed in the clinic.  Decisions regarding study treatment should be 
made on fasting levels drawn in the clinic whenever possible.  
Home glucose measurements may be used to trigger contact between patient and the 
investigative site team and may lead to an unscheduled clinic visit to assess fasting 
glucose.  Guidance for when to call the investigator/site staff (or designated 
endocrinologist, if applicable) should be provided to patients for hypoglycemia 
(e.g.,  glucos e value under 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (e.g., glucose value over 
300 mg/dL).  For any patients performing home glucose monitoring, the blood glucose 
log should be reviewed at each clinic visit.   
In the event of ipatasertib interruption, anti -diabetic m edications may need to be held or 
reduced (per investigator judgement) and glucose should be monitored closely to 
minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treat ment.  However, if the 
hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 1, with the exception 
of glucose, which should be drawn within 3 days prior.  Scans to document measurable or eval uable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be 
performed   4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment f or end -of-treatment fo llow-
up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  If the 
patient’s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone to 
include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and any stand ard of care laboratory 
and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and  chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated.  
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of  positive AKT gene activating mutations or PTEN loss or loss of function status should occur prior to performing other trial -related 
eligibility assessments.

253/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including p rior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 vi sit. 
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline  abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in  Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as in dicated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a serum 
pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be availabl e prior to administration of study drug.  Patients who have a 
positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT,  total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administ ration of the first dose of 
study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be  repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1, with the exception of 
glucose, which should be drawn within 3 days prior.  Subsequent c hemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each 
indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with dif ferential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).   If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m Fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL) , amylase, lipase  and HbA1c will be assessed aft er ≥8 hours of fasting.  If results are 
obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
n Samples should be assessed weekly during the first Cycle and D1 at every other cycle.  Mid-cycle fasting glucose levels m ay be obtained by 
glucometer (fingerstick). If measurements are done at home, phone visits with site staff should be conducted to review results and assess any 
potential signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia .  
o LVEF assessment by ECHO or MUGA to be performed  at screening and as clinically indicated.  Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by the 
same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO/M UGA scan 
for each individual patient.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
254/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  p All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumo r 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), 
a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis , and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI scan 
of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refu te the diagnosis of 
CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.    
q At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays  or treatment dis continuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, terminat ion 
of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
r For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
s Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (wit hin 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.  
t Study drug compliance will be reviewed with the patient.  
u Loperamide 2 mg BID or equivalent or per local institutional guideline for the first cycle.  If loose watery stools occur, ta ke addit ional 2 mg after 
each loose watery stool and up to 16 mg per day.  
v After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation  of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.  
All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation. All patients will be 
followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of 
cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becom es aware of any serious adverse event that is 
believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6).

E.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
The atezolizumab Drug Product will be supplied by the Sponsor as a sterile liquid in a 
single -use, 20 -mL glass vial.  The vial contains approximately 20  mL (1200 mg) of 
atezolizumab solution.  
For information on the formulation and handling of atezolizumab, see the pharmacy 
manual and the Atezo lizumab Investigator's Brochure.  
Chemotherapy will consist of either docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capecitabine, as determined 
by the investigator and will be used in commercially available formulations.  
For information on the formulation and handling of doce taxel, paclitaxel, and 
capecitabine, refer to the respective package insert.  
E.4.2.2  Study Treatment Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 21 -day cycles.  Atezolizumab should be 
administered prior to chemotherapy on days w hen both are administered.  
If a delay in administration of either agent is necessary, reasonable effort should be 
made to keep the administration synced if clinically feasible (e.g., briefly delay 
administration of the other agent).  A cycle should be cons idered to start when any drug 
is administered.   
If atezolizumab is discontinued, chemotherapy can be continued if the patient is likely to 
derive clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator.  If chemotherapy is

institutional guidelines, including considerations for premedication, supportive 
medications, infusion times, infusion frequency, and total cycle count.  
E.4.3  Concomitant Therapy  
E.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the  study:  
 Oral contraceptives  
 Hormone -replacement therapy  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such  as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin)  
 Vaccinations (such as influenza, COVID -19) 
Live, attenuated vaccines are not permitted (see Section  E.4.3.3 ) 
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant  
 Mineralocort icoids (e.g.,  fludrocortisone)  
 Corticosteroids administered for COPD or asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomati c 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted, provided it does not interfere with the 
assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be irradiated must not be 
the only site of measurable disease).  Treatment with atezo lizumab may be 
continued during palliative radiotherapy.  
 Local therapy (e.g.,  surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency 
ablation) as outlined below:  
Patients experiencing  a mixed response requiring local therapy f or control of 
three or fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor.  Patients who receive local therapy 
directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable  for radiographic response 
but will remain evaluable for  progression.  
 Premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or analgesics may be 
administered for the second and subsequent atezolizumab infusions only, at the 
discretion of the investigator.

Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
263/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  In general, investigators should  manage a patient's care (including preexisting 
conditions) with supportive therapies other than those defined as cautionary or 
prohibited therapies (see Section  E.4.3.2  and Section  E.4.3.3 ) as clinically  indicated, per 
local standard practice.  Patients who experience infusion -associated sympto ms may be 
treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-
receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per local 
standard practice.  Serious infusion associated -events manifested by dyspne a, 
hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or 
respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated 
(e.g.,  supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
E.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
E.4.3.2.1  Corticosteroids and TNF - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF - inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  Therefore, in situations in which 
systemic corticosteroids or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely administered, 
alternatives, including antihistamines, shou ld be considered.  If the alternatives are not 
feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF - inhibitors may be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Patients with primary CNS tumors can be receiving concurrent treatment with 
corticosteroids in consultation with  the Medical Monitor.  Patients must be receiving a 
stable or decreasing dose for  5 days prior to the baseline magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scan and at the time of drug initiation.  
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the di scretion of the investigator, for the 
treatment of specific adverse events when associated with atezolizumab therapy (refer 
to Section  E.5.2  for details).  
E.4.3.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions (DDIs) are 
generally unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
E.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapies  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:

E.5.2  Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede  clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.   
E.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
E.5.2.1.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Atezolizumab  
No dose reductions for atezolizumab are allowed.   
Atezolizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1 month to the equivalent of  10 mg/day oral 
Arm E :  Atezolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Patients with TMB -H/MSI-H/dMMR -Positive 
Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
266/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed.  If atezolizumab is withheld for 
 12 weeks after event onset, the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab.  
However, atezolizumab may be withheld for  12 weeks to allow for patients to ta per off 
corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab can be resumed after being 
withheld for  12 weeks if the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit.  The decision to 
re-challenge patients with atezolizumab should be based on the inves tigator’s 
benefitrisk assessment and documented by the investigator.   The Medical Monitor is 
available to advise as needed.  Atezolizumab treatment may be suspended for reasons 
other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures).  The acceptable length of treatment 
interruption must be based on the investigator's  benefitrisk assessment  and in 
alignment with the protocol requirements for the duration of treatment and documented 
by the investigator.   The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed . 
E.5.2.1.2  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Chemotherapy  
Dose modifications and  interruptions for docetaxel, paclitaxel, and capecitabine should 
be done according to standard medical practice and in accordance with the respective 
packaging insert.  
E.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events 
Associated with Atezolizumab  
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology.  
Altho ugh most immune -mediated adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab 
may not hav e an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, immune -mediated 
toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, systemic 
corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents.  
The following are general recommendations for manage ment of any other adverse events 
that may occur and are not specifically listed in the following subsections.  
 Patients and family caregivers should receive timely and up -to-date information 
about immunotherapies, their mechanism of action, and the clinica l profile of 
possible immune -related adverse events prior to initiating therapy and throughout 
treatment.  There should be a high level of suspicion that new symptoms are 
treatment related.  
 In general, atezolizumab therapy should be continued with close mo nitoring for 
Grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic toxicities.  
Arm E :  Atezolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Patients with TMB -H/MSI-H/dMMR -Positive 
Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
267/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   Consider holding atezolizumab for most Grade 2 toxicities and resume when 
symptoms and/or laboratory values resolve to Grade 1 or better.  Corticosteroids 
(initial dose of 0 .51 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may be administered.  
 For Grade 2 recurrent or persistent (lasting for more than 5 days) events, treat as a 
Grade 3 event.   
 Hold atezolizumab for Grade 3 toxicities and initiate treatment with high -dose 
corticosteroids (1 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent).  Corticosteroids should 
be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent, before 
atezolizumab can be resumed.  If symptoms do not improve within 48 to 72 hours 
of high -dose cortico steroid use, other immunosuppressants may be offered for some 
toxicities.  
 In general, Grade 4 toxicities warrant permanent discontinuation of atezolizumab 
treatment, with the exception of endocrinopathies that are controlled by 
hormone -replacement therapy.  
 The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance for a given patient prior 
to further administration of atezolizumab.  Resumption of atezolizumab may be 
considered in patients who are deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the 
immune -medi ated event.  The decision to re -challenge patients with atezolizumab 
should be based on the investigator's assessment of  the benefits and risks  and 
documented by the  Investigator .  The Medical Monitor is available to advise as 
needed.  
  
E.5.2.2.1  Pulmonary Events  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening  cough, chest pain, fever, dyspnea, 
fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates.   Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study.  
All pulmonary events should be t horoughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary 
hypertension.  COVID -19 evaluation should be performed per institutional guidelines 
where relevant.  Management guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in  Table  2.

279/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  E.5.2.2.6  IMMUNE -MEDIATED CARDIAC EVENTS  
Management guidelines for cardiac events are provided in Table  7. 
Immune -Mediated Myocarditis  
Immune -mediated myocarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with signs 
or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, laboratory (e.g., B -
type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, dyspnea, chest pain, 
palpitations, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  Myocarditis may also be 
a clinical manifestation of myositis and should be managed accordingly.   Immune -
mediated myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis  or associated with 
pericarditis (see section on pericardial disorders below)   resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac con ditions, 
or progression of malignancy.   
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac 
enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram (ECHO), and a cardiac 
MRI as appropriate per institutional guidel ines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines  in Table  7. 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED PERI CARDIAL DISORDERS  
Immune -mediated pericarditis should be suspected in any patient presenting with chest 
pain and may be associated with immune -mediated myocarditis (see section on 
myocarditis above).  
Immune -mediated pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade shoul d be suspected in 
any patient presenting with chest pain associated with dyspnea or hemodynamic 
instability.  
Patients should be evaluated for other causes of pericardial disorders such as infection 
(commonly viral), cancer related (metastatic disease or c hest radiotherapy), cardiac 
injury related (post myocardial infarction or iatrogenic), and autoimmune disorders, 
and should be managed accordingly.  
All patients with suspected pericardial disorders should be urgently evaluated by 
performing an ECG, chest X -ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
280/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Pericardiocentesis should be considered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, if 
clinically indicated.  
Patients with si gns and symptoms of pericarditis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac 
tamponade, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated 
according to the guidelines in Table  7.  Withhold treatment with atezolizumab for 
Grade  1 pericarditis and conduct a detailed cardiac evaluation to determine the etiology 
and manage accordingly.

E.5.2.2.7  Infusion -Related Reactions and Cytokine -Release Syndrome  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an IRR or cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) with 
atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines, antipyretic medications , 
and/or an algesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole 
(dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential 
for causing agranulocytosis.  
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antib odies and have 
been reported with atezolizumab.  These reactions, which are thought to be due to 
release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours of 
atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in severity.  
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune 
therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or 
other immune effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever at the  
Arm E :  Atezolizumab plus Chemotherapy in Patients with TMB -H/MSI-H/dMMR -Positive 
Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
281/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ dysfunction 
(Lee et al. 2019).  CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell 
therapies and bispecific T -cell engager antibody therapies but has also been rep orted 
with immunotherapies that target PD -1 or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and 
Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab.  
There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS, and in 
recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguis hing between the two, consolidated 
guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided in Table  8. 
Severe SARS -CoV-2 infection  appears to be associated with a CRS involving the 
inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL-10, IL -2, and IFN - (Merad and Martin 2020 ).  
If a patient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should 
include SARS -CoV-2 infection , which should be confirmed or refuted through 
assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic 
evaluations per investigator ’s judgment.  If a diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 infection  is 
confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines.

E.5.2.2.11  Immune -Mediated Meningoencephalitis  
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting 
with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited to, headache, neck  pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and 
altered or depressed level of consciousness.  Encephalopathy from metabolic or 
electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis 
resulting from infection (bacter ial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or 
secondary to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, infl ammation, or 
edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an 
identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  13.

E.5.2.2.12  Renal Events  
Eligible patients must have adequate renal function.  Renal function, including serum 
creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment.  Patients with abnormal 
renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more common etiologies 
(including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such as 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if clinic ally 
indicated.  A renal biopsy may be required to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  14.

E.5.2.2.13  Immune -Mediated Myositis  
Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.  
Patients with possible myositis should be referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist.  
Patients with possible myositis should be monitored for signs of myocarditis.

to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed   4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the stud y center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment for end -of-treatment 
follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post - chemotherapy 
discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this 
visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local 
phys ician may be contacted to collect AE data and any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless cli nically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR  status should occur prior to performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.   TMB -H should be 
determined using a tissue -based NGS assay .  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and pro cedures), 
reproductive status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional 
supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation  of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic s ystems.  Any 
abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical Histo ry and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -
directed physical examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be re corded in 
patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities s hould be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that 
a patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
 j Women o f childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening, withi n 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated i n the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
300/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior t o administration of study drug.  Patients 
who have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bi lirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administra tion of the 
first dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated  on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
Subsequent chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before ). 
l Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 3 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 t hey do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
m Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
n LVEF assessment by ECHO or MUGA to be performed at screening , at end of treatment,  and as clinically indicated.  Evaluation of LVEF 
must be performed by the same meth od (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and 
operator perform ECHO/MUGA scan for each individual patient. 
o The initial infusion of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (  15) minutes.  Subsequent infusions  will be delivered over 30 (  10) minutes if 
the previous infusion was tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events, or 60 (  15) minutes if the patient experienced an infusion -
associated adverse event with the previous infusion. 
p Docetaxel, pacli taxel, or capecitabine will be administered per package insert and institutional guidelines, including considerations for 
premedication, supportive medications, infusion times, infusion frequency, and total cycle count.  
q All known sites of disease must be  assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do 
not have to be repea ted at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.   
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
r At each subsequent tumor a ssessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic 
procedures every 8 ( 1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, 
until investigato r-determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors)  or loss of clinical benefit 
(with Medical Monitor consultation ; see Section  3.1.2 ), withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or 
death, whichever occurs first.   
s For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay cond ucted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If b oth archival and 
recent tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
t Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.

because these agents could potentially a lter the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab.  
 Use of steroids to premedicate patients for whom CT scans with contrast are 
contraindicated (i.e., patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance); in 
such patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  scans of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis with a non -contrast CT  scan of the chest must be performed.

or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
316/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post-treatment evaluation 
was pe
rformed (see Section F.6).
Figure 1  summarizes the management of trastuzumab emtansine on the basis of LVEF 
measurements and changes in LVEF from baseline in patients.  If an investigator is 
concerned that an adverse event may be related to cardiac dysfunction, an additional 
LVEF measurement may be performed.  Trastuzumab emtansine will be discontinued in 
any patient who develops symptomatic CHF.  CHF should be treated and monitored 
according to standard medical practice.
The decision to stop or continue trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be on the 
basis of the algorithm shown in Figure 1  or asymptomatic declines in LVEF. 
Trastuzumab emtansine must be discontinued in all patients for whom a confirmed 
decrease of LVEF to    40% is documented (with a confirmation assessment carried out 
within 21 days).  For patients whose LVEF decreases to values of 40% 45% with an 
absolute decrease in LVEF of   10% points from baseline, trastuzumab emtansine dose 
should be held.  For these patients, the LVEF measurement should be repeated within 
21 days, and trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be discontinued if the LVEF has 
not recovered to within a 10% absolute difference below baseline.  If clinically significant 
cardiac dysfunction or cardiac failure develops or persists or if significant medical 
management is required to maintain LVEF, the patient should be discontinued from all 
study treatment.

320/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  F.5.2.4  Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events that are 
Potential Overlapping Toxicities Associated with Trastuzumab 
Emtansine in Combination with Atezolizumab   
The following adverse events are potential overlapping toxicities associated with 
combination use of trastuzumab emtansine and atezolizumab:  pulmonary and 
hepatic  events.   
F.5.2.4.1  Pulmonary Events  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening cough, chest pain, fever, dyspnea, 
fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates.  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia/infection,  lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructi ve pulmonary disease, or pulmonary 
hypertension:  
 Measurement of oxygen saturation (i.e., arterial blood gas)  
 High-resolution CT scan of the chest  
 Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy  
 Pulmonary function tests (diffusion capacity of the lung f or carbon monoxide)  
 Pulmonary function testing with a pulmonary embolism protocol  
 
Patients will be assessed for pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study, and 
will also have CT scans of the chest at every tumor assessment.  COVID -19 evaluation 
should be performed per institutional guidelines where relevant.  See Table  7 for 
management guidelines for pulmonary events and pneumonitis.  
In this study, atezolizumab and trastuzumab emtansine are discontinued for all grades of 
interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis.

F.5.2.4.2  Hepatic Events  
Eligible patients must have adequate liver function, as manifested by measurements of 
total bilirubin and hepatic transaminases.  Liver function will be monitored throughout 
study treatment.

or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
321/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  While on this study, patients who present with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain 
and/or unexplained nausea or vomiting should have liver function tests (LFTs) performed 
immediately and reviewed before administration of the next dose of study drug.  
If outcome of LFTs is worsening, concurrent medications, viral hepatitis, and toxic or 
neoplastic etiologies should be consider ed and addressed, as  appropriate.  Imaging of 
the liver, gall bladder, and biliary tree should be performed to rule out neoplastic or other 
causes for worsening outcome of LFTs.  Antinuclear antibody, perinuclear antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody, anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and anti -smooth muscle 
antibody tests should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is  considered.  See 
Table  8 for management guidelines for atezolizumab and trastuzumab emtansine 
hepatic events.  
See Table  8 for Management Guidelines for Increased Transaminases (AST/ALT) and 
Hepatic Events.  See Table  9 for dose modificatio ns of trastuzumab emtansine for

hematology/CBC , chemistry panel , and thyroid function test  are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 
1.  Scans to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed  4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is disco ntinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment for end -of-treatment follow -
up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -trastuzum ab emtansine 
discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation, whichever is longer.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel 
distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone to incl ude an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the 
patient's local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c  If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to tr eatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification  without known TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR status should occur prior to performing other 
trial-related eligibility assessments.  
f  Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and pro cedures), reproducti ve 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
328/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  g A complete physical examination, performed  at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified a t baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i  All performance status will be asse ssed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
j  Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a  tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening, within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in t he schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed by a serum 
pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.   Patients who have a 
positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
k  Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administration of the first dose of 
study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent chemistry 
evaluations sh ould be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
l  Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
m Coagulation includes INR and aPTT. 
n TSH, free T3 (or total T3 for sites where free T3 is not performed), and free T4 will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and eve ry four cycles 
thereafter (i.e., Cycles 5, 9, 13, etc.).  
o LVEF assessments will occur during the screening period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, every fourth cycle thereafter  (e.g. C5D15, C9D15, etc.) .  
ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study treatment discontinuation only if the most recent  follow -up ECHO/MUGA was performed 28 
days before last study treatment administration and if no post -treatment evaluation was performed.  Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by the 
same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO/MUGA scan 
for each individual patient.  
p Atezolizumab will be administered first by IV infusion at a dose of 1200  mg on Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle thereafter.  For the first 
infusion of ate zolizumab, vital signs should be determined within 60 minutes before, every 15 (  5) minutes during, and 30 (  10) minutes after the 
infusion, if clinically indicated.  For subsequent infusions, vital signs do not need to be obtained during the infusion if t he prior infusion was 
tolerated without symptoms.   
q Trastuzumab emtansine will be administered second by IV  infusion at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 21 -day 
cycle thereafter.  Trastuzumab emtansine should be administered over approximately 90 minutes for the first dose and, in the absence of infusion -

emtansine infusion.  Patients will be monitored for any untoward effects for at least 90  minutes after completion of the first trastuzumab emtansine  
infusion and, in the absence of infusion -related events, for a minimum of 30  minutes at subsequent infusions.  
r  All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments  performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment d o not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or  impaired renal clearance), 
a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI scan 
of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of 
CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
s  At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedure s 
every 8 ( 1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 (  2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays  or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors)(or loss of  clinical benefit with 
Medical Monitor consultation , see Section  3.1.2 ), withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, 
whichever occurs first.   
t  For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted wit hin 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
u Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within on e week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.   
v  After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of trastuzumab 
emtansine or 90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab, whichever is longer.  All p atients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities 
resolve or for at least 28 days post -trastuzumab emtansine discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation, whichever is longer.  
After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, s hould be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes 
aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
w Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -manda ted treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.

Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
335/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  All PH FDC SC doses will be administered by SC injection by the investigator or their 
designee over 5 8 minutes at a rate of  2 mL/min with hand -held syrin ge to the thigh on 
Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle.  Patients should be monitored for 30  minutes 
after their first PH FDC SC dose administration regardless of whether a loading dose is 
required.  Patients should be monitored for 10 15 minutes followin g subsequent 
administrations.  Patients can be observed for longer periods at the discretion of the 
investigator or if necessary, as per local requirements.  
No dose reductions are allowed for PH FDC SC.  If an accidental overdose or 
medication error occurs , it should be noted on the Study  Drug Administration electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along 
with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as described in 
Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation for patients who experience 
adverse events are provided in Section  G.5.2 . 
G.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescript ion drugs, over the 
counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used 
by a patient from seven days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the final 
dose of study treatment.  After this period until the en d of the study, only medications 
used for the treatment of cancer will be reported.  All such medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
G.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the followin g therapies during the study:  
 H1-receptor  or H 2-receptor  antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, cimetidine)  
 Cardiovascular medications including angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel bloc kers 
and diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, thrombocyte 
aggregation inhibitors  
 Analgesics / anti -inflammatories (e.g., paracetamol  / acetaminophen, meperidine, 
opioids)  
 Standard therapies for pre -existing medical conditions and me dical or surgical 
complications  
 Any medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g., analgesics, antidiarrheals, 
antidepressants) at the investigator’s discretion  
 Blood transfusions at the investigator’s discretion

 Vitamin and mineral supplements  
 Bone density modifying agents (to be used in accordance with the approved labelled 
indication and/or nationally recognized treatment guidelines)  
 Any other medication not included in the list of  prohibited medications  
 
In general, investigators should manage a patient's care with supportive therapies as 
clinically indicated, per institutional standard practice.  Patients who experience 
infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically w ith acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional standard practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g.,  supplemental oxygen 
and β2-adrenergic agonists,see Appendix  6 ). 
G.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their pharmacokinetic 
profiles, safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are gener ally unknown.  
However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer may be used during 
the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
G.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Any invest igational therapy or agent (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) 
is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study 
treatment  
 Any targeted anti -cancer treatment other than adjuvant hormone treatment, adjuvant 
radiotherapy or bone density modifying treatment (e.g., lapatinib, neratinib)  
 Regular systemic treatment with steroids  
Short -term corticosteroid to treat and prevent allergic or infusion reactions are 
allowed however the dose must not exceed  20 mg/day of dexamethasone (or 
equivalent) for  7 consecutive days.  
 Hormone -replacement therapy  
 Use of erythropoiesis -stimulating agents (e.g., erythropoietin)  
 Herbal remedies initiated for cancer treatment.  Other herbal remedies are 
discouraged but perm itted and must be reported on the appropriate eCRF.  
 Topical estrogens (including any intra -vaginal preparations), megestrol acetate, and 
selective ER modulators used with prophylactic intent are prohibited

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
337/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Postmenopausal women with significant vaginal disc omfort associated with 
anti-estrogen therapy may be considered for intermittent use of low -dose topical 
estrogens if non -prescription methods are unsuccessful at ameliorating symptoms.  
G.4.4  Arm-specific Assessments  
In addition to the study assessments described  in Section  4.5, the following 
assessments are required for patients in Arm G: PH FDC SC.  Refer to the schedule of 
activities (Section  G.6) for arm -specific assessment timepoints.  
Cardiac Function  
Prior to study enrolment, patients must have an assessment for history of cardiac 
events, a physical examination, and an LVEF assessment (by ECHO or MUGA) to 
exclude any cardiac condition that would render them ineligible for participation in this 
trial.  Cardiac function will be assessed locally according to the schedule of act ivities 
(Section  G.6).  
All patients must have an LVEF  50% by ECHO or MUGA scan in order to be eligible for 
the study.  The same LVEF  evaluation method should be used throughout the study for 
each patient and should be performed and assessed by the same assessor if possible.  
Results of LVEF assessments must be reviewed prior to study treatment administration 
on the scheduled visit day.  
Investigators must be aware of local institutional regulations regarding the maximum 
allowable frequency of repeat MUGA scans.  The repeated administration of 
radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear medicine laboratories, and patients in this study 
requi re LVEF assessment on more than four occasions within one year.  
G.5 SAFETY PLAN

risks for PH FDC SC.  
Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
338/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  G.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events  
Guide lines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in manag ing individual cases.   
G.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for PH FDC SC  
Dose modification of PH FDC SC is not permitted.  The administration of PH FDC SC 
may be delayed to assess or treat adverse events, such as cardiac adverse events.   
During the stud y treatment period, a dose delay of up to (and including) six weeks (i.e., 
up to and including nine weeks between doses) will be permitted to allow adverse event 
recovery to baseline.  Following a dose delay of less than 3 weeks (i.e.,  6 weeks 
between do ses), study treatment does not need to be reloaded (only the maintenance 
doses needs to be given).    
Patients receiving PH FDC SC with  6 weeks since their last PH  FDC SC or Perjeta and 
Herceptin intravenous (IV) treatment must receive a loading dose con sisting of 1200 mg 
pertuzumab and 600  mg trastuzumab FDC SC before continuing with maintenance 
doses for subsequent administrations.  Patients should be monitored for 30 minutes after 
their first PH  FDC SC dose administration in the study and if a loading dose is required 
during the study.  Patients should be monitored for 10 15 minutes following 
maintenance dose administrations.  
If study treatment is withheld for more than two cycles (  9 weeks) because of toxicity, 
the patient should be discontinued from study treatment, unless resumption of treatment 
is approved following investigator discussion with the Medical Monitor.  Study treatment 
may be suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with 
Medical Monitor consultation .  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine 
the acceptable length of treatment interruption.  
G.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events 
Associated with PH FDC SC  
Supportive care and medical management of adverse events are at the discretion of the 
investigator, unless specifically listed below.  
G.5.2.2.1  Symptomatic LVSD and/or LVEF Decline  
All patients must have a baseline LVEF  50%.  LVEF will be monitored regularly 
according to the Schedule of Activities (see Section  G.6).  If an investigator is concerned 
that an adverse event may be related to LVSD, an additional LVEF measurement should 
be performed as soon as possible and within three weeks.  Symptomatic LVSD (CHF) 
should be assessed as “heart failure” on the basis of NCI CTCAE v5.0 and NYHA 
classification (see Appendix  9).  Symptomatic LVSD (CHF) should be treated and 
Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
339/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  monitored according to standard medical practice.  These patients should be evaluated 
by a certified cardiologist locally,  
Figure  1 summarizes the management of study medication in patients who develop an 
asymptomatic decrease in LVEF.  The decision to initiate study treatment and whether to 
continue or stop therapy should  be based on two factors: measured LVEF and changes 
in LVEF from baseline.  If a significant LVEF decrease occurs, this decrease should be 
confirmed by a second assessment within approximately 3 weeks showing also a 
significant decrease.  
Heart failure and  asymptomatic LVEF decline adverse events must be graded per NCI 
CTCAE v5.0 (see Appendix  9) and reported in the eCRF as described Section  G.5.4.2 . 
Figure  1 Asymptomatic  Decline in LVEF:  Algorithm for Continuation  and 
Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
 
LVEFleft ventricular ejection fraction  
Patients must have an LVEF  50% measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple -gated 
acquisition (MUGA) to be eligible for the study.  
 
G.5.2.2.2  Hypersensitivity  / Anaphylaxis and Administration -Related 
Reactions  
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitivity reactions.  Although severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and events with fatal outcomes, have 
not been observed in patients treated with PH FDC SC, caution should be exercised as  
these have been associated with Perjeta IV in combination with Herceptin IV.  

Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
340/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Study treatment administration should be stopped in subjects who develop dyspnea or 
clinically significant hypotension (defined per investigator’s discretion).  
Patients who exper ience any of the following events will be discontinued from study 
treatment:  
 Grade 4 allergic reaction  
 Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction  
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ARDS)  
 Bronchospasm  
Patients who experience administration -related reactions ( ARRs) may be managed by:  
 Stopping the injection of PH FDC SC  
 Supportive care with antihistamines, antipyretics, corticosteroids or epinephrine as 
appropriate at the investigator's discretion, as per institutional practice  
 Subsequently pre -medicating with analgesia and antihistamines as per institutional 
practice  
 
Patients should be monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms of any 
systemic reactions.  
In order to be able to calculate time to onset of such reactions, the occurrence of 
associat ed adverse events must be documented with the date and time of the onset and 
duration of the event (i.e., resolution of the event).  
All ARRs should be recorded as described in Section  G.5.4.3 . 
G.5.2.2.3  Diarrhea  
To prevent dehydration, early treatment of diarrhea with anti -diarrheal medication 
(e.g. loperamide) should be considered, and patients should be treated with fluids and 
electrolyte replacement, as clinically indicated.  
G.5.2.2.4  Rash / Skin Reactions  
Treatment recommendations for rash / skin reactions include topical or oral antibiotics, 
topical pimecrolimus, and topical steroids or systemic steroids (for severe reactions).  
These agents may b e used in patients experiencing pertuzumab -related rash / skin 
reactions, as clinically indicated, although they have not been studied in this context.  
G.5.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Section  5.2.3  describes adverse events of special interest that are required to be 
reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately for all study treatments , and 
Section  5.4.2  provides reporting instructions.  In addition to the adverse events of special 
Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
341/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  interest specified in Section  5.2.3 , the following adverse events are required to be 
reported by the investigator immediately for patients in the Arm G:  PH FDC SC.  
 An asymptomatic decline in LVEF that requires treatment or that leads to 
discontinuation of study treatment  
 
G.5.4  Reporting for Selected Adverse Events  
Additional data will be collected for the selected adverse events described below.  
G.5.4.1  Heart Failure  
Symptomatic L VSD (referred to as heart failure) should be reported as an SAE.  If the 
diagnosis is heart failure, it should be reported as such, and not as individual signs and 
symptoms of heart failure.  Heart failure should be graded according to both NCI CTCAE 
and N YHA Class (see Appendix  9).  Left ventricular ejection fraction results must also be 
reported.  
Heart failure occurring during the study must be reported irrespective of causal 
relationship and followed until one of the following occurs: resolution or improvement to 
baseline status, no further improvement can be expected, or death.  
G.5.4.2  Asymptomatic Declines in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction  
Asymptomatic declines in LVEF should not be reported as adverse events because 
LVEF data are collected separately in the eCRF.  Exceptions to this rule are as follows:  
 An asymptomatic decline in LVEF of  10 percentage -points from baseline to an 
LVEF  50% must be reported as an adverse event with the term of “ejection 
fraction decreased,” as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 (see Appendix  9).  In addition , a 
comment in the adverse events  comments field should confirm that the event was 
asymptomatic.  
 An asymptomatic decline in LVEF requiring treatment or leading to discontinuation 
of study treatment is an adverse event of special interest and must be report ed in an 
expedited manner (see Section  5.7).  The event must be reported as an adverse 
event with the term of “ejection fraction decrea sed,” as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 (see 
Appendix  9) and a comment should be added to the adverse events comments field 
confirming that the event was asymptomatic.

G.5.4.3  Administration -Related Reactions: Injection -Related Reactions 
and Injection -Site Reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study drug injection should be captured as a specific 
diagnosis (e.g.,  “injection -related reaction”, "injection -site reaction", "anaphylactic 
reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF in the EDC system.  If possible, avoid ambiguous 
terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded 
on the dedicated Injection Reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and 
systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded 
separately on the dedicated Injection Reaction eCRF.  
See Table  2 for the reporting conventions for injection -related reactions and injection -site 
reactions.

hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 1.  Scans to 
document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed  4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment f or end -of-treatment 
follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take 
place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to collect  AE data and any 
standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated  
unless clinically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification  status without known TMB -high/MSI -high/dMMR should occur prior to performing 
other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cance r therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, no se, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic  systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormali ties should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening, within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in t he schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be d one Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study  drug.   
j Will include measurem ents of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to ad ministration o f the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to  3 days before).  
Arm G :  PH FDC SC in Patients with ERBB2  Amplification or Mutation -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
346/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).   If results are obtained within 7 days  of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
l LVEF assessments will occur during the screening period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, and every fourth cycle thereafter  (e.g. C5D15, C9D15, 
etc.).  ECHO or MUGA will be performed followi ng study treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was 
performed  28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post -treatment evaluation was performed.  Evaluation of LVEF must be 
performed by the same method (E CHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform 
ECHO/MUGA scan for each individual patient. 
m Patients who have had  6 weeks since their last PH FDC SC (or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab IV) treatment must receive a loading dose 
before continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent administrations  
n All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed a s standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired re nal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is req uired to confirm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
o At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable, and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 ( 1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 (  2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent , 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
p For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent re section or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both archival and rece nt 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
q Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 w eeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.   
r After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only  serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.  
All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  After this period, all 
deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becom es aware of any 
serious ad verse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
s Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the final dose of study 
treatment.

Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
351/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Chemotherapy will consist of either docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capecitabine, as  determined 
by the investigator and will be used in commercially available formulations.  
For information on the formulation and handling of docetaxel, paclitaxel, and 
capecitabine, refer to the respective package insert.  
H.4.2.2  Study Treatment Dosage, Administra tion, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 21 day cycles.  PH FDC SC should be 
administered prior to chemotherapy on days when both are administered.  
If a delay in administration of either agent is necessary, reasonable effort should be 
made to keep the administration synced if clinically feasible (e.g., briefly delay 
administration of the other agent).  A cycle should be considered to start when any drug 
is administered.   
If PH FDC SC is discontinued, chemotherapy can be continued if the  patient is likely to 
derive clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator.  If chemotherapy is 
discontinued, PH FDC SC can be continued if the patient is likely to derive clinical 
benefit, as determined by the investigator.  
H.4.2.2.1  PH FDC SC  
PH FDC SC is gi ven as a fixed dose (i.e. non -weight based).  Two doses of PH FDC SC 
may be administered in the study:  a 15 mL loading dose consisting of 1200  mg 
pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab and a 10 mL maintenance dose consisting of 
600 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg tra stuzumab.  Patients who have had  6 weeks since a 
prior dose of Perjeta and Herceptin intravenous (IV) or PH FDC SC at study entry, or 
have had  6 weeks since their last study treatment during the study treatment period, 
must receive a loading dose before continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent 
administrations.  
All PH FDC SC doses will be administered by SC injection by the investigator o r their 
designee over 5 8 minutes at a rate of  2 mL/min with hand -held syringe to the thigh on 
Day 1 of each 3 -week treatment cycle.  Patients should be monitored for 30  minutes 
after their first PH FDC SC dose administration regardless of whether a load ing dose is 
required.  Patients should be monitored for 10 15 minutes following subsequent 
administrations.  Patients can be observed for longer periods at the discretion of the 
investigator or if necessary, as per local requirements.  
No dose reductions ar e allowed for PH FDC SC.  If an accidental overdose or 
medication error occurs, it should be noted on the Study  Drug Administration electronic 
Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along

Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation for patients who  experience 
adverse events are provided Section  H.5.2.1 . 
H.4.2.2.2  Chemotherapy  
Docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capecitabine will be administered per pa ckage insert and 
institutional guidelines, including considerations for premedication, supportive 
medications, infusion times, infusion frequency, and total cycle count.  
H.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over the 
counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used 
by a patient from seven days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the final 
dose of study  treatment.  After this period until the end of the study, only medications 
used for the treatment of cancer will be reported.  All such medications should be 
reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
H.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 H1-receptor  or H 2-receptor  antagonists (e.g., diphenhydramine, cimetidine)  
 Cardiovascular medications including angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers 
and diuretics, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, thrombocyte 
aggregation inhibitors  
 Analgesics / anti -inflammatories (e.g., paracetamol  / acetaminophen, meperidine, 
opioids)  
 Standard therapi es for pre -existing medical conditions and medical or surgical 
complications  
 Any medication intended solely for supportive care (e.g., analgesics, antidiarrheals, 
antidepressants) at the investigator’s discretion  
 Blood transfusions at the investigator’s discretion  
 Gonadotropin -releasing hormone agonists for fertility preservation

Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
353/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   
In general, investigators should manage a patient's care with supportive therapies as 
clinically indicated, per institutional standard practice.  Patients who experience 
infusion -assoc iated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional standard practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g.,  supplemental oxygen 
and β2-adrenergic agonists).  
H.4.3.2  Cautiona ry Therapy  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their PK, safety 
profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally unknown.  However, herbal 
therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer may be used during the stud y at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
H.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Any investigational therapy or agent (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) 
is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study 
treatment  
 Any targeted anti -cancer treatment other than adjuvant hormone treatment, adjuvant 
radiotherapy or bone density modifying treatment (e.g. lapatinib, neratinib)  
 Regular systemic treatment with ster oids 
Short -term corticosteroid to treat and prevent allergic or infusion reactions are 
allowed however the dose must not exceed  20 mg/day of dexamethasone (or 
equivalent) for  7 consecutive days.  
 Hormone -replacement therapy  
 Use of erythropoiesis -stimula ting agents (e.g., erythropoietin)  
 Herbal remedies initiated for cancer treatment.  Other herbal remedies are 
discouraged but permitted and must be reported on the appropriate eCRF.  
 Topical estrogens (including any intra -vaginal preparations), megestrol ac etate, and 
selective estrogen receptor ( ER) modulators used with prophylactic intent are 
prohibited  
Postmenopausal women with significant vaginal discomfort associated with 
anti-estrogen therapy may be considered for intermittent use of low -dose topical 
estrogens if non -prescription methods are unsuccessful at ameliorating symptoms.

Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
354/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  H.4.4  Arm-specific Assessments  
In addition to the study assessments described in Section  4.5, the following 
assessments are required for patients in Arm H:  PH FDC SC plus chemotherapy.  Refer 
to the schedule of activities (Section  H.6) for arm -specific assessment timepoints.  
Cardiac Function  
Prior to study enrolment, patients must have an assessment for history of cardiac 
events, a physical examination, and an LVEF assessment (by ECHO or MUGA) to 
exclude any cardiac condition that would render them ineligible for participation in this 
trial.  Cardiac function will be assessed locally according to the schedule of activities 
(see Section  H.6).  
All patients must have an LVEF  50% by ECHO or MUGA scan in order to be eligible for 
the study.  The same LVEF evaluation method should be used throughout the study for 
each patient and shou ld be performed and assessed by the same assessor if possible.  
Results of LVEF assessments must be reviewed prior to study treatment administration 
on the scheduled visit day.  
Investigators must be aware of local institutional regulations regarding the ma ximum 
allowable frequency of repeat MUGA scans.  The repeated administration of 
radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear medicine laboratories, and patients in this study 
require LVEF assessment on more than four occasions within one year.  
H.5 SAFETY PLAN

the prescribing information for capecitabine . 
H.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the b enefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.   
H.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
H.5.2.1.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for PH FDC SC  
Dose modification of PH FDC SC is not permitted.  The administration of PH FDC SC 
may be delayed to assess or treat adverse events, such as cardiac adverse events.   
During the study treatment period, a dose delay of up to (and including) 6 weeks (i.e., up 
to and including nine weeks between doses) will be permitted to allow adverse event  
recovery to baseline.  Following a dose delay of less than 3 weeks (i.e.,  6 weeks 
between doses), study treatment does not need to be reloaded (only the maintenance 
doses needs to be given).    
Patients receiving PH FDC SC with  6 weeks since their last PH  FDC SC treatment or 
pertuzumab plus trastuzumab IV must receive a loading dose consisting of 1200 mg 
pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab FDC SC before continuing with maintenance 
Arm H :  PH FDC SC Plus Chemotherapy In Patients With ERBB2  Amplification - or 
Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
356/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  doses for subsequent administrations.  Patients should be monitored for  30 minutes after 
their first PH  FDC SC dose administration in the study and if a loading dose is required 
during the study.  Patients should be monitored for 10 15 minutes following 
maintenance dose administrations.  
If study treatment is withheld for more  than two cycles (  9 weeks) because of toxicity, 
the patient should be discontinued from study treatment, unless resumption of treatment 
is approved following investigator discussion with the Medical Monitor.  Study treatment 
may be suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with 
Medical Monitor consultation .  The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine 
the acceptable length of treatment interruption.  
Patients who are permanently discontinued from study treatment shou ld be treated at 
the discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated.   
H.5.2.1.2  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Chemotherapy  
Dose modifications and interruptions for docetaxel, paclitaxel, and capecitabine should 
be done according to standard medic al practice and in accordance with the respective 
packaging insert.  
H.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events 
Associated with PH FDC SC  
Supportive care and medical management of adverse events are at the discretion of the 
investigator, unless specifically listed below.  
H.5.2.2.1  Symptomatic LVSD and/or LVEF Decline  
All patients must have a baseline LVEF  50%.  LVEF will be monitored regularly 
according to the Schedule of Activities (Section  H.6).  If an investigator is concerned that 
an adverse event may be related to LVSD, an additional LVEF measurement should be 
performed as soon as possible and within 3 weeks.  Symptomatic LVSD (CHF ) should 
be assessed as “heart failure” on the basis of NCI CTCAE v5.0 and New York Heart 
Association  (NYHA) classification (see Appendix  9).  Symptomatic LVSD (CHF) should 
be treated and monitored according to standard medical practice.  These patients should 
be evaluated by a certified cardiologist locally,  
Figure  1 summarizes the management of study medication in patients who develop an 
asymptomatic decrease in LVEF.  The decision to initiate study treatment and whether to 
continue or stop therapy should be based on two factors: measured LVEF and changes 
in LVEF from baseline.  If a significant LVEF decrease occurs, this decrease should be 
confirmed by a second assessment within approximately 3 weeks showing also a 
significant decrease.

Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
357/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Heart failure and asymptomatic LVEF decline adverse events must be graded per NCI 
CTCAE v5.0 (see Appendix  9) and  reported in the eCRF as described in Table  2. 
Figure  1 Asymptomatic Decline in LVEF:  Algorithm for Continuation  and 
Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
 
 
 
LVEFleft ventricular ejection fraction.  
Patients must have an LVEF  50% measured by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple -gated 
acquisition (MUGA) to be eligible for the study.  
 
H.5.2.2.2  Hypersensitivity  / Anaphylaxis and Administration -Related 
Reactions  
Patients should be observed closely for hypersensitiv ity reactions.  Although severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and events with fatal outcomes, have 
not been observed in patients treated with PH FDC SC, caution should be exercised as 
these have been associated with Perjeta IV in combin ation with Herceptin IV and 
chemotherapy.  
Study treatment administration should be stopped in subjects who develop dyspnea or 
clinically significant hypotension (defined per investigator’s discretion).  
Patients who experience any of the following events wi ll be discontinued from study 
treatment:  
 Grade 4 allergic reaction  

Arm H :  PH FDC SC Plus Chemotherapy In Patients With ERBB2  Amplification - or 
Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
358/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction  
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ARDS)  
 Bronchospasm  
 Patients who experience administration -related reactions (ARRs) may be managed 
by: 
– Stopping the injection of PH FDC SC  
– Supportive care with antihistamines, antipyretics, corticosteroids or epinephrine 
as appropriate at the investigator's discretion, as per institutional practice  
– Subsequently pre -medicating with analgesia and antihistamines as per  
institutional practice  
 
Patients should be monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms of any 
systemic reactions.  
In order to be able to calculate time to onset of such reactions, the occurrence of 
associated adverse events must be documente d with the date and time of the onset and 
duration of the event (i.e., resolution of the event).  
All ARRs should be recorded as described in Table  2. 
H.5.2.2.3  Diarrhea  
To prevent dehydration, early treatment of diarrhea with anti -diarrheal medication 
(e.g.,  loperamide) should be considered, and patients should be treated with fluids and 
electrolyte replacement, as clinically indicated.  
H.5.2.2.4  Rash / Skin R eactions  
Treatment recommendations for rash / skin reactions include topical or oral antibiotics, 
topical pimecrolimus, and topical steroids or systemic steroids (for severe reactions).  
These agents may be used in patients experiencing pertuzumab -related rash / skin 
reactions, as clinically indicated, although they have not been studied in this context.  
H.5.2.3  Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events Associated with 
Chemotherapy  
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capeci tabine 
treatment should be managed according to standard medical practice and in accordance 
with the respective packaging insert.   
H.5.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Section  5.2.3  describes adverse events of special interest that are required to be 
reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately for all study treatments, and 
Arm H :  PH FDC SC Plus Chemotherapy In Patients With ERBB2  Amplification - or 
Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
359/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Section  5.4.2  provides reporting instructions.  In addition to the adverse events of special 
interest specified in Section  5.2.3 , the following adverse events are required to be 
reported by the investigator immediately for patients in the Arm H:  PH FDC SC plus 
chemotherapy . 
 An asymptomatic decline in LVEF that requires treatment or that leads to 
discontinuation of study treatment  
 
H.5.4  Additional Reporting for Selected Adverse Events  
Additional data will be collected for the selected adverse events described below.  
H.5.4.1  Heart Failure  
Symptomatic LVSD (referred to as heart failure) should be reported as a serious adverse 
event.  If the diagnosis is heart failure, it should be reported as such, and not as 
individual signs and symptoms of heart failure.  Heart failure should be gr aded according 
to both NCI CTCAE and NYHA Class (see Appendix  9).  LVEF  fraction results must also 
be reported.  
Heart failure occurring d uring the study must be reported irrespective of causal 
relationship and followed until one of the following occurs:  resolution or improvement to 
baseline status, no further improvement can be expected, or death.  
H.5.4.2  Asymptomatic Declines in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction  
Asymptomatic declines in LVEF should not be reported as adverse events because 
LVEF data are collected separately in the eCRF.  Exceptions to this rule are as follows:  
An asymptomatic decline in LVEF of  10 percentage -points from baseline to an LVEF 
 50% must be reported as an adverse event with the term of “ejection fraction 
decreased,” as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 (see Appendix  9).  In addition, a comment in the 
adverse events  comments field should confirm that the event was asymptomatic.  
An asymptomatic decline in LVEF requiring treatment or leading to discontinuation of 
study treatment is an ad verse event of special interest and must be reported in an 
expedited manner (see Section  5.7).  The event must be reported as an adverse event 
with the term of “ejection fraction decreased,” as per NCI CTCAE v5.0 (see Appendix  9) 
and a comment should be added to the adverse events comments field confirming that 
the event was asymptomatic.  
Table  1 summarizes the repor ting conventions for LVSD and heart failure.

H.5.4.3  Administration -Related Reactions: Injection -Related Reactions 
and Injection -Site Reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and 
are judged to be related to study drug injection should be captured as a specific 
diagnosis (e.g.,  “injection -related reaction,” "injection -site reaction", "anaphylactic 
reaction") on the Adverse Event eCRF in the EDC system.  If possible, avoid ambiguous 
terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded 
on the dedicated Injection Reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local and 
systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded

Note: Cycle 21 days.  
a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treatment.  However, if 
the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 1.  Scans to 
document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed   4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment f or end -of-treatment 
follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatmen t-related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may 
take place by telephone to include an ass essment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and 
any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment dis continuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification  status without know n TMB -high/MSI -high/dMMR should occur prior to 
performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and pro cedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) 
used by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at  screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at b aseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i All performance status will be assessed  according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assess ed by the same person throughout the study.  
j Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indi cated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
Arm H :  PH FDC SC Plus Chemotherapy In Patients With ERBB2  Amplification - or Muta tion-Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
364/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.  
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to admi nistration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be re peated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
l Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet cou nt, differential count (neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).   If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
m LVEF assessments will occur during the screenin g period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, and every fourth cycle thereafter  (e.g. C5D15, C9D15, 
etc.).  ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was 
performed 28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post -treatment evaluation was performed.  Evaluation of LVEF must be 
performed by the same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operat or perform 
ECHO/MUGA scan f or each individual patient. 
n Patients who have had ≥ 6 weeks since their last PH FDC SC or pertuzumab plus trastuzumab IV treatment must receive a loading  dose before 
continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent administrations  
o Docetaxel, paclitaxel, or capecitabine will be administered per package insert and institutional guidelines, including considerations fo r 
premedication, supportive medications, infusion times, infusion frequency, and total cycle count.  
p All known sites of disease m ust be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do not 
have to be  repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired re nal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be perf ormed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
q At each subsequent t umor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
inves tigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
r For patients with a positive biomarker  result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If b oth archival and recent 
tissue  is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
s Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression (within 7 days after progressi on) for analyses including ctDNA.   
t After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse ev ents will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.

tucatinib.  
I.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Trastuzumab emtansine is provided as a lyophilized product in either 1 5-mL or 20 -mL 
single -use vials which contain enough product to deliver 100 mg or 160 mg, respectively, 
of trastuzumab emtansine.  The lyophilized form of the product is provided for 
reconstitution to a liquid concentrate using sterile water for injection.  After reconstitution, 
both the 15 -mL and 20 -mL vials contain 20 mg/mL trastuzumab emtansine, 10 mM 
sodium succinate, pH 5.0, 6% w/v sucrose, and 0.02% (w/v) polysorbate 20.  The 
reconstituted product contains no preservative and is intended for single use  only.  The 
density of the drug product after reconstitution is 1.026 g/mL.  
For information on the formulation and handling of trastuzumab emtansine, see the 
pharmacy manual and the Trastuzumab Emtansine Investigator's Brochure.  
Tucatinib drug product ma y be supplied as both a coated oval -shaped tablet in a 150  mg 
dosage strength and a coated round convex tablet in a  50 mg dosage strength.  The 
tablets are manufactured from a drug product intermediate amorphous dispersion of 
tucatinib in polyvinylpyrrolid one-vinyl acetate copolymer, which is then combined with 
the pharmaceutical excipients (microcrystalline cellulose, sodium chloride, potassium 
chloride, sodium bicarbonate, silicon dioxide, crospovidone, and magnesium stearate), 
and compressed into tablets . 
For information on the formulation and handling of tucatinib, see the pharmacy manual 
and the Tucatinib Investigator's Brochure.  
I.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Trastuzumab emtansine is administered intravenously at 3.6 mg/kg by IV infusion every 
21 days (unless dose reduction and/or dose delays are required) until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity.  The dose of trastuzumab emtansine will be 
administered on the basis of the patient’s baseline weight.  Weight will be measured at 
Arm I :  Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Tucatinib  in Patients With ERBB2 Amplification or  
Mutant -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
370/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  each visi t and dose must be re -adjusted for weight changes  10% compared to the 
previous visit or baseline.  The investigator may choose to recalculate the dose at every 
cycle using actual weight at that time, according to their local practice.  The calculated 
total dose may be rounded to the nearest milligram.   
Trastuzumab emtansine should be administered as described in Table  1.  The initial 
dose  will be administered over 90 minutes.  Infusions may be slowed or interrupted for 
patients experiencing infusion -associated symptoms.  Vital signs must be assessed 
predose and postdose.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for at least 
90 minutes.  Subsequent doses of trastuzumab emtansine may be administered over 
30 minutes.

 Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, 
blood pressure, and temperature) should 
be measured a 
 Administer the initial dose as a 90 -minute 
intravenous infusion.  
 Patients should be observed during the 
infusion and for at least 90  minutes 
following the initial dose for fever, chills, 
or other infusion related reactions.  
 The infusion rate should be slowed or 
interrupted if the patient develops 
infusion -related symptoms  
 The infusion site should be closely 
monitored for possible subcutaneous 
infiltration during drug administration.   Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, 
blood pressure, and temperature) should 
be measured a 
 If prior infusions were well tolerated, 
subsequent doses may be administered 
as 30 -minute infusions  
 Patient should be observed during the 
infusions and for at least 30 minutes after 
infusion.  
a Vital signs should be obtained and reviewed before and after each study treatment 
administration  but are not required to be reported on the eCRF during study treatment.  
Record  new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF  
 
Tucatinib 300 mg will be administered PO BID continuously starting from Cycle 1 Day 1 
onwards.  Tucatinib should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening, wi th 
approximately 8  to 12 hours between doses in the same calendar day.  
It is recommended that if a subject misses a scheduled dose of tucatinib and less than 6 
hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should be immediately 
taken.  It is  recommended that if more than 6 hours have passed since the scheduled 
dosing time, the subject should not take the missed dose but should wait and take the 
next regularly scheduled dose.

Use of the following therapy is p rohibited during study treatment:  
 Any systemic therapy intended for the treatment of the disease under study, 
including any other investigational agent  
 Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are prohibited as concomitant medications during study 
treatment and within 1 week of discontinuation of tucatinib.  Concomitant use of 
potent CYP P450 3A4/5 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole and itraconazole) with 
trastuzumab emtansine should be avoided.  Consider an alternate medication with 
Arm I :  Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Tucatinib  in Patients With ERBB2 Amplification or  
Mutant -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
372/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A 4/5.  If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor needs to 
be co -administered with trastuzumab emtansine, patients should be closely 
monitored for adverse reactions.  
 Strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 are prohibited as concomitant medications 
during study treatmen t; Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 are also prohibited within 1 
week of discontinuation of tucatinib (see Appendix  7).  Moderate inhibitors of 
CYP2C8 should be used with caution.  
 Use of sensitive CYP3A substrates should be avoided 1 week prior to first dose of 
study treatment and during study treatment (see Appendix  7).  Consider using an 
alternate medication which is not a sensitive CYP3A substrate.  If unavoidable, 
consider dose reduction of CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices and/or 
increased monitoring for potential  adverse reactions as described in the 
medication’s prescribing information.  
 Concomitant use of tucatinib with digoxin, a P -glycoprotein (P -gp) substrate, 
increases digoxin concentrations, which may increase the risk for digoxin related 
adverse reactions.  Concomitant use of tucatinib with digoxin or P -gp substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index (such as, but not limited to, dabigatran, 
fexofenadine, and cyclosporine) should be used with caution.  Refer to the 
prescribing information of digoxin or other P -gp substrates for dosage adjustment 
recommendations due to drug interactions.  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whethe r health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment and during study treatment 
(See Section  4.1.2 ), until disease progression is documented and the patient has 
discontinued study treatment.  
– Palliative radiation therapy for the treatment of bone pain for bone metastases 
in the absence of progressive disease is permitted, howe ver tucatinib should be 
held during and for 7 days following radiation therapy.

I.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events for 
Trastuzumab Emtansine  
I.5.2.2.1  Cardiotoxicity   
Patients without significant cardiac history and with a baseline LVEF of  50% as 
determined by ECHO or MUGA scan are eligible for arm participation.  Cardiac 
monitoring (ECHO/MUGA) will be performed in all patients enrolled in this arm.  
Arm I :  Trastuzumab Emtansine plus Tucatinib  in Patients With ERBB2 Amplification or  
Mutant -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
375/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Assessments will occur during the screening period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, and 
every four th cycle thereafter.  ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study 
treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was performed 
 28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post -treatment evaluation 
was performed (Section  I.6). 
Figure  1 summarizes the management of trastuzumab emtansine on the basis of LVEF 
measurements and changes in LVEF from baseline in patients.  If an investigator is 
concerned that an adverse event may be related to cardiac dysfunction, an additional 
LVEF measu rement may be performed.  Trastuzumab emtansine will be discontinued in 
any patient who develops symptomatic CHF.  CHF should be treated and monitored 
according to standard medical practice.  
The decision to stop or continue trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be on the 
basis of the algorithm shown in Figure  1 or asymptomatic declines in LVEF.  
Trastuzumab emtansine must be discontinued in all patients for whom a confirmed 
decrease of LVEF to  40% is documented (with a confirmation assessment carried out 
within 21 days).  For patients whose LVEF decreases to values of 40% 45% with an 
absolute decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% points from baseline, trastuzumab emtansine dose 
should be held.  For these patients, the LVEF measurement should be repeated within 
21 days, and trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be discontinued if the L VEF has 
not recovered to within a 10% absolute difference below baseline.  If clinically significant 
cardiac dysfunction or cardiac failure develops or persists or if significant medical 
management is required to maintain LVEF, the patient should be discon tinued from all 
study treatment.

383/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   Grade 4 AST, ALT, or bilirubin elevations  
 
Measurement of direct and indirect bilirubin should be considered in cases of 
hyperbilirubinemia to assist in determination of its etiology.  The sponsor will 
subsequently determine whether the elevations are ass ociated with other possible 
causes of aminotransferase elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, such as viral hepatitis, 
pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known 
to be hepatotoxic.

386/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  e Confirmation of positive ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification  status without known TMB -high/MSI -high/dMMR should occur prior to performing 
other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, s urgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinica lly indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
j Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at scre ening, within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in t he schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive u rine pregnancy test must be confirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study  drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior t o administration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicat ed cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
l Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells).  If results are obta ined within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
m Coagulation includes INR and aPTT.  
n Liver function test includes ALT/AST, total bilirubin.  
o LVEF assessments will occur during the screening period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, and every fourth cycle thereafter  (e.g. C5D15, C9D15, 
etc.).  ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was 
performed 28 days before last study treatment administration  and if no post -treatment evaluation was performed.  Evaluation of LVEF must be 
performed by the same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operat or perform 
ECHO/MUGA scan for each individual patie nt. 
p Trastuzumab emtansine will be administered by IV infusion at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle 
thereafter.  Trastuzumab emtansine should be administered over approximately 90 minutes for the first dose and, in  the absence of infusion -

387/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  related adverse events, over approximately 30 minutes in subsequent doses.  Vital signs should be taken before and after the trastuzumab 
emtansine infusion.  Patients will be monitored for any untoward effects for at least 90  minut es after completion of the first trastuzumab 
emtansine infusion and, in the absence of infusion -related events, for a minimum of 30  minutes at subsequent infusions.  
q Tucatinib is administered PO BID, on a 21 -day cycle.  On Day 1 of each cycle, review com pliance from previous cycle and dispense tucatinib for 
next cycle.  
r All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtai ning informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT  scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or 
refute the di agnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
s At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then e very 12 (2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study  arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
t For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted  within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
u Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within  one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.   
v After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a p rotocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.  
All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at lea st 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  After this period, all 
deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becom es aware of any 
serious adverse event that is believed to be re lated to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
w Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal  or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
396/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  No dose modification for atezolizumab is allowed.  
Trastuzumab emtansine is administered intravenously at 3.6 mg/kg by IV infusion every 
21 days (unless dose reduction and/or dose delays are required) until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity (or loss of clinical benefit with Medical Monitor 
consu ltation when given in combination with atezolizumab; see Section  3.1.2  for 
treatment beyond disease progression).  The dose of trastuzu mab emtansine will be 
administered on the basis of the patient’s baseline weight.  Weight will be measured at 
each visit and dose must be re -adjusted for weight changes  10% compared to the 
previous visit or baseline.  The investigator may choose to recal culate the dose at every 
cycle using actual weight at that time, according to their local practice.  The calculated 
total dose may be rounded to the nearest milligram.   
The initial dose will be administered over 90 minutes.  Infusions may be slowed or 
interrupted for patients experiencing infusion -associated symptoms.  Vital signs must be 
assessed predose and postdose.  Following the initial dose, patients will be observed for 
at least 90 minutes.  Subsequent doses of trastuzumab emtansine may be administe red 
over 30 minutes. Guidelines for medical management of infusion -related reactions 
(IRRs) are provided in Section  J.5.2.2.4 . 
If a dela y in administration of either agent is necessary, reasonable effort should be 
made to keep the administration synced if clinically feasible (e.g., briefly delay 
administration of the other agent). A cycle should be considered to start when any drug 
is admi nistered .

J.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
J.5.2.1.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Trastuzumab 
Emtansine  
For adverse events not listed below in Section  J.5.2.2  the following guidance should be 
used with regards to dose delays and modifications:  
 For Grade 3 non -hematologic adverse events not adequately managed by standard 
medical intervention or for a ny Grade 4 non -hematologic adverse event, study 
treatment should be held until recovery to Grade  1.  A maximum dose delay of 42 
days for the last administered dose of study drug will be allowed.  
 If withheld for 42 days, trastuzumab emtansine may be resumed at either the same 
dose level as before or at one dose level lower (see Table  3), at the dis cretion of the 
investigator.  Subsequent cycles should remain every 21 days.  
 Dose re -escalation is not permitted for trastuzumab emtasine.   
 Resuming trastuzumab emtanzine after 42 days may be considered in exceptional 
circumstances and should be done in c onsultation with  the Medical Monitor.

402/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  J.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events for 
Trastuzumab Emtansine  
J.5.2.2.1  Hepatotoxicity  
Hepatotoxicity is an overlapping toxicity for trastuzumab emtansine and atezolizumab.  
Managemen t guidelines are provided in Section  J.5.2.4.2 . 
J.5.2.2.2  Pulmonary Toxicity  
Pulmonary Toxicity is an overlapping toxicity for trastuzumab emtans ine and 
atezolizumab.  Management guidelines are provided in Section  J.5.2.4.1  
J.5.2.2.3  Cardiotoxicity   
Patients without significant cardiac his tory and with a baseline LVEF of  50% as 
determined by ECHO or MUGA scan are eligible for arm participation.  Cardiac 
monitoring (ECHO/MUGA) will be performed in all patients enrolled in this arm.  
Assessments will occur during the screening period, and o n Day  15 of Cycle 1, and 
every fourth cycle thereafter.  ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study 
treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was performed 
 28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post-treatment evaluation 
was performed (see Section  J.6). 
Figure  1 summarizes the management of trastuzumab emtansine on the basis of LVEF 
measurements and changes in LVEF from baseline in patients.  If an investigator is 
concerned that an adverse event may be related to c ardiac dysfunction, an additional 
LVEF measurement may be performed.  Trastuzumab emtansine will be discontinued in 
any patient who develops symptomatic CHF.  CHF should be treated and monitored 
according to standard medical practice.  
The decision to stop or continue trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be on the 
basis of the algorithm shown in Figure  1 or asymptomatic declines in LVEF.  
Trastuzumab emtansine must be discontinued in all patients for whom a confirmed 
decrease of LVEF to  40% is documented (with a confirmation assessment carried out 
within 21 days).  For patients whose LVEF decreases to values of 40% 45% with an 
absolute decrease in LVEF of ≥ 10% points from baseline, trastuzumab emtansine dose 
should be held.  For these patients, the LVEF measurement should be repeated within 
21 days, and trastuzumab emtansine treatment should be discontinued if the LVEF has 
not recovered to within a 10% absolute difference below baseline.  If clinically significant 
cardiac dysfunction or cardiac failure develops or persists or if significant medical 
management is required to maintain LVEF, the patient should be discontinu ed from all 
study treatment.

Potential Overlapping Toxicities Associated with Trastuzumab 
Emtansine in Combination with Atezolizumab   
The following adverse events are potentia l overlapping toxicities associated with 
combination use of trastuzumab emtansine and atezolizumab:  pulmonary and 
hepatic  events.   
J.5.2.4.1  Pulmonary Events  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening cough, chest pain, fever, dyspnea, 
fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates.  
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported 
etiologies such as pneumonia/infection,  lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary 
embolism, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary di sease, or pulmonary 
hypertension:  
 Measurement of oxygen saturation (i.e., arterial blood gas)  
 High-resolution CT scan of the chest  
 Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy  
 Pulmonary function tests (diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monox ide) 
 Pulmonary function testing with a pulmonary embolism protocol  
 
Patients will be assessed for pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study, and 
will also have CT scans of the chest at every tumor assessment.  COVID -19 evaluation 
should be performe d per institutional guidelines where relevant.  See Table  7 for 
management guidelines for pulmonary events and pneumonitis.  
In this study, atezolizumab and trastuzumab emtansine are discontinued for all grades of 
interstitial lung disease and pneumoni tis.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
407/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  While on this study, patients who present with right upper -quadrant abdominal pain 
and/or unexplained nausea or vomiting should have liver function tests (LFTs) performed 
immediately and reviewed before administration of the next dose of study drug.  
If outcome of LFTs is worsening, concurrent medications, viral h epatitis, and toxic or 
neoplastic etiologies should be considered and addressed, as  appropriate.  Imaging of 
the liver, gall bladder, and biliary tree should be performed to rule out neoplastic or other 
causes for worsening outcome of LFTs.  Antinuclear an tibody, perinuclear antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody, antiliver kidney microsomal antibodies, and antismooth muscle 
antibody tests should be performed if an autoimmune etiology is  considered.  See 
Table  8 for management guidelines for atezolizumab and trastuzumab emtansine

a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treatment.  However, if the 
hematology/CBC , chemistry panel , and thyroid function test  are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Day 
1.  Scans to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed   4 weeks prior to initiation of 
treatment.   
b After treatment is dis continued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment for end -of-treatment follow -
up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -trastuz umab emtansine 
discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation, whichever is longer.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel 
distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone to in clude an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the 
patient's local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and any standard of care laboratory and CT data, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to t reatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated.  
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive ERBB2 gene mutation or amplification  plus TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR status should occur prior to performing other trial -
related eligibility assessments.   TMB -H should be determined using a tissue -based  NGS assay .

Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
414/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (includi ng prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from base line abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where  possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
j Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the fi rst dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in the schedule o f 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study  drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.  
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to ad ministration of the first 
dose of study treatment. If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
l Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
m Coagulation includes INR and aPTT. 
n TSH, free T3 (or total T3 for sites where free T3 is not performed), and free T4 will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and eve ry four cycles 
thereafter (i.e., Cycles 5, 9, 13, etc.). 
o LVEF assessments will occur during the screening period, and on Day  15 of Cycle 1, and every fourth cycle thereafter  (e.g. C5D15, C9D15, 
etc.).  ECHO or MUGA will be performed following study treatment discontinuation only if the most recent follow -up ECHO/MUGA was performed 
28 days before last study treatment administration and if no post -treatment evaluation was performed.  Evaluation of LVEF  must be performed 
by the same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform  
ECHO/MUGA scan for each individual patient.  
p Atezolizumab will be administered first by IV infusion at a dose of 1200  mg on Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle thereafter.  For the 
first infusion of atezolizumab, vital signs should be determined within 60 minutes before, every 15 (  5) minutes during, and 30 (  10) minutes

415/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  after the infusion, if clinically indicated.  For subsequent infusions, vital signs do not need to be obtained during the infusion if the prior infusion 
was tolerated without symptoms.   
q Trastuzumab emtansine will be administered second by IV infusion at a dose of 3.6 mg/kg on Day 1 of C ycle 1, and on Day 1 of each 21 -day 
cycle thereafter.  Trastuzumab emtansine should be administered over approximately 90 minutes for the first dose and, in the absence of 
infusion -related adverse events, over approximately 30 minutes in subsequent doses.  Vital signs should be taken before and after the 
trastuzumab emtansine infusion.  Patients will be monitored for any untoward effects for at least 90  minutes after completion of the first 
trastuzumab emtansine infusion and, in the absence of infusion -related events, for a minimum of 30  minutes at subsequent infusions.  
r All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaini ng informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), 
a non -contrast CT s can of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI 
scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or  refute the 
diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
s At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then eve ry 12 (2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays  or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors)(or loss of clinical benefit with  
Medical Monitor consultatio n, see Section  3.1.2 ), withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, 
whichever occurs first.   
t For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central t esting.  If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
u Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment  (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor  
progression (within 7 days after progression) for analyses including ctDNA.   
v After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of trastuzumab 
emtansine or 90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab, whichever is longer.  All patients will be followed until treatmen t-related tox icities 
resolve or for at least 28 days post -trastuzumab emtansine discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation, whichever is longer.  
After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor s hould be notified if the investigator 
becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section  5.6). 
w Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of stu dy drug until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
425/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  K.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
Concomitant therapy consists of  any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days 
prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days a fter the last dose of study drug.  All such 
medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.  
K.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Oral contraceptives,  as allowed per local guidelines  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for a preexisting lesion, provided it does not 
interfere with the ass essment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be 
irradiated must not be a site of measurable disease).  Study treatment should be 
suspended during palliative radiotherapy.  Treatment with ipatasertib should be 
temporarily held for at least 7 days be fore and after the procedure (at least 14 
days after radiation is recommended).  For a single fraction of radiotherapy, this 
hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with the Medical Monitor.  
The patient may continue ipatasertib treatment aft er treatment holding has been 
completed and the patient has sufficiently recovered.  
 Prophylaxis use of loperamide is mandated in the first cycle and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea.  Patients who experience 
diarrhea should  be on treatment doses of loperamide per the management 
guidelines provided in  Table  3; please refer to that table  for additional details.  
Patients should be educated/reminded to be cognizant of the onset, duration, 
severity, and frequency of symptoms and the medications administered.  
 Prophylaxis use of antihistamines and prednisone (or equivalent dosing of other 
steroids) is mandated in th e first cycle due to the risk of rash and is described in 
Section  K.4.2.3 .  
 Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor treatment is permitted .  The primary 
prophylaxis should be administered per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 
and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines; namely, in patients 
who are  60 years of age and/or with comorbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et al. 
2011)  
 Bisphosphonate therapy or RANKL inhibitor therapy (e.g., zolendronic acid and 
denosumab) used specifically to prevent skeletal events (e.g., bone metastasis, 
osteoporosis) is allowed.  Both types of agents have potential immunomodulatory 
properties, but ma y be used as clinically indicated.

Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
426/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   Luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone or gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
agonists for ovarian function preservation are allowed.  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as warfarin at a stable 
dose or l ow-molecular -weight heparin)  
 Vaccinations (such as influenza, COVID -19) 
Live, attenuated vaccines are not permitted (see Section  K.4.3.3 ) 
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant after initiation of study 
treatment  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)  
 Inhaled corticosteroids administered for chronic obstru ctive pulmonary disease or 
asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
 Stable dose of calcium -channel blockers are permitted.  
 Stable dose of β -blockers, if an alternative treatment cannot be used , are permitted 
with caution.  
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapies as 
clinically indicated and per institutional practice.  For example, patients who experience 
infusion -associated symptoms may be treated sympt omatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing , 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen 
and β2 -adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
K.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
K.4.3.2.1  Corticosteroids and Tumor Necrosis Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) inhibitors may 
attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  
Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids or TNF - inhibitors would be 
routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If 
the alternativ es are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF - inhibitors may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator. Systemic corticosteroids are 
recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse 
events when  associated with atezolizumab therapy (refer  to Section  K.5.2.2.3  
[combination therapy] or Section  E.5.2.2  [single agent] for guidelines for managing 
specific adverse events).  
Arm K:  Ipatasertib plus Atezolizumab in Patients with PI3K (PIK3CA) Activating Mutation -
Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
427/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the 
treatm ent of specific adverse events  associated with ipatasertib  (refer to 
Section  K.5.2.2.3  [combination therapy] or Section  D.5.2.2.6 , Section  D.5.2.2.7  [single 
agent] for guidelines for managing specific adverse events ).  If daily systemic 
corticosteroids are initiated for treatment of any toxic ity or other condition, they must be 
tapered to 10 mg/day of oral prednisone or equivalent before ipatasertib or 
atezolizumab can be resumed. Steroids used as prophylaxis (i.e., as premedication prior 
to scans,  or as protocol -directed rash prophylaxis) do  not require holding of ipatasertib  or 
atezolizumab .  Steroids used on a single day to manage infusion -related reactions 
(IRRs) or allergic reactions similarly do not require holding of ipatasertib.   
K.4.3.2.2  Surgery or Radiation  
Patients who require radiation or surgery as part of medical treatment in the absence of 
radiographic disease progression must exercise caution, and all study treatment should 
be temporarily held for at least 7 days before and after the procedure (at least 14 days 
after radiation is recomm ended).  For minor surgeries or single -day radiotherapy, this 
hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with  the Medical Monitor.  After the 
temporary treatment hold is complete, study treatment may be re -initiated when the 
patient has sufficie ntly recovered.   
K.4.3.2.3  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug−drug interactions (DDIs) are 
generally unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the tr eatment of cancer 
may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
K.4.3.2.4  Medications Given with Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by CYP3A and may be a time -
depen dent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  A clinical DDI study with midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A 
substrate) showed a 2.2 -fold increase in midazolam exposures in presence of steady -
state ipatasertib dosed at 600 mg QD.  Therefore, sensitive CYP3A substrates with 
narrow th erapeutic window should be avoided.  Given that ipatasertib is primarily 
metabolized by CYP3A, there is a high potential for drug−drug interactions of ipatasertib 
with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces CYP3A.  Data from a clinical study 
show ed that ipatasertib exposures were reduced by ~50% when co -administered with 
enzalutamide, a strong CYP3A inducer.  Strong CYP3A inhibitors are expected to 
increase ipatasertib exposures significantly.  
Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers or CYP3A4/5 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index should be avoided or used with caution (see  Appendix  7).  
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment

428/Protocol ML42439, Version 5   (i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporaril y held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients are permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 with caution.  
Patients should be closely monitored.  Refer to the following information for further

The above li sts of medications are not comprehensive.  The investigator should consult 
the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication can be 
safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should contact the 
Medi cal Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.  
K.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent (see  
Section  4.1.2 , and during study treatment until disease progression is documented 
and the patient has discontinued study treatment, with the exception of palliative 
radiotherapy and radiotherapy to t he brain under circumstances outlined above 
in Section  K.4.3.1 .  
 Investigational therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment)  is prohibited 
within 21 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment.  
 Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not permissible by the 
Medical Monitor after enrollment (refer to the guidance in  Section  K.4.3.2.4  ) 
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment,  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug, whichever is 
longer, prior to initiation of s tudy treatment and during study treatment because 
these agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when 
given in combination with atezolizumab.  
 Systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, 
cyclophosphamid e, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide) are prohibited

safety of atezolizumab.  
 
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or us e of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of the se 
drugs.  Patients should be closely monitored.  Patients who require short -term use of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may continue study treatment with caution.

200 mg/day of ipatasertib) will be allowed (see  Table  2).  Dose re -escalation is not 
permitted for ipatasertib.  
If needed, dos e reductions may occur in decrements of 100  mg and no more than two 
dose reductions will be allowed.  Accordingly, the possible daily doses of ipatasertib are 
shown in  Table  2. If the patient continues to experience specified drug -related adverse 
events after the second reduction, the treatment should be discontinued.  
Any dose modification  should be noted on the corresponding Study Drug Administration 
eCRF.  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along with any associated  
adverse events, should be reported as described in Section  5.3.5.12 .

Note:  After dose reduction, the dose of ipatasertib may not be re -escalated.  
 
Ipatasertib treatment may be temporarily interrupted in patients who experience toxicity 
considered to be related to study drug.  If ipatase rtib has been withheld for 
28 consecutive days because of treatment -related toxicity, the patient should be 
discontinued from ipatasertib.  Ipatasertib may be suspended for reasons other than 
toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with Medical Monitor consu ltation .  If, in the judgment 
of the investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from resuming study 
treatment after a hold of  28 consecutive days, study drug may be restarted.  The 
decision to re -challenge patients with ipatasertib sh ould be based on the investigator’s 
benefitrisk assessment and documented by the investigator. The Medical Monitor is 
available to advise as needed. If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment of any toxicity, 
ipatasertib must be held and corticosteroi ds must be tapered over  1 month to 
 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent before ipatasertib can be resumed.  
If either ipatasertib or atezolizumab is discontinued, the other drug can be continued if 
the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit .  The acceptable length of treatment

Gastrointestinal toxicity  
General guidance   All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for more 
common etiologies other than drug -induced effects . 
 For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despite treatment with 
anti-diarrheal agent(s) and/or with dose hold of i patasertib, 
gastroenterologists should be consulted to rule out the risk of colitis and 
infection.  Patients should be educated on the symptoms and importance 
of early reporting of diarrhea to receive instructions of treatment and 
prevention of dehydration  so that patients can be promptly and 
appropriately managed.  Educational materials will be provided to 
investigators and patients outlining these guidelines.  
 For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of 
systemic inflammation  or acute phase reactants  (e.g.,  increased CRP, 
platelet count, or bandemia):  Perform sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if 
appropriate) with colonic biopsy, with three to five specimens for standard 
paraffin block to check for inflammation and lymphocytic in filtrates to 
confirm colitis diagnosis .

Gastrointestinal toxicity (cont.)  
General guidance   Administer anti -diarrheal agents and other supportive care per 
institutional guidelines or per suggested supportive care outlined below:  
Medication  
– Treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, 
should be instituted as early as possible.  Guidelines for treatment of 
diarrhea, following the prophylactic dose of loperamide 4 mg initial 
daily dose (taken 2 mg twice a day or per local institutional standard), 
includes use of loperamide 2 mg after each loose watery stool, up to 
the maximum total dose of 16  mg/day or per institutional guidelines 
and standard of care, including, but not limited to, additional therapy 
with Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), codeine , or octreotide.  
– Duration of diarrhea may be minimized by taking ipatasertib with food, 
avoiding lactose -containing foods, and hydrating with 8 10 glasses 
per day (~12 oz/glass) of electrolyte -containing clear liquid such as 
broth and Gatorade drinks.  
– Dose reductions of ipatasertib will be by one level at a time (i.e., 400 to 
300 mg; 300 to 200 mg) as outlined in If Grade   2 diarrhea persists 
following dose reductions of ipatasertib to 200 mg daily and with 
maximum treatment for diarrhea, ipatasertib shou ld be discontinued.  
Oral Supplementation  
– Initiate potassium and/or magnesium if serum levels are less than the 
lower limit of normal.  
– Consider rehydration therapy with oral electrolyte solution for Grade  1 
diarrhea or vomiting.  
Dietary Modifications  
– Instruct patient to eat small meals and eliminate lactose -containing 
products from diet.  
– Suggest diet of bananas, rice, apples, and toast, while avoiding fiber 
from vegetables and other fruits.  
– Encourage adequate hydration with salt -containing liquids (e.g ., broth, 
sports drinks such as Gatorade).

Dermatologic toxicity   
General guidance   Consider having a dermatologist evaluate persistent and/or severe rash 
or pruritus.  
 Unless contraindicated, a daily oral antihistamine prophylaxis should be 
used for at least the first cycle. It is suggested that a non -sedating oral 
antihistamine (e.g. loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine) and longer -
acting formulated be used.  
 For the fi rst 28 -day cycle of ipatasertib plus atezolizumab: On days 
when patients will receive atezolizumab ( Day 1 ), patients should 
received at least 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) as premedication 
prior to atezolizumab, followed by 10 mg/day prednisone (or 
equivalent) for 2 -4 consecutive days thereafter, unless contraindicated.  
 Ipatasertib should be permanently discontinued for rash -associated 
with Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or other 
suspected severe hypersensitivity or allergic reacti on. Dosage 
modification and symptom management guidelines for skin toxicity, 
including erythema multiforme, attributable to ipatasetib are shown 
below.  
 Although uncommon, cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxi c epidermal necrolysis 
have been reported with atezolizumab and atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for confirmed cases.  
Dermatologic event,  
Grade 1   Consider referring patient to a dermatologist.

before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indi cated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to adm inistration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be r epeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 with the 
exception of glucose, which should be drawn within 3 days prior.  Subsequent chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on 
Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 t hey do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m Fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL) , amylase, lipase,  and HbA1c will be assessed after ≥8 hours of fasting. If results are 
obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.   
n Samples should be assessed weekly during the first Cycle and D1 at every other cycle. Mid -cycle fasting glucose levels may be obtained by 
glucometer (fingerstick).   If measuremen ts are done at home, phone visits with site staff should be conducted to review results and assess any 
potential signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia .

452/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  o TSH, free T3 (or total T3 for sites where free T3 is not performed), and free T4 will be assessed on Day  1 of Cycle 1 and every third cycle 
thereafter (i.e., Cycles 4, 7, 10, etc.).  
p It is recommended that patients be resting in a supine position for at least 10  minutes prior to ECG recording.  
q LVEF assessment by ECHO or MUGA to be performed at screening a nd as clinically indicated. Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by the 
same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient. It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO/MU GA scan 
for each individual patient.  
r The initial infusion  of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (  15) minutes.  Subsequent infusions will be delivered over 30 (  10) minutes if the 
previous infusion was tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events, or 60 (  15) minutes if the patient experienced an infusion -
associated adverse event with the previous infusion. Refer to Section  K.4.2.3  for details on atezolizumab infusions (including measurement of 
vital signs).  
s Treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator (see Sectio n 3.1.2  for details).  
t Ipatasertib is administered 400 mg PO QD. On Day 1 of each cycle, review compliance from previous cycle and dispense ipataser tib for next 
cycle.  
u Loperamide 2 m g BID or equivalent or per local institutional guideline for the first cycle.  If loose watery stools occur, take additional 2 mg after 
each loose watery stool and up to 16 mg per day.  
v For the first cycle only: On day when patients will receive atezolizu mab, patients should receive at least 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) 
as premedication prior to atezolizumab, followed by 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for 2 4 consecutive days thereafter, unless 
contraindicated. Unless contraindicated, daily o ral antihistamine prophylaxis should be used for at least the first cycle. It is suggested that a 
non-sedating oral antihistamine (such as loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine) and a longer -acting formulation be used.  
w All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study  treatment do not 
have to be repeat ed at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal 
clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  
A CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to con firm or 
refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
x At each subsequent tumor as sessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until  
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.   
y For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testi ng.  If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
z Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week of the first tumor assessment) , and at tumor 
progression (within 7 days after progression) for analyses including ctDNA.

removed from the clinical trial site and replaced with new supplies by the Sponsor (or 
designee).  
Each bottle will be labeled with the required regulatory agency warning statement, the 
protocol number, the Sponsor’s name, and directions for patient use and storage.  The 
investigator should ensure that the study drug is stored  in appropriate conditions in a 
secure location with controlled access.  
L.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance for Ipatasertib  
Study treatment will be administered in 21 -day cycles.  
Ipatasertib will be self -administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days), at 
the same time each day, on a starting dose 400  mg/day (two 200 -mg tablets per day) 
once a day (QD) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity (or loss of clinical 
benefit with Medical Monitor  consultation , see Section  3.1.2  for treatment beyond 
disease progression).   
The tablets will be swallowed whole (not chewed) with 3 ounces (90 mL) of fluid.  
Ipatasertib i s recommended to be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day, 
and patients should refrain from eating overnight .  Patients are required to receive 
prophylaxis  with loperamide throughout the first cycle (2 mg oral twice a day, or per 
local ins titutional guidelines) and at subsequent cycles as clinically indicated (see 
Table  3).  
For ipatasertib doses to be administered at home, a  sufficient number of tablets should 
be dispensed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the investigator’s discretion, 
through one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a medication diary the time and 
date for each dose taken.  
A missed d ose can be taken within 8 hours of the scheduled time.  After that, patients 
should take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose 
(including vomited doses).

 No premedication is permitted prior 
to the atezolizuamb infusion except 
as outlined in Section  L.4.2.3  for the 
purpose of preventing rash . 
 Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory 
rate, blood pressure, and 
temperature) should be measured 
within 60 minutes prior to the infusion 
a 
 Atezolizumab should  be infused over 
60 (15) minutes.  
 If clinically indicated, vital signs 
should be measured every 
15 (5) minutes during the infusion 
and at 30  (10) minutes after the 
infusion. a 
 Patients should be informed about 
the possibility of delayed post -
infusion sy mptoms and instructed to 
contact their study physician if they 
develop such symptoms.   If the patient experienced an infusion -
related reaction with any previous infusion, 
premedication with antihistamines, 
antipyretics, and/or analgesics may be 
administered  for subsequent doses at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
 Vital signs should be measured within 
60 minutes prior to the infusion. a 
 Atezolizumab should be infused over 
30 (10) minutes if the previous infusion 
was tolerated without an infusion -related 
reaction, or 60 ( 15) minutes if the patient 
experienced an infusion -related reaction 
with the previous infusion.  
 If the patient experienced an infusion -
related reaction with the previous infusion or 
if clinically indicated, vital signs should be 
measured d uring the infusion and at 
30 (10) minutes after the infusion. a 
a Vital signs should be obtained and reviewed before and after each study treatment 
administration but are not required to be reported on the eCRF during study treatment.  
Record new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
 
No dose modification for atezolizumab is allowed. Guidelines for medical management 
of infusion -related reactions (IRRs) are provided in Section  E.5.2.2.7  for atezolizumab.  
Owing to the risk of rash in Cycle 1, patients should receive the following prophylaxis 
during the first cycle when study treatments will be given (see Table  3 for AE 
management of dermatological toxicities, including rash):  
 Unless contraindicated, daily PO antihistamine prophylaxis should be used for at 
least  the first cycle. It is suggested that a non -sedating longer -acting oral 
antihistamine be used (such as 10 mg of cetirizine PO QD or comparable dose of 
other antihistamines, e.g., loratadine, fexofenadine).  
 On day when patients will receive atezolizumab, patients should receive at least 10 
mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent dosing of other steroids e.g., 
methylprednisolone, prednisolone) as premedication prior to atezolizumab, followed 
by a fixed dose of 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for 2 4 consec utive days 
thereafter, unless contraindicated.

Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, n utritional 
supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days 
prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  All such 
medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on  the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.  
L.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Oral contraceptives, as allowed per local guidelines  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptoma tic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted for a preexisting lesion, provided it does not 
interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be 
irradiated must not be a site of measurable disease).  Study treatment should be 
suspended during palliative radiotherapy.  Treatment with ipatasertib should be 
temporarily held for at least 7 days before and after the procedure (at least 14 
days after radiation is recommended).  For a single fraction of radi otherapy, this 
hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with the Medical Monitor.  
The patient may continue ipatasertib treatment after treatment holding has been 
completed and the patient has sufficiently recovered.  
 Prophylaxis use of lopera mide is mandated in the first cycle and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea.  Patients who experience 
diarrhea should be on treatment doses of loperamide per the management 
guidelines provided in  Table  3; please refer to that section for additional details.  
Patients should be educated/reminded to be cognizant of the onset, duration, 
severity, and frequency of symptoms and the medications administered.  
 Prophylaxis use of antihistamines and prednisone (or  equivalent dosing of other 
steroids) is mandated in the first cycle due to the risk of rash and is described in 
Section  L.4.2.3 .  
 Gran ulocyte colony -stimulating factor treatment is permitted.  The primary 
prophylaxis should be administered per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 
and European Society for Med ical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines; namely, in patients 
who are  60 years of age and/or with comorbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et al. 
2011)  
 Bisphosphonate therapy or RANKL inhibitor therapy (e.g., zolendronic acid and 
denosumab) used specifically to pr event skeletal events (e.g., bone metastasis,

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
464/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  osteoporosis) is allowed.  Both types of agents have potential immunomodulatory 
properties, but may be used as clinically indicated.  
 Luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone or gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
agon ists for ovarian function preservation are allowed.  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin)  
 Vaccinations (such as influenza, COVID -19) 
Live, attenuated vaccines are not permitted (see Section  L.4.3.3 ) 
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant after initiat ion of study 
treatment  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)  
 Inhaled corticosteroids administered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 
asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
 Stable dose of calcium -channel blockers are permitted.  
 Stable dose of β -blockers, if an alternative treatment cannot be used, are permitted 
with caution.  
In general, investigators should manage a patient’s care with supportive therapies as 
clinically indicat ed and per institutional practice.  For example, patients who experience 
infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalen t medications per institutional practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinica lly indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen 
and β2 -adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
L.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
L.4.3.2.1  Corticosteroids and Tumor Necros is Factor - Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF -) inhibitors may 
attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab.  
Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids or TNF - inhibitors would be 
routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If 
the alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids and TNF - inhibitors may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator. Syste mic corticosteroids are 
recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse 
events when associated with atezolizumab therapy (refer  to Section  L.5.2.2.3  
Arm L:  Ipatasertib plus Atezolizumab in Patients with PTEN Loss/ Loss of Function or AKT 
Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
465/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  [combination therapy] and Section  E.5.2.2  [single agent] for guidelines for manag ing 
specific adverse events).  
Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the 
treatment of specific adverse events associated with ipatasertib (refer to 
Section  L.5.2.2.3  [combination therapy] or Section  D.5.2.2.6 , Section  D.5.2.2.7  [single 
agent] for guidelines for managing specific adverse events ).  If daily systemic 
corticosteroids are initiated for treatment of any toxicity or other condition, they must be 
tapered to 10 mg/day of oral prednisone or equivalent before ipatasertib or 
atezolizumab  can be resumed. Steroids used as prop hylaxis (i.e., as premedication prior 
to scans, or as pro tocol -directed rash prophylaxis ) do not require holding of ipatasertib  or 
atezolizumab . Steroids used on a single day to manage infusion -related reactions (IRRs) 
or allergic reactions similarly do no t require holding of ipatasertib.  
L.4.3.2.2  Surgery or Radiation  
Patients who require radiation or surgery as part of medical treatment in the absence of 
radiographic disease progression must exercise caution, and all study treatment should 
be temporarily held for a t least 7 days before and after the procedure (at least 14 days 
after radiation is recommended).  For minor surgeries or single -day radiotherapy, this 
hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with the Medical Monitor.  After the 
temporary trea tment hold is complete, study treatment may be re -initiated when the 
patient has sufficiently recovered.   
L.4.3.2.3  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug−drug interactions (DDIs) are 
generally unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
L.4.3.2.4  Medications Given with Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 E nzymes  
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by CYP3A and may be a time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  A clinical drug−drug interaction (DDI) study with 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) showed a 2.2 -fold increase in midazolam 
exposu res in presence of steady -state ipatasertib dosed at 600 mg QD.  Therefore, 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic window should be avoided.  Given 
that ipatasertib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, there is a high potential for 
drug−drug inte ractions of ipatasertib with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces 
CYP3A.  Data from a clinical study showed that ipatasertib exposures were reduced by 
~50% when co -administered with enzalutamide, a strong CYP3A inducer.  Strong 
CYP3A inhibitors  are expected to increase ipatasertib exposures significantly.

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
466/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers or CYP3A4/5 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index should be avoided or used with caution (see Appendix  7).  
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatme nt  
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients are permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 with cautio n.  
Patients should be closely monitored.  Refer to the following information for further 
guidance on CYP450−drug interactions and a list of common substrates, inhibitors, and 
inducers:

The above li sts of medications are not comprehensive.  The investigator should consult 
the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication can be 
safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should contact the 
Medi cal Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.  
L.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for 
various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent (see  
Section  4.1.2 ), and during study treatment until disease progression is documented 
and the patient has discontinued study treatment, with the  exception of palliative 
radiotherapy and radiotherapy to the brain under circumstances outlined above in 
Section  L.4.3.1 . 
 Investigation al therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) is prohibited 
within 21 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment.  
 Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A 
substrates with a narrow th erapeutic window that are deemed not permissible by the 
Medical Monitor after enrollment (refer to the guidance in  Section  L.4.3.2.4 ) 
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment,  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and 
interleukin -2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug, whichever is 
longer, prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment because

Mutation -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
467/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  these agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when 
given in combination with atezolizumab.  
 Systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, 
cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide) are prohibited 
during study treatment because these agents could potentially alter th e efficacy and 
safety of atezolizumab.  
 
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used ) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients should be closely monitored.  Patients who require short -term use of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may continue stud y treatment with caution.

469/Protocol ML42439, Version 5  L.5.2  Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are in tended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.  
L.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
L.5.2.1.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Ipatasertib  
If the patient does not tolerate the QD dosing of ipatasertib, dosing with food may be 
used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.  
No more than two dose reductions of ipatasertib per patient (i.e., doses below  
200 mg/day of ipatasertib) will be allowed (see Table  2).  Dose re -escalation is not 
permitted for ipatasertib.  
If needed, dose reductions  may occur in decrements of 100  mg and no more than two 
dose reductions will be allowed.  Accordingly, the possible daily doses of ipatasertib are 
shown in Table  2. If the patient continues to experience specified drug -related adverse 
events after the second reduction, the treatment should be discontinued.  
Any dose modification  should be noted on the corresponding Study Drug Administration 
eCRF.  Cases of accidental overdose or medication error, along with any associated  
adverse events, should be reported as described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
Table  2 Ipatasertib Dose Reductions  
Dose Level a Ipatasertib Dose  
Starting dose  400 mg 
First dose reduction  300 mg 
Second dose reduction  200 mg 
Third dose reduction  Not permitted  
Note:  After dose reduction, the dose of ipatasertib may not be re -escalated.  
 
Ipatasertib treatment may be temporarily interrupted in patients who experience toxicity 
considered to be related to study drug.  If ipatase rtib has been withheld for 
28 consecutive days because of treatment -related toxicity, the patient should be 
discontinued from ipatasertib.  Ipatasertib may be suspended for reasons other than 
toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with Medical Monitor consultation.  If, in the judgmen t 
of the investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit from resuming study 
treatment after a hold of  28 consecutive days, study drug may be restarted.  The 
decision to re -challenge patients with ipatasertib should be based on the investi gator’s 
benefitrisk assessment and documented by the investigator. The Medical Monitor is 
available to advise as needed. If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment of any toxicity,

 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent before ipatasertib can be resumed.  
If either ipatasertib or atezolizumab is discontinued, the other drug can be continued if 
the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit .  The acceptable length of trea tment 
interruption must be based on the investigator's  benefitrisk assessment and in 
alignment with the protocol requirements for the duration of treatment and documented 
by the investigator.   The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed . 
L.5.2.1.2  Dose Modifications and Interruptions for Atezolizumab  
No dose reductions for atezolizumab are allowed.  No dose reductions for atezolizumab 
are allowed.  Interruptions to atezolizumab treatment are described in Section  E.5.2.1.1 . 
If either atezolizumab or ipatasertib is discontinued, the other drug can be continued if 
the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit, as determined by the invest igator and 
following discussion with the Medical Monitor.

Gastrointestinal toxicity  
General guidance   All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for 
more common etiologies other than drug -induced effects.  
 For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despite treatment with 
anti-diarrheal agent(s) and/or with dose hold of ipatasertib, 
gastroenterologists should be consulted to rule out the risk o f colitis 
and infection.  Patients should be educated on the symptoms and 
importance of early reporting of diarrhea to receive instructions of 
treatment and prevention of dehydration so that patients can be 
promptly and appropriately managed.  Educational materials will be 
provided to investigators and patients outlining these guidelines.  
 For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with 
signs of systemic inflammation or acute phase reactants  
(e.g.,  increased CRP, platelet count, or bandemi a):  Perform

Gastrointestinal toxicity (cont.)  
General guidance   Administer anti -diarrheal agents and other supportive care per institutional 
guidelines or per suggested supportive care outlined below:  
Medication  
– Treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, 
should be instituted as early as possible.  Guidelines for treatment 
of diarrhea, following the prophylactic dose of loperamide 4 mg 
initial daily dose (taken 2 mg twice a day or per local institutional 
standard), includes use of loperamide 2 mg after each loose 
watery stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16  mg/day or per 
institutional guidelines and standard of care, including, but not 
limited to, additional therapy with Lomotil (diphenoxylate and 
atropine), codeine, or octreotide.  
– Duration of diarrhea may be minimized by taking ipatasertib with 
food, avoiding lactose -conta ining foods, and hydrating with 
810 glasses per day (~12 oz/glass) of electrolyte -containing clear 
liquid such as broth and Gatorade drinks.  
– Dose reductions of ipatasertib will be by one level at a time (i.e., 
400 to 300 mg; 300 to 200 mg) as outlined in  If Grade   2 diarrhea 
persists following dose reductions of ipatasertib to 200 mg daily 
and with maximum treatment for diarrhea, ipatasertib should be 
discontinued.  
Oral Supplementation  
– Initiate potassium and/or magnesium if serum levels are less than 
the lower limit of normal.  
– Consider rehydration therapy with oral electrolyte solution for Grade 
 1 diarrhea or vomiting.  
Dietary Modifications  
– Instruct patient to eat small meals and eliminate lactose -containing 
products from diet.  
– Suggest diet of bananas,  rice, apples, and toast, while avoiding 
fiber from vegetables and other fruits.  
– Encourage adequate hydration with salt -containing liquids (e.g., 
broth, sports drinks such as Gatorade).

Dermatologic toxicity   
General guidance   Consider having a dermatologist evaluate persistent and/or severe 
rash or pruritus.  
 Unless contraindicated, a daily oral antihistamine prophylaxis should 
be used for at least the first cycle. It is suggested that a non -sedating 
oral antihistamine (e.g. loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine) and 
longer -acting formulated be used.  
 For the fi rst 28 -day cycle of ipatasertib plus atezolizumab: On days 
when patients will receive atezolizumab ( Day 1 ), patients should 
received at least 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) as premedication 
prior to atezolizumab, followed by 10 mg/day prednisone (or 
equivalent) for 2 -4 consecutive days thereafter, unless 
contraindicated.  
 Ipatasertib should be permanently discontinued for rash -associated 
with Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or other 
suspected severe hypersensitivity or allergic reacti on. Dosage 
modification and symptom management guidelines for skin toxicity, 
including erythema multiforme, attributable to ipatasetib are shown 
below.  
 Although uncommon, cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
such as Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxi c epidermal necrolysis 
have been reported with atezolizumab and atezolizumab should be 
permanently discontinued for confirmed cases.  
Dermatologic event,  
Grade 1   Consider referring patient to a dermatologist.  
 Continue ipatasertib and atezolizumab.  
 Initiate supportive care (e.g., topical corticosteroids and continue 
antihistamine administration).   
 Consider treatment with 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent.  
Dermatologic event,  
Grade 2   Consider referring patient to dermatologist for evaluation and perform 
a biopsy, if appropriate.  
 Continue topical corticosteroids and antihistamine administration.  
 Consider treatment with 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent; 
treatment with higher steroid dose may be necessary as clinically 
indicated.  
 Ipatasertib:  interrupt ipatasertib treatment until resolution to Grade 
 1 or the toxicity is no longer clinically significant.  If steroid dose is 
 10 mg/day, ipatasertib may be resumed if clinically appropriate.  
 Atezolizumab:  If steroid dose is  10 mg/day, atezol izumab should 
be continued.

distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  
Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and any  standard of care laboratory and CT data, if 
performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be 
repeated unless clinically indicated.  
d Informed consent must be doc umented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive AKT gene activating mutations or PTEN loss or loss of function status should occur prior to performi ng other 
trial-related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical his tory includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), 
reproductive status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and 
nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, 
and throat, and the cardiovascul ar, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limit ed, 
symptom -directed phys ical examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  
h All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, 
that a patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
i Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 
days before the first dose of stud y drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in the 
schedule of assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy tes t must 
be confirmed by a serum p regnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration 
of study drug.  Patients who have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to 
administration of the first dose of study trea tment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 , with the exception of glucose, which should be drawn within 3 days prior .  Subsequent chemistry 
evaluations should be completed prior to dosin g on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count 
(neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other ce lls). If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they 
do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m Fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL) , amylase, lipase,  and HbA1c will be assess ed after ≥8 hours of fasting.  If 
results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.

490/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  n Samples should be assessed weekly during the first Cycle and D1 at every other cycle. Mid -cycle fasting glucose lev els may be 
obtained by glucometer (fingerstick).   If measurements are done at home, phone visits with site staff should be conducted to  review 
results and assess any potential signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia .  
o TSH, free T3 (or total T3 for sites wher e free T3 is not performed), and free T4 will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and every third 
cycle thereafter (i.e., Cycles 4, 7, 10, etc.).  
p It is recommended that patients be resting in a supine position for at least 10  minutes prior to ECG recording.  
q LVEF assessment by ECHO or MUGA to be performed at screening and as clinically indicated. Evaluation of LVEF must be performe d 
by the same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient. It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform 
ECHO/MUGA scan for each individual patient.  
r The initial infusion of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (  15) minutes.  Subsequent infusions will be delivered over 30 (  10) 
minutes if the previous infusion was tolerated without infusion -associated adverse events, or 60 (  15) minutes if the patient experienced 
an infusion -associated adverse event with the previous infusion.   Refer to Section  L.4.2.3  for details on atezolizumab infusions 
(including measurement of vital signs).  
s Treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator (see Section  3.1.2  for 
details).  
t Ipatasertib is administered 400 mg PO QD. On Day 1 of each cycle, review compliance from previous cycle and dispense ipataser tib for 
next cycl e.  
u Loperamide 2 mg BID or equivalent or per local institutional guideline for the first cycle.  If loose watery stools occur, ta ke additional 2 
mg after each loose watery stool and up to 16 mg per day.  
v  For the first cycle only: On day when patients w ill receive atezolizumab, patients should receive at least 10 mg/day prednisone (or 
equivalent) as premedication prior to atezolizumab, followed by 10 mg/day prednisone (or equivalent) for 2 4 consecutive days 
thereafter, unless contraindicated. Unless con traindicated, daily oral antihistamine prophylaxis should be used for at least the first cycle. 
It is suggested that a non -sedating oral antihistamine (such as loratadine, cetirizine, fexofenadine) and a longer -acting formulation be 
used.  
w All known site s of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  
Tumor assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of  study 
treatment do not have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy  or 
impaired renal clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head 
should be performed.  A  CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the 
brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
x At eac h subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic 
procedures every 8 ( 1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment 
discontinuation, until investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), 
withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by th e Sponsor, or death, whichever occurs first.

samples (archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21  days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both 
archival and recent tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
z Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week  of the first tumor assessment) , and at 
tumor progression (within 7 days after progression) for analyses including ctDNA.  
aa After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-
mandated intervention should be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 day s post -study drug 
discontinuation. All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period , the Sponsor should be notified

M.4.2  Study Treatment  
Study treatment  in this arm will consist of ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel 
treatment.  
M.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Ipatasertib will be supplied by the Sponsor as 100 -mg and 200 -mg tablets.   
The study drug will be periodically tested and monitored for its accep table shelf life.  Any 
study drug that fails to comply with the manufactured specifications will be promptly 
removed from the clinical trial site and replaced with new supplies by the Sponsor (or 
designee).  
Each bottle will be labeled with the required reg ulatory agency warning statement, the 
protocol number, the Sponsor’s name, and directions for patient use and storage.  The 
investigator should ensure that the study drug is stored in appropriate conditions in a 
secure location with controlled access.  
For information on the packaging, handling and storage, see the Pharmacy Manual and 
Ipatasertib Investigator ’s Brochure.  
For information on the formulation, packaging, and handling of paclitaxel, see the local 
prescribing information for paclitaxel.  
M.4.2.2  Dosage, Ad ministration, and Compliance for Ipatasertib  
Study treatment will be administered on days 1 through 21 of 28-day cycles.   
Ipatasertib will be self -administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days), at 
the same time each day, on a starting dos e 400  mg/day (two 200 -mg tablets per day) 
once a day (QD)  on days 1 through 21 of 28 -day cycles  until disease progression, 
intolerable toxicity or consent withdrawal.  For more specific dosing instructions, refer to 
the pharmacy manual.  
The tablets will be  swallowed whole (not chewed) with 3 ounces (90 mL) of fluid.  
Ipatasertib is recommended to be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day, 
and patients should refrain from eating overnight.   Patients are required to receive 
Arm M:  Ipatasertib plus Paclitaxel in Pa tients with Co -mutations in PI3K (PIK3CA) Activating 
Mutations and PTEN Loss/ Loss of Function or AKT Activating Mutation -Positive 
Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
498/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  prophylaxis (see Section M.5.2.4.1 ) with loperamide throughout the first cycle and at 
subsequent cycles as clinically indicated.  
For ipatasertib doses to be administered at home, a sufficient number of tablets should 
be dispen sed to the patient to last until the next visit, or at the investigator’s discretion, 
through one cycle.  Patients will be asked to record in a medication diary the time and 
date for each dose taken.  
A missed dose can be taken within 8 hours of the schedul ed time.  After that, patients 
should take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose 
(including vomited doses).  
Guidelines for ipatasertib dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation are provided in Section  M.5.2.1.1 . 
See Section  4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self -administered oral 
study drugs.  
M.4.2.3  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance for Paclitaxel  
The dose of paclitaxel in this study is 80  mg/m2 administered by IV infusion on Days  1, 8, 
and 15 of each 28 -day cycle.  If  the dose on Day  1, 8, or  15 is missed, it can be given on 
Day 22.  Calculation of body surface area for the purposes of dosing of paclitaxel should 
be made according to the prescribing information.  If  the patient ’s weight changes by 
 10% during the study, the body surface area and drug doses should be recalculated.   
The paclitaxel infusion will be delivered over at least 60  minutes for each dose per 
institutional guidelines and administered after the oral dose of ip atasertib.  
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Cremophor vehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis.  
Patients must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel with dexamethasone, 
diphenhydram ine, and an H 2-receptor blocker (i.e., ranitidine or famotidine) or per 
institutional practice.  H2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, which are known to 
inhibit cytochrome P450, should be avoided.  
Accidental overdose or medication errors should be  noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or 
medication error, along with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as 
described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
At the end of the study, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused study drug.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
499/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  M.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
Concomitant therapy consists of any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days 
prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  All such 
medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF.  
M.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Oral contraceptives, as allowed per local guidelines  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative ra diotherapy is permitted for a preexisting lesion, provided it does not 
interfere with the assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be 
irradiated must not be a site of measurable disease).  Study treatment should be 
suspended during palliativ e radiotherapy.  Treatment with ipatasertib and 
paclitaxel should be temporarily held for at least 7 days before and after the 
procedure (at least 14 days after radiation is recommended).  For a single 
fraction of radiotherapy, this hold may be shorter, if  discussed by the investigator 
with the Medical Monitor.  The patient may continue ipatasertib plus paclitaxel 
treatment after treatment holding has been completed and the patient has 
sufficiently recovered.  
 Premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics , and/or analgesics for each 
paclitaxel administration  as described in Section  M.4.2.3  
 Prophylaxis use of loperamide is mandated in the  first cycle and as clinically 
indicated in subsequent cycles to prevent diarrhea.  Patients who experience 
diarrhea should be on treatment doses of loperamide per the management 
guidelines provided in  Section  M.5.2.4.1 ; please refer to that section for additional 
details.  Patients should be educated/reminded to be cognizant of the onset, 
duration, severity, and frequency of symptoms and the medications administered.  
 Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor treatment is p ermitted.  The primary 
prophylaxis should be administered per the American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), 
and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines; namely, in pati ents 
who are  60 years of age and/or with comorbidities (Smith et al. 2006; Aapro et al. 
2011)  
 Bisphosphonate therapy or RANKL inhibitor therapy (e.g., zolendronic acid and 
denosumab) used specifically to prevent skeletal events (e.g., bone metastasis,

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
500/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  osteoporosis) is allowed.  Both types of agents have potential immunomodulatory 
properties, but may be used as clinically indicated.  
 Luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone or gonadotropin -releasing hormone 
agonists for ovarian function preservation are allow ed.  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin)  
 Inactivated influenza vaccinations  
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant after initiation of study 
treatment  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone)  
 Inhaled corticosteroids administered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or 
asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
In general, investigators s hould manage a patient’s care with supportive therapies as 
clinically indicated and per institutional practice.  For example, patients who experience 
infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, 
ibuprofen, diphenhydramine , and/or H2 -receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, 
cimetidine), or equivalent medications per institutional practice.  Serious 
infusion -associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, 
bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, o r respiratory distress should 
be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen 
and β2 -adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
M.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
Patients who require radiation or surgery as part of medical treatment in the absence of 
radiographic disease progression must exercise caution, and all study treatment should 
be temporarily held for at least 7 d ays before and after the procedure (at least 14 days 
after radiation is recommended).  For minor surgeries or single -day radiotherapy, this 
hold may be shorter, if discussed by the investigator with  the Medical Monitor.  After the 
temporary treatment hold is complete, study treatment may be re -initiated when the 
patient has sufficiently recovered.  Systemic corticosteroids are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events (refer to 
Section  M.5.2.4.5  and Section  M.5.2.4.6  for details).  All study treatment should be 
temporarily held during systemic corticosteroids treatment (except when corticosteroids 
are given as pre -medication to paclitaxel).

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
501/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  M.4.3.2.1  Medications Giv en with Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  
In vitro data suggest that ipatasertib is metabolized by CYP3A and may be a time -
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4.  A clinical drug−drug interaction (DDI) study with 
midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) showed a 2.2 -fold increase in midazolam 
exposures in presence of steady -state ipatasertib dosed at 600 mg QD.  Therefore, 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic window should be avoided.  Given 
that ipatasertib is primarily met abolized by CYP3A, there is a high potential for 
drug−drug interactions of ipatasertib with any medication that strongly inhibits or induces 
CYP3A.  Data from a clinical study showed that ipatasertib exposures were reduced by 
~50% when co -administered with  enzalutamide, a strong CYP3A inducer.  Strong 
CYP3A inhibitors are expected to increase ipatasertib exposures significantly.  
Therefore, strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers or CYP3A4/5 substrates with a 
narrow therapeutic index should be avoided or use d with caution (see  Appendix  7).  
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A s ubstrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients ar e permitted to take moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 with caution.  
 Paclitaxel exposures may be increased due to CYP2C8 inhibition; therefore, strong 
and moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors, such as gemfibrozil, teriflunomide, clopidogrel, 
and deferasirox should be us ed with caution during treatment with paclitaxel.   
Similarly, CYP2C8 inducers should be avoided or used with caution.  
 
Patients should be closely monitored.  Refer to the following information for further 
guidance on CYP450−drug interactions and a list of  common substrates, inhibitors, and 
inducers:

s/ DrugInteractionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm  
The above li sts of medications are not comprehensive.  The investigator should consult 
the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication can be 
safely administered with study treatment.  In addition, the investigator should contact the 
Medi cal Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.  
M.4.3.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug−drug interactions (DDIs) are

may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
M.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapy  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:  
 Investigational  therapy (other than protocol -mandated study treatment) is prohibited 
within 21 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment.  
 Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy) is prohibited  
 Chronic use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer, or sensitive CYP3A 
substrates with a narrow therapeutic window that are deemed not permissible by the 
Medical Monitor a fter enrollment (refer to the guidance in Section  M.4.3.2.1 ) 
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks pr ior to 
initiation of study treatment  
 
Patients who require short -term use of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor or inducer or use of 
sensitive CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic window for medical treatment 
(i.e., an alternative treatment cannot be used) must exercise caution and all study 
treatment should be temporarily held until at least 7 days after the last dose of these 
drugs.  Patients should be closely monitored.  Patients who require short -term use of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors may continue study treatment with caution.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
504/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  M.5.1.3  Risks Associated with Ipatasertib in Combination with 
Paclitaxel  
Ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel has been administered to 61 cancer patients in 
Study GO29227 (LOTUS).  Adverse events related to ipatasertib/placebo whose 
incidences were higher by  10% in patient s receiving ipatasertib   paclitaxel versus 
placebo   paclitaxel were diarrhea ( 93.4% vs. 21.0%) and nausea ( 52.5% vs. 33.9%).  
The most frequent Grade   3 adverse events (reported in  5% of patients in either 
treatment arm) in patients in the ipatasertib   paclitaxel arm vs placebo + paclitaxel arm 
were diarrhea (14 patients [23.0%], all Grade 3, vs. 0 patients), neutropenia (6  patients 
[9.8%] vs. 1 patient [1.6%]), decreased neutrophil count (5 patients  [8.2%] vs. 4  patients 
[6.5%]), and fatigue (2 patie nts [3.3 %] vs. 4 patients  [6.5%]), respectively.  
The incidence of overall neutropenia in the LOTUS Study was similar in both arms (34% 
in the ipatasertib   paclitaxel arm vs. 39% in the placebo   paclitaxel arm), but Grade 3 
neutropenia, analyzed by grou ped terms of similar medical concept, was higher in the 
ipatasertib   paclitaxel arm (18% vs. 8%).  Thus, for recurrent Grade  3 neutropenia, 
ipatasertib should be reduced by one dose level when treatment is restarted (refer to the 
management guidelines i n Section  M.5.2.4 ).  
Ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel (N=146) and placebo with paclitaxel (N=76) 
were observed in cohort B of study CO40016. Adverse events related to 
ipatasertib/placebo whose incidences were higher by  10% in patients receiving

Patients may hold  the ipatasertib  for up to 4  consecutive  week s (approximately 
28 consecutive  days ) in order to recover from toxicity or an adverse event related to the 
study drug.  If the ipatasertib  is discontinued at any time during the study, patients may 
have the option of continuing on study with paclitaxel alone.  
Ipatasertib treatment may be temporarily interrupted in patients who experience toxicity 
considered to be related to study drug.  If ipatasertib has been withheld for  28 
consecutive days  because of treatment -related toxicity, the pati ent should be 
discontinued from ipatasertib .  Ipatasertib and/or paclitaxel treatment may be suspended 
for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical pro cedures) with Medical Monitor 
consultation .  If, in the judgment of the investigator, the patient is likely to derive clinical 
benefit from resuming study treatment after a hold of >28 consecutive days, study drug 
may be restarted after consultation with  the Medical Monitor.  
M.5.2.1.2  Dosage Modification and Interruptions for Paclitaxel  
To manage paclitaxel -related toxicity, no more than one dose reduction for paclitaxel is 
allowed ( Table  2).  Paclitaxel doses other than specified in Table  2 will not be allowed . 
Table  2 Dose Reductions for Paclitaxel

Guidelines for management of specific adverse events for ipatasertib given as a single 
agent are provided in Section  D.5.2.2 . 
M.5.2.3  Guidelines for Management  of Patients Who Experience 
Specific Adverse Events with Paclitaxel  
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with paclitaxel treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice and in accordance with the respective 
packaging insert.  
M.5.2.4  Adverse Event Management Guidelines for Ipatasertib plus 
Paclitaxel  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are provided in the subsections 
below.  
M.5.2.4.1  Diarrhea Management Guidelines  
Specific guidelines for managing diarrhea to improve safety and tole rability are provided 
in Table  3.  In this study, all patients should receive loperamide (2 mg oral twice a day or 
4 mg once a day) as prop hylaxis for diarrhea in the first cycle if allowed by local 
guidance.  Investigators are encouraged to continue this dosing for the remainder of the 
study, and the prophylaxis dose may be adjusted as necessary, using their discretion 
based on clinical judg ment and per local guidance.  
Treatment modifications for diarrhea (any grade), when it occurs, should be instituted as 
early as possible.  Guidelines for treatment of diarrhea following the prophylactic dose of 
loperamide (where allowed) includes use of l operamide 2 mg every 4 hours or after each 
loose, watery stool, up to the maximum total dose of 16 mg/day or per institutional 
guidelines and standard of care, including, but not limited to, additional therapy with 
Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), co deine, or octreotide.  Duration of diarrhea may 
be minimized by taking ipatasertib with food, avoiding lactose -containing foods, and 
hydrating with 8 10 glasses per day (~12 oz/glass) of electrolyte -containing clear liquid, 
such as broth or low -calorie dri nks.   
For diarrhea that persists for more than 5 days, despite treatment with anti -diarrheal 
agent(s) and/or withholding dosing of ipatasertib, gastroenterologists should be 
consulted to rule out the risk of colitis and infection (e.g., obtaining CT image s or a stool 
culture for infectious workup [Clostridium difficile, enteric bacteria, cytomegalovirus]) .  
Patients should be educated on the symptoms and importance of early reporting of

patients can be promptly and appropriately managed.  Educational materials will be 
provi ded to investigators and patients outlining these guidelines.  
Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be maintained as tolerated.  Dose reductions of 
ipatasertib will be by one level at a time (i.e., 400 to 300 mg; 300 to 200 mg) as outlined 
in Section  M.5.2.1.1  and Table  1.  If Grade ≥  2 diarrhea persists following dose 
reductions of ipatasertib to 200 mg daily and with maximum treatment for diarrhea, 
ipatasertib should be discontinued.  Paclitaxel dose reduction or discontinuation should 
be considered if diarrhea persists eve n after ipatasertib discontinuation.

Prevention   All patients are mandated to receive loperamide (2 mg 
BID or 4  mg QD)  as prophylaxis for diarrhea in the 
first cycle, if allowed by local guidance.  If there are 
clinical concerns that preclude the use of loperamide 
prophylaxis in Cycle 1, discussion with the 
Medical  Monitor is required.  Loperamide dose 
adjustment may be made per investigator  discretion 
after discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
 After the first cycle, investigators are encouraged to 
continue this dosing for the remainder of the study 
using their discretion as clinically indicated.  
Grade 1

M.5.2.4.2  Fasting Hyperglycemia  
Fasting is defined as abstaining from food and drink (with the exception of water) for at 
least 8 hours.  
Dose modification guide lines for fasting hyperglycemia attributable to study treatment 
are outlined below (see Table  4) and are intended to provide guidance for fasting 
glucose measurements assessed in the clinic.  Decisions regarding study treatment 
should be made on fasting levels drawn in the clinic whenever possible.  
Home glucose measurements may be used to trigger contact between patient and 
investigative sit e team and may lead to an unscheduled clinic visit to assess fasting 
glucose.  Guidance for when to call the investigator/site staff (or designated 
endocrinologist, if applicable) should be provided to patients for hypoglycemia 
(e.g.,  glucose value under 7 0 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (e.g., glucose value over 
300 mg/dL).  For any patients performing home glucose monitoring, the blood glucose 
log should be reviewed at each clinic visit.   
In the event of ipatasertib interruption, anti -diabetic medications may need to be held or 
reduced (per investigator judgement) and glucose should be monitored closely to 
minimize the risk of hypoglycemia.

Grade 2   Ipatasertib may be continued at the original dose.  Paclitaxel 
may be held and can then be administered at the previous 
dose, when ANC has recovered to  1500/L and when the 
platelet count has recovered to  100,000/L.  If clinically 
appropriate based on  the investigator’s medical judgment, 
paclitaxel may be administered up to 14 days (2 doses), even 
with Grade 2 neutropenia, without a dose reduction, as long as 
G-CSF is used to manage the neutropenia.  If the hematologic 
criteria do not recover to Grade  1 or better within the 14 -day 
window of treating for ongoing Grade 2 neutropenia, the 
subsequent paclitaxel dose(s) must be held until recovery of 
hematological criteria to Grade  1 or better.  
Grade 3   Ipatasertib and paclitaxel should both be held until re covery to 
Grade 1 and if clinically appropriate based on the investigator’s 
medical judgment to Grade 2 as long as G -CSF is used to 
manage the neutropenia.  Please see guidelines in this table 
regarding treatment for ongoing Grade 2 hematological 
toxicitie s.   
– First episode:  If recovery is to Grade 1, resume the 
original dose.  If recovery to Grade 1 is achieved with the 
use of G -CSF, then continued use of G -CSF is 
recommended once dosing of the study drug is resumed.  
If recovery is to Grade 2, follow the guidance above.  
– Recurrent episode: Ipatasertib and paclitaxel should be 
reduced by one dose level when treatment is restarted.   If 
patient has had more than three Grade  3 neutropenia 
episodes on study, despite the above dose reduction to 
65 mg/m2, the paclitaxel dose should be permanently 
discontinued, but the patient may continue to receive 
ipatasertib following discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
 Following a treatment hold of up to 4 weeks, if recovery to 
Grade  2 or better neutropenia does not occur, the patient will 
permanently discontinue paclitaxel but may continue 
ipatasertib following discussion with the Medical Monitor.

517/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  M.5.2.4.7  Mucositis  
Mouthwash such as magic mouth wash (if inaccessible,  warm salt or bicarbonate water) 
should be used as supportive care per institution guidelines.  Brushing teeth after meals, 
keeping lips moisturized with non -Vaseline products, and avoiding alcohol, spicy food, 
and smoking have all been shown to reduce pa in and infection related to mucositis.  
Ranitidine or omeprazole may be helpful if patients have epigastric pain.  Dosage 
modification guidelines for mucositis attributable to study treatment are outlined 
in Table  9. 
Table  9 Mucositis Management Guidelines  
Severity of 
Mucositis  Management Guidelines  
Grade 1 or 2   Manage with maximum supportive care.   
 If Grade   2 mucositis recurs in subsequent 4  week cycles, despite 
maximal supportive care, the dose of ipatasertib should be reduced by one 
dose level (see Section  M.5.2.1.1 ).  The dose of paclitaxel may be 
maintained or reduced by one level for subsequent cycles per 
investigator ’s discretion (see Section  M.5.2.1.2 ). 
Grade  3  Hold ipatasertib and paclitaxel until recovery to Grade  2 or better.  If the 
mucositis resolves to Grade 2 or better during the current cycle, the dose 
of ipatasertib should be re duced by one dose level (see 
Section  M.5.2.1.1 ).  The dose of paclitaxel may be maintained or reduced 
by one dose level for subsequent cycles per investigator ’s discretion (see 
Section  M.5.2.1.2 ). 
 If recovery of mucositis to Grade 2 or better does not occur within 
a maximum of 4 weeks, the patient will permanently discontinue paclitaxel 
and ipatasertib.  
 
M.5.2.4.8  Peripheral Neuropathy  
If Grade  3 peripheral neuropathy attributable to paclitaxel develops in patients, 
paclitaxel should be held until the neuropathy recovers t o Grade 2 or better, or resolution 
such that the peripheral neuropathy is no longer clinically significant.  During this time, 
patients may continue ipatasertib at the discretion of the investigator.  If the peripheral 
neuropathy recovers to Grade 2 or bet ter within 4 weeks or resolution such that the 
peripheral neuropathy is no longer clinically significant, dosing of paclitaxel may resume 
reduced by one dose level (see Section  M.5.2.1.2 ).  If recovery of the peripheral 
neuropathy to Grade 2 or better does not occur within a maximum of 4 weeks, the 
patient will permanently discontinue paclitaxel but may continue the ipatasertib.  
M.5.2.4.9  Hypersen sitivity  
If a hypersensitivity reaction due to infusion of paclitaxel develops in patients, treatment 
for the hypersensitivity reaction, including the possibility of rechallenging with the

518/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  attributable chemotherapy agent, in presence of premedication for paclitaxel should be 
administered as per institutional guidelines or at the discretion of the investigator.  The 
patient may continue the other study treatment components not associated with the 
toxicity (i.e., ipatasertib).  
M.5.2.4.10  Other Non -Hematologic Toxicitie s 
If other Grade  3 non hematologic toxicities not described above develop in patients, 
treatment with ipatasertib and/or paclitaxel may be held, depending on the attribution of 
the toxicity, at the discretion of the investigator.  During this time, treat ment  may 
continue with the other non -attributable treatment agent (i.e., either ipatasertib or 
paclitaxel).  Grade  3 non -hematologic toxicity should be monitored at least weekly.  
If the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or better within 2 weeks, treatment may  resume with 
the attributable agent.  
If the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or better in 2 4 weeks, the dose of the attributable 
drug should be reduced by one level per the suggested guidelines in Section  M.5.2.1 . 
Depending on the nature and the severity of the adverse event, if recovery to Grade  1 or 
better takes  4 weeks, treatment may resume with the attributable agent with dose 
reduction , or the attributable agent may be permanently discontinued, at the discretion of 
the investigator and after discussion with the Medical Monitor.   
For Grade  3 toxicities associated primarily with laboratory abnormalities only 
(e.g.,  elevation of ALT, AS T, lipase, or amylase, or decreases in phosphorus without 
clinical or other evidence of pancreatitis or other hepatic dysfunction), study treatment 
may continue without interruption and/or dose reduction at the discretion of the 
investigator per institutio nal practice.  
M.5.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Section  5.2.3  describes adverse events of spe cial interest that are required to be 
reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately for all study treatments, and 
Section  5.4.2  provides reporting instructions.  In addition to the adverse events of special 
interest specified in Section  5.2.3 , the followin g adverse events are required to be

a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treatment.  However, if the 
chemistry panel is obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 it does not have to be repeated on Day 1 , with the exception of g lucose, which 
should be drawn within 3 days prior .  Scans to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be 
performed   4 weeks prior to initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the st udy center within 28 days after the last dose of study treatment for end -of-treatment follow -
up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug discontinuation.  If 
the patient’ s worsening disease combined with travel distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the patient may take place by telephone 
to include an assessment of A Es.  Alternatively, the patient ’s local physician may be contacted to collect AE data and any standard -of-care 
laboratory and CT data, if performed.

522/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be repeated 
unless clinically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific screening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive co -mutation in PI3K  activating mutation AND AKT gene activating mutations or PTEN loss or loss of function status 
should occur prior to performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and pro cedures), reproductive 
status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used 
by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eye s, ears, nose, and throat, 
and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems.  Any abnormality 
identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline C onditions eCRF.  Limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or 
worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded  as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
h Weight is to be measured up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle and compared with baseline.  
i All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions provided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, that a 
patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the study.  
j Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 days 
before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indi cated in the schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration of study drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to adm inistration of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be r epeated on Cycle 1 Day 1 , with the 
exception of glucose, which should be drawn within 3 days prior .  Subsequent chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 
1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
l Hematology/CBC with diffe rential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (neutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 3 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
m Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
n Fasting lipid panel (cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL) , amylase, lipase,  and HbA1c will be assessed after ≥8 hours of fasting.  If results are 
obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 t hey do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
523/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  o Samples should be assessed weekly during the first Cycle and D1 at every other cycle. Mid -cycle fasting glucose levels may be obtained by 
glucometer (fingerstick).  If measurements are done at home, phon e visits with site staff should be conducted to review results and assess any 
potential signs or symptoms of hyperglycemia .  
p It is recommended that patients be resting in a supine position for at least 10  minutes prior to ECG recording.  
q LVEF assessment  by ECHO or MUGA to be performed at screening and as clinically indicated.  Evaluation of LVEF must be performed by the 
same method (ECHO or MUGA) for each patient.  It is strongly recommended that the same laboratory and operator perform ECHO/M UGA scan 
for each individual patient.  
r Paclitaxel is administered 80 mg/m2 by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15 of each 28 -day cycle including considerations for premedication, supportive 
medications, infusion times, infusion frequency, and total cycle count. If the pati ent's weight changes by 10% from baseline during the study, 
the body surface area and drug doses of paclitaxel should be recalculated. Patients must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel with 
dexamethasone, diphenhydramine and an H2 -receptor blocker (i.e. r anitidine or famotidine) or per institutional practice. H2 -receptor antagonist, 
such as cimetidine, which are known to inhibit cytochrome P450, should be avoided.  
s Ipatasertib is administered 400 mg PO QD on Days 1 -21 of each 28 -day cycle. On Day 1 of eac h cycle, review compliance from previous cycle 
and dispense ipatasertib for next cycle.  
t Loperamide 2 mg BID or equivalent or per local institutional guideline for the first cycle.  If loose watery stools occur, ta ke additional 2 mg after 
each loose wate ry stool and up to 16 mg per day.  
u All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), 
a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be perform ed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI 
scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or  refute the 
diagnosis of CNS metastases at base line in the event of an equivocal scan.   
v At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter reg ardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), withdrawal of consent, 
termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, wh ichever occurs first.   
w For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both archival and recent 
tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
x Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week of the first tumor ass essment) , and at tumor 
progression (within 7 days after progression) for analyses including ctDNA.  
y After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated 
intervention sho uld be reported.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study drug.

MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
534/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  for atezolizumab and tiragolumab are similar; however, a cycle may begin with the 
administration of atezolizumab as a single agent  if considered appropriate at the 
discretion of the investigator, after consultation with the Medical Monitor.   
 In case of delays in dosing of tiragolumab  for study drug related toxicity while 
atezolizumab  is given as planned, it is recommended that the s tudy drug being 
delayed will be administered at the next scheduled infusion (i.e., at the next 
scheduled 21 -day cycle).   
 
Guidelines for treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided in Section  N.5.2.1  
and Section  N.5.2.2 . 
N.4.3  Concomitant Therapy  
N.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Patients are permitted to use the following therapies during the study:  
 Oral contraceptives  
 Hormone -replacement therapy  
 Prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such  as warfarin at a stable 
dose or low -molecular -weight heparin ) 
 Vaccinations (such as influenza, COVID -19) 
Live, attenuated vaccines are not permitted (see Section  N.4.3.3 ) 
 Megestrol acetate administered as an appetite stimulant  
 Mineralocorticoids (e.g.,  fludrocortisone)  
 Corticosteroids administered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) or 
asthma  
 Low-dose corticosteroids administered for orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency  
 Palliative radiotherapy (e.g., treatment of known bony metastases or symptomatic 
relief of pain) as outlined below:  
Palliative radiotherapy is permitted, prov ided it does not interfere with the 
assessment of tumor target lesions (e.g., the lesion to be irradiated must not be 
the only site of measurable disease).  Treatment with atezolizumab may be 
continued during palliative radiotherapy.  
 Local therapy (e.g.,  surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency 
ablation) as outlined below:  
Patients experiencing  a mixed response requiring local therapy f or control of 
three or fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment in 
consultat ion with the Medical Monitor.  Patients who receive local therapy 
directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable  for radiographic response 
but will remain evaluable for progression.

Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
535/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or analgesic s may be 
administered for the second and subsequent atezolizumab infusions only, at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
In general, investigators should  manage a patient's care (including preexisting 
conditions) with supportive therapies other than those d efined as cautionary or 
prohibited therapies (see Section  N.4.3.2 , Section  N.4.3.3 ) as clinically  indicated, per 
local standard practice.  Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be 
treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-
receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per local 
standard practice.  Serious infusion associated -events manifested by dyspnea, 
hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or  
respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated 
(e.g.,  supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix  6). 
N.4.3.2  Cautionary Therapy  
N.4.3.2.1  Corticosteroids, Immunosuppressive Medications, and TNF - 
Inhibitors  
Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and TNF - inhibitors may 
attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects of treatme nt with tiragolumab and 
atezolizumab.  Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressive medications, or TNF - inhibitors would be routinely administered, 
alternatives, including antihistamines, should be considered.  If the alt ernatives are not 
feasible, systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and TNF - 
inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Patients with primary CNS tumors can be receiving concurrent treatment with 
corticosteroids  in consultation with  the Medical Monitor.  Patients must be receiving a 
stable or decreasing dose for  5 days prior to the baseline magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scan and at the time of drug initiation.  
Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications are recommended, at the 
discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when 
associated with tiragolumab and atezolizumab therapy (refer to Section  N.5.2.1  and 
Section  N.5.2.2  for details).  
N.4.3.2.2  Herbal Therapies  
Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug drug interactions (DDIs) are 
generally unknown.  However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer 
may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator.  
N.4.3.3  Prohibited Therapies  
Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below:

Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
536/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (includin g, but not limited 
to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal 
therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited within 
3 weeks prior to starting study treatment and during study treatment, until dis ease 
progression is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment, with 
the exception of palliative radiotherapy and local therapy under certain 
circumstances (see Section  N.4.3.1  for details).  
 Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment and during study treatment.  
 Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  FluMist) are prohibited within  4 weeks prior to 
initiation of study treatment, during atezolizumab treatment, for 90 days after the 
final dose of tiragolumab, and for 5  months after the final dose of study treatment.  
 Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, int erferons and 
IL-2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is longer) 
prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment because these 
agents could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when giv en in 
combination with study treatment.  
 
N.4.4  Arm-specific Assessments  
In addition to the study assessments described in Section  4.5, the following 
assessments are required for patients receiving atezolizumab and tiragolumab.  Refer to 
the schedule of activities (Section  N.6) for arm -specific assessment timepoints.  
Local Laboratory Assessments  
 Thyroid function testing:  thyroid -stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine (T3) (or 
total T3 for sites where f ree T3 is not performed), and free thyroxine (T4)  
 HIV serology  
 HBV serology, consisting of the following:   
– HBsAg, HBsAb, and total HBcAb for all patients  
– HBV DNA for patients with negative HBsAg and HBsAb tests and a positive 
total HBcAb test  
 HCV serolog y:  HCV antibody and (if HCV antibody test is positive) HCV RNA  
If a patient has a positive HCV antibody test at screening, an HCV RNA test must 
also be performed to determine if the patient has an HCV infection.  
 EBV serology, including the following  
– EBV viral capsid antigen ( VCA) immunoglobulin M  (IgM)  
– EBV VCA immunoglobulin G ( IgG) or Epstein -Barr nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) IgG

N.5 SAFETY PLAN  
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety 
in this study.  Following are further instructions specific to Arm N: atezolizumab plus 
tiragolumab.  
N.5.1  Risks Associated with Stu dy Treatment  
N.5.1.1  Risks Associated with Atezolizumab  
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following:  infusion -related 
reactions (IRRs) and immune -mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, 
diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hy perthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, 
Guillain -Barré  syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, facial paresis, 
myelitis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis,  pericardial disorders,  nephritis, myositis, 
and severe cutaneous adverse reactions.  In addition, immune -mediated reactions may 
involve any organ system and lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH ).  Refer 
to Section  N.5.2.2  of the protocol and Section 6 of  the Atezolizumab Investigator's 
Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab.   
N.5.1.2  Risks Associated with Tiragolu mab 
IRR and immune -mediated hepatitis are an identified risk of tiragolumab. Additional 
immune -mediated adverse events, l ymphopenia and embryofetal toxicity are potential 
risks with tiragolumab.  Although clinical evaluation of tiragolumab is limited and n ot all 
risks are known, as an antagonist of T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains 
(TIGIT ), tiragolumab is anticipated to enhance T -cell and NK -cell proliferation, survival, 
and function.  Therefore, tiragolumab may increase the risk of autoimmune inflammation 
(also described as immune -mediated adverse events).   
Refer to Section  N.5.2.2  of the protocol and Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator's 
Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for tiragoluma b.   
N.5.1.3  Risks Associated with Combination Use of Tiragolumab 
and Atezolizumab  
Based on results from nonclinical and/or clinical studies with each molecule as a single 
agent, clinical data with tiragolumab plus atezolizumab, there are known and  potential 
overl apping toxicities in patients treated with tiragolumab plus atezolizumab.  Because 
the expected pharmacologic activity of these two molecules is to increase adaptive 
tumor cell ( TC) immune responses, there is the possibility of heightened immune 
responses.    
Arm N:  Atezolizumab plus Tiragolumab in Patients with TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR -Positive 
Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
538/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  Refer to Section 6 of the Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure for a list of identified 
risks associated with tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab.  Based on the 
mechanism of action of tiragolumab and atezolizumab, additional immune -mediated 
adve rse events are potential overlapping toxicities associated with combination use of 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab.  
Based on clinical experience to date, it is anticipated that immune -mediated adverse 
events following treatment with tiragolumab and atezolizu mab will be amenable to 
monitoring and manageable in the setting of this combination study.  The extensive 
experience with immune checkpoint inhibitors ( CPIs ) to date has been incorporated into 
the design and safety management plan in order to reduce the p otential risks to 
participating patients.  Patients with a history of autoimmune disease will be excluded 
from this study (see Section  N.4.1.2 ).  Patients previously treated with approved or 
experimental cancer immunotherapy ( CIT) will also be excluded from participation in this 
study.  Owing to the risks of active viral infection and viral reactivation (see Tiragolumab 
Investigator’s Brochure), patients with active  HIV, HBV, HCV, or EBV  infection s, known 
and/or suspected chronic a ctive EBV infection, or tuberculosis and/or patients with 
recent severe infections will be excluded from this study (see Sections  4.1.2  
and N.4.1.2 ). 
N.5.2  Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.   
N.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Treatment Interruptions  
No dose reductions for atezolizumab or tiragolumab are allowed.  Interruptions to 
atezolizumab or tiragolumab treatment are described below  (Section  N.5.2.2 ). 
N.5.2.2  Management of Specific Adverse Events Associated with 
Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab  
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezo lizumab and/or tiragolumab 
treatment should be managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, 
such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible 
immunogenic etiology  when clinically indicated . 
Although most immune -mediated adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized early and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab 
and/or  tiragolumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, 
immune -mediated toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, 
systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents.  
Arm N:  Atezolizumab plus Tiragolumab in Patients with TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR -Positive 
Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
539/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  The following are general re commendations for management of any other adverse events 
that may occur and are not specifically listed in the following subsections.  
 Patients and family caregivers should receive timely and up -to-date information 
about immunotherapies, their mechanism of  action, and the clinical profile of 
possible immune -related adverse events prior to initiating therapy and throughout 
treatment.  There should be a high level of suspicion that new symptoms are 
treatment related.  
 In general, atezolizumab  and tiragolumab therapy should be continued with close 
monitoring for Grade 1 toxicities, with the exception of some neurologic toxicities.  
 Consider holding atezolizumab and tiragolumab for most Grade 2 toxicities and 
resume when symptoms and/or laboratory values resolve t o Grade 1 or better.  
Corticosteroids (initial dose of 0.5 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent) may 
be administered.  
 For Grade 2 recurrent or persistent (lasting for more than 5 days) events, treat as a 
Grade 3 event.   
 Hold atezolizumab  and tiragolumab  for Grade 3 toxicities and initiate treatment 
with high -dose corticosteroids (1 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent).  
Corticosteroids should be tapered over 1 month to 10 mg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent, before atezolizumab can be r esumed.  If symptoms do not improve 
within 48 to 72 hours of high -dose corticosteroid use, other immunosuppressants 
may be offered for some toxicities.  
 In general, Grade 4 toxicities warrant permanent discontinuation of atezolizumab 
and tiragolumab treatme nt, with the exception of endocrinopathies that are 
controlled by hormone -replacement therapy.  
 
The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may be 
experiencing prior to  further administration of atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab .  
Resumption of atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab may be considered in patients who are  
deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -mediated event.  The decision 
to re-challenge patients with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab should be based on 
investigator's assessment of benefit risk and documented by the investigator.  The 
Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed.  
DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab and tiragolumab in this study.  
TREATMENT INTERRUPTION  
Atezolizumab and tiragolumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients 
experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are 
initiated for treatment of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1 month to the 
equivalent of  10 mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab and tiragolumab can be

the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab and tiragolumab.  How ever, 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab may be withheld for  12 weeks to allow for patients to 
taper off corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab and tiragolumab 
can be resumed after being withheld for  12 weeks if the patient is likely to d erive 
clinical benefit.  The decision to re -challenge patients with atezolizumab and 
tiragolumab should be based on the investigator’s benefit risk assessment and 
documented by the investigator.  The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed.  
Atezo lizumab and tiragolumab treatment may be suspended for reasons other than 
toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures).  The acceptable length of treatment interruption 
must be based on the investigator's  benefitrisk assessment and in alignment with the 
protocol requirements for the duration of treatment and documented by the 
investigator.   The Medical Monitor is available to advise as needed . 
N.5.2.2.1  Pulmonary Events  
Pulmonary events may present as new or worsening cough, chest pain, fever, dyspnea, 
fatigue, hypoxia, pne umonitis, and pulmonary  infiltrates .  Patients will be assessed for 
pulmonary signs and symptoms throughout the study.   
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported

myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac condi tions, 
or progression of malignancy.   
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac 
enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate et iology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table  8. 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED PERI CARDIAL DISORDERS  
Immune -mediated pericarditis should  be suspected in any patient presenting with chest 
pain and may be associated with immune -mediated myocarditis (see section on 
myocarditis above).  
Immune -mediated pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade should be suspected in 
any patient presenting with  chest pain associated with dyspnea or hemodynamic 
instability.  
Patients should be evaluated for other causes of pericardial disorders such as infection 
(commonly viral), cancer related (metastatic disease or chest radiotherapy), cardiac 
injury related (p ost myocardial infarction or iatrogenic), and autoimmune disorders, 
and should be managed accordingly.  
All patients with suspected pericardial disorders should be urgently evaluated by 
performing an ECG, chest X -ray, transthoracic echocardiogram, and cardi ac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  
Pericardiocentesis should be considered for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, if 
clinically indicated.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of pericardi tis, pericardial effusion, or cardiac 
tamponade, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated 
according to the guidelines in Table  8.  Withhold treatment with  tiragolumab and  
atezolizumab for Grade  1 pericarditis and conduct a detailed cardiac evaluation to 
determine the etiology and manage accordingly.

N.5.2.2.7  Infusion -Related Reactions   
No premedication is indicated for the administration of the Day 1, Cycle 1 infusion of 
tiragolumab or atezolizumab.  However, patients who experience an infusion -related 
reaction (IRR) with the Day 1, Cycle 1 infusion of tiragolumab or atezolizumab may 
receive premedication with antihistamines, antipyretic medication, or analgesics (e.g., 
acetaminophen) fo r subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in 
treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.  
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have 
been reported with  tiragolumab and atezolizumab.  These reactions, which are thought 
to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours 
of tiragolumab or atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in 
severity.  Guide lines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in 
Table  9.  For subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional 
guidelines.

IRR, Grade 1   Reduce infusion rate to half the rate being given at the time of event 
onset.  
 After the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30  minutes 
while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.  
 If the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for 30 minutes after 
symptoms have resolved, the infusion rat e may be increased to the 
original rate.  
IRR, Grade 2   Interrupt infusion.  
 Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).  
 After symptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half the 
rate being given at the time of event onset.  
 For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral premedication 
with antihistamines, antipyretic medications, and/or analgesics and 
monitor  closely for IRRs.  
IRR, Grade 3 or 4   Stop infusion.  
 Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).  
 Permanently discontinue tiragolumab  or atezolizumab and contact the 
Medical Monitor. a 
IRR   infusion -related reaction.  
a Resumption of tiragolumab and atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving 
benefit and have fully recovered from the immune -mediated event.  The decision  to re -
challenge patients with tiragolumab and atezolizumab should be based on the investigator’s 
benefit -risk assessment and documented by the investigator.  The Medical Monitor is 
available to advise as needed.  
 
N.5.2.2.8  Cytokine -Release Syndrome  
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of tiragolumab or 
atezolizumab.  However, patients who experience cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) with 
tiragolumab or atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines, 
antipyretic medic ations, and/or analgesics (e.g.,  acetaminophen) for subsequent 
infusions.  
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune 
therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells 
and/or other im mune effector cells.  Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever 
at the onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ 
dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019).  CRS has been well documented with chimeric antigen 
receptor T -cell th erapies and bispecific T -cell engager antibody therapies but has also

Adashe
k and Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab.
Guidelines for medical management of CRS are provided in Table 10.
Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with a CRS involving the 
inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN-  (Merad and Martin 
2020).  If a patient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis 
should include SARS-CoV-2 infection, which should be confirmed or refuted through 
assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or 
radiologic evaluations per investigator’s judgment. If a diagnosis of SARS -CoV-2 
infection is confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or institutional 
guidelines.

a Grading system for management guidelines is based on the ASTCT CRS consensus 
grading scale.  NCI  CTCAE v5.0 and the ASTCT CRS consensus grading scale should be 
used when reporting severity of CRS on the Adverse Event eCRF.  NCI  CTCAE v5.0

N.5.2.2.12  Immune -Mediated Meningoencephalitis  
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis is a potential risk with tiragolumab.   
Immune -mediated meningoencephalitis should be suspected in any patient presenting 
with signs or symptoms suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis, including, but not 
limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and 
altered or depressed level of consciousness.  Encephalopathy from metabolic or 
electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from potential meningoencephalitis 
resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression of malignancy, or 
secondar y to a paraneoplastic process.   
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with 
a CT scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or 
edema.  If deemed safe by the treating physician, a  lumbar puncture should be 
performed and a neurologist should be consulted.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an 
identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  15.

N.5.2.2.13  Renal Events  
Eligible patients must have adequate renal function.  Renal function, including serum 
creatinine, should be monitored throughout study treatment.  Patients with abnormal 
renal function should be evaluated and treated for other more common etiologies 
(including prerenal and postrenal causes, and concomitant medications such as non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs).  Refer the patient to a renal specialist if clinically 
indicated.  A renal biopsy m ay be required to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of nephritis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  16.

Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders.  Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin ras h in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.  
Patients with possible myositis should be referred to a rheumatologist or neurologist.  
Patients with p ossible myositis should be monitored for signs of myocarditis.  
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in  Table  17.

before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indicated in t he schedule of 
assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy test must be co nfirmed by a 
serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to ad ministration of study drug.  Patients who 
have a positive pregnancy test must not receive study drug.   
j Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, 
total biliru bin, direct bilirubin, total protein, and albumin.  Screening results must be reviewed and documented prior to administration  of the first 
dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent 
chemistry evaluations should be completed prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle (or up to 3 days before).  
k Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (n eutrophils, 
eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 t hey do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
l Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
m All patients will be tested for HIV, HBV, HCV at screening.  Patients with HBV or HIV will be exluded based on the criteria d etailed in 
Section  4.1.2 . Patients with HCV will be excluded based on the criteria in  Section  N.4.1.2 .  EBV serology samples will be collected at screening 
for the following: EBV VCA IgM, EBV VCA IgG or EBNA IgG. An EBV PCR test should be performed as clinically indicated to scree n for active 
infection or suspe cted chronic active infection.  Patients with a positive EBV viral capsid antigen immunoglobulin M (IgM) test or positive EBV  
PCR test at screening  are excluded. Additional EBV serology tests will be performed for patients who subsequently experience an ac ute 
inflammatory event, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, while receiving study treatment.  
n Urinalysis consists of specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood.  
o An ECG is required at screening, at the treatment discontinuation/completion visit, and when clinically indicated.  ECGs for each patient should 
be obtained from the same machine wherever possible.  Lead placement should be as consistent as possible.  ECG recordings mus t be 
performed after the patient has  been resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes.  
Arm N:  Atez olizumab plus Tiragolumab in Patients with TMB -H/MSI -H/dMMR -Positive Tumors  
 
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
578/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  p  TSH, free T3 (or total T3 at sites where free T3 is not performed), and free T4 will be collected at screening, on Day 1 of C ycles 1 and 4, every 
fourth cycle thereafter (e.g., Cycles 1, 5, 9, and 13, etc. ), and at the  treatment discontinuation/completion visit.  
q Atezolizumab will be administered by IV infusion at a fixed dose of 1200 mg on Days 1 of each 21 -day cycle. The initial infusion of atezolizumab 
will be delivered over 60 (  15) minut es.  Subsequent infusions will be delivered over 30 (  10) minutes if the previous infusion was tolerated 
without infusion -associated adverse events, or 60 (  15) minutes if the patient experienced an infusion -associated adverse event with the 
previous inf usion. 
r Tiragolumab will be administered by IV infusion at a fixed dose of 600 mg on Days 1 of each 21 -day cycle. The initial dose will be delivered over 
60 ( 15) minutes.  If the first infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivere d over 30 (  10) minutes.  Dosing of both study 
drugs will occur only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory test results are acceptable.  If a tumor assessment was  performed, results 
must be reviewed by the investigator before dosing of study tre atment.  
s All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiatio n of study treatment do not 
have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), 
a non -contrast CT scan of the chest may be performed and MRI scans of the ab domen, pelvis, and head should be performed.  A  CT or MRI 
scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or  refute the 
diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an eq uivocal scan.   
t At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic procedures 
every 8 (1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks thereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment discontinuation, until 
investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors)  or loss of clinical benefit (with 
Medical Monitor consultation ; see Section  3.1.2 ), withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor, or death, 
whichever occurs first.   
u For patients  with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue samples 
(archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of enrollment at baseline for central testing. If b oth archival and recent 
tissue are available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
v Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week of the first tumor assessment ), and at tumor 
progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.   
w After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-mandated 
intervention should be reported.  After initiation of  study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of 
chemotherapy or 90 days after the final dose of atezolizumab, whichever is longer.  All patients will be followed until treat ment -related toxicities 
resolve or for at le ast 28 days post -chemotherapy discontinuation or 90 days post -atezolizumab discontinuation, whichever is longer. After this 
period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified if the invest igator becomes aware of 
any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see  Section  5.6). 
x Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a 
patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.

O.4.2  STUDY TREATMENT  
Study treatment in this arm will consist of pralsetinib.  
O.4.2.1  Formulation and Packaging  
Pralsetinib will be supplied by the Sponsor as 100 -mg capsules.  
The study drug will be periodically tested and monitored for its acceptable shelf life.  An y 
study drug that fails to comply with the manufactured specifications will be promptly 
removed from the clinical trial site and replaced with new supplies by the Sponsor (or 
designee).  
Each bottle will be labeled with the required regulatory agency warnin g statement, the 
protocol number, the Sponsor’s name, and directions for patient use and storage.  The 
investigator should ensure that the study drug is stored in appropriate conditions in a 
secure location with controlled access.  For information on the pa ckaging, handling, and 
storage, see the Pharmacy Manual and Pralsetinib Investigator's Brochure.  
 
O.4.2.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Study treatment will be administered in 28 -day cycles.  
Pralsetinib will be self -administered by patients orally at home  (except on clinic days 
Section  O.6), at the same time each day, on a starting dose of 400  mg/day (four 100 -mg 
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
583/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  capsules per day) once a day (QD) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or 
consent withdrawal.  For more specific dosing instructions, refer to the pharmacy 
manual.  
Pralsetinib should be taken in the morning with a glass of water in a fasted state, with no 
food intake b eginning 2 hours before until 1 hour after study drug administration.  The 
capsules should not be opened and the contents of the capsules should not be 
dissolved.   
A missed dose can be taken within 12 hours of the scheduled time. After that, patients 
shou ld take the next dose the following day, without compensating for the missed dose 
(including vomited doses).  
Guidelines for pralsetinib dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation are provided in Section  O.5.2.1 .  
See Section  4.3.2  for details on assessment of compliance for self -administered oral 
study drugs.  
Accidental overdose or medication errors should be noted on the Study Drug 
Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Cases of accidental overdose or 
medication error, along with any associated adverse events, should also be reported as 
described in Section  5.3.5.12 . 
At the end of the s tudy, the Sponsor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any 
unused study drug.  
O.4.3  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Food, and Additional 
Restrictions  
O.4.3.1  Permitted Therapy  
Anti-emetic and anti -diarrheal treatments may be used at the investigator’s disc retion (in 
accordance with the local guidelines) after documented nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea 
has occurred in patients who are not taking medications to manage these symptoms.  
Prophylaxis for nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea may be instituted beginning on Cycle 2 
Day 1 in patients who experience these toxicities during Cycle 1, and during Cycle 1 for 
patients who experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  
In certain instances, palliative radiotherapy to specific sites is permitted if considered 
medically nece ssary by the investigator.  The Sponsor must be notified if palliative 
radiotherapy is started; however, the need for radiotherapy will generally be considered 
indicative of progressive disease.  
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors  
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
584/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  If palliative radiation is indicated for bone lesions, pallia tive radiation may start within 
24 hours of the last dose of pralsetinib, unless, in the judgment of the investigator, 
patient safety will require a longer washout period prior to palliative therapy.  Dosing of 
pralsetinib may resume with the resolution of  any radiation toxicity to  Grade 1 or better.  
If radiation therapy or surgical excision of target lesion is determined to be in patient's 
best interest and cannot be avoided, the Medical Monitor should be consulted.  Note that 
radiation or surgical excisio n of target lesions may render patients unevaluable for 
further response assessments.  
O.4.3.2 Concomitant Therapy to Be Used With Caution  
The following medications are to be used with caution during the study. 
In vitro metabolism studies in human liver microsomes  have demonstrated that
pralsetinib is a direct moderate inhibitor and inducer of multiple P450 enzymes
(CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9).  Pralsetinib is also a time -dependent inhibitor of
CYP3A4/5.
Pralsetinib is an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), BCRP,  OATP1B1, OATP1B3,
OAT1, MATE1, and MATE2 -K at clinically relevant concentrations.  In patients,
pralsetinib may alter or increase the plasma concentration of co -administered
sensitive CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1,
MATE1, and MATE2 -K substrates.
Medications that are sensitive CYP2C8, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, P -gp, BCRP,
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, MATE1, and MATE2 -K substrates with known
drugdrug interaction potential should be used with caution.
Lists of relevant drugs to be used with  caution are provided in  Appendix  7.
O.4.3.3 Prohibited Therapy  
In vitro metabolism studies indicate that pralsetinib oxidation is primarily mediated
by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, and glucuronidation by
UGT1A4.   As a precaution, strong inhibitors as well as inducers of CYP3A4 are
prohibited.  Drug transporter studies in cells overexpressing P -gp indicate that
pralsetinib is likely also a P -gp substrate.  Medications that are strong dual inhibitors
of P-gp and CY P3A4 are prohibited.
–Refer to  Appendix  7 for a list of relevant prohibited medications.
Any investigational agent or device other than pra lsetinib, including commercially
available agents that are investigational for the treatment of the patient’s underlying
malignancy.
Any anti -cancer treatment other than study drug.
Use of herbal medications (e.g., St. John’s Wort) should be avoided when p ossible.
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
585/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  O.4.3.4  Prohibited Food  
 Consumption of grapefruit, grapefruit products, Seville oranges (including 
marmalade containing Seville oranges) or star fruit should be avoided for up to 14 
days prior to and during the treatment period.  
 Consumption of St. John’s wort, a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, is prohibited for 
up to 14 days prior to and during the study treatment period.  
 
O.4.4  Pralsetinib -Specific Assessments  
In addition to the study assessments described in Section  4.5, the following 
assessments are required for patients in the pralsetinib treatment arm.  Refer to the 
schedule of activities (Section  O.6) for arm -specific assessment timepoints.  
Local Laboratory Assessments  
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory 
for analysis:  
 Coagulation:  INR and aPTT  
 Urinalysis (dipstick):  (pH, specific gravity, glucose, protein, ketones, blood, nitrite, 
leukocyte esterase [or white blood cells]). Note that for sites that do not routinely 
perform leukocyte esterase in the urinalysis (dipstick) test, white  blood cell result in 
the report of urinalysis with dry chemistry (dipstick) method is acceptable.  
Other Assessments  
 Vital signs will include measurements of pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure while the patient is in a seated position, and t emperature.  
 Single 12 -lead ECG   
 
O.5 SAFETY PLAN  
Please refer to Section  5 for general instructions with regard to the assessment of safety  
in this study.  Following are further instructions specific to Arm O:  pralsetinib treatment.  
O.5.1  Risks Associated with Pralsetinib  
Pralsetinib has been associated with risks such as the following:  pneumonitis, 
pneumonia/lung infections, tumor lysis syndrome , hypertension and hepatotoxicity.  
Refer to the Pralsetinib Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated 
safety risks for pralsetinib.  
O.5.2  Management of Patients Who Experience Adverse Events with 
Pralsetinib  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events and dose modification or 
interruption are outlined below.  These guidelines are intended to inform rather than 
supersede clinical judgment and the benefit -risk balance as assessed by the investigator 
in managing individual cases.   
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
586/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  O.5.2.1  Dose Modifications and Interruptions  
Adverse events associated with pralsetinib can often be managed with concomitant 
medications, supportive care (see Section  O.4.3.1  and Section  O.5.2.2 ), and/or dose 
modifications as per Table  1 and Table  2. 
The dose of pralsetinib can be reduced in decrements of 100 mg and no more than 3 
dose reductions will be allowed.  Pralsetinib dose reductions to below 100 mg QD are 
not permitted.  If a patient requires dose reduction below 100 mg QD, study treatment 
should be discontinued.   
The possible daily doses of pralsetinib are shown in Table  1. 
Table  1 Pralsetinib Dose Reductions  
Dose Level  Pralsetinib  
Starting dose  400 mg QD  
First dose reduction  300 mg QD  
Second dose reduction  200 mg QD  
Third dose reduction  100 mg QD  
Fourth dose reduction  Not permitted  
QD   once a day.  
 
Pralsetinib treatment may be interrupted for a maximum of 56  days (8  weeks) to allow 
for sufficient recovery from any toxicity if a patient is still deriving clinical benefit in the 
judgment of the investigator.  In general, if a toxicity that is considere d to be related to 
the study drug does not resolve to   Grade 1 or has not returned to baseline after dose 
interruption for more than 56  days, the patient should be discontinued from study 
treatment unless a specific exception is made following discussion  with the Medical 
Monitor because resumption of treatment is considered to be in the best interest of the 
patient, and this is documented in writing.  Additionally, the Medical Monitor must be 
informed if an adverse event that is not considered to be relat ed to the study treatment 
requires a dose interruption for more than 56  days.  
 
Pralsetinib may be suspended for reasons other than toxicity (eg, surgical procedures), 
however pralsetinib should be interrupted at least 5 days in advance of surgery and 
resumed 2 weeks after major surgery and until adequate wound healing. If there are 
questions regarding whether or not study drug should be interrupted, the investigator 
should consult with the Medical Monitor.

588/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  O.5.2.2  Guidelines for Management of  Specific Adverse Events  
Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in the subsections 
below.  
O.5.2.2.1  Pneumonia/Lung Infections   
The diagnosis of pneumonia and lung infections (including opportunistic infections), 
some of which have been fatal, have been reported with patients treated with pralsetinib.  
The determination of causal relationship to the drug is often confounded by 
immu nosuppression related to the patient’s underlying disease, prior therapy (such as 
immunotherapy and steroids), and other risk factors for infection such as 
myelosuppression.  Pneumonias and other lung infections should be managed with 
systemic antibiotics and other supportive management.   
If the causality is at least possibly related to the study drug, dose interruption and 
potential dose reduction and/or discontinuation should follow the guidelines in  Table  2 , 
dose modification for non -hematologic toxicity.  
O.5.2.2.2  Tumor Lysis Syndrome   
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) has been observed following pralsetinib treatment.  
Investigators should monitor elec trolyte status and renal function via laboratory testing.  
Patients with TLS may require supportive care with intravenous fluids and correction of 
electrolyte imbalances.  
Patients who are at risk for TLS at study entry, such as those with high tumor burden , 
should be well hydrated before initiation of pralsetinib and avoid dehydration during the 
first cycle.  If TLS is suspected, investigators should manage the adverse event(s) 
according to standard institutional practices or accepted oncology management 
guidelines (Coiffier et al. 2008; Klastersky et al. 2016).   
O.5.2.2.3  Hypertension   
Treat with standard of care antihypertensive therapy.  Dose modification is not required if 
hypertension can be managed with supportive medications.  If dose modification is 
necessary , please use dose modification guidelines for non -hematologic toxicity 
(Table  2).   
O.5.2.2.4  Hepatotoxicity  
Serious hepatic adverse reactions have been observed with pralsetinib.  Pralsetinib 
treatment must be discontinued permanently if either of the following occurs:  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  upper limit of normal ( ULN; of which  35% is direct bilirubin)  
 Treatment -emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice

589/Protocol ML42439, Version 6   
O.5.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to 
the Sponsor)  
Section  5.2.3  describes adverse events of special interest that are required to be 
reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor immediately for all study treatments, 
and Section  5.4.2  provides reporting instructions.  There are no additional adverse 
events of special interest for the  RET fusion -positive cohort other than those specified in 
Section  5.2.3 . 
O.5.4  Selected Adverse Events  
Additional data may be analyzed for the following selected adverse events:  
 Pneumo nitis 
 Pneumonia  
 Hepatotoxicity  
 Hypertension  
 Hemorrhagic events  
 Tumor lysis syndrome

Note: Cycle 28 days.  
a The medical history, ECOG PS, hematology/CBC, and chemistry panel should be done   28 days prior to initiation of treatment.  
However, if the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be repeated  on 
Day 1.  Scans to document measurable or evaluable disease (i.e.,  tumor measurement) should be performed   4 weeks prior to 
initiation of treatment.   
b After treatment is discontinued, patients will visit the study center within 28 days after the last  dose of study treatment for end -of-
treatment follow -up assessments.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study 
drug discontinuation.  If the patient’s worsening disease combined with travel  distance makes this visit too difficult, follow -up with the 
patient may take place by telephone to include an assessment of AEs.  Alternatively, the patient's local physician may be con tacted to 
collect AE data and any standard of care laboratory and CT d ata, if performed.   
c If the hematology/CBC and chemistry panel are obtained within 7 days prior to treatment discontinuation, they do not have to be 
repeated unless clinically indicated . 
d Informed consent must be documented before any study -specific scr eening procedure is performed.  
e Confirmation of positive RET fusion status should occur prior to performing other trial -related eligibility assessments.  
f Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior  cancer therapies and procedures), 
reproductive status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and 
nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the Cycle 1, Day 1 visit.  
g A complete physical examination, performed at screening should include height, weight, an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears,  nose, 
and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neur ologic systems.  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Limit ed, 
symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed as clinically indicated.  Changes from baseline abn ormalities should be 
recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse 
Event eCRF.  
h Includes respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure while t he patient is in a seated position, and temperature. 
Vital signs should be assessed at screening and day 1 of each cycle. Additionally, blood pressure should be assessed at C1D8 . 
i All performance status will be assessed according to ECOG PS definitions pr ovided in Appendix  5.  It is recommended, where possible, 
that a patient’s performance status be assessed by the same person throughout the  study.  
j Women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening , within 7 
days before the first dose of study drug.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests may be performed at subsequent visits, as indi cated in the 
schedule of assessments.  Pregnancy tests must be done Day 1 prior to starting every cycle.  Any positive urine pregnancy tes t must 
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
592/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  During the treatment period, pregnancy test results must be available prior to administration 
of study drug.   
k Will include measurements of glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, 
ALT, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, total protein,  and albumin.  Screening r esults must be reviewed and documented prior to 
administration of the first dose of study treatment.  If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they do not have to be 
repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Subsequent chemistry evaluations should be comp leted prior to dosing on Day 1 of each indicated cycle 
(or up to 3 days before). AST and ALT should also be assessed on D15 of cycles 1 -3. 
l Hematology/CBC with differential includes WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differentia l count 
(neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells). If results are obtained within 7 days of Cycle  1, Day 1 they 
do not have to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
m Coagulation includes aPTT and INR.  
n Urinalysis (dipstick):  (pH, specific gravity, glucose, protein, ketones, blood, nitrite, leukocyte esterase [or white blood cells]). Note that 
for sites that do not routinely perform leukocyte esterase in the urinalysis (dipstick) test, white blood cell result in the report of u rinalysis 
with dry chemistry (dipstick) method is acceptable.  
o A single 12 -lead ECG should be performed during screening, on  Day 1 of every treatment cycle, at the end of treatment, and as 
clinically indicated.  ECG recordings will be obtained during scre ening and as clinically indicated at other timepoints .  Patients should be 
resting in a supine position for at least 10  minutes prior to ECG recording.  If at a particular post -dose timepoint (if applicable) the mean 
QTcF is  500 ms and/or  60 ms longer than the baseline value, another ECG must be recorded, ideally within the next 5  minutes, and 
ECG monitoring should continue until QTcF has stabilized on two successive ECGs.  The Medical Monitor should be notified.  St andard 
of care treatment may be insti tuted per the discretion of the Investigator.  
p All known sites of disease must be assessed and documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation.  
Tumor assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consen t and within 28 days prior to initiation of study 
treatment do not have to be repeated at screening.  If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (i.e., in patients with con trast allergy or 
impaired renal clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest m ay be performed and MRI scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and head 
should be performed.  A  CT or MRI scan of the head must be performed at screening to assess CNS metastasis.  An MRI scan of the 
brain is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metas tases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan.   
q At each subsequent tumor assessment, all measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed using the same radiographic 
procedures every 8 ( 1) weeks for 3 evaluations, then every 12 ( 2) weeks t hereafter regardless of dose delays or treatment 
discontinuation, until investigator -determined radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or RANO (for primary CNS tumors), 
withdrawal of consent, termination of an individual study arm by the Sponsor,  or death, whichever occurs first.   
r For patients with a positive biomarker result from an assay other than a tissue -based assay conducted by FMI, pre -treatment tissue 
samples (archival or recent resection or biopsy) must be submitted within 21 days of e nrollment at baseline for central testing.  If both 
archival and recent tissue is available, the recent tissue should be preferentially submitted.   
s Blood samples will be collected at screening, 8 weeks after first treatment (or within one week of the first tumor assessment), and at 
tumor progression  (within 7 days after progression)  for analyses including ctDNA.   
Arm O:  Pralsetinib in Patients with RET Fusion -Positive Tumors   
MyTACTIC  Study —Genentech, Inc.  
593/Protocol ML42439, Version 6  t Pralsetinib will be self -administered by patients orally at home (except on clinic days, Section  O.4.2.2 ), at the same time each day, on a 
starting dose of 400 mg/day (four 100 mg capsules per day) once a day (QD) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, o r consent  
withdrawal. Compliance will be reviewed with the patient prior to starting each cycle.  
u After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a proto col-
mandated intervention should be repor ted.  After initiation of study drug, all  adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final 
dose of study drug.  All patients will be followed until treatment -related toxicities resolve or for at least 28 days post -study drug 
discontinuation.  After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported.  After this period, the Sponsor should be notified 
if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment 
(see Section 5.6). 
v Medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional suppleme nts) used 
by a patient in addition to protocol -mandated treatment from 7 days prior to initiation of study drug until 28 days after the final dose of 
study drug.

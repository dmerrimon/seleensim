[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Walking in Multiple Sclerosi s 
A single -blind, sham -controlled, randomized, cross -over design was employed. Subjects 
attended three experimental sessions . In the first session, participants gave consent, completed 
the isokinetic strength testing of the knee extensors and flex ors to objectively determine the 
more -affected leg, and self -selected a comfortable walking speed on the treadmill to be used 
during sessions 2 and 3. At least three days after the first session, Session 2 was completed. 
Sessions 2 and 3 were separated by at least seven days to allow tDCS effects to dissipate . 
Prior to sessions 2 and 3, the participants were asked to fast for a minimum of 6 h before FDG administration. At the beginning of sessions 2 and 3, the participants’ height and weight were measured, blood glucose levels were determined, and an IV catheter was inserted for FDG 
injection. Blood glucose level was required to be equal to or less than 200 mg/dL in order to 
proceed with FDG administration and PET scanning. During sessions 2 and 3, either Sham (0 
mA) or tDCS (3 mA) was applied (determined through randomization) to the motor cortex (M1) area corresponding to the more- affected leg for 20 min. The purpose (e.g., enhancing motor 
learning or improving motor performance) of tDCS may determine stimulation timing. Studies on 
motor learning often apply tDCS during a task to improve acquisition. In contrast, tDCS was 
applied before the motor performance of a well -learned task (walking) in the current study. It has 
previously  been demonstrated that tDCS has ambiguous effects on cortical excitability during 
stimulation, but significantly and consistently increased cortical excitability after stimulation [48]. 
Moreover, when comparing tDCS before and during a 6 -min walk test in PwMS, it was found 
that stimulation before increased gait velocity, whereas stimulation during resulted in a decrease 
in the distance walked. Therefore, in this study participants underwent 20 min of tDCS then rested for 10 min to allow for peak stimulation effects  before walking on a treadmill for 20 min. 
Ratings of Perceived Exhaustion (RPE) were collected at the end of each minute during the walking task. Approximately two minutes into treadmill walking, 10 ± 10% mCi of FDG was administered via IV injection. Immediately after walking was completed, participants were 
positioned in the PET/computed tomography (CT) scanner and a whole body (top of head to 
toes) scan was completed to evaluate glucose uptake in the leg muscles. 
Data Analysis 
Twenty regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on the CT scan from each experimental session 
to locate the skeletal muscles of the lower limbs. In the upper leg, the knee extensors (rectus 
femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis) and knee flexors (long and short head of the biceps femoris, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, sartorius, and gracilis) 
were identified. In the lower leg, the plantar flexors (gastrocnemius, soleus, peroneus longus, 
peroneus brevis, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior) and the dorsiflexors (tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, and extensor hallucis longus) were identified.  The PET images were acquired immediately after the treadmill task and, therefore, 
the glucose uptake values closely reflected the uptake of FDG during walking. Standardized uptake values (SUV) based on the injected dose and body weight were calculated for each muscle. Although the participants fasted for a minimum of 6 h in order to minimize the impact, SUVs may be affected by blood glucose and insulin levels. Therefore, the SUV data were 
analyzed without normalization and as values normalized to standard blood glucose (adjusted to 
100 mg/dL), and/or the liver as a reference tissue, to allow for comparison across experimental 
sessions. The data were analyzed using PMOD Version 4.001 (PMD Technologies LLC, Zürich, 
Switzerland). The more -affected (weaker) legs were assigned using the knee extensor torque 
data obtained in Session 1. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were calculated to determine the 
magnitude of the asymmetry in SUVs between t he legs using a previously used equation 
(Equation (1)) . An AI greater than 10% was considered asymmetric .  
Statistical Analysis  
In order to compare muscle activity between the legs and experimental sessions, SUVs were averaged for each muscle group (knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar flexors, and dorsiflexors). The assumptions for normality were investigated via histograms, Q -Q plots, and 
the Shapiro -Wilk test, but were not met. Therefore, nonparametric paired tests (Wilcoxon tests) 
were performed on the normalized data to compare the muscle groups of the left and right leg 
within each condition (e.g., left vs. right knee extensors during the tDCS condition) and to 
compare the muscle groups of each leg between conditions (e.g., left knee extensors in Sham 
vs. tDCS). Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Analyses w ere performed using GraphPad 
Prism 8.1.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
 This is a research study.  We are inviting you to participate in thi s research study because you are 
between 18  and 70 years of age, and you were diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis  (MS).  
 The purpose of this research study is to determine if a single session of t ranscranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS ) can improve walking in people with MS. A second purpose is to find out whether 
tDCS should be applied before or during walking.  
 tDCS is a non- invasive technique in which a very weak electrical current is appli ed to the head in order 
to stimulate the brain.    
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE?  
 Approximately 40 people will take part in this study conducted by investigators at the University of Iowa.  
  
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to participate in three sessions on three different days separated by no less than 5 days.  Each visit will last approximately 60 min utes.

WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
 
Upon arrival to the Int egrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (NIPL)  on the IOWA Campus  the 
investigators will explain the protocol procedures . You will be assigned to one of two groups.  
If you agree to participate in the study and sign the consent document, you will complete the Patient Determined Disease Steps Scale (P DDS ), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), and a 6 Minute Walk Test 
(MWT) for baseline performance. Your maximal strength of  your  right and left leg muscles will be 
performed to determine your more -affected leg . You will sit on a chair and you will be asked to extend 
your knee against a pad as strong as possible.  If you are in group 1, t he second session will involve a 6 MWT i n which you receive tDCS or S ham (no 
electrical current) before the 6 MWT. In the third session you will receive the application (tDCS or 
Sham)  which was not used in the first session. If you are in group 2, t he second session will involve a 6 
MWT in which  you receive tDCS or S ham during the 6 MWT. In the third session you will receive the 
application which was not used in the first session. We will also measure gait speed, cadence, stride length and time, step length and time during the walk test.  For tDC S, we will place rubber electrodes soaked in salt water or electrode gel over your scalp and 
forehead. Therefore, one of the electrodes will be placed over your hair, but no additional substances will be put in your hair and no additional preparation of the hair will be conducted.  The electrodes will be held in place with a head band. A small current will be passed between the electrodes.  You may feel some tingling under the electrodes when the current is first turned on. The stimulation will last for no longer than 20 min.  
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS STUDY?  
 You may experience one or more of the risks indicated below from being in this study. In addition to these, there may be other unknown risks, or risks that we did not anticipate, associated with being in this 
study.  
 
Risks of tDCS  
 tDCS has been conducted on humans and animals for many years and no evidence has emerged to suggest that it is harmful or has ever induced a serious side effect. However, the safety of tDCS is dependent on current strength, electrode size, and stimulation duration. We will follow the current guidelines for safe and effective stimulation  that have been  identified for research studies and in clinical 
practice for tDCS applications. In the several hundred studies conducted on humans using tDCS, the only side effects that have been reported when proper guidelines are followed are temporary tingling, itching , mild headache, or skin redness under the electrodes in some subjects.  
 
Please let us know immediately if you develop any skin pain or discomfort during tDCS. We will monitor you during stimulation and will stop the procedure if any problem develops. You  may ask to 
stop the procedure at any time.  Any effects of tDCS should wear off within 60- 90 minutes after the 
current is stopped.

  Page 3 of 6 Risks of Performing Motor Tasks  
 
There is potential for injury (muscle strain), resulting from the maximal contractions.  There is a 0.01% 
chance of death (in people who have heart problems), a 0.02% risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require you to go the hospital (in people with hear t problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in 
blood pressure.  
 You can stop the contractions  immediately if you experience any slight pain or discomfort.  Following 
participation, you may experience some muscle soreness.  Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not exercised recently.   
Other risk s may include increased feelings of anxiety and/or stress induced by the experiment, which 
can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.   
 
General Risk  
 
Even though the risk is minimal, there is a risk for breach of confidentiality. We will protect your information using the methods describes later in this document, in the section, “What About Confidentiality?”

INTRODUCTION  
Background   
Food choices play a significant role in achieving glycemic goals and optimizing overall health for 
people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides a 
comprehensive look at the impact of foods and other behaviors on glucose. People with T2D 
may b enefit from using CGM to guide food choices that help achieve their desired glycemic 
goals (e.g. their Time in Range ( TIR); % time with glucose 70 -180 mg/dL) ). However, people with 
     Page 3 of 9      07Jun2023 Ver. 1.0 [IRB Approved Date 27JUL2023]  T2D may encounter challenges with knowing how to use CGM data to make food choices, 
especially food choices that can maximize TIR and that are good for overall health (e.g. 
identifying food choices that keep glucose in target and that align with current evidence -based 
nutrition guidance  for people with T2D1).  
Obtaining benefit from CGM requires education, training, and support.2 Many tools,3 methods,4 
and programs5 have been created to educate CGM users on effective use of the technology and 
its associated data. However, specific emphasis on evidence -based nutrition guidance has not 
been embedded into these trainings. Lack of  educat ion on the importance of achieving  glycemic 
(and other health) goals by following evidence -based nutrition guidance  could have 
consequences. For example, without nutrition guidance, a continuous glucose monitor could 
lead its user to choose low -quality (e.g. unhealthy) foods that keep gluc ose in the target range 
of 70 -180 mg/dL ( for example, choosing high -fat meats  like bacon  or highly -processed low -carb 
snacks, etc.) but these foods may be detrimental to other aspects of health and lead to 
unintended consequences.  
The IRB has approved st udy A21 -292 (also know n as the My Diabete s Study ), a randomized 
clinical trial to assess the impact of using a nutrition -focused approach (NFA) , based on 
evidence -based nutrition guidance , or a self -directed approach during CGM initiation. The NFA 
was developed specifically for the randomized clinical trial study .  
Interview Purpose
The purpose o f these qualitative interviews is to  provide a deeper understanding of the 
perspectives of people with T2D who receive a NFA when initiating CGM. More specifically, 
these interviews will help describe how the NFA may or may not have worked compared to 
how it was intended; the  interviews  will also provide information that can be used to help 
refine future NFA iterations.  
Data from this qualitative research will be considered in partnership with the quantitative data 
collected as part of IRB-approved study A21-292. Together, this work will offer important  
insights into the eff icacy of  a NFA during  CGM initiation in people with T2D. The qualitative 
research will  help  identify gaps in our understanding of how people with T2D use their CGM 
data to make f ood-related decisions and what factors influence their use of the CGM data.     
Outcomes will provide the diabetes care community with considerations for how to present 
and position nutrition messages when initiating CGM  in people with T2D.  
Interview  Que stions  
Primary Research Question:  How do people with T2D who  have received a NFA during CGM 
initiation use CGM data when  mak ing food -related decisions  and what specific types of food -
related changes , if any,  do they describe  making?  
To describe how participants use CGM data when making  food -related decisions after  receiving 
a NFA during CGM initiation, the following topics will be assessed:  
     Page 4 of 9      07Jun2023 Ver. 1.0 [IRB Approved Date 27JUL2023 ] •Which specific CGM data were used and what was the thought -process when using it
•Wha t specific food -related changes , if any,  are described by participants  as a result of the
CGM data
•What helped or what got in the way of using CGM data to guide food -related decisions
Secondary Research Question:  What is the overall experience of people with T2 D who receiv e 
a NFA during CGM initiation?  
To describe how people with T2D experience the NFA and its associated nutrition -focused CGM 
initiation  materials , the following topics will be assessed:  
•Were participants satisfied with the NFA  concept  and the nutrition -focused  materials  (e.g.
the CGM  and Nutrition  guide , the interactive  presentation) ; why or why not

•Target number of completed interviews: up to 15
•Anticipated participation  rate: 70%
•Total sample needed: approximately 21  in order to accommodate people who decline
participation ; expect approximately  30% may decline . (For reference, we expect N=66
people to complete the NFA arm of the My Diabetes study. It is expected that most
people wi ll meet all inclusion criteria.)
•Effort will be made to include  participants from at least two different sexes and
participants with point -of-care HbA1c s greater than  and less than  8.5% at the start of
the study .
Recruitment into Interviews Process  
•Participants who have completed  the NFA arm of the My Dia betes  study  will be invited
to participate . Invitation will stop when  the target number of interviews are complete.
•A verbal invitation or a n invitation  letter  will be shared with  study participants before
their study completion visit in  the My Dia betes  study . The invitation will provide a brief
description of the qualitative study .
•Participants who express interest in participating in the qualitative study interview, may
be able to complete the interview  immediately following the study completion visit in
the My Dia betes  study .
•IDC study staff working on the My Dia betes  study  will assess  eligibility for participation
in the qualitative  interview s the day of the  study completion visit. Eligibility assessment
includes :
oConfirm participant completed all study visits in the NFA arm of the My Dia betes
study
oConfirm participant had at lea st 70% “Time CGM Active” on Dexcom Clarity
Report during study visit  completion visit
oWilling to be recorded
•IDC study staff will relay  participant eligibility to a Center  for Evaluation  and Survey
Research  (CESR) team member .
•A trained CESR interviewer will provide the participant with a description of the study
and purpose of the interview .
•The C ESR interviewer will assess willingness to participate  and be recorded .
•If participant  is interested and available for the interview during the initial CESR contact ,
the CESR interviewer will provide consenting language and ask for a verbal consent (a
waiver of written consent will be requested) to participate in the audio -recorded , semi -
structured interview over the phone .
     Page 6 of 9      07Jun2023 Ver. 1.0 [IRB Approved Date 27JUL2023 ] •If the participant is interested , but does not have enough time, interviews will be
scheduled by CESR as soon as possible within  14 days of the study completion visit in the
My Dia betes  study .
•Recruitment will be closed when a maximum of 15 interviews have been  completed .
Interview  Process  
•Interviews  will be conducted  within  14 days  after  a participant  completes  the My Dia betes
study.
•After  the participant  provides  consent,  trained  interviewers  experienced  in qualitative
facilitation  will conduct  the interviews;  all interviewers  will be supervised  by a Co-
Investigator  with  extensive  qualitative  research  experience.
•Semi -structured  phone  interviews  will be recorded  and transcribed  with  secure  technology .
Audio  recording  is done  for accuracy  and for taking  additional  field  notes.
•Individual  interviews  are intended  to last approximately  20-30 minutes  and all of the
interviews  are expected  to be completed  within  approxima tely 25 weeks  of the first
interview  (this  estimate  is based  on expected  participant  completion  of the My Dia betes
study  and could  change  pending  enrollment  into that trial).
•CESR interviewers  will confirm  participant  information  and, as needed,  provide  participants
with  a brief  reminder  of the interview  purpose  before  beginning  the audio  recording.
•CESR interviewers  will inform  the participants  that they  are experts  in interviewing,  but they
are not experts  in diabetes  care .
•Audio  recording  will begin  immediately  prior  to the first interview  question .
•Each  interview  will start  with  a rapport -building  question,  followed  by a transition  question
that brings  participants  to the primary  area  of focus.
•Interviewers  will enter  detai led field  notes  into REDCap  during  the interview;  this will
support  circling  back  to prior  discussion  throughout  the interview  and enhance  depth  of
responses  collected.
•Interviewers  will monitor  timing  of each  question  and when  to proceed  or ask additional
probes  to ensure  the interview  stays  within  the expected  timing.
•If disconnected  during  the interview,  interviewers  will immediately  pause  the recording  and
call the participant  back.  They  will confirm  the correct  participant,  start  the recording  again
and continue  the interview.  If the participant  cannot  be reached,  a voicemail  will be left and
the interviewer  will call back  a few minutes  later . If participant  still is not reached  and the
interview  continues  at another  time , the interviewer  will restart  at the appropriate  root
question  and proceed  from  that point .
•Immediately  following  the interview,  interviewers  will document  the interview  length,
review  the completed  audio,  add any additional  field  notes  to the study -speci fic REDCap
database  to aid in interpretation  and analysis . Interviewers  will remove  protected  health
information,  and they  will download  and save  the audio  recording  and transcripts  from  the
recording  platform  using  an established  file-naming  convention .
•Contact  information  will be confirmed  and incentive  compensation  will be processed  and
sent  to participants  after  the interview  is confirmed  complete.

Interviewer Supervision  
•Interviews will be  audio -recorded
•After each interviewer conducts their first study interview, a CESR Project Lead or
qualitative co -investigator will listen to the audio and provide feedback and make any
necessary adjustments to the interview process before subsequent interviews are
conducted
•Interviewers, CESR project lead, and Investigators will me et after  approximately  the first
half of  the interviews are complete to review processes and listen to recordings as a
group to help prevent drift in facilitation skills
•Following interview completion, the team will de-brief and cover lessons learned
Interview Guide Development  
An interview  guide  will be developed  by the Investigators  with  input  from  stakeholders,  
including  diabetes  care  and education  specialists . Interview  questions  will be created  to address  
the specific  research  questions  described  above . Further,  literature  review,  prior  study -site 
research,  and Investigator  experience  will inform  question  development.   
•Root  questions  with  a combination  of struc tured  and unstructured  probes  will be used  to
facilitate  accurate,  rich,  and complete  responses.  Probes  will be designed  in a neutral  way
to avoid  biasing  responses.
•Interview  questions  will be open -ended  and will consider information from the BCW
framewor k and its associated COM -B model.
•The guide  will be reviewed  by an interdisciplinary  team  of diabetes  content  experts  and,  if
possible,  it will be pilot -tested  with  a proxy  interviewee  similar  to the target  population.  It
will be refined  based  on relevant  feedback.
•The final  interview  guide  may  be slightly  refined  based  on relevant  feedback  after  the first
two participants  complete  their  interviews .
Data Analysis  
•Transcripts  of audio  recordings  and accompanying  field  notes  will be analyzed  in a
qualitative  software  program  (i.e.,  NVivo).
•Inductive  thematic  coding  will be completed  by the Investigators  with  support  from  CESR
and other  stakeholders , if possible.
•Emerging  codes  and themes  will be organized  and synthesized  to draw  data  interpretation.
•A detailed  code  book  and audit  trail will be kept  to increase  reproducibility,  trustworthiness
and rigor,  and to avoid  issues  of transferability.

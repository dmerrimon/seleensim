Title of study:  Characteristics and Treatment Patterns of Patients with Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Initiating Tiotro pium+Olodaterol or Other 
Maintenance Therapies in the US and the UK: A Retrospective Claims 
Database Study  
Rationale and 
background:  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease 
characterized by airway obstruction confirmed by spirometry, often including 
small airway obstruction and emphysema.  
For patients who are diagnosed with COPD, maintenance treatmen ts often 
include bronchodilators, primarily long -acting muscarinic antagonists 
(LAMA), long -acting beta agonists (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroids 
(ICS) alone or in combination with each other and corticosteroids. 
Sp(t)iolto ® Respimat ®, a LAMA+LABA combi nation, was approved in May 
21, 2015 in the US and July 1, 2015 in the EU (marketed as Stiolto in the US 
and Spiolto in the EU, referred  to here as Tio+Olo ).  
Selective prescribing according to patient characteristics, known as 
channeling, can lead to bias  in comparative studies where drugs with similar 
therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic 
differences. Claimed advantages of a new drug may be distorted if they are 
channeled  to patients with special pre -existing morbidi ty, with the 
consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the 
drug. Therefore, it is important to identify clinical and socio -demographic 
characteristics of patients who initiate each treatment as opposed to other 
available maint enance treatments in COPD patients.  
Research question 
and objectives:  The primary objectives of the study are to use US and UK data to describe the 
characteristics of COPD patients according to various demographic, lifestyle, 
clinical, and medication use at the following times:  
● Date of COPD claim confirming diagnosis  (at any time) . 
● Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapies as first 
maintenance therapy  (after date of Spiolto launch) . 
● Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapies as 
second maintenance therapy  (after date of Spiolto launch) .

The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:  
 
● To estimate the time between the following events among COPD 
patients, overal l and stratified by maintenance therapy type:  
○ COPD claim confirming diagnosis and first maintenance 
therapy.  
○ COPD claim confirming diagnosis and second maintenance 
therapy.  
○ First and second maintenance therapy  in patients receiving 
second maintenance therapy . 
● To estimate the number of COPD exacerbations overall and stratified 
by maintenance therapy type during the year prior to the following:  
○ Date of first maintenance therapy.  
○ Date of second maintenance therapy . 
● To describe COPD patients at the time of COPD claim confirming 
diagnosis according to various demographic, lifestyle, clinical, and 
medication use, stratified by calendar year.  
● To describe the characteristics of COPD patients stratified by therapy 
catego ry at the following times:  
○ Date of COPD claim confirming diagnosis . 
○ Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapies as 
first maintenance therapy.  
○ Date of initiation of Tio+Olo or other maintenance therapies as 
second maintenance therapy.  
● To estimate the proportion of patients who used each combination of 
therapy class at first vs. second maintenance therapy  
Study design:  Retrospective cohort study using previously collected administrative 
healthcare data.   
Population:  COPD (“Parent”) Cohort:  
The study population for the analysis will consist of all patients with at least 
one medical claim with a diagnosis code of COPD identified (ICD -9-CM 
code 491.*, 492.*, 496.*, ICD-10-CM J41.*, J43.*, J44.*, or the appropriate 
READ codes ) between  date of first availability of Tio+Olo (launch date May 
21, 2015  in the United States  and July 1, 2015 in the UK)  and last date of 
available data  (March 31, 2017  for MarketScan and June 6, 2018  for CPRD) .

 RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND  
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease characterized by airway 
obstruction confirmed by spirometry, often including small airway obstruction and 
emphysema (Barnes 2015). Patients may experience exacerbations, defined as acute onset, 
short but sustained worsening of patient’s condition beyond normal levels. Exacerbations 
often lead to hospitalization and/or change in medication, as they negatively impact long -
term health outcomes (Pavord 2016). As thma COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) is another 
complication that consists of concurrent COPD and asthma. Most studies have reported that 
patients with ACOS have worse prognosis than patients with only COPD in terms of more 
frequent and severe exacerbations, worsened symptoms, and decreased quality of life (Barnes 
2016). Scant information exists on appropriate therapy for ACOS, because these patients are 
often excluded from clinical trials of asthma or COPD (Barnes 2016).  
No known medications can reverse COPD,  but use of rescue medications in the form of short 
acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA), short acting beta agonists (SABA), and also regular 
maintenance treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. The Global 
Initiative for Chronic Obs tructive Disease (GOLD 2017) recommends classifying patients for 
treatment based on assessment of existing symptoms and history of exacerbations. For 
patients who are diagnosed with COPD, maintenance treatments often include 
bronchodilators, primarily long -acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long -acting beta 
agonists (LABA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) alone or in combination with each other 
and corticosteroids. Sp(t)iolto ® Respimat ®, a LAMA+LABA combination, was approved in 
May 21, 2015 in the US a nd July 1, 2015 in the EU (marketed as Stiolto in the US and 
Spiolto in the EU, referred  to here as Sp(t)iolto). Currently the product is sold in 46 countries, 
including the UK and most of the EU countries, US, Japan, Canada and several other 1st wave 
coun tries. Respimat is a device that aerates the Tio+Olo  drug into a mist that may be more 
effective in reaching the lungs. Compared with LAMA or LABA alone, LAMA+LABA has 
demonstrated improved lung function, patient -reported outcomes, and quality of life 
meas ures in clinical trials (Calzetta 2017). Furthermore, the classic side effects of weight 
gain, osteoporosis, and community -acquired pneumonia associated with ICS use do not 
appear to be as severe for LAMA+LABA use (Tariq 2017).  
Selective prescribing accord ing to patient characteristics, known as channeling , can lead to  
allocation bias  in comparative studies , where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are 
prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences (Petri 1991). Claimed advantages 
of a new drug may be distorted if they are channeled  to patients with special pre -existing 
morbidity, with the consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the 
drug. Therefore, it is important to identify clinical and socio -demograph ic characteristics of 
patients who initiate each treatment as opposed to other available maintenance treatments in 
COPD patients.  
This study will allow us to evaluate patient characteristics by first and second  maintenance 
therapy  and to identify factors p otentially driving prescriptions to different patient 
populations in the US and UK.

 RESEARCH METHODS  
 STUDY DESIGN  
Market Scan: 
The proposed study is a non -interventional retrospective study based on existing data from 
the Truven Health Market Scan, a US claims database. Data from Jan 1, 2008  (earliest data 
available) to March 31, 2017 (latest data available)  will be used to characterize COPD 
patients who initiated first and/or second maintenance treatment in three different cross 
sections: at COPD claim confirming diagnosis date, at date of first maintenance therapy, and 
at date of second maintenance therapy.  Details of the study design are provided below.  
 
CPRD:  
The proposed study is a non -interventional retrospective study based on existing data from 
the CPRD, a UK -based administrative database. Data from November 21, 1987  (earliest data 
available) to June 30, 2018  (latest data available) will be used to characte rize COPD patients 
who initiated first and/or second maintenance treatment in three different cross sections: at 
COPD claim confirming diagnosis date, at date of first maintenance therapy, and at date of 
second maintenance therapy. Details of the study des ign are provided below.  
 
 SETTING  
 Definitions  
Study Period:  The period of time that includes the baseline, cohort entry date , and follow -up 
period for the study population. This period is the same for all patients.  
 
The study period will be from January 1, 2008  to March 31, 2017  in MarketScan and 
November 21, 1987  to June 30, 2018  in the CPRD, encompassing the date of earliest follow -
up availability  to the date of the latest follow -up availability.  
 
Patient Selection Period:  the period of time for which pat ients are eligible to enter the cohort. 
The earliest date of the patient selection period is January 1, 2009  for MarketScan and 
November 21, 1988 for CPRD, corresponding to  12 months after the date of first data 
availability to allow for a sufficient  enrollment and washout period.

2nd Treatment Index Date: Date of initiation of Tio+Olo  or other as second maintenance 
therapy.  
 
Baseline Period: The 365 -day period prior to the cohort entry date or treatment index date  
used to assess concomitant medication use and lifestyle variables . The baseline period will 
vary between patients depending on the se dates. 
 
Follow -Up Period: For patients who were diagnosed with COPD before May 21, 2015 
(MarketScan) or July 1, 2015 (CPRD), the follow -up period will be May 22, 2015 
(MarketScan) or July 2, 2015 (CPRD) to the earliest occurrence of death, disenrolment, or 
end of data. For patients diagnosed after those dates in their respective dataset, the follow -up 
period will be 1 day after their cohort entry date to the earliest occu rrence of death, 
disenrolment, or end of data. Occurrence of first and second maintenance treatment will be 
assessed during this period.  
 
For entry into the study population, patients will be required to have 365 days  of continuous 
enrolment  with both medical and pharmacy coverage , as well as no occurrence of COPD in 
the previous 365 days . The follow -up period will be used for capturing first and second 
maintenance therapies. This is illustrated in Figure 1 .

Three cohorts will be used to address the study objectives : 1) a parent cohort of COPD 
patients with no previous maintenance medication use; 2) a child cohort of first maintenance 
therapy users; 3) a grandchild cohort of second maintenance therapy users . All analyses will 
include patients who are aged 4 0 years or older on the cohort entry date , and who have at 
least 365 days  of continuous enrolment  before these dates . For the parent cohort, patients who 
had maintenance medication use in the 365 days  before index will be excluded (i.e. parent 
cohort will include only incident COPD cases ).

As the objective is to study the first and second prescription for maintenance therapy, patients 
receiving maintenance treatment  at study entry or up to 365 days  prior to study entry will be 
excluded. In order to ensure that the first prescriptions are captured, at least 1 year of 
continuous data available prior to COPD claim confirming diagnosis will be required. All 
patients must also be age 40 years or more on the date of COPD claim confirming diagnosis. 
The study timelines for this primary study population are depicted in Figures 1  and 2. 
9.2.2.2  Child Cohort for First Maintenance Therapy  
A child (i.e. nested) cohort wi ll be created consisted solely of individuals who ever initiated 
first maintenance therapy. The parent cohort is the population of COPD patients described 
above. The date of initiation of first maintenance therapy will be set as the index date, and the 
365-day period before index will be used to provide descriptive analyses and number of 
COPD exacerbations.  Importantly, the date of initiation of first maintenance therapy 
must occur on or after May 21, 2015 (MarketScan) or July  1, 2015 (CPRD), the Spiolto 
approval  date. 
 
For entry into this child cohort, patients will be required to have 365 days  of continuous 
insurance enrolment  with both medical and pharmacy coverage  prior to initiation of the 
maintenance therapy . Data in this baseline period will be used t o provide descriptive statistics 
and number of COPD exacerbations. This is illustrated in Figure 3 .

9.2.2.3  Grandchild Cohort for Second Maintenance Therapy  
A grandchild cohort will be created consisted solely of individuals who ever initiated second 
maintenance therapy. The grandchild co hort will be nested within  the child cohort described 
above consisting of patients who ever initiated first maintenance therapy and had COPD 
diagnosis. The date of initiation of second maintenance therapy will be set as the index date, 
and the 365-day period before index will be used to provide descriptive analyses, number of 
COPD exacerbations, and proportion of patients who used each combination of therapy 
category at first vs. second maintenance.  
 
For entry into this child cohort, patients will be requir ed to have 365 days  of continuous 
insurance enrolment with both medical and pharmacy coverage. This is illustrated in Figure 
4. Note that the study period and patient identification periods are shifted forward by 3 1 days 
compared t o the child cohort because the shortest possible time between initiation of first and 
initiation of second maintenance therapy is 3 1 days by definition  (30 days of use of previous 
therapy + 1 day) .

 VARIABLES  
 Exposures  
Specific drug class definitions are defined herein.  A list of drug definitions, formulations, and 
brands is provided in Annex 5 . 
 
Mutually exclusive maintenance therapy categories:  
Monotherapy  
• LAMA  
• LABA  
• ICS 
Dual Therapy  
• Tio+Olo (LAMA + LABA)  
• LAMA + LABA that is not Tio+Olo  
• LAMA + ICS  
• LABA + ICS 
• SAMA + SABA  
Triple Therapy  
• Tio+Olo + ICS  
• LAMA + LABA + ICS  
 
The two medication -related outcomes in this non -interventional study are as follows:  
1. First maintenance therapy is defined as first occurrence of any of the categories listed 
above after cohort entry date.  
2. Second maintenance therapy is defined as any subsequent maintenance therapy 
category that differs from the first maintenance therapy category. The earliest date of 
initiation of second maintenance therapy is 30 days after date of initiat ion of first 
maintenance therapy.  
 
Classification of individuals to different therapy categories will be based on the continuous 
use of a single drug  (defined by the supply of the drug  over the number of treatment days ) for 
at least 30 days (monotherapy), a combination therapy for at least 30 days (dual therapy), an 
overlap of two different mono -formulations (e.g. LAMA overlapping with LABA) for at least 
30 days (dual therapy), or different combination formulations and mono -formulations 
together for at leas t 30 days (triple therapy). We will employ a 14 -day allowable gap for 
continuous drug use to account for possible under -dosing of maintenance therapies 
(analogous to splitting pills) and skipping or forgetting to take doses. The specific definitions 
for th erapy classification are detailed below.

Monotherapy  is defined as at least 30 days of continuous drug use (with a 14 -day allowable 
gap), without use of either of the other two drug classes during that 30 -day period. For 
illustrations of three possible cas es that would be classified as monotherapy, see Figure 5 
below.  
 
Figure 5. Three possible monotherapy scenarios.  
 
 
 
Dual therapy  is defined as:  
• At least 30 days of overlap of continuous drug use of separate prescriptions for two 
drug classes, OR  
• At leas t 30 days of continuous drug use of a fixed -dose combination formulations.  
• In both cases, there is a 14 -day allowable gap between individual drug fills.  
 
For illustrations of three possible cases that would be classified as dual therapy, see Figure 6  
below.

• At least 30 days of overlap of continuous drug use of separate prescriptions for three 
drug classes , OR  
• At least 30 days of overlap of a dual fixed -dose combination formulations paired with 
a mono -formulation for the third drug class, OR  
• At least 30 days of continuous drug use of a triple fixed -dose combination 
formulations.

9.3.2.2  Secondary outcomes  
We will also examine two clinical outcomes over follow -up among individuals among 
individuals who had first and/or second maintenance therapy:  
• Exacerbations in the year prior to the start of first maintenance therapy.  
• Exacerbations in the year prior to the start of second maintenance therapy (if 
available).  
 
For Market Scan, there are specific ICD -10 codes to identify e xacerbations, but no ICD -9 
code. COPD exacerbation s will be defined as any of the following:  
• An acute COPD exacerbation diagnosis (ICD -10 J44.0, J44.1);  
• A claim for an antibiotic or a corticosteroids on the same day or within 7 days 
following an outpatient COPD diagnosis;  
• An inpatient diagnosis of COPD in any position;  
• A hospitalization due to respiratory condition;  
• An emergency department visit with a COPD diagnosis in any position ; 
• Lower respiratory tract infection diagnosis (ICD -9 466, ICD -10 J20.9, J21.0, J21.8, 
J22) (Rothnie 2016);  
 
For CPRD , COPD exacerbations will be defined as any of the following:  
• An acute COPD exacerbation diagnosis  or respiratory failure  (READ code 
“H312200”, “8BP8.00”, “H3y1.00”, “H590.00”, “H59..00”, “R2y1.00”, “R2y1z00” );  
• A lower respiratory tract infection diagnosis ( READ code “H060.00”, “H060.11”, 
“H060300”, “H060500”, “H060w00”, “H060x00”, “H060z00”, “H062.00”,

“Hyu0B00”, “Hyu0H00”, “Hyu1.00” );  
• Antibiotic or oral corticosteroids prescription on the same or within 7 days following 
a COPD diagnosis (Chalmers 2018).  
 
Exacerbations occurring within 14 days of one another will be  consi dered a single event.  
 
The mean (SD) and median (IQR) number of COPD exacerbations will be reported. 
Categories of COPD exacerbations will also be reported as: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+ exacerbations.

 Covariates  
Patient characteris tics will be identified based on data recorded within one year prior to or on 
the index date (date of dispensing/initiation of the exposure), unless otherwise specified. If

 DATA SOURCES  
The proposed study will utilize data from two separate data sources: the Truven Market Scan 
data (US) and The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) (UK).  
 
MarketScan  
The Truven MarketScan databases capture longitudinal, individual -level administrative  
claims data from the United States. The data available for study included three components of 
MarketScan: the Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) Database, the Medicare 
Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database (MDCR), and the Medicaid Databa se. 
Patients in the databases are  active employees, dependents, retirees, COBRA recipients, and 
Medicare or Medicaid enrollees . Data were drawn from large employers, health plans, and 
public organizations in the United States. The following tables of the M arketScan databases 
were available for analysis: Enrolment Detail, Inpatient Admissions, Inpatient Services, 
Outpatient Services, Outpatient Pharmaceutical Claims, and Long Term Care. These tables 
provide information on plan enrolment, healthcare utilizati on and expenditures, 
demographics, and integrated records for inpatient events, outpatient events, and pharmacy 
dispensings. Data were available from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2017, and represent 
approximately 155.8 million patients.  
 
CPRD  
Clinical Prac tice Research Datalink (CPRD) is based on standardized electronic medical 
records (EMR) systems in primary care practices in the United Kingdom (UK). This database 
represents over 700 contributing general practices in the UK, and includes approximately 
17.8 million patients. The geographical distribution of the practices has been shown to be 
representative of the UK population, and age and sex distributions of patients in the databases 
are similar to those reported by the national population census (Walley 1997). Participating 
general practitioners have been trained to record medical information, including demographic

data, medical diagnoses, procedures, and deaths using a standardized form (Garcia Rodriguez 
1998). The EMR system records conditions, interven tions and diagnostics using READ codes 
and medication prescribing is recorded using the British National Formulary (BNF). The 
EMR system records the prescribing of medications, including over -the-counter medications, 
but it does not verify whether patients  fill the medications at the pharmacy. The system 
records laboratory test results and lifestyle measures like smoking, alcohol use, and body 
mass index with varying degrees of completeness. The database is limited to recordings by 
the primary care physicia n including the transferred notes from specialists and some 
information on hospitalization. Linkage to other datasets is possible, including the Hospital 
Episodes Statistics (HES), which is a data warehouse containing records of all patients 
admitted to NH S hospitals in England (Walley 1997). In the current study, event dates 
spanned from November 21, 1987 through June 30, 2018.  
 STUDY SIZE  
Among approximately 1,4 87,765 patients with COPD in MarketScan  who did not use 
maintenance therapy before May 21, 2015 , there were about 1,269  with at least 1 claim for 
Stiolto Respimat  in follow -up. 
Among approximately  98,537 patients with COPD in CPRD  who did not use maintenance 
therapy before July 1, 2015 , there are 332 with at least 1 claim for Spiolto Respimat  in 
follow-up.  
 DATA MANAGEMENT  
MarketScan  
The Truven Health MarketScan database is comprised of fully adjudicated and paid claims 
records of integrated longitudinal enrolment, inpatient, outpatient and drug data from 
multiple payers, that has been standardized and de -identified prior to use for the analysis. The 
statistical analysis will be conducted using the Aetion Evidence Platform.  
 
Drug Duration  
For MarketScan, unless otherwise noted, drug event duration was calculated from the “Days 
Supply” fi eld, and in cases where this field was 0, the duration was assumed to be 1 day.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data that occurs in covariates or descriptive variables will be classified as own 
category . In addition, a feasibility assessment before begi nning the analyses will be done, and 
variables with >75 % missing values will be excluded from all analyses, other than baseline 
characteristics. If a variable is left with only one category  other than missing, the variable 
will be excluded completely from  all analyses.  The percentage of patients with missing data 
for both categorical and continuous variables will be reported .

CPRD  
 
Drug Duration  
For CPRD, drug events' duration was calculated from the provided number of days field. In 
the case where this field was zero and a dosage identifier was present in the text field, the 
days supplied was determined from the quantity field and the numeric dai ly dose from the 
associated dosage metadata. In the case where this field was zero and no numeric daily dose 
could be determined, the default duration will be set to thirty days.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Missing data that occurs in covariates or descripti ve variables will be classified as its own 
level. In addition, a feasibility assessment before beginning the analyses will be done, and 
variables with >75 % missing values will be excluded from all analyses, other than baseline 
characteristics. If a variab le is left with only one level other than missing, the variable will be 
excluded completely from all analyses.  
 
For clinical variables (FEV 1/FVC, BMI ), distributions of observed values will be evaluated 
and clinically feasible ranges will be applied. Follo wing implementation of reasonable 
ranges, a final assessment of outliers will be tested visually using histograms to understand 
the distribution of these variables. Any potential effects of skewed distributions will be 
presented in results and revised appr oaches will be considered where necessary.  
 DATA ANALYSIS  
 Main analysis  
For all analyses, variables will be reported as follows:  
• Continuous variables (e.g., age) will be presented as means (with standard deviation , 
SD) and /or medians (with interquartile range , IQR ). 
• Categorical variables (e.g., sex) will be presented as absolute and relative frequencies.  
• All results will have two digits following the decimal point.

9.7.1.1  Descriptive Analysis  
• Descriptive Analysis at  Cohort Entry Date  
 
All variables specified in section 9 .3.3 will be reported. For demographic and lifestyle 
variables, the value recorded on the cohort entry date  will be reported, otherwise the most 
recent known value will be reported. Presenc e of concomitant medication use will be 
determined based whether they ever occurred within the 365-day baseline period preceding 
the cohort entry date. Presence of comorbidities will be determined based on whether they 
ever occurred within all data precedi ng cohort entry.  In CPRD, BMI, alcohol use, smoking 
status, and FEV1/FVC will be reported based on the last recorded value.  
 
• Descriptive Analysis at First Maintenance Therapy  
 
The chi ld cohort described in section 9 .2.2.2  will be used for this analysis.  
All variables specified in section 9 .3.3 will be reported. For demographic and lifestyle 
variables, the value recorded on the date of initiation of first maintenance therapy will be 
reported, otherwise the most recent known value will be reported. Presence of concomitant 
medication use will be determined based whether they ever occurred within the 365-day 
baseline period preceding the cohort entry date. Presence of comorbidities wi ll be determined 
based on whether they ever occurred within all data preceding date of initiation of first 
maintenance therapy.  In CPRD, BMI, alcohol use, smoking status, and FEV1/FVC will be 
reported based on the last recorded value.  
 
• Descriptive Analysis  at Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
The grandchi ld cohort described in section 9 .2.2.3  will be used for this analysis.  
All variables specified in section 9 .3.3 will be reported. For demographic and lifestyle 
variables, the value recorded on the date of initiation of second maintenance therapy will be 
reported, otherwise the most recent known value will be reported. Presence of concomitant 
medication use will be determined based whether they ever occurred within the 365-day 
baselin e period preceding the cohort entry date. Presence of comorbidities will be determined 
based on whether they ever occurred within all data preceding date of initiation of second 
maintenance therapy.  In CPRD, BMI, alcohol use, smoking status, and FEV1/FVC w ill be 
reported based on the last recorded value.

• Treatment Patterns at First vs. Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
The grandchi ld cohort described in section 9 .2.2.3  will be used for this analysis.  
A table will be constructed cros s tabulating proportions of patients using a specific 
medication class at first maintenance vs. a specific medication class at second maintenance. 
We will present two proportions, a conditional and a marginal proportion: 1) For the 
conditional proportion, the numerator will be the number of patients who used that specific 
combination, and the denominator will include all patients who used the first maintenance 
drug for that combination. Using arbitrary values as an example, if the number of patients 
who swi tched from LABA → LAMA was 400 and the number of patients who used LABA 
as first maintenance therapy was 1000, then the condit ional proportion would be: 400  / 1000 
= 0.4; 2) For the marginal proportion, the numerator will be the number of patients who used  
the specific combination, and the denominator will include all patients in the grandchild 
cohort. Using arbitrary values as an example, if the number of patients who switched from 
LABA → LAMA was 400 and all patients who used any second maintenance therap y was 
5,000, then the marginal proportion would be: 400 / 5000 = 0.08.  
Sankey plots will also be generated to visually illustrate the flow of patients from first to 
second maintenance therapy according to therapy category.  
9.7.1.2  Time to Initiation of Therapy  
• Time Between  Cohort Entry Date  and First Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with first maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time (days) 
between index date and first maintenance therapy will be reported in tabular form .  
 
• Time Betwee n Cohort Entry Date  and Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with second maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time 
(days) between cohort entry date and second maintenance therapy will be reported in tabular 
form.  
 
• Time Between First and Second Maintenance Therapy  
 
Among patients with second maintenance therapy, the mean (SD) and median (IQR) time 
(days) between date of initiation of first to the date  of initiation of second maintenance 
therapy will be reported in tabular form.

 QUALITY CONTROL  
Aetion will build measures for cohort inclusion, outcomes and covariates. Some of the 
measure algorithms will be based on those collaboratively developed for another respira tory-
related protocol with clinical input from external pulmonology expert. When available, 
algorithms that have been validated in administrative databases will be used. When validated 
algorithms are not available, coding criteria will be based on clinical  input and through 
searches of medical claim coding systems.  
 
All measures created, cohorts developed, statistical analyses implemented, and tables 
completed will undergo quality control review by at least 1 additional analyst or scientist 
under the superv ision of the senior scientist.  
 
This protocol will be strictly followed in the study. All changes to this protocol will be 
documented in protocol amendments.  
 
The study protocol has been written following the Code of Conduct by the European Network 
of Cent res for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance (ENCePP) [R15 -4870] that 
provides a set of rules and principles for post -authorisation studies with regard to the best 
practices and transparency, thereby promoting scientific independence of such studies.  The 
study will be registered to the ENCePP’s E -register and the results will also be published on 
the same site.  
 
The study protocol also follows the key elements of the Guideline for Good 
Pharmacoepidemiology Practices (GPP) by International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology 
[R11 -4318], and the recent draft Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff “Best Practices for 
Conducting and Reporting Pharmacoepidemiologic Safety Studies Using Electronic 
Healthcare Data Sets” [R15 -4859].  
 
Quality controls include checks for the validity and logical content of codes and checks for 
missing values and variables. In order to control for potential inconsistencies and errors, all 
variables will be tabulated. In addition, the distribution of each variable will be examined. 
Extre me observations with values larger than ± 3 standard deviations (SD) will be examined 
as potential outliers and consequently excluded from the dataset.  
 LIMITATIONS OF THE RESEARCH METHODS  
MarketScan  
This study will be conducted using data from insurance claims and is subject to certain 
limitations. One limitation is that these are based on a large, non -random convenience 
sample, which may contain biases or lack generalizability to other populations. D ata also 
come mostly from large employers, and although the database also includes a large amount of 
data from health plans, data from medium and small firms may be underrepresented.

Additionally, the MarketScan database also poses some limitations inheren t to administrative 
claims data. Electronic outpatient pharmacy dispensing records are considered accurate 
because pharmacists fill prescriptions with little room for interpretation and  are reimbursed 
by insurers on the basis of detailed, complete, and acc urate claims submitted electronically 
(Stergachi 1988, Levy 2003). Pharmacy dispensing information is usually seen as the gold 
standard of drug exposure information compared to self -reported information (West 1995) or 
prescribing records in outpatient medi cal records (West 1994). However, drugs used during 
hospital stays are not recorded in this data source. Finally, while the EMR system records the 
prescribing of medications, including over -the-counter medications, it does not verify 
whether patients fill the medications at the pharmacy, and up to 50% of prescriptions are 
never filled (Fischer 2010). Further, these prescriptions do not ensure that medications were 
taken as prescribed, and any medications filled over -the-counter or provided as samples by 
the physician will not be observed in the claims data. Finally, patients are required not to 
have used any maintenance medications in the year before COPD claim confirming 
diagnosis, but use of these medications may have occurred beyond one year.  
 
CPRD  
This study will be conducted using data from electronic medical records, which is subject to 
certain limitations. While the electronic medical records from CPRD strive for high quality 
data, this relies upon correct entry of the data by health practitioner s. Therefore, it is possible 
that there may be missing values where data has not been recorded, or values which have 
been recorded incorrectly. This may affect the data we have on patient demographics and 
comorbidities, and the factors we are interested in  investigating which may influence the 
choice of therapy.  
Finally, prescription data is likely to be entered correctly as the electronic system requires 
that the data is input in order to generate a patient prescription. These prescriptions do not 
ensure t hat medications were taken as prescribed, and any medications filled over -the-counter 
or provided as samples by the physician will not be observed in the claims data. Finally, 
patients are required not to have used any maintenance medications in the year b efore COPD  
claim confirming  diagnosis, but use of these medications may have occurred beyond one 
year.

 Controls  
Not applicable.  
 BIAS 
The population -based nature of the CPRD will avoid selection bias and ensure external 
validity. However, the validity of research based on any automated database depends on the 
quality and completeness of data recorded. The CPRD carries out a series of ongoing  checks 
to ensure quality of the data; this comprises assessment of both patient data (age, gender, 
registration details and event dates) and the completeness, continuity and plausibility of 
electronic data recording in key areas at the practice level (for  example, ensuring a minimum 
specified percentage of deaths have cause of death recorded, a minimum referral rate per 100 
patients, and a minimum number of prescriptions per patient per month) (Herrett 2015). 
Prescription data in the CPRD are known to be w ell documented as the prescriptions are 
automatically recorded in the database. The therapy file is therefore considered complete, 
except for prescriptions issued in secondary care and for drugs that are purchased over the 
counter (Herrett 2015). Validity of the diagnoses has been assessed in numerous validation 
studies.  However, because this database is limited to general practice, specialist care and 
hospitalization events may not be captured.  
In principle, in the US when a patient goes to a pharmacy and gets a drug dispensed, the 
pharmacy bills the insurance carr ier for the cost of that drug. Electronic outpatient pharmacy 
dispensing records are considered accurate because pharmacists fill prescriptions with little 
room for interpretation, and are reimbur sed by insurers on the basis of detailed, complete, and 
accurate claims submitted electronically (Levy 2013, Stergachis 1988). Pharmacy dispensing 
information is usually seen as the gold standard of drug exposure information compared to 
self-reported infor mation or prescribing records in outpatient medical records. Yet, the 
obvious limitation in these data is that drugs purchased  out of pocket will not result in a 
pharmacy claim.  
To minimize misclassification of the recorded patient characteristics, previou sly validated 
algorithms or code lists will be used whenever available. Code lists will be reviewed by the 
qualified medical reviewers prior to implementation. Basic plausibility checks will be 
implemented for continuous variables (e.g. BMI, patient age et c.). 
 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
The final study CPRD protocol will be submitted for approval to the Independent Scientific 
Advisory Committee (ISAC) (http://www.cprd.com/ISAC).  
 The CPRD has obtained ethical approval from a Multicentre Research Ethics Co mmittee 
(MREC) for all observational research using CPRD data without patient involvement; 
however, ISAC may recommend that the MREC review the study documentation if any 
ethical issues arise.

 MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS/ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Data is anonymized and extracted, analyzed, validated and reported in aggregate.  
There is no potential that any employee of BI or agent working on behalf of BI will access 
individual patient data in which the patient may be identified during data compilati on, data 
reporting or data analysis.  
Based on current guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology [R11 
4318] and the EMA [R13 -1970], non -interventional studies such as the one described in this 
protocol, conducted using health care r ecords, do not require expedited reporting of suspected 
adverse events/reactions. Specifically, as stated in section VI.C.1.2.1 of Guideline on Good 
Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP), Module VI – Management and Reporting of Adverse 
Reactions to Medicinal P roducts, for non -interventional study designs, which are based on 
use of secondary data, reporting of adverse reactions is not required.  
 
 PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING 
STUDY RESULTS  
The results of the study will primarily serve internal decisio n making for future studies on 
comparative effectiveness. These baseline results will be published as an abstract and/or 
manuscript. Conference and Journal to be decided.

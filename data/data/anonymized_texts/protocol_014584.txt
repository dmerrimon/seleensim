Summary  A prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial is proposed to compare the outcome 
of primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty using the Stryker ReUnion system with 
implantation of either a 40 mm glenosphere or a 36 mm glenosphere, both with  either  
a +2 mm  or a +6 mm  offset. The Stryker ReUnion is a shoulder arthroplasty system 
approved by the FDA.  
 Each shoulder will be assessed preoperatively, at 3 weeks, 3 months, one year  and 
two years. The primary end -point will be range of motion at one year. Additional end -
points will include dislocation, stress fractures of the acromion, metal ion levels in 
peripheral blood, neurovascular complications, radiographic notching, implant 
mechanical failure and revision surgery.  
 Introduction  
 Reverse shoulder arthroplasty has emerged as a very successful procedure for selected patients with severe degeneration of the glenohumeral joint and a deficient rotator cuff. All reverse systems incorporate various degrees of modularity to adapt 
size, length and other biomechanical parameters to each specific individual. One such 
parameter is the size of the glenosphere. Smaller glenospheres are easier to implant and seem to provide a good outcome with many reverse systems. Theoretically, a larger glenosph ere could provide larger arcs of motion, decrease notching and 
increase soft- tissue tension. However, the effect of glenosphere size on motion and 
complications is largely unknown; to date, no study has specifically analyzed clinically the effect of sphere size on reverse outcome.  Modularity with use of multiple metal trunions  and Morse tapers also creates 
concerns regarding metal ions in peripheral blood, a problem well identified in the 
field of total hip arthroplasty.

Purpose  
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the outcome of primary reverse shoulder 
arthroplasty using the Stryker ReUnion system with implantation of either a large (40 mm) or a small (36 mm) glenosphere, both with either a +2 mm  or a +6 mm of lateral 
offset.  
 Materials and Methods  
 Study design  
 This will be a prospective, randomized, blind clinical trial. P hysician’s assistants will 
supervise the running of the study and evaluate all patients. Randomization will be provided through a password -protected computer program developed by Mayo 
Clinic Division of Biostatistics personnel and communicated to  the surgical team for 
listing. Physician assistants will be blinded regarding glenosphere size at the time of 
follow -up evaluations.  
 The indications and contraindication as outlined in Stryker’s labelling will be strictly 
followed. Off -label use of the device is prohibited.

irreparable rotator cuff tear (MRCT) or osteoarthritis (OA) with marked 
posterior subluxation or bone loss

 Randomization  
 
Version 2 .0  November 17, 2016  
In order to assign patients to specific treatment groups in an unbiased manner, 
randomization will occur prior to surgery.  
  
After the patient has met the inclusion criteria and given full informed consent, 
he/she will be assigned to the treatment group. The randomization will be stratified 
by variables with potential confounding effects on the outcomes of interest. Specifically, patients will be stratified by gender (male/female) , age group ( 50-65/ 66 
– 80 / 81+) and underlying diagnosis. Within each stratum, subjects will be assigned 
to one of the two treatment groups using a computerized dynamic allocation program as mentioned  before.  
 
Sample size  
The target sample size was estimated using shoulder range of motion as the primary 
outcome, and a 15° between- group difference as being a clinically meaningful 
difference.  In a recent study of a cohort of patients undergoing primary RSA, Steen 
et al (Steen, JSES, 2015) reported the following means and standard deviations of 
postoperative shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation: 153.3 ± 32.7, 140.4 ± 37.4, and 47.1 ± 38.9, respectively.  If similar variability is observed in the proposed study, a  sample of 100 subjects in each of the two groups (200 total) will 
provide 80% power to detect a difference of at least 13.1° in shoulder flexion, 14.9° 
in abduction, and 15.5° in external rotation as being statistically significant (alpha = 
0.05, two -side d).  In order to protect against a potential subject attrition rate of up 
to 10% due to drop out or loss to follow -up, the target sample size of 100 in each of 
the two main groups (36mm glenosphere and 40 mm glenos phere) will be 
increased to 110 per group (220) total. Although the primary comparisons will be between the 36mm and 40mm study groups, subjects will be enrolled and randomized such that within each group, half of the subjects will have a +2mm offset, and half will have a +6mm offset.  Thus there will be 55 subjects with a 36 + 
2mm glenosphere, 55 subjects with a 36 + 6mm glenosphere, 55 subjects with a 40 
+ 2mm glenosphere, and 55 subjects with a 40 + 6 mm glenosphere.     
 
Surgical technique 
 All procedures will be performed by two shoulder arthroplasty surgeons: Drs. Mark 
Morrey MD and Joaquin Sanchez -Sotelo MD PhD. The surgeons will implant the 
prosthesis according to the standard surgical technique for this particular implant 
system. A biceps tenotomy and tenodesis will be performed in all patients. The 
subscapularis tendon will be repaired at the end of the procedure when possible. Patients will receive one preoperative do se and two postoperative doses of IV 
antibiotics separated by a 6 -8 hour period. All patients will receive an interscalenic 
brachial plexus block for pain control unless medically contraindicated.  A shoulder 
immobilizer will be placed in the operating room once the procedure is completed and used for three weeks.  
 
Version 2 .0  November 17, 2016  
Hospitalization  
 
Patients will be admitted to the hospital o n the day of their surgery, unless medical 
problems dictate earlier admission. Hospitalization of 1 day is routine for these patients, although uncontrolled pain or medical complications could lead to a more prolonged admission .  
 
Physical therapy  
 
Both treatment groups will undergo the same program of postoperative care and physical therapy. A shoulder immobilizer will be used for three weeks. Active and 
active- assisted motion exercises for the elbow, wrist and hand will be initiated on day 
1. Shoulder active- assisted motion exercises will be initiated at week 3. Isometrics 
will be added at week 6. Therabands will be added at week 8.

Gender and Racial/Ethnic Distribution  
 No gender or racial/ethnic group will be intentionally excluded from this study.  
 Risks  
 Participation in this study, involving FDA -approved devices, poses no increased risk 
to patients undergoing reverse total shoulder arthroplasty surgery. Risk and complications of this procedure include infection, nerve injury, bleeding, blood clots, persistent pain, persistent stiffness, loosening, wear, osteolysis and other forms of mechanical failure.  
 Anal
ysis  and Intended Publications  
 The primary outcome will be shoulder range of motion in elevation, external rotation, 
and internal rotation at 1 year post surgery.  Additional outcomes will include 
strength, pain, speed test, Oxford Shoulder Score, ASES score, Quick -DASH score, and 
patient satisfaction.  The analysis will focus on comparing the subjects randomized to the small glenosphere to the patients randomized to the large glenosphere, at 1 year. 
Additional comparisons will be performed to evaluate data collected at the 3 -month, 
2-year, and 5 -year time points.  Variables comprised of discrete data will be analyzed 
using chi -square tests or Fisher’s exact tests (if low expected cell counts are 
observed).  Continuous variables will be analyzed using two -sample t -tests or 
Wilcoxon rank s um tests, if necessary and appropriate.  Two -factor models may be 
used to analyze the effect of study group and time since surgery simultaneously, 
including the evaluation of potential interactions between these two factors.  Modeling tools may include ANOVA, logistic regression, or generalized linear models, as appropriate based on examination of the data distribution and structure.  
Furthermore, separate analyses may be undertaken on specific patient subsets, 
Version 2 .0  November 17, 2016  
including those with a primary diagnosis of OA, CTA, or MRTC.  Other possible 
analyses may involve metal ion levels following RSA, correlation of sarcomere length (as measured with ultrasound elastography) with radiographic parameters, biceps 
symptoms, and screw location and length.  All statistical tests will be two -sided and 
p-values less than 0.05 will be considered significant.

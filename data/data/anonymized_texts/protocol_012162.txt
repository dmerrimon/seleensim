SECTION 3.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  
 41 
1) Background  42 
During the past decade, over 2 million  U.S. military personnel have deployed  on potentially dangerous 43 
missions in support of the wars in  Iraq and Afghanistan [1].  Combat duty is inherently hazardous and 44 
many deployed Soldiers have experienced intense and personally life -threatening situations or witnessed 45 
horrific and traumatic events .  The neuroendocrine stress response that is associated with these types of 46 
potentially life -threatening experiences prepares the brain and body for survival.  As part of this survival 47 
response, several brain systems become hyper -responsive and sensitized to potential threat.  In particular, 48 
exaggerated  amygdala responses during stre ssful experiences enhance the  encoding of vivid and indelible 49 
emotional memories [2, 3].  For some  combat veterans, the intensity and horrific nature of these 50 
experiences is perceived as so overwhelming that they continue to have sustained physiological arousal, 51 
heightened startle reflexes, and uncontrollable intrusive memories and nightmares that pers ist for years or 52 
even decades after  the traumatic experience.  If these symptoms are sustained  and lead  to impairments in 53 
daily functioning, the service  member may be diagnosed with  post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  54 
Initial rates of PTSD in Soldiers returning from combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan were reported to be 55 
as high as 17% [4], and subsequent reports have confirmed rates as high as 20% [5], depending on the 56 
method of assessment.  Furthermore, PTSD often presents as a comorbid disorder with a range of other 57

psychiatric and/or somatic problems [6-8].  Treatment for PTSD usually involves  some combination of 58 
cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, and pharmacotherapy.  Unfortunately, current therapeutic 59 
interventions show variable efficacy and frequent treatment failures [9, 10].  Consequently, alternative 60 
approaches or augmen tations to existing treatments are needed.   61 
 62 
Sleep disruption in PTSD  63 
Sleep disruption has been labeled the “hallmark of PTSD .”  In fact, sleep problems appear to be the most 64 
prevalent complaint of individuals with PTSD  [11], and may contribute significantly to the persistence 65 
and s everity of the disorder [12-14].  A recent meta -analysis confirmed the presence of sleep 66 
abnormalities in patients with PTSD, including excessive  stage 1 sleep, reduced slow wave sleep, and 67 
elevated rapid -eye-movement density, when compared to unaffected individuals [15].  Over two -thirds of 68 
combat veterans with PTSD endorse problems with sleep, p articularly insomnia and nightmares [13, 16, 69 
17], with rates of self-reported sleep c omplaints exceeding 90% in some studies [18].  Neylan and 70 
collea gues (1998) found that initial insomnia (difficulty falling asleep) occurred in 44% of combat 71 
veterans with PTSD, 6% of veterans without PTSD and 5% of healthy comparison subjects.  Moreover, 72 
91% of veterans with PTSD reported difficulties maintaining slee p (i.e., staying asleep after initial sleep 73 
onset)  [19].  In another stu dy, early morning awakening  was reported by 43% of individuals with PTSD 74 
compared to 13% of individuals without PTSD [20].  Nightmares leading to awakening  have been 75 
reported to occur frequently in about 50% of comba t veterans with PTSD, compared to only 5% of 76 
veterans without PTSD and 3% of healthy controls [19].  Moreover, the severity of sleep disturbance 77 
correlates with overall PTSD symptom severity [21, 22], even when accounting for the effects of 78 
potentially confounding variables such as alcohol use and psychiatric comorbidity [23].  Recent findings 79 
suggest that insomnia and sleep problems may actually play a mediating role between combat stressors 80 
and the eventual development of psychological symptoms among veterans of the war in Iraq [24].  81 
Soldiers who develop insomnia  in the months following a combat deployment are more likely to show 82 
symptoms of PTSD and depression when re -assessed at one year post -deployment [25], and sleep 83 
problems are better predictors of suicide among military personnel than measures of either depression or 84 
hopelessness [26].  Thus, sleep may be a leverage point for affecting recovery from PTSD.  85 
Research on conditioned fear point s to a critical role for sleep in the treatment of PTSD.  Indeed, 86 
PTSD has been conceptualized as a disorder of fear conditioning, involving hyper -responsive fear 87 
reactions via sustained and exaggerated amygdala activation [27].  There is a large animal liter ature 88 
showing that quality sleep facilitates the extinction of conditioned fear [28-31].  Moreover, Pace -Schott 89 
and colleagues, recently demonstrated the same effect in humans [32], showing  that after a person has 90 
been conditioned to fear a particular stimulus and then  provided with multiple extinction trials, the 91 
extinction response only generalizes to other simil ar stimuli following a night of undi sturbed sleep, but 92 
fails to generalize to other similar stimuli if post -learning sleep is prevented.  These results suggest that 93 
extinction of conditioned fear is facilitated by sleep.  Other research shows that sleep disruption amplifies 94 
the effects of an xiety on anticipatory brain functioning in the amygdala [33].  By extension, the potential 95 
for rapid recovery from PTSD may be hampered by the inability to obtain normal restor ative sleep.  In 96 
other words, the PTSD patient may be locked in a vicious c ircle whereby one of the major symptoms of 97 
the disorder may itself be preventing full recovery and leading to continuation or even exacerbation of 98 
symptoms.  Therefore, effective tr eatment and recovery from PTSD may be crucially dependent upon, or 99

individual’s sleep.  101 
 102 
Light Therapy for Sleep Disruption & Implications for PTSD  103 
The most common approaches to sleep disturbance involve short -term prescription hypnotic 104 
medications, but these can have negative or even dangerous side effects [34].  Therefore, alternative, non - 105 
pharmacologic approaches are needed.  While psychological or behavioral treatments may be helpful, 106 
many service  members perceive stigma associated with traditional talk -therapy approaches.  An 107 
alternative  non-pharmacologic approach that shows promise for treating sleep disruption is bright light 108 
therapy (BLT), particularly within the short -wave length (i.e., blue) spectrum [35-40].  Exposure to bright 109 
light at certain times of the day has been shown to r eset the timing of the sleep and wake cycle  [41], 110 
enhance subjective and objective measures of alertness  [42, 43], increase prefrontal brain activation  [44], 111 
and to improve overall sleep quality  [43].  The effectiveness of BLT is potentially  mediated by the 112 
entrainment of circadian cycles that regulate sleep and other homeostatic bodily functions [45-48].  Light 113 
exposure during the early morning phase -advances the timing of the circadian clock, while exposure 114 
during the late evening delays it  [49].   115 
Sleep -wake cycles and other endogenous circadian rhythms are regulated  predominantly by the 116 
suprachiasmatic nucle us (SCN) of the hypothalamus.  The SCN generates an endogenous rhythm of 117 
slightly over 24  hours [50].  This rhythm is entrained or synchronized by environmenta l cues, most 118 
prominently by light exposure cycles that correspond to transitions from night to day.  This process is 119 
mediated by photoreceptive ganglion cells in the retina  (i.e., melanopsin receptors) , which appear to be 120 
specialized for  relay ing light/dark information, particularly within the blue wavelengths, to the SCN via 121 
the optic nerve [51].  This information is then sent from the SCN to the pineal gland, resulting in th e 122 
synthesis and release of the hormone melatonin  which signals the biological night and prepares the 123 
organism to sleep  [40, 52, 53].   124 
Initial  studies on circadian effects of light showed that bright white light effectively suppresses 125 
melatonin and shifts both melatonin secretion and circadian rhythms [40, 54-56], resulting in shifts in 126 
sleep and wakefulness periods [57, 58].  More recently, it has been found that shorter wavelength light in 127 
the blue spectrum (446 -477nm) is particularly effective at suppressing melatonin  [59], and outperforms 128 
longer wavelength red light in terms of melatonin -suppression, circadian phase shifting, antidepressant 129 
effects, and increasing alertness [38, 39, 60-65].  Given that the melanopsin receptors appear to be 130 
primarily responsive to blue wavelength light [40], and that similar melatonin suppressing effects can be 131 
produced with significantly lower light intensities in the blue -wave  spectrum , numerous studies have now 132 
begun to focus on using this wavelength for improving daytime alertnes s, subjective sleep quality [43], 133 
and phase advancing individuals with delayed sleep phase disorders [39, 48]. BLT is particularly effective 134 
for circadian rhythm sleep disorders [66-68], which involve a shift between the individual’s sleep pattern 135 
and the pattern desired by social norms [69].  BLT also appears to improve the irregular sleep -wake 136 
patterns seen in Alzheimers’ dementia, which involve periodic sleep disruption and nightly restlessness 137 
[69].  138 
Bright light therapy has long been recognized as an extremely effective treatment for Se asonal 139 
Affective Disorder (SAD) [70].  Evidence for the efficacy BLT in SAD has accumulated over nearly three 140 
decades of research investigations, including a number of placebo -controlled trials.  Some studies have 141

shown that either morning or evening BLT is superior to pl acebo, while others find greater evidence of 142 
morning light superiority [41].  More recently, BLT has also shown efficacy in nonseasonal Major 143 
Depression, producing net reductions in depression and anxiety symptoms in the range o f 12-35% 144 
compared with dim light placebo conditions [71-73], and having potent synergistic effects when u sed as 145 
an adjunct to medication.  BLT also appears to have a mild anxiolytic effect [74], and has recently been 146 
shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients with seizure disorders [75].  In 147 
several studies, significant effects on mood were found within 1 week or less of BLT treatment initiation 148 
[73], with increasing benefits seen over several weeks.  Recent evidence also suggests blue light 149 
wavelengths may be particularly effective for reducing depressive symptoms and features [61, 76, 77].  150 
Importantly, the effectiveness  of BLT in SAD and nonseasonal depression appears comparable to that of 151 
antidepressant medication [78], with the additional advantages of a low side effect profile [79] and 152 
quicker onset of action [73, 80].  Moreover, BLT provides a viable option for patients who resist, refuse, 153 
or do not respond to pharmacological treatment.  154 
In summary, there is convincing evidence that BLT has therapeutic 155 
effects on anxiety  and depression , and has strong effects on the normal circadian 156 
rhythm of alertness and sleep -wake cycles .  These  features  are all central  to the 157 
symptomatology  of PTSD, yet no published studies have examined the effects 158 
of BLT on PTSD outcome.  One unpublished pilot study at the University of 159 
South Carolina and Dorn VA Medical Center using 10000 Lux BLT (broad 160 
spectrum white light) for 45 minutes  per day for two weeks in 9 PTSD patients.  161 
Compared with placebo, BLT was associated with greater percent improvement 162 
in scores on the Clinical Global Impression Scale and the Clinician 163 
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS -5), with more  than 20% improvement foun d 164 
for BLT, while less than 4% of placebo participants showed improvement 165 
(Youngstedt, Ginsberg, Kline, & Zielinski, unpublished data).  These pilot 166 
results suggest that BLT may be an effective treatment for PTSD, though larger 167 
controlled studies are needed  to provide confirmation and to examine the effects 168 
of BLT on particular PTSD symptoms.  Based on the evidence  summarized above, we propose that BLT 169 
in the blue wavelength spectrum will lead to  significantly  improved sleep, less depression, and less 170 
anxiet y among  combat veterans and other individuals with PTSD, and that these improvements will lead 171 
to a global improvement in overall PTSD severity relative to control groups with and without combat 172 
exposure.  Based on recent evidence suggesting that the effec t of light therapy on melatonin, sleep, and 173 
mood is mediated primarily via short wavelength blue light melanopsin receptors in the eye, we propose 174 
to compare  an active treatment  device with wavelengths peaking at 469 nm (blue) versus an identical 175 
placebo d evice fitted with amber colored diodes (see Figure 1) .  Thus, this study will be the first, large 176 
placebo controlled study examining the effectiveness and neuroimaging correlates of BLT in PTSD.   177

A. 3. Preliminary Data  179 
Our group has a long history of using functional 180 
neuroimaging techniques to study PTSD.  Using a 181 
paradigm known as the Masked Affect Task (MAT), 182 
our lab reported that combat exposed veterans with 183 
PTSD showed exaggerated amygdala responses to 184 
fear-related facial stimuli perceived below the 185 
threshold of conscious awareness when compared to 186 
combat exposed veterans without PTSD [27].  We 187 
have now collected pilot data on 65 participants, 188 
including 14 individuals with PTSD, 14 individuals 189 
with panic disorder, and 15 participants with simple 190 
phobias using this same paradigm. As evident in the 191 
figure, compared to healthy controls  or other anxiety 192 
groups  viewing masked fearful faces, patients with 193 
PTSD showed greater activation within the 194 
amygdala, one of the primary brain structures 195 
involved in the assessment of threat.   PTSD subjects 196 
also showed reduced activation within the ventromed ial prefrontal 197 
cortex relative to healthy controls.   This suggests that the 198 
hyperarousal and exaggerated startle reflexes associated with PTSD 199 
may be partly the result of abnormal responses in the amygdala.  At 200 
present, no neuroimaging studies have yet exa mined the role of 201 
sleep in this process.  However, recent data from Yoo and 202 
colleagues suggests that loss of normal sleep is associated with 203 
reduced functional connectivity between the VMPFC and the 204 
amygdala, suggesting that sleep loss may reduce the abili ty of the 205 
prefrontal cortex to regulate the emotional responses of the 206 
amygdala [81].  We have also conducted an fMRI study showing that reduced sleep is associated with 207 
altered func tional connectivity between the VMPFC and amygdala, and the strength of such connectivity 208 
is directly related to the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and reduced emotional functioning  209 
[82].  Our preliminary studi es of cognitive functioning during sleep deprivation support the prefrontal - 210 
emotional dysregulation model [83-92]. Notably, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus 211 
demonstrate abnormalities in neurometabolites such as n -acetylaspartate (NAA), a putative marker of 212 
neuronal integrity, in patients with PTSD (Karl and Werner, 2010). [83-92] Because sleep disruption is 213 
one of the most common symptoms of PTSD, the associated reduction in sleep quantity and quality  may 214 
serve to exacerbate the difficulties the se patients  have regulating emotions, serving to develop a vicious 215 
circle of hyperarous al, decreased sleep, and emotional dysregulation.   216

The proposed investigation will examine changes in sleepiness, neuropsychological functioning, 217 
symptom severity, as well as brain functioning and neurochemistry before and after a 6 -week treatment 218 
period with BLT.  To this end, w e have collected pilot data show ing that 6-weeks of daily morning 219

in concussion patients  compared to equivalent exposure to am ber placebo light (PL) .  Our preliminary 221 
findings in a small pilot sample  of 12 participants  (BL n = 7; PL n = 5) suggest that BL treatment may be 222 
effective at improving sleep and accelerating recovery.   While fully cognizant of the fact that these data 223 
are preliminary, we present the following findings to provide support for the feasibility of the study 224 
design and demonstrate our capacity to collect, process, and analyze relevant data.   225 
Subjective S ymptom Improvement .  Figure 3 depicts subjective sleep qu ality, as measured with 226 
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) pre - and post - 227 
intervention by group.  While there was no change in the Amber 228 
Light Placebo group between pre - and post -treatment assessment, 229 
by trend, PSQI scores were reduced in the Blue Li ght group (p = 230 
.07), suggesting improvement. Of note, in contrast to the Amber 231 
Light group, for which sleep quality remained clinically abnormal 232 
(i.e., PSQI ≥ 5), the post -treatment PSQI mean reflected good sleep 233 
quality for the Blue Light group (i.e., PSQ I < 5).  These findings 234 
suggest that BL was more effective in improving subjective sleep 235 
quality than the PL treatment.  236 
Actigraphic Sleep :  Participants were monitored using wrist 237 
actigraphy for the duration of the study (1 -week before treatment and throu ghout the treatment period).  238 
We compared actigraphic sleep between the baseline week and the final week of the study.  After removal 239 
of one outlier (z > 2.5), participants in the BL group (n = 6) showed an increase in the minutes of sleep 240 
objectively meas ured by wrist actigraphy compared to the PL group (n = 5) (see Figure 4).   On the whole, 241 
those in the amber placebo group improved by only 8.1 minutes of additional sleep per night, whereas 242 
those in the active BL group gained nearly twice as many minutes o f sleep per night on average (i.e., 15.0 243 
minutes).  Findings suggest that BL was associated with greater 244 
improvement in objective sleep quantity than PL.   245 
Objective Sleepiness /Alertness . On an objective measure of 246 
sleepiness, participants were monitored w ith 247 
electroencephalography (EEG) while 248 
attempting to sleep for 20 minutes in a 249 
quiet, darkened room. Figure 5 shows 250 
daytime sleepiness, as measured with the 251 
Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) at 252 
11:50am,  1:50pm and 3:50pm pre - and 253 
post-intervention by group.  There was a 254 
significant change in sleep onset latency 255 
between pre - and post -treatment by 256 
group (p=.02), w ith the BL group taking 257 
longer to fall asleep in sleep -conducive 258

conditions than the PL group.  This indicates greater enhancement of alertness in the BL group following 259 
treatment compared to the PL condition.  260 
Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) :  The PVT is  a 10-minute computerized measure of sustained 261 
attention and psychomotor vigilance that has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to sleep deprivation.  262 
The PVT currently serves as the “gold standard” for assessing degradation in alertness and vigilance 263 
following sleep loss.  Figure 6 depicts mean 264 
change in response time for correct trials for 265 
one of three PVT administrations.  There was 266 
a significant group difference, with the PL 267 
group showing slower mean response times 268 
between pre - and post -treatment ass essment.  269 
In addition, there was a significant group 270 
difference on PVT attentional lapses (i.e., 271 
response time > 500ms) between pre - and 272 
post-treatment assessment, with more 273 
attentional lapses in the PL than the BL 274 
group. This preliminary finding is presen ted 275 
in Figure 6.  Together, these findings suggest 276 
that BL was associated with greater post - 277 
treatment alertness and vigilance compared to PL treatment.   278 
d)  Neuropsychological Performance Changes :  Figure 7 depicts the change in cognitive 279 
functioning, as m easur ed with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status 280 
(RBANS) between pre - and post -intervention assessment by group.  Of note, the BL group showed not 281 
only a marked increase in Total test p erformance, but also a significant i mprovement on the Attention and 282 
Delayed Memory  subscales .  In contrast, in the PL group, cognitive performance declined in three of five 283 
subscales (i.e., Visuo -constructional, Language, and Attention) and Total test performance, but not for the 284 
BL group.  Importantly, the difference in change between pre - and post -treatment group proved 285 
significant or marginally significant for the Visuo -constructional subscale (p = .06), Language subscale (p 286 
= .03) and Total test performance (p = .04) between PL and BL gro ups.  This suggests that sleep 287 
improvement in the BL group was paralleled by improvements in cognitive functioning, while such 288 
findings were not observed for the PL group .  289

e)  Task -Related Functional MRI :  Figure 8  290 
shows functional brain activation for 1 4 subjects (7 291 
BL, 7 PL) during the n -back working memory task 292 
and the multi -source interference task (MSIT) that 293 
subjects performed in the MRI scanner pre -and 294 
post-treatment  (blue = BL > PL; amber = PL > BL) .  295 
Specifically, the figure shows increases  in medial 296 
prefrontal cortex  activation between pre - and post - 297 
assessment for the most difficult task condition  (i.e., 298 
2-back) in the blue light condition.  Blue light also 299 
resulted in increased activation within the thalamus 300 
and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (D LPFC) on the 301 
MSIT  following six weeks of BL compared to PL 302 
treatment .  303 
f)  Resting State F unctional Connectivity :  304 
Participants also completed a 6 -minute resting state 305 
functional connectivity (rsFC) MRI scan which 306 
allows the identification of intrinsic pat terns of 307 
temporal correlation among various regions within 308 
the brain.  Based on our prior published work in 309 
healthy controls showing that minor fluctuations in nocturnal sleep, even as little as an hour or two, can 310 
have significant effects on rsFC  [93], we hypothesized that improvement in sleep in subjects with mTBI  311 
would also be associated with improved functional connectivity within behavioral control and memory 312 
regions of the brain. As shown in Figure 9, we found that six weeks of BL treatment was associated with 313 
significantly (p< .05) greater inter -regional funct ional connectivity for the prefrontal cortex and 314 
hippocampus with other cortical regions in this very preliminary sample (7 BL, 5 PL).  In contrast, those 315 
receiving PL showed greater functional connectivity of the insula with other posterior cortical regio ns, 316 
suggesting greater emotional/visceral sensory processing in the PL group.  Overall, BL treatment was 317 
associated with increased functional connectivity between memory and attention processing regions.  318

g)  Diffusion Tensor Imaging :  319 
Participants also co mpleted a diffusion 320 
tensor imaging (DTI) scan.  These data 321 
were preprocessed in FSL (i.e., eddy current 322 
correction, reconstruction of diffusion 323 
tensors, estimation of diffusion parameters, 324 
registration to anatomical image and 325 
standard space).  For demonstr ation of 326 
feasibility, preliminary data (8 BL, 8 PL) 327 
have been analyzed in FSL, although the 328 
sample is currently too small to conduct 329 
statistical parametric analyses.  Pre - to post - 330 
treatment increases in fractional anisotropy 331 
(FA) were seen in key regions i mplicated in 332 
PTSD, including the rostral and subgenual 333 
anterior cingulate regions for those 334 
receiving BL but not for the amber PL 335 
group.  Greater FA is generally considered 336 
to signify better white matter health.  These 337 
preliminary data raise the intriguing  possibility that improvement in sleep during the six -week treatment 338 
period with BL may lead to an accelerated re -myelination process relative to those in the PL group.  We 339 
believe further research into this intriguing and potentially important possibility  and its relation to PTSD 340 
symptom change is warranted.  341 
Summary .  Our preliminary findings clearly demonstrate that the methods proposed herein are 342 
feasible and that our team can effectively collect, process, and analyze the data, thereby accomplishing the 343 
aims of the study.  We have now implemented this paradigm with over 30 brain injured participants, and 344 
all were able to complete the study procedures without difficulty.  Furthermore, the case findings we 345 
highlight also provide limited but compelling evide nce that the BLT program was associated with 346 
improvement in symptoms, neuropsychological status, and neurocircuitry changes in the hypothesized 347 
direction.  Thus, the preliminary data suggest that the protocol we propose is feasible and shows 348 
significant pr omise for improving sleep and brain functioning.  349 
 350 
B. SPECIFIC AIMS/ HYPOTHESES  351 
Project Overview .  Combat veterans and other individuals with PTSD will complete two comprehensive 352 
sessions including neurobehavioral assessment s, repeated polysomnographic sleep  studies , and 353 
neuroimaging sessions (functional MRI, structural MRI, and proton spectroscopy) separated by 6 weeks 354 
of actigraphically monitored at -home treatment .  During the intervening 6 weeks , participants will be 355 
randomly assigned to receive 30 minutes  of daily morni ng blue light therapy (BL) or an amber light 356 
placebo treatment (PL).  Sleep quality and quantity will be measured using subjective reports, objective 357 
actigraph readings, and polysomnography.  Globally, w e hypothesize BL will improve sleep qu ality and 358 
quantity relative to PL, and these improvements will be associated with improvements in neurocognitive 359

function, alterations in proton metabolites in the limbic system and medial prefrontal cortex, and reduced 360 
PTSD symptom severity at follow -up assessment.   The following are the Specific Aims and Hypotheses:  361 
AIM  1:  Evidence suggests that morning bright light therapy suppresses daytime melatonin and 362 
leads to an entrainment of the circadian rhythm that modulates  daytime alertness and nighttime slee p.  363 
The first objective will be to assess the validity of this effect in PTSD patients.  364 
Hypothesis 1 :  Six weeks of BL T will improve sleep  relative to PL among PTSD  subjects.  365 
1a:  Six weeks  of morning blue light therapy (BL T) will improve objective and subjective 366 
measures of sleep duration and quality as measured by actigraphy, sleep logs, sleep scales, and 367 
polysomnography  relative to an amber light placebo therapy (PL) condition.  368 
AIM  2:  If light therapy is successful in entraining the circadian rhythm and improving nighttime 369 
sleep in patients with PTSD, this should be associated with improvement in symptoms and cognitive 370 
functioning, as sleep has been shown to be critical in the process of extinguishing conditioned fears.  371 
Therefore, the second Aim  is to evaluate the association between changes in sleep patterns and 372 
improvement in symptom expression, emotional wellbeing, and cognitive functioning in patients with 373 
PTSD.  However, even if Aim 1  is not successful, the present study will provide important cross -sectional 374 
data regarding the relations hip between measured sleep, cognitive functioning, and fear extinction in 375 
individuals with P TSD.  376 
Hypothesis 2 :  BL will improve cognitive functioning , symptoms of PTSD , and generalization of 377 
fear extinction  relative to PL.  378 
2a:  Six weeks of BL will improve measures of neurocognitive (i.e., memory and executive 379 
functions) and mood functioning relative to PL.  380 
2b: The PTSD  group receiving six weeks of BL wi ll show significant reduction in self - 381 
reported symptom scores on the PTSD symptom checklist and CAPS,  lower emotional distress on clinical 382 
measures , and greater generalization of conditioned fear extinction  relative to the PTSD group receiving 383 
PL. 384 
AIM  3:  At present, there are no known studies that have examined the neurobiological correlates 385 
of symptom improvement in patients with PTSD following light exposure therapy.  The present study 386 
aims to provide clear evidence of functional and neurochemical chang es that are associated with changes 387 
in sleep, cognition, and PTSD symptoms from pre - to post -treatment.  Even if Aim 1 is not supported, the 388 
obtained cross sectional data will provide critical insights regarding the association between sleep , 389 
neurometabolit es, and brain function within patients with PTSD.  This correlational information is 390 
currently lacking for PTSD and will fill an important knowledge gap regardless of whether the light 391 
therapy is su ccessful.  392 
Hypothesis 3 :  Six weeks of BL will produce reli able changes in brain activation  and 393 
neurochemistry  relative to PL, particularly for PTSD subjects.  394 
3a:  Relative to PL, six weeks  of BL will lead to significantly increased ventromedial 395 
prefrontal activation and reduced amygdala activation during the backward masked affect fMRI task.  396 
3b:  Relative to PL, six weeks  of BL will lead to significantly greater negative functional 397 
connecti vity between the  ventromedial prefrontal cortex and  amygdala during resting state fMRI . 398 
3c: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will be associated with increased activation of the 399 
VMPFC, and reduced activation within the amygdala and dorso -medial prefrontal co rtex during the 400 
extinction recall scan . 401

3d: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will be associated with increased levels of GABA and 402 
reduced glutamate in the amygdala -hippocampal complex and anterior cingulate gyrus as measured by 403 
proton magnetic resonance spe ctroscopy (1H MRS).  404 
3e: Relative to PL, six weeks of BL will produce increased levels of N -acetyl -aspartate 405 
(NAA), choline (Cho), and reduced phosphocreatine (Cr) within the amygdala -hippocampal complex and 406 
anterior cingulate gyrus.  407 
AIM  4:  The fourth Aim is to demonstrate whether changes in subjective and objective measures 408 
of sleep are associated with changes in symptom severity, cognitive functioning, brain activation, and 409 
neurochemistry . Regardless of the success of the light therapy approach outcome in  Aim 1, the ava ilable 410 
data will provide some of the first longitudinal data examining changes in sleep patterns over time in 411 
individuals with PTSD and their correlation with these other metrics.  Thus, useful data will be acquired 412 
even if the primary hypot hesis of Aim 1 is not supported.  413 
Hypothesis 4 :  Improvements in sleep noted in Hypothesis 1, will be linearly correlated with 414 
improvements in cognitive and symptom functioning in Hypothesis 2 and structural and functional 415 
brain changes in Hypothesis 3.  416 
4a:  Changes in sleep parameters identified in Hypothesis 1 will correlate with 417 
improvements in memory, executive functioning, and neurop sychological performance on neurocognitive 418 
measures described in Hypothesis 2.  419 
4b: Changes in sleep param eters identified in Hypothesis 1 will cor relate with changes in 420 
neurochemistry  as outlined in Hypothesis 3d and 3e above.  421 
 422 
2) Lay Summary  (approximately 400 words ) 423 
Sleep disturbance is nearly ubiquitous among individuals suffering from PTSD and is a major pro blem 424 
among service members returning from combat deployments.  Recent evidence suggests that adequate 425 
restorative sleep may a crucial component in the ability to generalize fear extinction learning, and 426 
ultimately may be a key feature in the process of rec overy from PTSD.  The proposed study aims to test a 427 
novel, inexpensive, and easy to use non -pharmacologic approach to improving sleep among service 428 
members  and other individuals  with PTSD.  Our approach is based on recent scientific discoveries 429 
regarding t he role of the photosensitive retinal ganglion cell system in regulating sleep -wake patterns.  430 
Moreover, our protocol employs a novel, non -pharmacologic intervention f or influencing this system to 431 
regulate sleep and cognition.  Primary outcome measures wil l include not only PTSD symptom 432 
improvement but also include cutting -edge neuroimaging of brain structure, function, connectivity, and 433 
neurochemistry changes.  The proposal is firmly grounded in the emerging scientific literature  434 
regarding sleep, light exp osure, brain function, anxiety, and resilience.  Prior evidence suggests that blue 435 
light therapy is effective for improving mood and fatigue, and our pilot data further suggest that this 436 
treatment may be effective for improving daytime sleepiness and brain  functioning in brain injured 437 
individuals.  Thus, this intervention, in our own research and in the work of others, has been shown to 438 
affect critical sleep regulatory systems.    Improving sleep may be a vital component of recovery in these 439 
service members .  Our approach would directly address this issue.  Our preliminary data have shown that 440 
this approach is extremely well tolerated and is effective for improving sleep, mood, cognitive 441 
performance, and brain function among individuals with brain injuries.  The protocol is actually less 442

burdensome than it appears, as over 30 participants have already successfully completed this same 443 
protocol in our pilot study of mild traumatic brain injury without any complaints or discontinuations due 444 
to excessive burden.  Finally, the potential impact  of this study is high because of the capability of 445 
transitioning the research to direct clinical application almost immediately.  If the BL treatment is 446 
demonstrated as effective, this approach would be readily available for nearly immediate large -scale 447 
implementation, as the devices have been widely used for years in other contexts, are already safety 448 
tested, and commercially available from several manufacturers for a very low cost.  Thus, the impact of 449 
this research on treat ing PTSD would be high and immediate.  450 
 451 
3) Setting of the Human Research  452 
 This study requires three visits including an initial assessment and two testing/scanning sessions 453 
separated by six -weeks of daily light exposure treatment at home.  454 
 For the initial assessment and the baseline testing session, subjects will be seen at the Lab of Dr. 455 
Killgore in the University of Arizona Department of Psychiatry. There, subjects will complete personality 456 
assessments, a comprehensive cognitive assessment  battery, and several tests of motor functioning.  457 
  458 
 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedures:   The data collection will occur at the research - 459 
dedicated University of Arizona scanner facility that houses a new 3 Tesla magnet (see Equipment for 460 
description). For functional neuroimaging, audio and visual stimulus presentation equipment is available 461 
through the Resonance Technologies  headphone/goggle  system or high -definition MRI -compatible LCD - 462 
display (viewed through a mirror in the head cage).  An fMRI compatible EEG system including caps, 463 
cabling, and pre -amplifier is integrated with this space (see  Equipment for description).  Scanner data are 464 
transferred securely to a RAID storage system for subsequent transfer to PI laboratories. Offline analysis 465 
will take place in the Laboratory of PI Dr. Killgore.  466 
 In January 2013, the University of Arizona purc hased a Siemens Magnetom TIM Skyra 3T that is 467 
capable of high -resolution imaging capabilities. This whole -body 3.0T device will be configured with 48 468 
receiver channels and up to 204 integrated coil elements. It is capable of integrated parallel acquisition  469 
techniques and provides higher signal to noise in the parallel imaging mode than its predecessor, the Trio. 470 
The maximum acceleration factor using parallel imaging is 16 using either mSENSE or GRAPPA, and 471 
3D scanning can be accelerated in two directions (m aximum acceleration factor of 4 in second direction). 472 
The gradients of the Skyra have a maximum amplitude of 45 mT/m and a maximum slew rate of 200 T 473 
Tm-1s-1, yielding a minimum rise time of 225μs. The vector gradient performance (vector summation of 474 
all three gradient axes) results in a maximum effective amplitude of 78 mT/m and a maximal effective 475 
slew rate of 346 Tm-1s-1. All three gradient coils are force -compensated to reduce vibration and deliver 476 
superior eddy current performance. The water cooled gra dient amplifier has a maximum amplitude 477 
potential of 2,250 volts and a maximum current output of 750 amps. The instrument has a minimum slice 478 
thickness (in two dimensions) of 0.1 mm and a minimum partition thickness (in three dimensions) of 0.05 479 
mm. The in strument produces high sensitivity, with main field, or B0, homogeneity of 1.4 ppm VRMS for 480 
a 40 cm diameter spherical volume. Single shot EPI sequences for measuring diffusion -weighted data sets 481 
with up to 256 directions of diffusion weighting are also a part of this instrument’s capability. It provides 482

diffusion tensor imaging and parametric maps derived from fractional anisotropy calculated in real time, 483 
automatically. Additional sequence options include Arterial Spin Labeling, and susceptibility weighte d 484 
imaging (SWI) with both fully supported with parametric and phase map reconstructions.  485 
 All structural and functional MRI studies will be conducted in concert with the University of 486 
Arizona Translational Bioimaing Resource . Subjects in this study will b e studied in a scanner that has a 487 
field strength of 3 Tesla. This field strength has been approved by the FDA for routine clinical use. The 488 
three instruments are maintained by GE service engineers and currently meet or exceed manufacturer's 489 
specifications on performance. For functional neuroimaging, audio and visual stimulus presentation 490 
equipment is available through the Resonance Technologies headphone/goggle system.  491 
 A research area, Room 1564 (400 square feet), located immediately adjacent to the 3.0 Te sla 492 
scanner, is equipped with 3 PC/Linux workstations and sgi O2 for data transfer and storage, image 493 
processing, and data manipulation. All workstations are networked through a central hub and are 494 
protected against external tampering using firewalls withi n the UAMC computer network.  495 
 Functional MRI is mostly done in MR3, a General Electric 3.0T HD Signa Excite scanner. It is 496 
equipped with Optimized ACGD Gradients (40mT/m, 150 mT/m/ms slew rate running 12x software). It is 497 
a 55cm diameter long bore magnet. This instrument is equipped with a head coil, 8 channel HR brain 498 
array, a phased array neurovascular coil, 8 channel phased array spine coil, extremity coils (knee and 499 
wrist) and a torso coil. MR3 has multinuclear spectroscopy capability and high order shi ms. 500

 528 
5) Study Population  529 
 The target population is combat -exposed military personnel and other non -military individuals 530 
who meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Participants in the study will include active duty or recently 531 
discharged combat -exposed military personnel from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi 532 
Freedom (OEF/OIF) meeting DSM -V diagnos tic crite ria for PTSD , in addition to some individuals from 533 
the general population who meet DSM -V diagnostic criteria for PTSD to achieve a total sample size  of 90 534 
participants , which we anticipate will require enrolling up to 108 individuals to account fo r attrition . An 535 
 age range of 18 -50 years has been selected to minimize possible developmental and degenerative 536 
effects that could be expected in younger and older subjects and to encompass the age range of the 537 
majority of military personnel. Participants will be recruited from several sources. Active duty 538 
participants will be recruited according to the guidelines specified by the CDMRP upon award receipt. 539 
The PI, a U.S. Army Reserve Research Psychologist (Lieutenant Colonel), already has a number of 540 
establ ished relationships and collaborations with leaders in the Army Medical Department (AMEDD), the 541 
Pentagon, several major medical treatment facilities (MTFs), and all three of the Army’s primary research 542 
laboratories, including the Walter Reed Army Institute  of Research (WRAIR), the U.S. Army Institute of 543 
Environmental Medicine (USARIEM), and the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory 544 
(USAARL).  It is anticipated that potential recruitment of active duty, Reserve, and National Guard 545 
participants will be eff ectively facilitated according to the guidelines specified by the CDMRP. 546 
Participants will be recruited primarily from the Tucson  area via IRB approved internet, newspaper, and 547 
radio advertisements, and contact with individual units.  Facebook advertisements and flyers will also be 548 
utilized to recruit subjects, as described in greater detail below.   549 
 550 
Inclusion Criteria:  551 
1) age 18 -50 years;  552 
2) right handedness  or right -hand dominance  as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory  (EHS)  553 
(necessary to avoid mixed lateralization on brain imaging);  554 
3) SCID diagnos is consistent with PTSD  555 
 556 
Exclusion Criteria:  557 
1) History of head injury with loss of consciousness  for greater than 30 minutes,  or post -traumatic 558 
amnesia  for >24 hours , or major neurological illness  (e.g. epilepsy, multiple sclerosis/MS) ; 559 
2) Chronic medical  (e.g. heart conditions, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, HEP C, thyroid 560 
problems, high blood sugar) or psychiatric (e .g. bipolar disorder/manic or hypomanic episodes, 561 
personality disorders, schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, severe OCD or ADHD ) condition s that 562 
would confound interpretation of results ; 563

3) Left-handedness  or left -hand dominance if ambidextrous  (could affect brain lateralization and add error 564 
variance to scanning) ; 565 
4) Abnormal visual acuity that cannot be corrected by contact lenses (necessary to see stimuli in the 566 
magnetic  environment  of the scanner ); 567 
5) IQ estimate less than 70; 568 
6) Metal within the body , pregnancy, or other contraindication for MRI procedures;  569 
7) Ongoing trauma (e.g. currently being in an abusive relationship)  or non -qualifying trauma (e.g. index 570 
trauma emotional/verbal abuse, children being taken away by the CPS, divorce, natural deaths by  age 571 
or illness) ; 572 
8) Previous formal treatment with light therapy;  573 
9) History of light -induced migraine or epilepsy; medical complications that could elevate the risk of 574 
discomfort associated with light -therapy;  575 
10) Use of medications that could affect functional ne uroimaging results (e.g., beta -blockers , mood 576 
stabilizers , atypical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, hypertension medication, chemotherapy, 577 
photosensitive medications etc. ). Patients currently taking other psychotropic medications (i.e., 578 
“treatment as usua l”) must be stabilized for at least 4 -weeks prior to participation. Although 579 
participants will not be excluded from participation, detailed history and dosages will be documented 580 
and examined as appropriate in statistical analyses.  581 
11) Curren t suicidal intent based on an assessment conducted by a licensed clinical psychologist;  582 
12) Currently taking or anticipa ting the need to take sleep -inducing medications (e.g., zolpidem) or 583 
supplements that have known effects on sleep (e.g., melatonin) during the course of the s tudy.  584 
a. Patients currently taking other psychotropic medications (i.e., “treatment as usual”) must be 585 
stabilized for at least 4 -weeks prior to participation.  Although participants will not be 586 
excluded from participation, detailed history and dosages will be documented and examined as 587 
appropriate in statistical analyses.  Due to the broad range of sleeping disturbances that are 588 
observed with PTSD and the likely difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of participants, 589 
we will not be excluding any par ticular sleep disorder, but will collect data regarding these 590 
sleep related problems so that it may be possible to statistically control for the effect of the 591 
BLT treatment on different forms of sleep problems ; 592 
13) Index trauma occurring before the participant  is 18 years of age ; 593 
14) Index trauma occu rring 10 years or longer prior to participation in the study ; 594 
15) WRAT4 reading test score indicative of  less than a 6th grade level of reading comprehension ; 595 
16) Drug use: Marijuana use not exclusionary. Past drug dependence (other than  marijuana) not 596 
exclusionary if individuals have sustained remission (no drug use in the past 12 months) .  597 
6) Recruitment Methods  and Consenting Process  598 
Please note:  The Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) with US Army Medical Research and 599 
Materiel Command must approve any major amendment to this study prior to its implementation. 600 
Therefore, implementation of any amendment which requires HRPO approval, including use of revised 601 
consen ts, will not begin until HRPO approval is received.  602

 Participants will be recruited from several sources. Active duty participants will be  recruited 604 
according to the guidelines specified by the Department of Defense's (DoD's) Congressionally Directed 605 
Medical Research Programs ( CDMRP ) upon award receipt. The PI, a U.S. Army Reserve Research 606 
Psychologist (Lieutenant Colonel) , already has a number of established relationships and collaborations 607 
with leaders in the Army Medical Dep artment (AMEDD), the Pentagon, several major medical treatment 608 
facilities (MTFs), and all three of the Army’s primary research laboratories, including the Walter Reed 609 
Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), the U.S. Army Institute of Environmental Medicine (US ARIEM), 610 
and the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory (USAARL). It is anticipated that recruitment of 611 
active duty, Reserve, and National Guard participants will be effectively  facilitated and will proceed 612 
according to the guidelines specified by the CD MRP.   Civilian  veterans, Reserve Soldiers, National 613 
Guard Soldiers, and nonmilitary combat -exposed  civilians will also be recruited primarily from the local 614 
Tucson  and surrounding area,  from clinical programs within the Department of Psychiatry , and local 615 
events and advertisements on the web (including our own websites, appropriate sections  of community 616 
websites  and forums  [e.g. Craigslist ], Facebook or other social media , and reputable clinical trial referral 617 
websites [e.g. StudyKik] , and similar websites ). Our lab will post IRB approved advertising text on 618 
similarly themed Facebook groups , which allow for outside posts of this nature. We will adhere to any 619 
page specific posting requirements as well as Facebook Terms of Service for appropriate behavior. We 620 
may also utilize print, radio advertisements, TV, and UAHS and College of Medicine hallway and lobby 621 
monitors  and flyers on campus, as well as UA list serves such  as 3D memos etc. (ad text will be IRB 622 
approved), Residence Halls, and other UA buildings (with the appropriate recruitment site authorization 623 
obtained prior).   624 
 We will make  approved  screening surveys ( e.g., Recruitment Survey.pdf ) available on UA 625 
departmental (e.g., Dep artment of Psychiatry, Department of Psychology ) or other UA -affiliated websites 626 
(e.g., UAHS Clinical Research Studies website) , as well as other online media appropriate for research 627 
advertising such as  clinical trial  referral websites , survey websites  (e.g., Qualtrics, Survey Monkey), 628 
research data management (e.g., REDCap),  and crowdsourcing websites  (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk  629 
[MTurk ]). Crowd -sourcing platforms facilitate recruitment of and payment to individuals for their 630 
participation in online surv eys. When disseminated via this method , our surveys will be restricted  to 631 
participants who live in Arizona  and will be securely hosted i n Qualtrics, REDCap, or other such 632 
reputable survey -host.  633 
 In addition, UA Clinics (i.e. CAPS, Campus Health, etc.), and outside clinics/businesses in the 634 
greater Tucson area will be utilized to refer patients to the study. Treating physicians at clinics may be 635 
informed of the study and the inclusion/exclusion criteria, if they feel they have  a patient  who qualifies 636 
they will provide the patient with a study recruitment flyer and the patient will contact our office if they 637 
are interested. Recruitment site authorization will be obtained prior to recruitment occurring at any site; 638 
this documenta tion will be kept within our research file s. A trained research assistant will initially screen 639 
individuals  who respond to these advertisements via telephone interview. Individuals meeting basic  640 
eligibility requirements will be scheduled for an intake visi t. Participants whose intake visits are 641 
scheduled more than six weeks after the date of the initial phone screen will be given a shortened follow - 642 
up phone screen prior to the intake visit, in order to ensure that no changes have taken place which may 643 
affec t their eligibility. Recruitment and advertisement  materials will include brief descriptions of the 644

purpose of the study, the general procedures of  the study, important inclusion and exclusion criteria, the 645 
amount of compensation, and the  phone number or e mail address to contact if interested.   646 
 To encourage full participation and minimal subject discontinuation, subject  compensation will 647 
follow the prorated schedule as seen in Section 12.  648 
 649 
 Subjects will be made aware via the Informed Consent Form that if they are active duty military 650 
personnel, they are not eligible to receive compensation for time spent completing assessments unless 651 
they are on official military leave status in accordance with Title 24 United States Code 30. Therefore, 652 
any active duty mil itary personnel not on leave status will not receive compensation for time spent 653 
completing assessments  as attested to by all subjects as part of the informed consent process .  654 
We will request that subjects attest to their understanding of this by initialing the following:  655 
 656 
Participants who are active duty cannot be compensated for any of the research activities while they 657 
are “on -duty”.   It will be the volunteer’s responsibility to ensure they have taken leave and obtained 658 
the right permissions, if required, in order to rece ive compensation for this study.   659 
______     Please initial to indicate you acknowledge this requirement.  660 
 661 
If you are active duty military personnel , you are not eligible to receive compensation for time 662 
spent completing assessments while you are “on duty .”  In accordance with Title 24 United States 663 
Code 30, active duty military personnel must be on leave status during each of the three assessment 664 
sessions in order to be compensated.  If you are on active duty, it is your responsibility  to ensure that 665 
you ha ve completed the appropriate paperwork for leave and obtained the necessary permissions to 666 
allow you to participate in this study.  If you are on leave status, you will be compensated for the 3 667 
assessment sessions according to the schedule listed above.  668 
Screening Procedures:  669 
 Potential subjects will be screened over the phone by a clinically trained research assistant to 670 
verify that subjects meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusionary criteria.  671 
Information collected during screening will not be used as a part of the research data. Subjects who meet 672 
basic eligibility requirements will be scheduled for an intake visit. Informed consent will be obtained prior 673 
to initiating any further screening proc edures. After informed consent has been determined, a supervised 674 
Research Technician who has been trained and meets  predetermined qualifications to administer a 675 
Structured Clinical Interview by d octoral level clinical psychologists with training and experi ence 676 
administering  these instruments will conduct a structured clinical interview to screen for any psychiatric 677 
diagnoses . Once  eligibility for the study has been confirmed or rejected, the subject will be placed into the 678 
appropriate experimental group, or  excluded from the study if any information yielded from this visit is 679 
consistent with the exclusionary criteria.  680 
 681 
Informed Consent Process : 682 
• Either the PI or a trained research assistant will be responsible for explaining the  study, answering 683 
questions, an d obtaining written informed consent from participants.  684

• Initial description of the study will be provided during the telephone screening  process. The actual 685 
consent process will occur during the in -person intake visit. The  consent process is the first part  of 686 
the visit, and will take place in a private office. The  participant will have the opportunity to read 687 
the consent form, and each section will be  explained in detail by the research assistant. The 688 
participant will have a chance to ask  questions and have  them answered fully before making a 689 
decision to participate. All  volunteers will receive a copy of the signed consent form once they and 690 
the study staff  member obtaining consent have signed the form.  691 
• Only adult participants with normal intellectual  capaci ty (IQ≥70) will be included in the study. 692 
Any evidence of altered mental status or capacity, due to substances, medications, cognitive  status, 693 
or injury will result in discontinuation of the consent process.  694 
• Participants will be consented in a private offi ce, but may be accompanied by anyone  of their 695 
choosing. There will be no time pressure and potential volunteers may discuss  possible 696 
participation with anyone and may choose to suspend the consent process and  return on another 697 
occasion, as long as they hav e not been disqualified or the study has  terminated.  698 
• Participants will be monitored closely by study staff and queried about continued  participation 699 
after completion of each major component of the study (i.e.,  neurocognitive testing, functional 700 
imaging, sleep study, etc.) and if there are visible  signs that the participant may be having 701 
difficulty tolerating the procedures.  702 
• We will not enroll subjects who cannot provide written informed consent; therefore  plans to 703 
consent the subject’s Legally Au thorized Representative are not applicable.  704 
• Because the study requires the ability to read many self -report instruments and  complete several 705 
written task s, we will not be enrolling anyone that cannot read with at  least 6th grade proficiency , 706 
as indicated b y the WRAT 4 Reading test . Because the study requires the ability to comprehend a  707 
variety of self -report instruments that are only available in English, we will not be  enrolling 708 
participants whos e primary language is not English. No waiver of consent is  being sought for this 709 
study.  710 
• All participants will be adults (age 18 to 50), thus issues regarding assent from minors  are not 711 
relevant.  712 
 713 
7) Procedures involved in the Human Research  714 
General Procedure : Over a 4-year period, 108 participants between the ages of 1 8 and 50 will be 715 
recruited to participate  (to reach a final n of 90 subjects,  assuming 20% attrition) .  Participants will 716 
comprise a ctive duty , Reserve, National Guard,  or recently discharged combat -exposed military personnel  717 
or DoD contractors  from Operat ion Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) meeting 718 
DSM -V diagnostic criter ia for PTSD , in addition to some non -military individuals who meet the DSM -V 719 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD .  Combat -exposed individuals  within 10 years of return from OIF/OEF will 720 
be eligible.   An age range of 18 -50 years has been selected to minimize possible developmental and 721 
degenerative effects that could be expected in younger and older subjects and to encompass the age range 722 
of the majority of military personnel.   723

Prior to data analysis,  subjects who consent will have a follow -up phone call where they will be 724 
administered the PCL -5, PHQ -9, and be asked about general sleep problems  using the ESS and ISI .  725 
The procedures will essentially be identical to those used successfully in our pilot study of patients 726 
with mTBI.  Participants will attend three laboratory sessions (see Figure 10 below).  Visit 1 involves 727 
informed consent, demographic data collection , and basic psychiatric assessment.  Participants will be 728 
provided with a wrist actigraph sleep monitor.  After a week of at home monitoring, each participant will 729 
return for Visit 2, which is involves comprehensive neurocognitive assessment, neuroimaging, fea r 730 
conditioning testing, objective sleepiness monitoring  and heart rate monitoring .  Then participants will be 731 
randomly assigned to one of two light therapy conditions (n = 45 per group) differing only in the 732 
wavelength emitted by each light therapy device.  Participants  will be randomly assigned to either the BL 733 
condition or the PL condition , using computerized permuted block randomization to match groups by 734 
gender . Participants assigned to the active treatment condition will undergo 6 -weeks of at -home treat ment 735 
with a light device fitted with blue light (BL) diodes, while those assigned to the  Placebo (PL) condition 736 
will undergo 6 -weeks of identical treatment with a device fitted with amber light diodes.  To objectively 737 
monitor sleep, p articipants will wear a wrist actigraph for the duration of the study.  During the 6 weeks 738 
of treatment, participants will use the light device for 30 -minutes each morning, within 2 -hours of 739 
awakening  (verified via light sensor built into the wrist actigra ph, daily time stamped electronic sleep 740 
diary , and compliance as measured by wattage usage/time meter ).  After 6 -weeks, participants return for 741 
Visit 3 and undergo a follow -up neurocognitive assessment, neuroimaging, fear conditioning, objective 742 
sleepiness  monitoring, and hear t rate monitoring .  These procedures have been extremely successful and 743 
well tolerated in our pilot study.  744 
 745 
Subject Screening : Participants whose intake visits are scheduled more than six weeks after the date of 746 
the initial phone scre en will be given a shortened follow -up phone screen prior to the intake visit, in order 747 
to ensure that no changes have taken place which may affect their eligibility.  748 
Intake Visit (Visit 1) :  Participants  will be given a full description of the study, have  the opportunity to 749 
ask questions, and will  provide written informed consent , and will be evaluated for PTSD severity using  750 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -V (SCID) . The Morningness Eveningness Questionnaire 751 
(MEQ) will be administered to assess c ircadian rhythm disturbances prior to light treatment. The combat 752 
exposure  scale (CES) will also be administered to participants with combat -related PTSD  to inform us of 753 
the extent and nature of combat exposure in military participants. T he Weschler Abbreviated Scale of 754 
Intelligence (WASI -II) will be administered to control for variation in intelligence levels amongst 755 
participants . The AUDIT and MUSE questionnaires will also be given to determine the degree and extent 756 
of alcohol and marijuana  use, though neither of these scales will be utilized as a means to determine 757

exclusion from the study.  The Rivermead Post -Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (RPCSQ) will be 758 
administered to confirm that any participants who may have experienced concussion d uring their 759 
traumatic event did not lose consciousness or experience post -traumatic amnesia . Research Technicians 760 
who have been trained and meet predetermined qualifications to administer a Structured Clinical 761 
Interview by d octoral level clinical psycholog ists with training and experience with these instruments  will 762 
administer the SCID. All SCID administrations  will be reviewed via supervision by a qualified doctoral 763 
level clinical psychologist  immediately following the participant’s interview .  Female participants  will 764 
also provide information about their menstrual cycle (length of cycle and time since last menses) because 765 
this is critical in the interpretation of brain metabolite levels during magnetic resonance spectroscopic 766 
imaging .  We do not know if MR I scanning presents a risk to unborn fetuses, so we will ask all female  767 
participant s of childbearing potential to complete a urine pregnancy test immediately prior to the scan. 768 
Female  participant s must have a negative pregnancy test before the MRI scan can  be initiated.  This 769 
pregnancy test will be performed in the Department of Psychiatry.  All subjects will wear a heart rate 770 
monitor for the duration of this visit.  Selection criteria for all subjects are as follows:  771 
During  Visit 1, participants will be fitte d with a  wrist -worn  actigraph  to monitor sleep/wake 772 
patterns.  This device will also log exposure to light in three wavelengths (red, green, blue) to measure 773 
compliance with the protocol.  Participants will also be introduced to the online sleep diary coll ection 774 
system and will be given an automated email each morning reminding them to log in and complete the 775 
sleep diary.  776 
Visits 2 and 3: Assessment/Scanning Visits :  One week after Visit 1, participants will return for 777 
Visit 2 . Participants  will complete a d etailed demog raphic (Day of Scan Questionnaire (DSIQ)) and health 778 
questionnaire and will be fitted for a heart rate monitor to be worn for the duration of the visit, save for 779 
the MRI scan where heart rate will be measured by MRI safe leads as part of the M RI scanner. Subjects 780 
will complete a comprehensive baseline assessment  of neurocognitive and emotional functioning, coping 781 
capacity, and resilience.  Participants will also undergo a validated de novo  fear conditioning and 782 
extinction procedure [98-101], and a series of functional neuroimaging and neurochemistry scans .  783 
Additionally, participants will complete subjective and objective measures of sleepiness and alertness 784 
throughout the day.  The following specific tasks and procedures will be administered during the 785 
assessment session:  786 
Emotional Functioning/Coping/Sympto m Severity:  PTSD severity will be assessed using the 787 
20-item National Center for PTSD Checklist , Military Version (PCL -5), Patient Health Questionnaire 788 
(PHQ -9), and Clinician Administered PTSD Scale -5 (CAPS -5). Further assessment of psychopathology 789 
will b e made via administration of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II); Beck Anxiety Inventory 790 
(BAI); and Spielberger State -Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI).  Participants will also complete  measure s 791 
resilience (Connor -Davidson Resilience Scale (CD -RISC)) , Evaluation of Risks (EVAR) , the Satisfaction 792 
with Life Scale (SWLS)  and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ6) .  The Balloon Analogue Risk Test 793 
(BART) will be done to measure risk taking.  794 
Subjective Sleep Measures:  To assess general sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and 795

three times during the assessment day . The Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) and 799 
Sleep Diaries A & B will also be done.   800 
Neurocognitive Assessment :  All participants wi ll complete a comprehensive neuro cognitive  801 
assessment battery to include:  802 
1. Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) .  The 803 
RBANS is a brief battery of well -normed neuropsychological tests  with two alternate forms (RBANS A 804 
and RBANS B) to permit repeated testing. The test provides several index scores, including: Total Score, 805 
Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention, and Delayed Memory.  This brief 806 
battery will be admin istered to assess change in cognitive performance in each group following treatment.  807 
Subject responses will be recorded via recording device for the Semantic Fluency portion of the RBANS 808 
assessment in order to ensure that their complete responses are captu red given that they may respond 809 
faster than the study team may otherwise be able to record. No identifiers will be used and these recording 810 
will be assigned to the subject ID number only. Recordings will be listened to the same day they are 811 
created and com pared to the initial response collection to ensure the study team captured the subject’s 812 
complete response , anything missed will be transcribed onto the RBANS form . The recording will then be 813 
deleted.  814 
2. Fear Conditioning Paradigm . Our group has developed a fear-conditioning/fear extinction 815 
paradigm that is highly effective at discriminating individuals with PTSD from healthy controls  [98-101].  816 
The protocol consists of 4 experimental phases: Habituation, Conditioning, Extinction and Extinction  817 
Recall.  Subjects first choose a level of mild 818 
electric shock that is “highly annoying but not 819 
painful” while being administered shocks of 820 
increasing intensities through electrodes 821 
connected to two fingers.  For this paradigm, the 822 
conditioned st imuli (CSs) consist of digital 823 
photographs of three differently colored vehicles  824 
(blue, red or yellow) displayed on a computer 825 
screen within the image of two different 826 
photographic environments (contexts), a 827 
“conditioning context” in which the 828 
unconditione d (shock) stimulus (US) 829 
accompanies certain CSs (CS+s) during 830 
Conditioning and an “extinction context” in 831 
which CS+s occur without USs during the Extinction and Extinction Recall phases.   Before each 832 
experimental phase except Habituation, subjects are told  they "may or may not be shocked." During 833 
Conditioning, 16 CS+’s (8 each of 2 different colors) are presented in the conditioning context and a 0.5 - 834 
sec US (shock) immediately follows the offset of 10 of 16 CS+ presentations (5 of the 8 of each CS+ 835 
color).  Sixteen randomly interspersed presentations of the third vehicle  color (CS -s) are never paired with 836 
the US. During the Extinction phase, one CS+ color (CS+E) appears 16 times in the extinction context, 837 
along with 16 interspersed CS -s and no USs. The other  CS+ color (CS+U) does not appear and therefore 838 
remains un -extinguished. During the Extinction Recall phase, the 8 CS+Es and 8 CS+Us are presented in 839 
the extinction context with 16 interspersed CS -s and no USs. The measurement of conditioned fear is 840

palm -recorded skin conductance response (SCR), a reliable index of sympathetic activation. Participants 841 
will be conditioned and undergo extinction prior to entry into the scanner.  During scanning, participants 842 
will again be confronted with the previously exting uished stimuli to evaluate extinction recall, a hallmark 843 
deficit of PTSD.   It is expected that improved sleep due to the BL condition will lead to improved 844 
generalization of the extinction response and extinction recall.  845 
Modified Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) :  Participants will undergo 3 MSLT procedures with 846 
polysomnographic (PSG) recording over the course of the assessment day.  A trained technician will fit 847 
each participant with a standard electrode montage for PSG recording.  Standard PSG will be recorded 848 
using the Polysmith 11.0  system that is installed in our sleep laboratory facilities.  During each MSLT, the 849 
participant will be given up to 20 minutes to fall asleep in a private, darkened, sound -attenuated bedroom.  850 
PSG recordings will be scored by a trai ned technician to determine the latency to fall sleep.  The mean 851 
latency to sleep is taken as an indication of objective sleepiness.  852 
                  Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) :  The PVT is a 10 -minute computerized measure of 853 
sustained attention and psychomotor vigilance that has been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to sleep 854 
deprivation.  The PVT currently serves as the “gold standard” for assessing degradation in alertness and  855 
vigilance following sleep loss.   856 
Functional Neuroimaging :   Subjects will be screened for any contraindications to MRI and magnetic 857 
materials. The investigator or MRI Technologist will explain the MRI system and the scan that they are 858 
about to take part in. The subject will be asked to lie down on the scanner bed. Some part of the subject’s 859 
body may be covered or enclosed within an FDA or UA HSPP approved MRI coil. The subject may be 860 
asked to interact with a peripheral system such as a button, joystick, o r TV system before, during, or after 861 
the scan.  862 
Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will 863 
be collected  at the University of Arizona Translational Bioimaing Resource . The MRI hardware  and 864 
procedures immediately to follow are approved  by the FDA. A Siemens Skyra  3T whole body high -speed 865 
imaging device equipped for echo planar imaging  (EPI) (Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) will be 866 
used.  Head movement will be restricted using expandable foam cushions. After an a utomated scout 867 
image is acquired and shimming procedures performed to optimize field homogeneity, high -resolution 3D 868 
MPRAGE sequences (TR/TE/flip angle=7.25ms/3ms/7°) with an in -plane resolution of 1.3 mm, and 1 869 
mm slice thickness, will be collected for sp atial normalization, positioning the slice prescription, and for 870 
subsequent morphometric analysis. Then a T1 -weighted (TR/TE/flip angle=8sec/39msec/90°) and a T2 - 871 
weighted (TR/TE/flip angle=10sec/48ms/120°) sequence will be used to gather sets of images to assist in 872 
registration of the functional data to the high -resolution anatomical scan. Functional MRI images (blood 873 
oxygenation level dependent or BOLD; Kwong et al 1992) will be acquired using a gradient echo T2* - 874 
weighted sequence (TR/TE/flip angle= 2 sec/4 0msec/90°).  Prior to each scan, four images are acquired 875 
and discarded to allow longitudinal magnetization to reach equilibrium. The T1, T2, and gradient -echo 876 
functional images will be collected in the same plane ( whole brain acquisition; axonal  slices an gled 877 
perpendicular to the AC -PC line) with the same slice thickness ( 3.125 mm, skip 1mm; voxel size  3.125 x 878 
3.125 x 3.125  mm), excitation order ( descending ) and phase encoding ( head -to-foot).  During fMRI, 879 
participants will complete four functional tasks : 880

1. Masked Affect Task (MAT) :  This task , first developed by our group back in the mid -1990’s  881 
[110], presents a series of facial expressions displaying happiness or fear, each for only 16 msec and 882 
masked immediately by a neu tral image from a different poser for 184 msec  (Figure 14).  At this rate of 883 
presentation, the “masked” affective expression is not consciously perceived, yet is still processed via an 884 
extrastriate pathway to the amygdala that bypasses normal cortical proc essing.  This task has been shown 885 
to selectively activate the amygdala in healthy participants.  Moreover, in our laboratory, exaggerated 886 
amygdala response has been found on this task in patients with PTSD [27].  Our laboratory has extensive 887 
experience usin g this task with patients with PTSD and  anxiety disorders [27, 111-115], and healthy 888 
adults and children [116-118]. 889 
2. Extinction Recall (ER) :  This task measures the 890 
retention of the extinction memory established during the 891 
previous fear conditioning session.  While undergoing fMRI, 892 
participants will view the previously conditioned images from 893 
the Fear Conditioning and E xtinction Task.  Here, 8 CS+E, 8 894 
CS+U, and 16 CS - trials will be presented (without any 895 
shocks).  Skin conductance responses will also be collected 896 
while participants are undergoing the scan.  During this task, 897 
the contrast of interest will be CS+E vs. CS+U, permitting the 898 
isolation of psychophysiological and brain responses that are 899 
specific to extinction recall.  900 
3. Resting State Scan (RS) :  Emerging evid ence suggests 901 
that t he brain shows stable patterns of functional connectivity 902 
during the resting state and that these patterns may be 903 
particularly useful in elucidating specific networks [119-122].  904 
Therefore, in addition to the probe tasks described above subjects will also be scanned for 10 minutes 905 
with eyes closed and instructed to let their “mind wander.”  Functional connectivity will be evaluated 906 
from pre - to post -treatment for the two conditions .   907 
4. Anticipation Task: The Emotional Anticipation Task was adapted on the basis of Aupperle  et al.’s 908 
(2013) study design and lasts a total of 7 min and 8 seconds. Two version of the anticipation tasks will be 909 
used, in order to have two different versions of the tasks for the baseline and follow up visit. Participants 910 
are presented with a grey ba ckground with a black arrow alternating randomly in its direction from left to 911 
right (Baseline). Participants are instructed to indicate via button press which direction the arrow was 912 
pointing in. Participants are told that when the screen turns yellow, a negative picture will soon appear 913 
(Negative Anticipation (NA)). If the screen turns blue, a positive picture will soon appear (Positive 914 
Anticipation (PA)), and if the screen turns green a positive or a negative picture will soon appear 915 
(Uncertain Anticipat ion (UA)).  The picture stimuli consist  of positive and negative pictures from the 916 
International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The most unpleasant (e.g., mutilated bodies) as well as the 917 
most pleasant (e.g., animals) pictures were chosen from the picture set.  The aim of this task is to 918 
investigate whether the intervention changes neural responses during anticipation of negative stimuli.   919

Spectroscopic Neuroimaging :   While all MRI 920 
hardware used during th is study is FDA -approved, a s part of the 921 
MRI session, one MRI sequence will be conducted  that uses 922 
investigational software that enables collection of unique 923 
spectroscopic data. This scan, referred to as the MEGA -PRESS 924 
sequence, uses Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) 925 
to measure chemicals in the brain, specifically, cerebral 926 
metabol ites and neurotransmitter concentrations.  It is very 927 
similar to other FDA -approved MRS sequences, but it does a 928 
better job at quantifying certain metabolites, namely, GABA.  929 
Per the Master Research Agreement (MRA) between Siemens 930 
and the University of Ari zona, as a Works in Progress (WIP), the 931 
MEGA -PRESS sequence complies with all FDA guidelines for 932 
magnetic resonance imaging (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory - 933 
information/search -fda-guidance -documents/criteria -significant - 934 
risk-investigations -magnetic -resonance -diagnostic -devices - 935 
guidance -industry -and) and is suitable for te sting in a clinical 936 
environment. Because of this, the MEGA -PRESS sequences does not increase the risk to subjects . 937 
A key element of the proposed project involves assessment of changes in brain neurochemistry 938 
as a function of 6 -weeks of light therapy treatm ent and associated changes in sleep quality.  Growing 939 
evidence suggests that some of the deficits in memory and emotional regulation that occur for patients 940 
with PTSD are related to alterations in neurochemistry within key regions of the hippocampus and AC C 941 
(Karl & Werner, 2010).  In particular, patients with PTSD show decreased NAA in the hippocampus and 942 
ACC, as well as reduced concentrations of choline in the hippocampus and increased levels in the ACC.  943 
These are often compared directly as ratios relativ e to creatine (Cr).  Assuming that improved sleep leads 944 
to improvement in emotional functioning, this will permit us to identify a potential mechanism for this 945 
improvement.  Presently,  for 1H MRS imaging, two voxels will be placed, one encompassing the dor sal 946 
anterior cingulate cortex  just anterior to the genu of the corpus collosum and another placed at the 947 
amygdala -hippocampal complex within the mesial temporal lobe (see figure  15).  All 1H MRS 948 
measurements will be performed using a Siemens TIM Trio 3T whole body high -speed imaging device 949 
(Siemens Medical Systems, Iselin, NJ) and a 32-channel single -tuned (170.3 MHz) “birdcage ” coil for 950 
radiofrequency (RF) transmission and signal reception , both of which are approved by the FDA .  The 951 
following brain metabolites will be collected and analyzed : alanine (Ala), aspartate (Asp), choline ( Cho), 952 
Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) , Glutamate ( Glu), Glutamine ( Gln), glutathione (GSH), glycine 953 
(Gly), myo -I, N-acetylaspartate  (NAA ), N-acetylaspatylglutamate (NAAG), creatine ( Cr), 954 
phosphocreatine (PCr), scyllo -inositol (Scy), taurine (Tau) and lactate (Lac).   955

At Home Six-Week Light Exposure Treatment :    At the 956 
conclusion of Visit 2, participants  will be randomly assigned to either the BL 957 
condition or the PL condition , using computerized permuted block 958 
randomization to match groups by gender .  All participants will be given a 959 
goLITE® unit to take home and provided with detailed training and 960 
instruction on its use .  Depending on the light condition assigned, the 961 
goLITE will include either blue or amber  LEDs .  The goLITE BLU is 962 
commercially available and has a narrow bandwidth, peaking at  = 469 nm, 963 
at 214 L ux, and panel irradiance mW/cm2) = 1.23 at 20 cm.  A similar 964 
appearing amber LED system (goLITE AMBER) will be employed for the 965 
PL devices, but will peak at  = 578 nm, at 188 Lux, and total irradiance 966 
(mW/cm2) = 0.35.   Both of these devices have undergone  extensive ocular 967 
safety testing (Sliney, 2009) and have been used successfully without incident in our prior study .  Each 968 
participant will be instructed to use the unit each morning (within 2 hours of awakening and prior to 10:30  969 
am) for 30 minutes per da y over the next 6 weeks.   Participants are permitted to engage in sedentary 970 
activities (e.g., read, watch TV, surf the internet, eat, engage in daily hygiene) while the unit is activated, 971 
as long as the light is within arm’s reach and projecting to the eye s from within a 45 -degree angle to either 972 
side (see Figure 14) . A wattage use meter will be connected to the goLITE device to measure participant 973 
compliance in terms of duration, timing, and intensity of light exposure. They will  be asked to record this 974 
via the Sleep Diaries A & B . This same procedure 975 
has been used in our prior work and has been well 976 
tolerated  by participants, allowing them  977 
considerable  flexibility to choose whether to use the 978 
light immediately upon arising, or after morning 979 
hygiene, meals, drive, etc., but while still ensur ing 980 
that all treatme nt occur in the morning hours.   981 
Safety and efficacy of the device itself is not 982 
being tested, r ather, the effects of specific 983 
wavelengths of light on human performance; the 984 
device is simply used as a convenient method to 985 
deliver the light in a controlled and reliable way in 986 
order to assure the scientific validity of the results.   987 
Actigraphic Sleep M easurement :  Daily sleep, activity, and light exposure will be collected 988 
via the Respironics Actiwatch Spectrum®.  This actigraphic wrist -watch device uses a built -in 989 
accelerometer to  unobtrusively  measure and record ambulatory activity levels and sleep 24  hours a day.  990 
This data can then be analyzed via sleep analysis software (Actiware 5®) that includes algorithms that 991 
transform activity data into probable sleep periods.  The Actiwatch Spectrum also includes three -color 992 
light sensors that provide irradian ce and luminous lux recordings in three -color bands of the visible 993 
spectrum, including red, green, and blue  (Figure 17) .  The light sensor will be used to verify that subjects 994 
are in fact undergoing the daily light treatment and will permit covariation of other daily light sources in 995 
the statistical analyses.  The device also records periods of off -wrist time to determine compliance.  Data 996

sleep efficie ncy, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset (WASO), and fragmentation index will be 998 
calculated for each day and averaged across the study period.   999 
Compliance Monitoring:   Compliance with the study requirements  will be monitored in 1000  
several ways.  Firs t, participants are required to log into the internet each day to complete the sleep diary 1001  
and report timing of light usage.  This is an effective means for monitoring general compliance.  On -line 1002  
compliance will be monitored, and participants will be cont acted by phone and/or email if they have not 1003  
logged in for more than 48 hours.  Second, use of the lights will be monitored by a recording device built 1004  
into the light device that records a time stamp each time the light is engaged.  Third, participants are  1005  
required to wear the wrist acticgraph at all times.  This device includes a light monitor that is sensitive to 1006  
various wavelengths of light.  This light data will be evaluated at the conclusion of the study to identify 1007  
whether there is a detectible change  in blue/red light during the period of reported light exposure.  1008  
Post-Treatment Assessment and Scan :   At the completion of 6-weeks of BL or PL, participants 1009  
will return to the imaging center for Visit 3 to complete an 1010  
identical series of assessment and neuroimaging tasks as in 1011  
Visit 2, as well as a repeated administration of the CAPS.   1012  
Participants will  return  wrist actigraphs  and the goLITE  1013  
device.  1014  
Please note that s ubjects will be offered and required 1015  
to wear earplugs and/or earphones t o minimize the scanner 1016  
noise. Subjects will be able to converse with a staff member 1017  
via a microphone and speaker system at all times during the 1018  
scanning session. Subjects will be provided with an 1019  
emergency button to indicate an immediate concern. 1020  
Subjects may ask to have a scan stopped and discontinue 1021  
participation in the study at any time.  1022  
Follow -Up. After subjects complete  the study, prior 1023  
to data analysis , subjects will be sent an email (Follow -up 1024  
Script.doc ) with a link to an online ICF Addendum  1025  
(PTSD_I CF_addendum.doc ) and, if they agree, subjects 1026  
will complete a 10- to 15 -minute follow -up online survey,  1027  
where they will be administered the PCL -5, PHQ -9, and be 1028  
asked about general sleep problems using the ESS and ISI . 1029

indices and sleep variabl es will be analyzed using correlation and linear regression models in SPSS.  Tests 1046  
for normality will be conducted for all variables.  In the case on non -normality, appropriate data 1047  
transformation or non -parametric techniques will be employed (e.g., Kruska l-Wallis or Friedman tests for 1048  
ANOVA; Mann -Whitney U or Wilcoxon for 2 -group comparisons).  Inflation of Type I error will be 1049  
controlled first through the use of planned comparisons based on the hypotheses and the use of protected 1050  
omnibus F -tests.  Post -hoc analyses will be undertaken with protected comparisons (e.g., Tukey) or 1051  
Bonferroni adjustment.  Functional MRI data will be analyzed using statistical parametric mapping 1052  
(SPM8 ) software , implementing the general linear model  to compare pre - to post -thera py changes in 1053  
functional responses between the active and placebo groups and across diagnostic groups, and sleep 1054  
variables will be tested as covariates in the models.  Finally, proton spectroscopy data for each of the 1055  
metabolites will be quantified and com pared for pre - to post -therapy changes in metabolite concentrations 1056  
between the active and placebo treatment groups and across diagnostic groups.   Type I error during 1057  
neuroimaging will be controlled via whole brain False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction or small volume 1058  
corrections using Family Wise Error (FWE) rate within a priori  specified regions of interest.  To handle 1059  
missing data, we will first determine the potential cause of the data loss.  Statistically, missing data can be 1060  
considered as falling into three types:  1) missing completely at random, 2) missing at random, or 3) 1061  
missing not at random.  The type of missing data will dictate the approach.  Assuming type 1, and that the 1062  
number of missing values is low, we will use a standard listwise deletion procedure.  However, assuming 1063  
that a larger number of values is missing, and data are not missing completely at random, we will be able 1064  
to apply missing data imputation methods.  1065  
Power Analysis :  A power analysis based on a proposed sample size of 90 subjects suggested that 1066  
with an omnibus 2 between -groups (BL vs. PL) x 2 within -subjects (pre - vs post -treatment) mixed design, 1067  
assuming a moderate effect size (f = .25), and  = .05, there should p rovide be adequate  power to detect 1068  
most effects.  First, the primary hypotheses of the study focus on interaction effects  across groups  (i.e., 1069  
treatment x session  interactions), which will have exceptional  power (1 -) = 0.99 to detect a moderate 1070  
effect siz e at  = .05  (see Figure 18A) .  Paired comparisons within each group of will also have excellent  1071  
power of . 91 to detect moderate effect size changes (d = .50), with 2-tailed  tests (see Figure 18B) .  1072  
Without regard to group differences, a sample size of 90 would yield power = 0. 84 to detect a moderate 1073  
linear association (i.e., r  .30) between a predictor variable (e.g., average sleep; change in sleep 1074  
parameters, PTSD symptom severity; neurocognitive performance; etc.) and an outcome variable (e.g., 1075  
fMRI sig nal intensity changes; spectroscopic metabolite changes; etc.), with a two -tailed test at  = .05  1076  
(see Figure 16).  Thus, the proposed sample size of n = 45 per group appears to provide adequate power 1077  
for testing the major hypotheses of the proposed study.    1078

Functional Image Pre-Processing:   Functional neuro imaging data will be preprocessed in SPM 8 1079  
[123].  Following standard algorithms, function al images will be slice-time corrected, co -registered to 1080  
their anatomical T1 -weighted images, realigned, unwarped to correct for field inhomogeneity, normalized 1081  
to the standard three -dimensional space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), spatially  smoothed 1082  
using an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full width half maximum [FWHM] = 6 mm), and resliced to 2x2x2 1083  
mm isotropic voxels using sinc interpolation.  Depending on the specific task, functional data  will be 1084  
convolved to a n event -related or  boxcar wavef orm based on  the experimental design and the canonical 1085  
hemodynamic response function.   Artifact detection will be conducted with the Artifact Detection Tool 1086  
(ART) program.  Images with global intensities exceeding 3 standard deviations or scan -to-scan 1087  
move ment exceeding 1mm will be statistically regressed out of the design matrix.  For event related 1088  
analyses, individual subject motion parameters will also be included as nuisance regressors in the design 1089  
matrix.  1090  
FMRI Statistical Analysis :  At the first stage , activation during the conditions of interest will be 1091  
fitted using the general linear model in SPM8  for each subject individually.  This procedure yields a  1092  
statistical parametric map that isolate s the activity unique to the condition of interest (e.g., ma sked affect) 1093  
relative to the activity associated with the control condition (e.g., simple perception of neutral facial 1094  
expressions).  Thus, for each subject, a “contrast image” will be produced that reflects the pattern of 1095  
BOLD signal change due to the ind ependent variable for each task.   At the second stage, subject specific  1096  
contrast images will be entered as the dependent variables in a series of random effects analyses in SPM8  1097  
[124].  Functional data will be a nalyzed from two approaches, including region of interest (ROI) analyses 1098  
and whole brain exploratory analyses.  1099  
1. ROI Analyses .  First, a series of region of interest (ROI) analyses will be performed.  The 1100  
primary hypotheses for the MAT involve changes in the amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus, and 1101  
ventromedial prefrontal cortex for the MAT , whereas the  ACC and dorsolateral prefr ontal cortex are 1102  
hypothesized to differ across groups for the MSIT. Consequently, ROIs will be placed in these regions, 1103  
defined according to the boundaries of the published anatomical atlas of Tzourio -Mazoyer and colleagues 1104  
[125] and PickAtlas Utility [126].  These ROI analyses will be carried out at a n FDR small volume 1105  
corrected  threshold of p = .05, k (extent) = 10.  Each of the probe tasks has been selected because of its 1106  
prior involvement in the neuro circuitry of PTSD.  1107  
2. Whole Brain Exploratory Analyses .  Furthermore, whole brain analyses will be undertaken to 1108  
examine global patterns of activation for  each of the previously described analyses.  Because these 1109  
analyses will be exploratory in nature, they will be evaluated at a stringent correction for multiple 1110  
comparisons using a whole brain family -wise error (FWE) correction of p < .05, k = 10.  1111  
3. Resting  State Functional Connectivity Analysis :  Preprocessed resting state data will be 1112  
analyzed using the fMRI Functional Connectivity Toolbox (CONN).  Physiological and other noise 1113  
sources are reduced through the implementation of a CompCor strategy implemente d within the toolbox.  1114  
For each subject, gray and white matter masks will be created from the previously segmented images in 1115  
SPM8 and entered as nuisance covariates in the analyses, as will subject specific motion parameters.  1116  
Regions of Interest (ROIs) wi ll be created from the Automated Anatomical Labeling Atlas [125].  ROI to 1117  
ROI and seed -to-voxel analyses will be run individually at the first level and then imported  into a second 1118  
level random effects group analysis.  Primary s eed regions for connectivity analyses will include the 1119

subgenual and rostral ACC, VMPFC, and amygdala.  Data will be analyzed at an FDR corrected 1120  
significance level of p < 05.  1121  
MRS Analyses : The goal will be to determine whether BL treatment is more effective than PL at 1122  
altering bran metabolites that are associated with alertness, cognitive processing, and inhibitory capacity.  1123  
All MRS processing will be carried -out in a fully automated fashion us ing methods previously published 1124  
by our group [127].  Metabolite ratios will be derived as a ratio of each raw metabolite integral to the total 1125  
sum of the creatine and phosphocreatine integrals, and will be T1 -corrected using values previously  1126  
reported in the literature.  Our primary endpoints of interest are Glu (excitatory neurotransmitter), GABA 1127  
(inhibitory neurotransmitter), and NAA (marker of neuronal energy production).  Standard linear and 1128  
mixed model approached will be employed for comp aring metabolite ratios between the active BL and 1129  
placebo light conditions within the dorsal ACC and amygdala -hippocampal complex.  As described 1130  
above, all analyses will be undertaken with α = .05, employing corrections for multiple comparisons (e.g., 1131  
Tuke y post -hoc corrections; Bonferroni corrections) as appropriate. We expect that the active BL 1132  
condition will lead to increased levels of GABA, N-acetyl -aspartate (NAA), and choline (Cho), and 1133  
reduced glutamate  and phosphocreatine (Cr) in the amygdala -hippoc ampal complex and anterior cingulate 1134  
gyrus  compared to the PL condition.  Furthermore, it is expected that these changes will be linearly 1135  
related to changes in sleep parameters and cognitive/symptom score changes from pre - to post - 1136  
assessment.  1137  
8) Risks to subj ects 1138  
 Participation in this study may involve some risks or discomforts, which are described below.  1139  
 1140  
 During the study visits, subjects may be asked some questions during the brief clinical interview 1141  
and on the questionnaires that deal with personal or emotional matters. These questions might cause 1142  
psychological discomfort. Subjects may refuse to answer any questions that make them uncomfo rtable. If 1143  
they reveal during these sessions that they are currently or have recently had thoughts of self -harm or 1144  
suicide, appropriate follow -up evaluation and referral for care will be ensured. Results of the clinical 1145  
evaluation will be kept in a locked cabinet and identified using only subject unique study identification 1146  
number.  1147  
 Subjects may find the sensation of the electric shock used in the picture -viewing task to be 1148  
uncomfortable. However, they will be able to choose their own level of shock, which should be strong 1149  
enough to annoying or uncomfortable, but not painful. The apparatus that provides the shock is powered 1150  
by a 9 -volt electric battery, identical to those used in toy electronics. These mild shocks are not dangerous 1151  
or harmful, but may be ann oying.  1152  
Unlike X -rays or CAT scans, magnetic resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing 1153  
radiation. Instead, it uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to collect the images and data. With  the 1154  
exception of one sequence ( MEGA -PRESS spectroscopy work -in-progress (WIP) pulse sequence ), all 1155  
MRI procedures involved are standard. The radio frequency exposure, magnetic fields and gradients, and 1156  
noise levels produced by the MRI sequences used in this study are no greater than or fall below the FDA's 1157  
limits, so subjects are exposed to no greater risk than those of routine MRI scans (see MEGA -PRESS 1158  
Sequence Manual.pdf  and Request allowance for running MEGA -PRESS WIP  (Rouse, Trouard, et al, 1159

2019 ). During the scan, subjects will wear a birdcage coil around their heads; this is an FDA -cleared 1160  
device and its use in this study will be as approved by FDA.  1161  
 1162  
The four risks the FDA associates with MRI scanning are: 1) tissue heating due to RF fields, 2) 1163  
peripheral nerve stimulation due to quick changes in magnetic field,  3) hearing damage due to acoustic 1164  
noise, and 4) force and torque on magnetic materials in or on a participant. That said, the FDA lists “MRI 1165  
Devices within FDA specified parameters” as non -significant risk devices. The research scanner in the 1166  
TBIR fits wi thin this description. With regard to tissue heating and peripheral nerve stimulation, the 1167  
Siemens scanner is not capable of running a sequence that is outside the FDA safety guidelines. With 1168  
regard to hearing damage, volunteers wear ear protection when in  the scanner. In addition, any non -FDA 1169  
approved sequence conducted is within FDA parameters for tissue heating, peripheral nerve stimulation, 1170  
and hearing damage.  1171  
 1172  
With regard to force and torque on magnetic materials, anyone entering the magnet room must r emove 1173  
all metal objects from their body. In addition, significant risks may exist for people with:  1174  
 1175  
• Cardiac pacemakers  1176  
• Metal clips on blood vessels (also called stents)  1177  
• Artificial heart valves  1178  
• Artificial arms, hands, legs, etc.  1179  
• Brain stimulator d evices  1180  
• Implanted drug pumps  1181  
• Ear implants  1182  
• Eye implants or known metal fragments in eyes  1183  
• Exposure to shrapnel or metal filings (wounded in military combat, sheet metal workers, welders, and 1184  
others)  1185  
• Other metallic surgical hardware in vital areas  1186  
• Certain tattoos with metallic ink  1187  
• Certain transdermal (skin) patches such as NicoDerm (nicotine for tobacco dependence), Transderm 1188  
Scop (scopolamine for motion sickness), or Ortho Evra (birth control)  1189  
 1190  
Volunteers are screened before entering the magnet to be sure they do not have any of these items. If 1191  
subjects  are unsure whether they have any of these items in their body, they will be informed  that most 1192  
would have been implanted as part of a surgical procedure , and that trying to remember past op erations 1193  
may help them  remember if they have any implanted devices or history of exposure to shrapnel or metal 1194  
filings, and, if so, they will not be able to participate in this study.  1195  
 1196  
Significant risks also can arise if certain materials (many types of metal objects) are brought into the 1197  
scanning area, as they can be pulled into the magnet at great speed , which might  cause serious injury. 1198  
Therefore, these types of items are not permitted in the scanning area. Subjects  will not be allowed to 1199  
bring anythin g with them  into the scanning room.  1200

The MR exams are painless, and except for pulsating sounds or vibrations, subjects will not be aware that 1202  
scanning is taking place.  1203  
 1204  
The scans will take place on a 3T scanner , which are approved by the FDA for routine c linical studies in 1205  
children and adults . However, as part of the MRI session, subjects  will receive an MRI scan that measures 1206  
chemicals in the brain , the MEGA -PRESS sequence,  that is not FDA approved, though  it does comply  1207  
with the same FDA guidelines used for routine FDA approved MRI scans. Therefore , all MRI scans used 1208  
in this study do not expose subjects  to any more risk that a routine MRI exam.  1209  
 1210  
Although there are no known risks from these scans, there could be adverse effects that are delayed or 1211  
very mi ld, such that they have not yet been recognized. Most people experience no ill effects from these 1212  
scans, but some people do report claustrophobia (fear of being in enclosed small spaces), dizziness, mild 1213  
nausea, headaches, and a metallic taste in their mou th, double vision, or the sensation of flashing lights. 1214  
Some subjects also experience feelings of panic and/or anxiety. These symptoms are rare, and if present, 1215  
disappear shortly after leaving the scanner.  In addition to these physical risks, the MRI syste m can be 1216  
psychologically unsettling to some volunteers that are bothered by loud noises or small spaces.  1217  
 1218  
Volunteers can ask to be removed from the scanner at any point during the procedure without any 1219  
repercussions.  1220  
 1221  
Steps taken to minimize risk:  1222  
 1223  
For the first three MRI risks described above, all sequences operate within the FDA limits of non - 1224  
significant risk. For the fourth risk, force/torque on magnetic materials, all volunteers are checked 1225  
multiple times for these materials before entering the magne tic field. In addition, volunteers can ask to be 1226  
removed from the scanner at any point during the procedure without any repercussions.  1227  
Subjects will be screened for any contraindications to MRI and magnetic materials. The investigator or 1228  
MRI Technologist w ill explain the MRI system and the scan that they are about to take part in. The 1229  
volunteer will be asked to lie down on the scanner bed. Some part of the volunteer ’s body may be covered 1230  
or enclosed within an FDA or UofA HSPP approved MRI coil. The voluntee r may be asked to interact 1231  
with a peripheral system such as a button, joystick, or TV system before, during, or after the scan.  1232  
 1233  
Although both light device s (placebo [PL] and blue light [BLT]) are  safe to use  (Sliney, 2009 , 1234  
2006; Apollo Health , 2009 ), we will minimize unnecessary direct exposure to the bright lights to reduce 1235  
the possibility of discomfort or persistent visual symptoms. Although looking directly at the LEDs for 1236  
brief periods is not known to be harmful, it is unnecessary and may lead to  glare, eyestrain, or other 1237  
irritating visual sensations that can be easily avoided by keeping the panel at an angle in the peripheral 1238  
vision. It is sufficient that the light reaches the eyes indirectly from the side. Looking directly at the LEDs 1239  
does not provide any additional benefit. Prolonged staring at the LEDs could lead to significant eye 1240  
irritation, lingering afterimages, or other symptoms such as headaches. Although the light emissions of 1241  
the device are well within safe limits and no problems have ever been reported, we want to minimize any 1242  
risks or discomforts. While extremely unlikely, it is possible that prolonged continuous staring at the 1243

LEDs could lead to more severe changes in vision such as photoretinitis, a condition that is most 1244  
commonly a ssociated with looking for too long at very bright light sources such as snow on a bright 1245  
sunny day or looking at the sun during an eclipse. Such a condition could lead to temporary or long -term 1246  
vision problems. As individuals may differ in sensitivity to light, some subjects may experience eye 1247  
fatigue or irritation during the use of the light exposure device. If subjects  notice any unusual sensations 1248  
or discomforts, they are advised to discontinue use and to contact the Principal Investigator immediately.  1249  
 1250  
 Thus, to minimize risk, subjects  will be instructed via the following for the goLITE Blu:  1251  
 1252  
NOTE: DO NOT STARE DIRECTLY AT THE LIGHTS ON THE LED PANEL.  1253  
IT IS SUFFICIENT THAT THE LIGHT REACHES YOUR EYES DIRECTLY FROM THE 1254  
SIDE.  1255  
 1256  
 There is the potential for skin irritation due to the heart rate monitor leads  or wearing the 1257  
actiwatch . This can be alleviated with use of lotions and/or creams.  1258  
 1259  
9) Potential benefits to subjects  and/or society  1260  
 It is not anticipated that subjects will derive direct benefit from participation in the proposed 1261  
study. However, it is anticipated that findings from this study will help to advance scientific and medical 1262  
understanding of treatment of PTSD and sleep disorders. The study will provide basic scientific 1263  
information about the effects of short wavelength light on sleep patterns and potential treatment of PTSD. 1264  
Such information may improve the ability to treat sleep disorders and cognitive performance among 1265  
patients with PTSD.  1266  
 1267  
Incidental MRI findings:  1268  
Study  assessments (labs, MR I scans, psychological  assessments, etc.) are not intended to provide medical 1269  
benefit. Personnel involved conducting this study may not be trained or licensed to clinically review lab 1270  
findings, MRI images, etc. If study personnel notice something irregular  in subjects’ study information, 1271  
the investigator may provide de -identified reports or images to a licensed physician, radiologists, or other 1272  
qualified practitioner for further review. In the unlikely case that such a qualified clinician determines a 1273  
findi ng to be an irregularity, subjects will be advised to consult their primary care physician. Subjects 1274  
may be provided copies of their study information or MRI images for this purpose, but this medical 1275  
consultation will be on subjects’ own time and at their cost. If subjects are provided a copy of their study 1276  
information, we make no promises as to the clinical value of the data. The University of Arizona and its 1277  
employees have no funds set aside for the payment of treatment expenses that may arise from subjec ts 1278  
volunteering for an MRI scan.  1279  
 There may be instances in which an abnormality exists but is not identified in our analyses. Our 1280  
team is not  trained in clinically diagnosing issues pertaining to abnormalities found in the collected data. 1281  
Further, our dat a analyses are not intended to treat, diagnose, or replace the expertise of a medical doctor 1282  
or a medical diagnosis.  As such, the University of Arizona and its employees are not responsible for 1283

abnormalities that go undetected through participation in thes e research activities and subjects will be told 1284  
that they should not rely on our data or analyses to reveal abnormalities.  1285  
 1286  
10) Provisions to protect the privacy of subjects  and the confidentiality of data  1287  
 Collected data are computerized. A unique study -specific ID number is assigned to each subject 1288  
and used for identification purposes. A separate password -protected data file, stored on a stand -alone PC, 1289  
maintains  the ID number and identifying information for each participant.  Only the PI a nd Project 1290  
Coordinator have access to that file.   1291  
Data collected will be entered into REDCap in de -identified format. Subjects’ identities will be linked 1292  
via a coded/subject ID. REDCap requires authorized users to enter a username and password unique to 1293  
each study staff member.  1294  
Study data will be maintained on secure servers maintained by University of Arizona College of 1295  
Medicine IT, accessible only through secure UA networks by UA -affiliated computers. Only authorized 1296  
researchers associated with this pro ject will be given access via a unique medadmin username and 1297  
password.  1298  
 All information regarding experimental subjects are kept in a locked f ile cabinet in the University 1299  
of Arizona Department of Psychiatry . The signed consent forms are stored separately from the research 1300  
data in a locked file  cabinet in the Department of Psychiatry . Any study forms that contain personally 1301  
identifying information for our participants (e.g., signed consent forms, payment information) are kept 1302  
separately from research record s and data in separate locked filing cabinets in the Department of 1303  
Psychiatry . All subject voice recordings will be used to verify that the study team collected complete 1304  
responses and will be verified and deleted the same day they are collected. These reco rdings will only be 1305  
linked to subject IDs during that period.  1306  
 The Imaging Center will be provided with Subject ID numbers only. MRI  Records are kept in a 1307  
locked office. Subject identifiable information  is not used for research data. HIPAA  requirements wil l be 1308  
followed  to protect subject confidentiality . 1309  
For subjects who agree, their information will be saved for future use to allow possible contact for 1310  
other studies conducted by the PI . 1311  
A final study report will be made available to the sponsor, the Department of Defense (DoD). Only 1312  
non-identifiable data will be shared. DoD maintains a secure file transfer system, "DoD SAFE," which 1313  
can be used to securely transfer study information to the sponsor.  1314  
 Research d ata will be stored in a secure area for a period of 6 years following the conclusion of the 1315  
study. All data and links will be destroyed as soon as possible . 1316  
11) Cost to subjects   1317  
 There are no costs to subjects, except  for their time.  1318  
 1319  
12) Subject compensation  1320  
 Potential subjects who complete pre -screening surveys ( Recruitment Survey.pdf ) through 1321  
crowdsourcing websites will be compensated in line with the specific site’s payment policy  (e.g.,  Amazon 1322

Mechanical Turk will pay $0.60 after the survey is completed , a rate of $0.12 per min in compliance with 1323  
research guidelines for fair wages within the MTurk community, with a predetermined 5 -minute effort 1324  
allotted ).  1325  
 Subjects will receive $1200 for completion of all three study sessions, successful adhere nce to 1326  
daily light exposure treatment, and compliance with all study procedures and proper use of all study 1327  
equipment. This payment is also intended to cover all transportation expenses to and from the study site . 1328  
 If subjects choose to withdraw from the study prematurely or are disqualified for any reason, 1329  
subjects  will be compensated according to the following schedule  for the time subjects were undergoing 1330  
scanning and testing:  1331  
 1332  
• Discontinuation during or following the initial intake visit: $75 ($25/hour, 3 hours max for day), 1333  
following return and adherence of all study -related tasks and equipment.  1334  
• Discontinuation before the end of second visit: $17.05/hour, up to a maximum of 8.5 hours and 1335  
$145 for the day (i.e., m ax = $220 total for both days), following return and adherence of all 1336

necessary permissions to allow them to participate in this study.  If the pa rticipant is  on leave status, they 1364  
will be compensated for the 3 assessment sessions according to the schedule listed above.  1365  
 1366  
 The necessary information to capture receipt of subje ct payment will be collected via the Subject 1367  
Payment Form .  1368  
Method of payment:   Participants will be paid in cash or check. Patients may need to complete a W -9 1369  
(IRS Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification) in the Psychiatry business office 1370  
depending on the amount of compensation being provided for this s tudy and their extent of involvement.    1371  
 1372  
 1373  
13) Medical care and compensation for injury  1374  
 Subjects will be offered the care needed to treat any injury that directly results from taking part in 1375  
this research study.  We reserve the right to bill their insurance company or other third parties, if 1376  
appropriate, for the care they get for the injury.  We will try to have these costs paid for, but subjects may 1377  
be responsible for some of them.   1378  
 Injuries sometimes happen in research even when no one is at fault.  There are no plans to pay 1379  
subjects or give them other compensation for an injury, should on e occur.  However, they are not giving 1380  
up any of their legal rights by signing this form.  1381  
 If subjects think they have been injured or have experienced a medical problem as a result of 1382  
taking part in this research study, they are to tell the person in char ge of this study as soon as possible . 1383  
Siemens will pay for the actual cost of reasonable and necessary medical  treatment if a study subject 1384  
is injured during the Trial, to the extent the injury is a direct result of the proper  performance of study  1385  
procedur es that: 1386  
• are pursuant to the study plan , 1387  
• are not standard of care, unless included i n the study plan , 1388  
• would not otherwise have been performed but for a subject's participation in the study , 1389  
• are not a result of the negli gence or willful misconduct of UA personnel , and  1390  
• are not the result of normal progression of a study subject's underlying disease.  1391  
 1392  
14) Monitoring the data  for subject safety  1393  
 The principal investigator will oversee the collection, maintenance, and analysis of all data.  The 1394  
UA HSPP  will be contacted immediately in the case of unexpected adverse events. This is not a treatment 1395  
trial. Sai Parthasarathy, MD, is director of the sle ep laboratory and oversees collection of sleep PSG and 1396  
actigraphy data. Patricia Haynes, PhD, is an expert in PTSD and contributes to the design, development, 1397  
analysis and interpretation of data. In addition to Dr. Haynes, in the event a subject should rep ort suicidal 1398  
ideation and she is not available for consultation/assessment, Michael Grandner PhD, or another qualified 1399  
clinician, will provide assessment to promote the well -being of the subject. Ted Trouard, PhD, is an 1400  
expert in the development and applic ation of novel MRI technologies and will assist with collection of 1401

magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging, analysis strategies, and statistical analysis of MRS and DTI 1402  
data.  1403  
 Subjects may refuse to answer any questions that make them uncomfortable. In ad dition, subjects 1404  
may terminate their participation in the study at any time.  If significant psychopathology (e.g., threat of 1405  
harm to self or others) is discovered at any time during or after a subject’s visit, we will contact one of the 1406  
psychiatrists on s taff to determine the level of risk and establish a contract for safety.  If the subject does 1407  
not already have an established relationship with a psychiatrist, we will provide the appropriate referrals 1408  
for psychiatric evaluation.  1409  
 Assessment of MRI scanni ng-related safety issues will occur at every scanning session by the 1410  
study staff.  Risks to subjects will be minimized by following standard MRI procedures. Individual scans 1411  
will be aborted if any safety parameters are breached.  If the safety issue involv es the patient that cannot 1412  
be eliminated within the time course of the study, their involvement in the study will be terminated. If the 1413  
safety issue involves the scanner or the scanning environment, no further scans will be conducted from 1414  
that point, until  assurances are made that all safety parameters have returned to allowable limits.  1415  
 Female  participant s must have a negative pregnancy test before the MRI scan can be initiated. If 1416  
the results of the pregnancy test are positive, one of the clinically train ed study  investigators will explain 1417  
why the scan cannot be completed.  1418  
 No long -lasting physical or economic harm is anticipated during scanning. Every effort will be 1419  
made to reassure the patient and minimize any such discomforts while scanning. Subjects w ill be offered 1420  
and required to wear earplugs and/or earphones to minimize the scanner noise. Subjects will be able to 1421  
converse with a staff member via a microphone and speaker system at all times during the scanning 1422  
session. Subjects will be provided with an emergency button to indicate an immediate concern. Subjects 1423  
may ask to have a scan stopped and discontinue participation in the study at any time.  1424  
 In case of an adverse event, the  principal investigator will  evaluate and report such events  to the 1425  
UA HS PP per UA HSPP guidelines  as well as report to HRPO per federal guidelines.  1426  
The diagnostic assessment , MRI,  and heart rate measures may reveal previously unid entified 1427  
psychiatric disorders and/or  brain or  heart abnormalities the subject didn’t know they ha d. If any 1428  
abnormalities are identified, they  will be provided with information about the finding  and encouraged to 1429  
follow up with their primary care physician .  Subjects will be made aware that we are not providing 1430  
psychiatric, neuroradiological, or other clinical services; only that we will let them know in the event that 1431  
anything abnormal is noticed by the study team. We are unable to assume responsibility or offer 1432  
compensation for related medical costs that they make as a result of being informed of an a bnormal 1433  
finding.  1434  
There may be instances in which an abnormality exists but is not identified in our analyses. Our team 1435  
is not  trained in clinically diagnosing issues pertaining to abnormalities found in the collected data. 1436  
Further, our data analyses are not intended to treat, diagnose, or replace the expertise of a medical doctor 1437  
or a medical diagnosis. Thus, subjects will be awa re that they should not rely on our analyses to reveal 1438  
abnormalities in their data, and our lab claims no responsibility for abnormalities that go undetected 1439  
during participation in any research related activities.  1440

15) Withdrawal of subjects  1443  
 If any disquali fying condition is discovered during the study or if it becomes evident that the 1444  
participant is unable or unwilling to comply with study procedures, research study staff may withdraw 1445  
that individual from the study.  1446  
 Subjects can voluntarily withdraw from t he study at any time by speaking with the PI or study 1447  
team. The study will then ensure the subject withdraws from the study safely and will provide any 1448  
necessary follow -up care.   1449  
In order to protect subjects, study resources and the integrity of study data , the Principal 1450  
Investigator reserves the right to remove any subject at his discretion from the study. This will be 1451  
communicated to prospective subjects during the consent process.  1452  
If a subject chooses to withdraw from the study or his/her participation is ended prematurely, any 1453  
information collected up to that point  will be kept.  1454  
 1455  
16) Sharing of results with subjects   1456  
 Subjects will be informed of any new information that pertains to th eir rights or safety 1457  
immediately.  1458  
 Subjects have the right to see and get a copy of their health information that is used or shared for 1459  
treatment or for payment. To ask for this information, subjects will contact the person in charge of this 1460  
research study .  Subjects may only get such information after the research is finished.  1461

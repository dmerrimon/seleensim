Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria ESRD patients undergoing HD with major depression or dysthymia  Interventions • Engagement Interview • Sertraline drug therapy • Individual CBT Duration of study Up to 16 weeks Primary Outcomes • Efficacy of Engagement Interview: Initiate treatment for co-morbid depression • Comparative Efficacy of Sertraline vs. CBT: Change in depressive symptoms as per QIDS-C   Statistical Methodology • Efficacy of Engagement Interview: Fisher’s exact test to compare the proportions of patients who initiate treatment for comorbid depression. • Comparative Efficacy of Sertraline and CBT: Longitudinal mixed effects analyses will be applied to QIDS-C to compare means at Weeks 6 and 12 assessments between the CBT and Sertraline groups with the treatment group and clinical center as fixed effects in the model. An unstructured covariance matrix will account for serial correlations in outcome measurements within patients and the model will constrain baseline means of the outcome to be equal in the treatment groups. Linear contrasts will be constructed to estimate for each outcome variable: (a) mean difference in outcome between the treatment groups at Week 12 (primary assessment of treatment effect); (b) mean difference in outcome between groups at Week 6 (early treatment effect); (c) the average of the treatment effect estimates from (a) and (b) over Weeks 6 and 12 (persistence of early effect to 12 weeks); and (d) the difference in the estimated treatment effects from (a) and (b) between Week 6 and Week 12 (overall assessment of the treatment effect incorporating both follow-up visits).

1. Introduction  The prevalence of comorbid depression is about four-fold higher in patients undergoing maintenance HD than in the general population. A large number of studies have demonstrated that comorbid depression in patients undergoing HD is associated with worse patient-centered outcomes such as lower health-reported quality of life (QOL), greater burden of somatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cardiac events, hospitalizations, mortality, and withdrawal from dialysis [1-17]. Yet, there is wide variability in the diagnosis and treatment of comorbid depression in HD patients: the condition is not diagnosed in most patients, and when diagnosed, invariably not treated. This may, in part, be because of patients’ reluctance to accept the diagnosis and/or therapy and lack of evidence for efficacy of different treatments for depression in patients undergoing HD [18, 19].  ASCEND, ‘A Trial of Sertraline vs. CBT for End-stage Renal Disease Patients with Depression’, is the first multi-center randomized controlled trial that will enroll a racially/ethnically diverse group of English and Spanish-speaking individuals undergoing HD with comorbid major depression or dysthymia in up to 50 dialysis facilities in three metropolitan areas in the United States. The study will (1) compare the efficacy of engagement interview vs. a control visit for patients’ probability of starting treatment for comorbid depression; (2) compare the efficacy of sertraline vs. individual CBT for improvement of depressive symptoms in patients undergoing HD with comorbid major depression or dysthymia; and (3) study the evolution of depressive symptoms in a prospective longitudinal cohort of individuals who find all forms of treatment for the condition unacceptable. The results of the study will provide patients and healthcare providers with much needed information when weighing treatment options for comorbid depression. 1.1  Background  In the United States, over 400,000 individuals are undergoing HD for the treatment of ESRD in over 5000 dialysis facilities at an annual societal cost of $50 billion[20]. Most ESRD patients have multi-morbidity and report significant impairments in their quality of life (QOL) [1, 20-25]. They experience frequent care transitions as they are hospitalized on an average for 12 days every year, and one-third are re-hospitalized within 30 days of discharge[20]. In addition to the burden from disease, these individuals have a high burden of treatment. They receive HD treatments at least three times every week and each session is 3-4 hours long. They need to make numerous dietary changes including limiting daily fluid intake, and prescribed 10-12 medications with a median of 17 pills daily [23, 26]. With such a high burden of both disease and its treatment, it is imperative to identify effective 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 11  
interventions to improve patient-centered outcomes for HD patients and to enhance their ability to adhere to complex treatment regimens. Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in HD patients. In a recent systematic review of 198 cohorts with 46,505 patients, the summary prevalence of depression using the most stringent criteria for diagnosis, a structured clinical interview, was 23% [27]. This prevalence is over four-fold higher than in the general population [27]. Several studies have demonstrated a strong association between the severity of depressive symptoms and somatic symptom burden, sexual dysfunction, unemployment, and poor QOL in HD patients [1-6]. These outcomes are highly relevant to patients and influence their sense of wellbeing. Numerous studies have also consistently shown an association between the severity of depressive symptoms and cardiac events, hospitalizations, mortality, and withdrawal from dialysis [7-17]. Two potential mechanisms may explain these latter associations: First, depression is associated with systemic inflammation, which may be the proximate cause of morbidity and mortality [28, 29]. Second, depression makes self-management difficult leading to challenges in adherence with the complex treatment regimens for ESRD[30]; depressive symptoms are associated with higher likelihood of patients’ shortening the length of and/or skipping dialysis treatments, excessive fluid intake, and lower medication adherence [31-35]. Moreover, depression makes navigating care transitions, as frequently experienced by HD patients, difficult.  There is wide variability in the diagnosis and treatment of comorbid depression in HD patients. Even though HD patients have numerous symptoms that affect their well-being (viz., lack of energy, insomnia), physicians often do not recognize them and hence, don’t make any attempts to alleviate these symptoms [36]. Consistent with this, only 40% of 1089 HD patients with clinically significant depressive symptoms had been diagnosed and/or treated [10]. In the USRDS Special Study (ACTIVE-ADIPOSE), 25% of the participants had a CES-D score ≥ 18; only 5.6% of these individuals were receiving anti-depressants (Kutner, personal communication). While this may suggest the need for systematic screening for depression in the routine care of HD patients, even when implemented, an appropriate intervention is made infrequently [14, 37]. In a recent clinical trial, treatment was instituted in only 17% of patients, even though the diagnosis of depression was communicated to physicians directly or through nurses trained to offer treatment recommendations[38]. Hence, despite the high prevalence and robust data associating it with poor patient-centered outcomes, comorbid depression is neither diagnosed when present nor treated when identified in HD patients. This is likely due to lack of high-level generalizable evidence for the efficacy of treatment for the condition in this population.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 12  
1.2 Rationale for Study 1.2.1 Engagement Interview Past studies have also shown that many HD patients with comorbid depression do not wish to receive any form of treatment in part because of the lack of their understanding about depression, and the stigma associated with mental illnesses[38]. In a recent cluster randomized controlled clinical trial, 220 HD patients were randomly assigned to provide direct feedback along with evidence-based treatment algorithms, or to specific recommendations from nurses trained in symptom assessment and algorithms to patients. There was no significant difference in the implementation of treatment in the feedback arm (11 of 37) or the nurse recommendation arm (6 of 28). Consistent with this observation, the patients that responded to a survey administered to dialysis patients through our two patient advocacy partners, AAKP and DPC,  over 60% ranked “no specific intervention” as their top choice were they to suffer from comorbid depression. Similarly, over 40% of patients approached for participation in a recently completed trial of individual CBT in Brooklyn did not wish to undergo treatment for clinically significant depressive symptoms [39]. Hence, it is necessary to determine whether an engagement interview prior to discussing options increases the frequency of treatment for depressive symptoms. A large number of clinical trials have tested the efficacy of collaborative care for the treatment of depression in primary care in individuals with comorbid illnesses such as diabetes mellitus. An engagement interview, which is based on principles of motivational interviewing, is an integral component of the collaborative care arm of the studies. At least one study was shown to increase acceptance of evidence-based treatment of depression in low-income minority women who are new mothers[40]. In another recent study, 925 adult patients treated by 135 primary care clinicians were randomized to watch a depression engagement video, or a tailored interactive multimedia computer program, or a control visit [41]. The primary outcome was a composite measure of patient-reported anti-depressant drug recommendation, mental health referral, or both. Individuals randomized to interactive multimedia program were significantly more likely to achieve the primary outcome compared to controls (26% vs.26.3%); there was no significant difference between the use of depression engagement video and controls (17.5% vs. 16.3%). There are no data on the efficacy of this approach for the increasing the likelihood of treatment for depressive symptoms among patients undergoing HD.  The intervention to be tested in this study is the same as the one being used in studies of collaborative care for the treatment of depression and will include the presentation of a video along with motivational interviewing.

1.2.2 Comparative Efficacy of individual CBT and anti-depressant drug therapy There are two distinct approaches to treat depression – cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT, or psychotherapy), and anti-depressant drug therapy. While developing the research plan, responses from 61 ESRD patients indicated that not all treatment options for depression are equally acceptable to every HD patient, since the two approaches for treatment are very different; CBT necessitates multiple encounters with a therapist for patients who already need to go to a healthcare facility for dialysis sessions thrice weekly. Similarly, anti-depressant drug therapy would add to the already high pill burden for HD patients and may result in adverse effects in some patients. Moreover, the availability of each of these treatments varies, in part, by insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs to patients. Hence, the current study will compare two different treatments that, if found to be comparably efficacious, would offer options for treatment that are most acceptable and/or available to them and their providers. There is a paucity of data for the efficacy of either of these approaches for the treatment of comorbid depression in HD patients[42]. There is only one clinical trial that has compared the efficacy of citalopram and psychological training for improving depression and anxiety symptoms in patients undergoing hemodialysis [43]. In this single-center study, 44 patients undergoing hemodialysis in Iran who scored 8 or more on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were randomly assigned to either 20 mg/d of citalopram or six one-hour sessions of psychological training. While both treatments resulted in improvement in both anxiety and depressive symptoms, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of these two interventions. This study will compare the efficacy of CBT with anti-depressant drug therapy in a multi-center study in a larger multi-ethnic population to ensure high external validity.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is a short-term focused psychotherapy for many psychological problems including depression[44]. The focus of the therapy is on how the individual is thinking, behaving, and communicating today rather than on their childhood experiences. The therapist assists the patient in identifying specific distortions (cognitive assessment) and biases in thinking and provides guidance on how to change this thinking[45]. Thus, CBT helps the patients learn effective self-help skills that are used in homework assignments that target change in the way they think, feel, and behave now. CBT is action-oriented, practical, rational, and helps the patient gain independence and effectiveness in dealing with real-life issues. Numerous studies show that CBT is a first-line treatment for depression, is endorsed by clinical practice guidelines from the American Psychiatry Association, and does not have the negative side-effects of medications [42, 44]. It would also be expected to reduce relapse because patients may learn self-management techniques during therapy. The efficacy of CBT has been demonstrated in two pilot single-center studies of HD patients with 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 14  
comorbid depression, setting the stage for a larger-scale testing in a multi-center clinical trial (n=85 and 63) [39, 46]. In the first clinical trial conducted in Brazil, 41 patients in the intervention group received 12 weekly sessions of group CBT by a trained psychologist over three months and 44 patients received the usual treatment [39]. After three months of treatment, there was a significant improvement in depressive symptoms with BDI-II (3 month score, 14.1 ± 8.7 vs. 21.2 ± 9.1), major depression module on the MINI (3 month score, 1.9 ± 2.8 vs. 4.3 ± 2.9), burden of kidney disease, quality of social interaction, sleep, and mental component summary of health-related quality of life. In the second clinical trial conducted in Brooklyn, New York, 65 patients were randomly assigned to treatment first or wait-list control group [46]. Individual CBT was administered chair side while the patient underwent hemodialysis for three months. The intervention was associated with a significant improvement in depressive symptoms (Beck’s Depression II and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), quality of life (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form), and treatment adherence (inter-dialytic weight gain).  This study will test the efficacy of individual CBT, as tested in the latter clinical trial, among patients treated in up to 50 dialysis facilities operated by 7 providers in a geographically, ethnically, and culturally diverse and broader array of patients across a wider age range than done thus far. Anti-Depressant Drug Therapy with Sertraline:  Anti-depressant drugs are also a first-line treatment for depression in the general population [42, 47]. The data for anti-depressant drugs are even more limited, as patients with kidney diseases have been excluded from all major clinical trials [18, 19]. The benefits with drug therapy in otherwise healthy individuals cannot be extrapolated to those with chronic medical illnesses as evident from the lack of efficacy of anti-depressant drugs in large clinical trials of patients with asthma and congestive heart failure [48, 49]. Only two randomized trials of drug therapy for the treatment of depression have been reported for HD patients; only one tested the effect on depressive symptoms [48]. In a placebo-controlled trial of 14 patients undergoing hemodialysis, the improvement in depressive symptoms with 8-weeks of treatment with fluoxetine did not reach statistical significance [48]. At least nine non-randomized uncontrolled studies with 7-44 HD patients with comorbid depression each, treated with anti- depressant drugs, have been published, most of which demonstrated improvement in depressive symptoms [49-57]. These limited data allow us to posit a significant improvement in patient- reported outcomes with treatment of comorbid depression in HD patients.  Clinical practice guidelines indicate that only selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and bupropion meet the balance between efficacy and tolerability[42]. In ESRD patients, loss of renal excretory capacity further complicates drug selection [18]. A recent systematic review of 28 studies for 24 anti-
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 15  
depressant drugs in patients with kidney disease indicates that both serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and bupropion require dose reduction [18]. However, the magnitude of dose reduction cannot be readily determined as it is influenced by residual kidney function, which has not been considered in any study. These complicated dosing considerations are likely to make it difficult to balance efficacy and safety for these two drug classes for HD patients, and will likely preclude widespread adoption in clinical practice. Hence, sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, will be used as the anti-depressant for this clinical trial. The drug is metabolized to an inactive form before being excreted via the kidneys; is safe in patients with heart disease (SADHART trial); and available in generic form [18, 19]. In a study of ten HD patients receiving 200 mg sertraline/day for 21 days, the pharmacokinetics were no different than 12 age-matched healthy volunteers[58]. At least six studies including 128 dialysis patients treated with sertraline have been published [50, 56, 57, 59-61]; three reported improved hemodynamic stability during dialysis, and none reported any intolerability.  1.2.3 Evolution of depressive symptoms without any treatment in patients undergoing hemodialysis  In any individual, a diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia requires treatment. However, some patients are reluctant to either accept a diagnosis or treatment for depression. Over 60% of the patients with kidney disease that we surveyed ranked “no specific intervention” as their top preference for managing clinically significant depressive symptoms. In other patients, the available treatment options may not be feasible or tolerated; this may be from availability and/or insurance coverage for such treatment or unacceptable pill burden and/or adverse effects. As such, there is a need for us to understand the natural course of depressive symptoms in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. Such data are extremely sparse. In a single center observational cohort study, the data on the presence and severity of depressive symptoms using SCID-1 Depression module were available at two different time points, 16-months apart [62]. Of the 47 patients with sufficient follow-up data, 12 had a depressive disorder and 2 had dysthymia.  Upon follow-up, 7 of the 12 subjects with depressive disorder no longer qualified for a SCID diagnosed depressive disorder while 5 had persistent depression. Of the two patients with dysthymia, they met the SCID criteria for major depression at the second time point. In the SMILE study, 286 subjects completed at least one depression or pain assessment [63]. The subjects completed a median of 16 and total of 4452 monthly PHQ-9 assessments; moderate to severe depressive symptoms were reported on 788 (18%). At baseline, 73 patients (26%) reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms, 50% on at least one assessment, and 9% on ≥ 755 of assessments 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 16  
[63]. In this multi-center study, patients that do not find any form of treatment acceptable either within or outside the scope of the clinical trial will be followed for the presence and/or severity of depressive symptoms for up to 12 weeks. This will generate evidence to inform patients on what they should expect if they were to decide not to accept any form of treatment.   2. Study Objective and Aims  With the ASCEND study, we seek to test two hypotheses:  • Hypothesis One: In HD patients with comorbid current major depressive episode or dysthymia, an engagement interview significantly increases the frequency of treatment for comorbid depression. • Hypothesis Two: In HD patients with comorbid current major depressive episode or dysthymia, there is no significant difference in the efficacy of 12-week treatment with individual CBT in a dialysis facility or anti-depressant drug therapy.  2.1 Efficacy of the Engagement Interview The primary measure of efficacy will be % of patients undergoing hemodialysis with co-morbid depression who initiate treatment for the condition. This will be defined as one of the following: • Completing at least one psychotherapy session either as a part of the clinical trial or in the community within four weeks of the engagement/control visit. • Receiving a supply of anti-depressant drug either as a part of the clinical trial or the treating physician within four weeks of the engagement/control visit.  The secondary measure of efficacy will be the % of patients undergoing hemodialysis with co-morbid depression who are willing to accept treatment. This will be measured by the patient’s intent and will be defined as one of the following: • Signing the informed consent to be randomly assigned to individual CBT or drug therapy. • Receiving a referral by the research team and/or primary care physician and/or treating nephrologist to a therapist for psychotherapy in the community within two weeks of establishing an engagement/control visit. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 17  
• Receiving a prescription for anti-depressant drug therapy from primary care physician and/or treating nephrologist within two weeks of establishing an engagement/control visit.  2.2 Comparative Efficacy of individual CBT and sertraline drug therapy 2.2.1 Primary Measure of Efficacy The primary measure of efficacy will be the mean difference in QIDS-C score at Week 12 between treatment groups.  2.2.2 Secondary Measure of Efficacy Two groups of secondary measures of efficacy will be examined – Patient Reported Outcomes and Treatment Adherence. 2.2.2.1 Patient-Reported Outcomes The mean difference in the scores for each of the following scales at Week 12 between treatment groups: • Depressive Symptoms:  o Global Improvement Scale o Beck Depression Inventory-II • Anxiety Symptoms: o Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7- item (GAD-7) scale • Effect of Disease on Well-Being: o Sheehan Disability Scale • Fatigue: o Short-Form 36- Energy/Vitality Sub-scale • Health-Related Quality of Life: o One-item global quality of life scale o Satisfaction with Life Scale • Perceived Social Support: o Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support • Sleep: o Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index • Exercise: o Single item Activity Measure  2.2.2.2 Treatment Adherence This will comprise: 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 18  
• Non-Adherence with Dialysis as defined by the percentage of all dialysis sessions skipped and/or requested by the patient to be shortened by ≥ 10 minutes over the 12-week intervention period. Dialysis sessions missed due to hospitalization will not be included as a skipped treatment.  • Non-Adherence with Fluid Intake as defined by inter-dialytic weight gain (as % of post-dialysis weight) during Week 12 of the study. • Non-Adherence with Diet and/or Medications as defined by serum phosphorus level measured as a part of routine clinical care during the third month of participation in the study. 3. Study Design and Overview The ASCEND study is an open- label, randomized, controlled clinical trial of HD patients with comorbid depression, with accrual of participants over 24 months, comparing (1) a single engagement interview with a control visit for initiating treatment for comorbid depression in 200 patients; and (2) individual CBT with drug therapy for 12 weeks in 120 HD patients for depressive symptoms at three clinical sites - Seattle, Dallas, and Albuquerque (Figure 1 and Appendix 1). The length of intervention is selected based upon considerable data from the general population that indicate that individuals, who do not respond to CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy within 12 weeks, are highly unlikely to do so with continued treatment. In addition, up to 40 patients who refuse to accept treatment either within or outside the clinical trial, will also be followed for 12 weeks. These patients will not be a part of the clinical trial, will be offered treatment at each evaluation, and will undergo longitudinal assessment of depressive symptoms. An Engagement Interview will comprise a one-on-one session with the patient, during which the health-care provider will use reflective statements and non-judgmental listening techniques, will explore barriers to treatment, and will help the patient articulate ambivalence about engaging in treatment. This session will be enhanced with a 20-minute DVD that the subject will watch with the therapist in the dialysis facility [64]. The subject will be encouraged to take the DVD home with them and watch it with their family members as well.   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a short-term psychotherapy that will focus on how the individual is thinking, behaving, and communicating today rather than on their childhood experience. The therapist will assist the patient in identifying specific distortions (cognitive assessment) and biases in thinking and will provide guidance on how to change this thinking [45]. Thus, CBT will help the patients to learn effective self-help skills that will target change in the way they think, feel, and behave. CBT will be

administered while the patient is undergoing the HD procedure; however, alternative arrangements will be made for individual patients based upon their preferences.  Anti-Depressant Drug Therapy will be delivered with sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and the dose will be titrated using the Measurement Based Care Protocol.

4. Participant Selection and Withdrawal 4.1 Study Population 4.1.1 Pre-Screening:  All patients with ESRD being treated in participating dialysis facilities that meet the following three criteria, will be eligible to participate in pre- screening: (1) age ≥ 21 years; (2) undergoing maintenance HD ≥ 3 months; and (3) speak either English or Spanish. These individuals will be invited to complete the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Individuals with BDI score ≥ 15 will be invited to participate in subsequent study-related activities.  4.1.2 Subjects for Engagement Interview and Treatment of Comorbid Depression:  Inclusion Criteria: 1. Age ≥ 21 years; 2. Undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance HD for ≥ 3 months; 3. Able to speak either English or Spanish; 4. BDI-II score ≥ 15; and 5. Meets diagnostic criteria for either current major depressive episode or dysthymia on the MINI [65]. Exclusion Criteria: 1. Active suicidal intent; 2. Intensive psychotherapy (once weekly) for the treatment of depression;  3. Current drug therapy for the treatment of depression with serotonin receptor uptake inhibitors or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors at doses higher than listed in Appendix Two; 4. Evidence of cognitive impairment on Mini-Cog[66]; 5. Present or past psychosis or bipolar disorder I or II on the MINI[65]; 6. Alcohol or substance abuse diagnosed on the MINI or history of such abuse in the past three months [65]; 7. Life expectancy < 3 months, in the judgment of the site principal investigator; 8. Anticipated to receive living related donor kidney transplantation within 3 months; 9. Pregnancy, or lactation, or women of childbearing age not willing to use adequate birth control; 10.

 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 21  
12. Current use of class I anti-arrhythmic medications (e.g., propafenone, flecanide), pimozide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reserpine, guanethidine, cimetidine, tri-cyclic anti-depressants, triptans, tramadol, linezolid, tryptophan, and St. John’s wort; and 13. Known hypersensitivity to sertraline. 4.2 Participant Pre-Screening and Recruitment  4.2.1 Pre-Screening and Enrolling Subjects in Engagement Interview Phase All eligible patients with ESRD being treated in participating dialysis facilities will be invited to complete the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Study personnel will provide all patients with an information sheet that will describe the purpose and nature of pre-screening and provide patients with an option to opt-out of the pre-screening.  Once the patient completes the BDI-II, it will be reviewed immediately upon receipt for subjects’ response to question 9 to determine the presence of suicidal intent; those who answer either “I would like to kill myself” or “I would kill myself if I had the chance” will be emergently triaged.  The summary score on BDI-II will be computed within 48 hours of receipt and subjects will be managed based on the summary score: • Score ≥ 15 will be approached for their willingness to complete the modules of MINI, and undergo other screening activities. Subjects that agree will be invited to sign a consent form (ICF-1) and those individuals with a diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia on the MINI will be randomly assigned to (1) an engagement interview with a trained therapist, or (2) brief discussion with study staff. • The information on subjects with score ≥ 15 who refuse to undergo additional screening activities will be communicated to the patients’ treating nephrologist. Subjects will also be presented with a list of mental health care providers and resources in their community. This will include providers who serve safety-net populations like those with Medicaid insurance and those that provide charity care. • Information on subjects with score < 15 will also be communicated to the patients’ treating nephrologist. 4.2.2 Re-Administration of Pre-Screening Some subjects may complete the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) additional time(s). These include when a subject: • Scores ≥15, but is unable to be screened within the 10 day window. A second BDI will be administered for a valid score prior to screening. • Scores < 15, 3 months have passed since previous administration. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 22  
4.2.3 Enrollment of Subjects in Comparative Efficacy Trial of individual CBT and Anti-Depressant Drug Therapy The clinical trial will be limited to patients with major depression or dysthymia, with no additional psychiatric co-morbidity. Subjects with (1) confirmed diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia on the MINI, (2) are willing to receive treatment for comorbid depression, and (3) who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be approached for their willingness to be randomly assigned to either individual CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy as a part of the clinical trial.  All subsequent study-related activities will begin only upon the subjects’ signing an informed consent form (ICF-2).  4.2.4 Enrollment of Subjects in Observational Cohort Study with no Active Treatment Subjects who (1) are not willing to participate in the clinical trial and (2) do not find any treatment acceptable outside the clinical trial will be invited to participate in the prospective observational cohort for serial assessment of depressive symptoms. 4.2.5 Patients 4.6 Early Termination of Study Treatment and Withdrawal of Subjects  Active treatment with the study interventions (individual CBT or sertraline drug therapy) will be terminated if the patient: • Withdraws informed consent • Unable to follow study procedures • Undergoes kidney transplantation • Transfers to home dialysis  • Transfers care to a dialysis facility outside the participating metropolitan areas.  Under each of these circumstances all attempts will be made to continue to ascertain primary and secondary patient-reported outcomes with computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI).  5. Study Interventions 5.1 Engagement Interview Phase Subjects will be randomly assigned to engagement interview or a control visit using block randomization within each site based on variable blocks of size 6 to 10. This will ensure that equal numbers of participants are randomized to each group, and that the two groups are balanced at periodic enrollment intervals. Randomization assignment will be obtained via the secure study web portal hosted at the Data Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 23  
5.1.1 Engagement Interview 5.1.1.1  Overview of the Intervention Trained CBT therapists at each of the three sites will conduct the engagement interview. The session will be aimed at improving the acceptance of the diagnosis of depression by patients and treatment for the same. The therapist will invite patients to tell their story of recent stress (including medical symptoms) and possible connection to depression. The therapist will use reflective statements and non-judgmental listening techniques so that the patient feels heard. Potential barriers to acceptance of treatment and how to overcome them will be discussed. Motivational interviewing techniques will be used to help the patient articulate potential ambivalence about treatment and therapists will reflect back to the patients their expression of wanting life to be different despite ambivalence about treatment. The session is anticipated to last an hour and maybe supplemented with a 40- minute DVD entitled “Depression Self Care Companion for Better Living” in an effort to improve health literacy regarding depression and its treatment. The subject can watch salient portions of the video along with the therapist, or watch it at home or in the dialysis unit. 5.1.1.2 Training and Certification Prior To Implementation in Trial Each of the therapists will undergo a one-day in-person training to be scheduled in Seattle prior to implementing the intervention. The training will be led by Nancy Grote at the School of Social Work at the University of Washington, supported by Yaminette Diaz Linehart; the latter will focus on adapting the intervention culturally to Latinos.  Following the completion of training, each therapist will be required to complete mock interventions prior to implementation of the intervention in the clinical trial. These mock sessions will be audio recorded and will be reviewed by Drs. Grote and Linehart using a structured fidelity adherence form. Once the therapists are deemed competent in the intervention, they will be ready to implement the intervention in a clinical trial.  In the event of staff turnover, any new therapist will need to undergo training procedures prior to start of intervention for the clinical trial. 5.1.1.3  Monitoring the Fidelity of the Intervention During the conduct of the trial, bi-weekly conference calls will be scheduled with all the therapists during which clinical issues and implementation will be discussed and cases reviewed.  All sessions of the engagement interview will also be audio-taped and a 10% random sample will be periodically reviewed to provide rating for treatment fidelity using forms that outline the major skills and intervention pieces.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 24  
5.1.2 Control Visit Individuals assigned to control visit will be scheduled for a follow-up discussion with a member of the research team. During this session, they will be informed of the diagnosis of major depression or dysthymia, the options for treatment available through the clinical trial, and alternatives should they decline participation in the clinical trial. The time spent in providing this information will be recorded for the control visit. 5.2 Comparative Efficacy of individual CBT vs Anti-Depressant Treatment Drug Therapy The subjects will be randomly assigned to individual CBT or sertraline drug therapy using block randomization as for the engagement interview. The randomization will occur using the secure study web portal. 5.2.1 Individual CBT in Dialysis Facility 5.2.1.1  Overview of the Intervention Individuals will undergo 10 CBT sessions of 60 minutes each, by a therapist in the dialysis facility (8 weekly sessions; then every other week x 2). The CBT will be administered while the patient is undergoing HD; however, alternative arrangements will be made upon individual patient’s preferences. To the extent possible, each session will be scheduled on the same day of the week for any given patient. Standard CBT intervention for depression will be modified for the challenges associated with HD treatment to include psycho-education, adherence with the dialysis prescription, adapting behavioral activation, and identification and challenging ESRD specific cognitive distortions and maladaptive thought patterns (detailed manual in Appendix Five). During the course of intervention, study subjects will undergo assessment of severity of depressive symptoms using Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Self-Report (QIDS-SR) every two weeks for the first six weeks (weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6) and on weeks 9 and 11. The results of these assessments will be available to the therapist as they will be for titration of the drug therapy. 5.2.1.2  Training and Certification Prior To Implementation in Trial The training of the therapists in the implementation of the CBT will be held in conjunction with the training for the engagement interview. This training is expected to last two days, will be held in-person in Seattle, and led by Daniel Cukor.  Following the completion of training, each therapist will be required to complete mock interventions prior to implementation of the intervention in the clinical trial. These mock sessions will be audio recorded and will be reviewed by Dr. Cukor using a structured fidelity adherence form. Once the therapists are deemed competent in the intervention, they will be ready to implement the intervention in a clinical trial.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 25  
Table 2 Overview of individual CBT for the study Sessions 1-2 Assessment – Assess patient’s motivation for change, goals for treatment, ‘stage of change’. Evaluate need for patient to modify fluid intake, adherence with medical regimen. Psycho-education – highlight similarities/differences between depression and medical illness. Behavioral Intervention – Behavioral activation – increase patients’ enjoyable activities. Sessions 3-6 Cognitive Intervention – Train participants in relationship between dysfunctional automatic thoughts and negative perceptions and outcomes; Improve patient’s ability to categorize distorted thoughts and provide rational behavioral responses; Identify recurring patterns of maladaptive thinking and challenge negative schemas. Sessions 7-8 Health Behaviors – Teach and practice healthy living (adherence) skills for HD treatment; Increase positive social contacts – initiating contact, building support network; Teach and practice strategies for managing anxiety Sessions 9-10 Termination – Review newly learned skills and practice eliciting, challenging, and modifying maladaptive thoughts; Plan for termination of therapy – identify which interventions were helpful and which were not, and focus on relapse prevention  5.2.1.3  Monitoring the Fidelity of the Intervention During the conduct of the trial, bi-weekly conference calls will be scheduled with all the therapists during which clinical issues and implementation will be discussed and cases reviewed. All individual CBT sessions will be audio-taped and a 10% random sample periodically reviewed to provide rating for treatment fidelity using forms that outline the major skills and intervention pieces.  5.2.1.4  Monitoring Adherence to Intervention A structured form will be developed for therapists to monitor patients’ adherence with health behaviors and/or homework at the start of each session following the first session. This will generate data to describe the association between adherence with skills taught during CBT with observed efficacy with the intervention. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 26  
5.2.2 Anti-Depressant Drug Therapy 5.2.2.1 Overview of the Intervention The site investigators will prescribe sertraline drug therapy and dose titration will be implemented using “Measurement-Based Care”, a model of patient-centered shared-decision making (Appendix Three). This protocol incorporates standardized assessments of depressive symptoms and drug side effects, and the research team and the patient make joint decisions about the next steps in titration – to maintain, increase, or decrease the dose[19, 67]. This will help establish the highest efficacious but tolerable dose tailored for each patient and minimize the risk of under-dosing. The QIDS-SR scale will be used to determine the clinical response for dose titration [68]. Side effects will be assessed using the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating (FIBSER) scale, a self-report three-item scale to assess side effects and the degree to which they interfere with day-to-day functions[69].  The assessments will occur every two weeks for the first six weeks (Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6) and on Weeks 9 and 12 in the dialysis facility while the patient is undergoing HD. To the extent possible, the assessments will be done on the first dialysis day of the week (Monday or Tuesday, respectively, for subjects on Monday-Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday / Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday schedules). The participant-specific dose at week 6, up to a maximum of 200 mg/d, will be continued for the remaining six weeks.   5.2.2.2 Training of Investigators in Measurement Based Care The investigators, sub-investigators, or any personnel with privileges to prescribe drug therapy at each of the three sites will undergo formal training in the implementation of Measurement Based Care prior to implementation of the study protocol. This training will led by Drs. Hedayati and Katon.   5.2.2.3 Drug Procurement and Dispensation The drug will be procured as 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg tablets by the Kidney Research Institute at the University of Washington and shipped to each of the three clinical sites. The drug will be stored at the Investigational Drug Services at each of the three sites and will be dispensed for individual patients at two-week periods for the first six weeks and three-week periods for the second six weeks. The dose for each dispensation will be determined by assessments made on the first dialysis day of the week and drugs will be dispensed to the patient on the second dialysis day of the week.   5.2.2.4 Monitoring Drug Adherence At weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 subjects will be asked to bring in the bottles that were provided to them at the preceding study visit. Pill count will be done to monitor adherence to drug therapy and all unused drug will be destroyed by IDS.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 27  
6. Ascertainment of Outcomes 6.1 Engagement Interview vs. Control The primary outcome will be assessed six weeks from the time of completion of the engagement interview or control visit. This will be assessed as: • Subjects enrolled in comparative efficacy trial: Completion of at least one CBT session or receiving at least one dispensation of sertraline. • Subjects not enrolled in comparative efficacy trial: This will be ascertained with a single telephone call and subjects will be asked if, since the completion of engagement interview or control visit, they have either (1) completed one psychotherapy session, or (2) filled a prescription of anti-depressant drug therapy. The secondary outcome will be ascertained upon completion of the engagement interview or control visit by the therapist or research coordinator, respectively. Patients will be asked to report whether they are willing to (1) enroll in the clinical trial of comparative efficacy of CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy, (2) receive a referral for psychotherapy, or (3) receive a prescription of anti-depressant drug therapy.  6.2 Comparative Efficacy of individual CBT and anti-depressant drug therapy The primary and secondary patient reported outcomes will be ascertained by CATI at weeks 0, 6, and 12. If there are individuals that do not have access to a telephone, the study staff will work to make that available to them to complete the CATI.  The CATI will run out of Albuquerque, NM under the direction of Mark Unruh who will train the interviewers. All the interviews will be audio recorded and up to 10% of all interviews will be audited to ensure the integrity of the assessment. The CATI interviewers will be blinded to study assignment. Bilingual CATI operators will conduct the assessments using scripts available in both English and Spanish, using the language preferred by the study subject. The interview is expected to last about 30 minutes. The baseline assessment will be performed prior to the first scheduled session of CBT or receiving anti-depressant drug therapy. Each of the three sessions will be scheduled on the day following the first dialysis treatment of the week (Tuesday for subjects on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule, and Wednesday for subjects on a Tuesday-Thursday- Saturday / Sunday-Tuesday-Thursday schedule). If, however, the CATI could not be completed on the designated day, it would be acceptable to complete it during the subsequent non-dialysis days.  If the subject is not available for the call on a non-dialysis day, then it is permissible for it to be done within the first hour of the dialysis session according to the subject’s treatment schedule as noted above.  The calls for the 6 and 12 weeks should be done on a dialysis vs. non-dialysis day based on which was chosen for the baseline call, consistently for each subject. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 28  
Measures of adherence will be ascertained by a structured data extraction from the medical records maintained in the dialysis facility at each site at weeks 0, 6, and 12 of the study. The study staff at each site will be trained in the process prior to the start of the clinical trial. Adherence with dialysis regimen will be determined for the preceding six weeks as a composite of % of treatments in which patient requested early termination of HD (≥ 10 minutes) or skipped a session (excluding missed due to hospitalization or changes by dialysis facility). Adherence with diet and medications will be determined by (1) weight gain between each of the completed HD treatments over the preceding six weeks; and (2) each measurement of serum phosphorus in the preceding six weeks.  6.3 Observational Cohort Study of Patients Who Find Treatment Unacceptable These subjects will only undergo assessment of severity of depressive symptoms at weeks 0, 6, and 12 using QIDS-C and they will be ascertained using CATI as described above. 7. Study Visits  All study visits will occur in the participating dialysis facility and a summary of the screening procedures prior to start of treatment are summarized as:      7.1 Pre-Screening • Information sheet will be handed to patients to invite them to complete BDI-II • Patients who agree will be invited to complete BDI-II • Study staff will review response to question 9 of BDI-II and emergently triage patients with suicidal intent • BDI-II scores will be computed within 48 hours of receipt of surveys 7.2 Screening (within 10 days of completion of BDI-II) • Patients with BDI-II score ≥ 15 will be invited to sign consent form to complete screening activities (ICF-1).

• For subjects that consent to participate in the study, the following information will be recorded: o Registered on to the online study portal. o Demographic Data o 7 modules of MINI o Mini-COG o Health literacy questions: § How often do you have someone help you read hospital materials? (Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often, Always) § How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself? (Extremely, Quite a bit, Somewhat, Little Bit, Not at all) § How often do you have problems learning about your medical condition because of difficulty understanding written information? (Never, Occasionally, Sometimes, Often, Always) o Review Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria • Subjects that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to engagement interview or control visit through the secure study web portal. 7.3 Engagement Interview vs. Control Visit (within 10 days of screening) • Engagement interview will be conducted by the study therapist and control visit will be delivered by another member of the research team. • Upon completion of the intervention, subjects will be asked about their preference for treatment :  o “Both antidepressant medication and a type of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy can be successful in treating depression. Antidepressant medication involves taking one or more pills once daily which may have only minor side effects. Counseling involves speaking with a therapist once a week during dialysis for approximately 50 minutes to work on patterns of thinking and emotions that are involved in depression. Which of these two treatments would you prefer?  § Medication § Counseling § Either § Neither”  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 30  
7.4 Baseline Visit/Week 0 • , Within 7 days of engagement interview or on the day of the control visit, subjects will be approached for their willingness to enroll in the clinical trial of comparative efficacy of treatment options for depression (ICF-2). • CATI will be scheduled for the non-dialysis day (or the next dialysis session, if the subject is not available on a non-dialysis day) following the day the consent form was signed (within 7 days of signing the consent form). • Consenting subjects will be randomly assigned to individual CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy at the beginning of the week following the CATI call. • During Week 0, the following data will be recorded for consenting study subjects: o Medical History o Concomitant Medications o QIDS-SR • Study Intervention will start during the same week: o The first session for individual CBT will be scheduled on the second or third dialysis day of the week o Patients on sub-therapeutic doses of anti-depressant drugs will be asked to discontinue the drug, in consultation with the physician who initially prescribed the drug (See Appendix Two). o Sertraline will be made available on the second dialysis day of the week and the first dose (25 mg) administered under supervision of study staff 7.5 Weeks 2, 4, and 9 • On the first dialysis day of the week, the following will be completed o QIDS-SR o FIBSER (for subjects in the anti-depressant drug therapy arm) • On the second dialysis day of the week, subjects in the anti-depressant drug therapy arm will: o Return the supply of medications at the prior visit to research staff o Receive a new supply of medications from research staff 7.6 Week 6, 11 and 12 • On the first dialysis day of the weeks 6 and 11, the following will be completed o QIDS-SR o FIBSER (for subjects in the anti-depressant drug therapy arm) • On the first non-dialysis day (or dialysis day, if subject is not available on a non-dialysis day) of the week 6 and 12: o CATI 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 31  
• On the second dialysis day of Week 6, subjects in the anti-depressant drug therapy arm will: o Return the supply of medications at the prior visit from research staff o Receive a new supply of medications from research staff 7.7  Study Exit  At 12 weeks, study patients will be deemed either to have achieved a response (≥ 50% decrease in baseline depressive symptoms) or remission (QIDS-C < 5), or not. The approach to managing participants upon conclusion of the study will depend upon the treatment arm: • CBT Arm: In individuals with clinically significant depressive symptoms (QIDS-C ≥ 11), the 12-week score and its interpretation will be communicated to the patients’ treating nephrologist, along with a list of mental health care providers and resources in their community. • Drug Therapy: Patients that demonstrate either a response or achieve remission will be offered continued treatment in consultation with the treating nephrologist. If patients and/or treating nephrologists do not want continued treatment, sertraline will be gradually tapered by 50 mg/week. In patients that don’t achieve a 50% improvement in depressive symptoms, the drug will be gradually tapered to off after 12-weeks. The failure to respond to sertraline will be communicated to the treating nephrologist with information on resources as listed above. The study team will provide the supply for and oversee the care should the patient and/or treating physician choose to discontinue sertraline. On the other hand, should the treating physician and patient decide to continue with sertraline drug therapy, the study staff will ensure a smooth transition for patients to receive the drug from their pharmacy as a part of their routine clinical care.  7.8  Post-Study Follow-up (done on week 12 by CATI) • Semi-structured interview will be conducted to elicit the experience of patients with the study intervention. This will be included as the last question on the CATI call done on week 12 of the study • At 30 days from the end of the study, the research staff will ascertain by reviewing the patient’s medical records or calling the patient, the occurrence of following events: o Death or o Hospitalization

8. Statistical Analyses 8.1 Preliminary Analyses Descriptive statistics will be provided for continuous data and frequency distributions for categorical data. Pre-treatment characteristics of the two randomized groups in both the engagement interview phase and evaluation of comparative efficacy of CBT and drug therapy will be compared to assess chance imbalances. If differences are found, these variables will be used as covariates in secondary analyses to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary analysis.  8.2 Statistical Analysis for the Engagement Interview Phase The primary analysis will employ logistic regression adjusting for recruitment site to compare the proportions of patients who initiate treatment for comorbid depression between the engagement interview and control visit groups. The primary analyses will be based on a likelihood ratio test. In secondary analyses, we will compare the proportions of patients who report that they would be willing to initiate treatment for comorbid depression upon completion of engagement interview phase.  8.2.1 Statistical Power for Primary Analysis of the Engagement Interview Phase Randomized evaluation of an engagement interview will be conducted with 400 patients. In the pilot study by Dr. Cukor, 40% of HD patients accepted treatment for comorbid depression and in studies by Dr. Katon, the engagement interview increases the rate by 10-20% [39]. Based on recent updated assessment of sample size considerations and statistical power, we have updated our target sample size to a total of 120 patients randomized to cognitive behavioral therapy or sertraline drug therapy. Therefore our study design is well powered to detect the anticipated effect of an engagement interview. 8.3 Statistical Analysis for the Comparative Evaluation Phase Longitudinal mixed effects analyses will be applied to the QIDS-C primary outcome and to other continuous secondary outcomes to compare outcome means at the 6 and 12 Week assessments between the CBT and Sertraline groups[70]. Treatment group and the Clinical Center will be fixed effects in the model. An unstructured covariance matrix will account for serial correlations in outcome measurements within patients[71]. The model will constrain baseline means of the outcome to be equal in the treatment groups based on randomization. Such an analysis is known to correspond to an ANCOVA when only one follow-up measure is evaluated. Linear contrasts will be constructed to estimate for each outcome variable: (a) the mean difference in the outcome between the treatment groups at Week 12 (primary assessment of treatment effect); (b) the mean difference in the 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 33  
outcome between groups at Week 6 (early treatment effect); (c) the average of the treatment effect estimates from (a) and (b) over Weeks 6 and 12 (persistence of early effect to 12 weeks); and (d) the difference in the estimated treatment effects from (a) and (b) between Week 6 and Week 12 (overall assessment of the treatment effect incorporating both follow-up visits). In addition, we will describe the following proportions for each of the two treatment arms: • % of patients in each of the two treatment arms that have at least 50% improvement in severity of depressive symptoms from baseline • % of patients in each of the two treatment that achieve remission at end of follow-up (QIDS-C < 5). 8.3.1 Plan for Handling Missing Data  The potential for bias due to loss-to-follow-up is a concern as poor adherers who discontinue either intervention are at risk both for loss to follow up and poor outcomes. The mixed effects modeling approach will mitigate the effects of loss-to-follow-up after the Week 6 visit by incorporating information from baseline and the Week 6 measurements for patients who subsequently drop out of the study when estimating treatment effects at Week 12. Multiple imputations will be used to further limit the effects of missing outcome measurements. Baseline and follow-up factors beyond the analyzed outcome can be incorporated into the imputation model to account for dependence of the missing data mechanism on other measured factors, including measures of patient adherence to the intervention. Data augmentation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation will be applied to generate imputed values[72]. Secondary analyses will examine the association between participation in engagement interview prior to randomization, health literacy at baseline, and adherence with the respective intervention on treatment efficacy. 8.3.2 Sample size/detectable effect size in the Comparative Evaluation of CBT and Drug Therapy  The sample size for this phase is 120 patients. The serial correlation in self-reported depression scales in data from published and unpublished studies in HD patients or those with advanced kidney disease by members of this consortium, over approximately 12 weeks, typically ranges between R = 0.40 and 0.70[38, 39, 73]. Assuming a loss- to-follow-up of ≤ 15%, 120 randomized participants will provide 80% power with 2-sided α = 0.05 to detect a difference in the mean 12-Week QIDS-C between the treatment groups of between 0.40 (if R = 0.70) and 0.51 (if R = 0.40) of 1 standard deviation in the QIDS-C. This range of detectable effect sizes is well within the range of differences observed in the randomized and non-randomized trials of CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy for comorbid 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 34  
depression in HD patients[46, 50, 51, 56, 57]. Moreover, the magnitude of effect size that is detectable is in the range of what is considered to be a clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms. Smaller effect sizes may exist that may be statistically significant in larger studies. However, they are unlikely to be clinically meaningful or relevant to patients in the selection of treatment options. 8.3.3 Overall Approach for Avoidance of bias in the Comparative Efficacy of CBT and drug therapy  Several features of study design will minimize bias. First, a randomized controlled study design will generate the highest level of evidence for treatment efficacy. Second, all HD patients in participating dialysis facilities will be systematically screened, which will assure the selection of a cohort highly representative of the HD patient population with comorbid depression. Third, the primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at two time points after randomization, and hence data on intermediate time points will be available for participants who may drop out. Fourth, computer-assisted telephone interviewing will maximize patient participation and the assessor will be blinded to treatment assignment, both of which will minimize bias in an open-label clinical trial. Fifth, procedures to minimize missing data will be implemented, such as training and certification of study personnel, careful design of data collection forms, documentation of procedures, and implementation of a management system that minimizes data entry errors and patient tracking procedures[74]. Should there still be missing data, multiple imputation methods will be utilized as described above[74]. 8.4  Statistical analysis of data from observational cohort of patients who refuse to accept any treatment for comorbid depression Longitudinal mixed effects analyses will be performed to describe the change in depressive symptoms for this cohort; no comparisons will be made with data from the clinical trial. The proportion of patients who begin treatment during follow-up will be described as well. If sufficient numbers of patients initiate CBT or treatment with Sertraline then we will generate propensity scores for treatment and use these to conduct observational data based estimates of treatment effects, and compare these estimates with those obtained from the randomized trial. 9. Adverse Events 9.1 Potential Adverse Events from Study Interventions  1. Adverse Effects from CBT: The risk classification for this arm is “not greater than minimal”. There is risk of experiencing discomfort in exploring psychologically 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 35  
difficult material. Some people feel temporarily worse when they begin to disclose their intimate feelings, but this is usually mild and transient. Additional potential risks include breach of confidentiality if participants choose CBT to be done while undergoing HD. 2. Adverse Effects from Sertraline:  a. Common side effects (>10%) are transient and include nausea, decrease in appetite, diarrhea, dry mouth, dizziness, headache, insomnia, somnolence, decreased libido, sweating and tremors.  b. Less common side effects (1-10%) include chest pain, palpitations, agitation, nervousness, pain, rash, impotence, increased appetite, constipation, vomiting, weakness, visual problems, yawning, and tinnitus.  c. Rare (<1%) potential risks include bleeding, extrapyramidal reactions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and suicide.  d. Withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, confusion, headache and seizures could occur if sertraline is stopped abruptly.  e. Use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported to increase risk for bleeding; this risk may potentially be amplified in the presence of ESRD due to platelet dysfunction with uremia and use of heparin with each HD treatment. However, this adverse event has not been reported in any of the studies with this class of drugs in dialysis patients to date [48-50, 54-57]. Nevertheless, participants will be closely monitored for the occurrence of this complication. 3. Worsening of depressive symptoms. 4. Psychological discomfort from completing patient-reported scales 5. Loss of patient confidentiality 9.2 Anticipated Adverse Events in the Hemodialysis Population Patients undergoing hemodialysis experience a large number of adverse events from their underlying health, co-existing illnesses, and concomitant medications. These adverse events include (1) death, (2) fluid overload, (3) congestive heart failure, (4) vascular access events such as thrombosis or infection or dysfunction, (5) atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, (6) infections such as pneumonia, and (6) laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism. 9.3 Monitoring for Adverse Events The subjects will be monitored for the occurrence of adverse events as:  • The study staff will evaluate the subjects every two weeks for the first six weeks and every three weeks for the next six weeks.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 36  
• At these visits, tolerability of sertraline drug therapy will be monitored with the use of FIBSER. Patients assigned to the sertraline arm will be withdrawn if (1) they experience a serious adverse event attributable to the study drug and in the judgment of the site PI, the medication cannot be safely reinstituted; (2) the patient has intolerable side effects despite reducing dose to 50 mg/d; or (3) patient becomes pregnant. • The informed consent document will provide the name of a study staff with a phone number to be contacted in the case of an emergency or if an adverse event occurred outside the time frame of study visits. 9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events All adverse events experienced by study subjects from the time of registration into the study (screening visit for engagement interview phase of study) will be recorded and summarized by random assignment group. The summary will be submitted to oversight groups at periodic intervals. All serious or unanticipated adverse events will be reported by each of the clinical site to the Data Coordinating Center within 24 hours of becoming aware of these events using a structured reporting form. Each site will also be expected to follow local reporting policies such as to the Institutional Review Board. Serious adverse events are ones that result in death, or are life threatening, or lead to or prolong hospitalization, or result in disability or incapacity. Unanticipated adverse events are unexpected events, which in the opinion of the investigator, could be reasonably be considered to be associated with participation in the research study.  The DCC will be responsible for communicating these to the DSMB consistent with the policies agreed upon and outlined in the DSMB charter. 9.5 Management of Active Suicidal Intent The overall incidence of suicide is extremely low. However, since individuals with comorbid depression are at risk for committing suicide and individuals with ESRD are at a higher risk for committing suicide than the general population, care will be exercised to identify and provide help to individuals with suicidal intent. The suicidal intent could be ascertained by: • Study Coordinator (initial pre-screen with BDI-II or monitoring with QIDS-SR) • Therapist (Engagement Interview or CBT sessions) • CATI (while completing QIDS-C or CATI) The subjects will be deemed to have active suicidal intent if they answer the following questions: 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 37  
• BDI-II (question 9): “I will like to kill myself” or “I will like to kill myself if I had the chance” • QIDS-SR (question 12): “I think of suicide/death several times a week for several minutes” OR “I think of suicide/death several times a day in some detail, or I have made specific plans for suicide or have actually tried to take my life”. Each site will be asked to provide three emergency telephone numbers of study personnel; these telephone numbers will be made available to the therapist, CATI operator, and dialysis facility staff. Upon being informed of study subjects with an active suicidal intent, the following process will be followed: • If the subject is at immediate risk for self-harm, call 911 • If the subject is not at immediate risk for self-harm, site clinician would be immediately contacted by telephone along with an electronic communication to the site study team and DCC. • The site clinician will assess the suicidal risk using the “Suicidality” module of the MINI, classify the individual’s risk as low, medium, or high, and manage as follows: o High (≥ 17 points): Arrange for immediate help o Medium (9-16 points): State concern for subject, encourage patient to contact provider, and provide three emergency telephone numbers. o Low (1-8 points):  Provide three emergency telephone numbers and suggest subject call the numbers if continued symptoms/concerns.  10. Data Management 10.1 Data Coordinating Center and Data Entry Overview The DCC will be based at the Center for Biomedical Statistics (CBS) at the University of Washington. Data collection and management of the clinical trial will be web-based and the DCC will support https-secured study-specific ‘.NET’ web page that will provide a centralized location for public information about the project for participants, investigators, and institutional agencies. The web page will contain a link to a study-specific portal. Study personnel will log on to the private portal with individual Shibboleth-based user names and passwords to securely perform data management activities. Shibboleth is a standards-based, open source software package for web single sign-on across organizational boundaries. The web portal will serve as the wrapper for all data management tools and software utilized in the project, including: study ID assignment, screening, randomization, prospective data collection, and study operations reporting.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 38  
10.2 Computer and Data Security  Access to research data will be restricted to study team members at each site and DCC personnel. The clinical recruitment sites will maintain a secure electronic database that links the study participant ID generated by the portal to participant contact information. Efforts made by clinical sites to contact patients for follow-up visits will be documented in this database. The database will be stored on a secure electronic server with user name and passwords log in for individual users and will be backed up nightly.  10.3 Training Procedures After the planning phase and before the recruitment begins, a training session will be held to train study staff on data collection procedures, including orientation to the Manual of Operations, data entry and management principles, review of study interventions, and quality control procedures.  10.4 Responsibilities of the Clinical Sites Each of the clinical sites will be responsible for maintaining a regulatory binder and maintaining source documents for all data entry. The web portal will generate queries and the sites will be responsible for completing these queries in a timely manner.  11.  Study Oversight The research will operate under the oversight provided by: • Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB); • Patient Council; and  • Stakeholder Council. The membership of each of these oversight bodies is listed in Appendix Four. Each of the bodies will review and approve the study protocol prior to implementation. Each of the three groups will develop a charter outlining their role in monitoring the progress of the study (The DSMB Charter and the Data Safety Monitoring Plan is available as Appendices Six and Seven, respectively). Each group will convene via a teleconference at least once every six months, or more frequently if deemed necessary.

2.6.1 Open Minutes 69 2.6.2 Closed Minutes 70 Part 3: Appendices 71 Appendix 1:  Rosters and Contact Information 71  Part 1: Introduction The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for assessing safety and efficacy during conduct of the ASCEND trial, as well as ensuring the validity and scientific merit of the trial.  This charter describes the roles and responsibilities of the DSMB for this trial.  The DSMB will meet on a regular basis, and will provide recommendations to the Principal Investigator for the ASCEND study on whether to continue, modify, or terminate the study.  1.1 Charge to the DSMB The DSMB will monitor the conduct of the study and review interim results for the purpose of recommending whether or not to continue the trial as designed. The fundamental responsibilities of the DSMB are to assure: • The ongoing safety of study participants, and  • The scientific integrity of the trial. In addition, the DSMB will use established guidelines to monitor the study for important safety variables suggesting harm.  The DSMB is also charged to recommend whether to continue the study, terminate the study, continue the study with major or minor modifications (such as modifications to inclusion/exclusion criteria or criteria to determine eligibility for cross-over), or temporarily suspend enrollment and/or treatment in the study until uncertainty is resolved. 1.2  Protocol Summary The ASCEND study is a two phase randomized, controlled trial randomizing 200 depressed patients undergoing hemodialysis to receive either engagement interview or control visit, and the second phase randomizing 120 patients accepting intervention, to 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 63  
either CBT or drug therapy. Those who do not accept treatment are followed observationally.  The goals of this study are to 1) evaluate the impact of an engagement interview on receiving treatment; and 2) compare the effectiveness of treatments for depression in patients undergoing hemodialysis.  The primary outcome for the first randomization will be at 6 weeks post-randomization assessing treatment (either psychotherapy or drug therapy) uptake.  The primary outcome for the second randomization will be at 12 weeks post-randomization assessing depressive symptoms. With N=200 patients, the ASCEND study will have 80% power to detect a 15% difference in uptake between the engagement interview group (55%) and the control visit group (40%). The primary analysis will employ logistic regression adjusting for recruitment site to compare the proportions of patients who initiate treatment for depression between the engagement interview and control visit groups. For the second phase of the trial (N=120), the study is powered on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician rated (QIDS-C) score, as measured at the primary study endpoint of 12 weeks.  The QIDS-C is a 16-item questionnaire used to assess depressive symptoms.  The primary analysis will utilize analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare CBT to Sertraline with the following analysis parameters: 85% follow-up at 12 weeks; two-sided Type 1 error rate of alpha=0.05; adjustment for recruitment site, first randomization, and the QIDS-C baseline score.  Depending on the within-person correlation from baseline to 12 weeks (estimated range .4-.7), the study will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.40(r=0.7) – 0.51 (R=0.4).   1.3  DSMB Membership and Responsibilities The DSMB is an independent multidisciplinary group consisting of four clinicians in the fields of nephrology and psychiatry and one biostatistician who collectively have experience in the treatment of subjects with depression, and/or experience with care for patients with end stage renal disease, and/or in the conduct and monitoring of randomized clinical trials.  The duration of membership will span until six months after the end of patient recruitment.   All DSMB Members have agreed by contract that proceedings from DSMB meetings and related activities are confidential.  DSMB Members will not act as investigators or sub-investigators for these trials and will have no trial involvement outside their role on the DSMB.   No Member of the DSMB will be an employee of PCORI.  DSMB Members must disclose all active agreements (direct or indirect) with pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 64  
companies, or contract research organizations.  Members of the DSMB will be responsible for advising the Board of any changes in their financial interests in the aforementioned companies. The DSMB membership has been restricted to individuals free of apparent significant conflict of interest.  The source of conflict may be financial, scientific and/or regulatory in nature.  Thus, neither study investigators nor individuals employed by the funder or regulatory agencies are to be Members of the DSMB. The DSMB will be responsible for deciding whether consultant agreements or financial interests of the members have the potential for conflict of interest.  Members of the DSMB who develop significant potential or perceived conflicts of interest will be asked to resign from the committee. The DSMB Members and Chair are listed in Appendix 1.  As part of this study, the DSMB is established to provide an independent review and assessment of the accumulating safety and efficacy data, and to further safeguard the interests and safety of the participating subjects. The primary role of the DSMB is to make a recommendation to the Principal Investigator based on analysis of available data. The objective of the DSMB is to independently monitor and assess the study.  At each interim meeting, the DSMB will undertake a comprehensive review and assessment of the cumulative study safety data.  The DSMB will determine if safety of sertraline is sufficient to allow the trial to continue.  The DSMB will use a priori defined, and, where appropriate, ad hoc analyses to assess safety. The DSMB will utilize all available trial data when forming any recommendation to discontinue the study or unblind the results.  The Study Management Team will consult with the DSMB as needed on substantive changes to the protocol or study conduct once the trial begins. The DSMB will be responsible for ensuring the timely review of the accumulated safety data.  Based on the reviews and assessments of the data, the DSMB will inform the Principal Investigator of any safety concerns and will provide recommendations for appropriate actions. 1.3.1 DSMB Chair The DSMB Chair will have the following additional responsibilities: chair the meeting, confirm quorum, summarize recommendations, set an agenda for the Closed Session of the meeting, and record Open and Closed Minutes of the DSMB meetings. If a DSMB 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 65  
member can no longer continue, the Chair is responsible for selecting his or her replacement. 1.3.2 DSMB Statistician  The DSMB statistician will provide guidance to the voting Members of the DSMB on issues of a statistical nature. 1.4 Responsibilities of the Study Management Team and Coordinating Center The Coordinating Center and Study Management Team work in tandem but are distinct entities.  Representatives from the Study Management Team are charged with the day-to-day management of the trial; the Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician and Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor are not involved in these activities and have no contact with sites or patients.  The Study Management team and their roles are listed in Appendix. The Study Management Team is responsible for providing timely and accurate data to the Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician for inclusion in reports to the DSMB.  In addition, the Study Management Team will review the Open Report and may present information about the status of the trial and any issues related to study execution during the Open Session. The Study Management Team must maintain an up-to-date, accurate study database by such processes as retrieving CRFs promptly, entering and validating the data, querying suspicious data, and coding adverse events. 1.4.1 Principal Investigator The Principal Investigator for the ASCEND study will be the physician leading the conduct of the clinical trial, and will oversee activities of the Study Management Team.  The Principal Investigator must set an agenda for the Open portion of the meeting, and will receive the recommendations of the DSMB. The Principal Investigator will distribute the recommendations to the Study Management Team, Internal Review Boards, and others as appropriate. 1.4.2 Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician The Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician must produce and validate the DSMB report, keeping any potentially unblinding information confidential and out of reach of other members of the coordinating center (with the exception of unblinded programmers). This individual will also be responsible for delivering the Open and Closed Reports to the DSMB. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 66  
The Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician will be responsible for getting approval from the DSMB in the event that personnel directly associated with the study must be given information that could potentially unblind them. 1.4.3 Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor The Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor must review and present the Closed Report during the Closed Session and answer questions from the DSMB that are of a statistical nature, or other questions as deemed appropriate by the DSMB.  Due to potential for bias, the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor should not make study design decisions after viewing the semi-blinded results; after the first data review, such decisions should be made by a blinded person as appointed by the Principal Investigator.  Part 2: Procedures of the DSMB 2.1 Blinding The DSMB will be unblinded in its assessment of safety data.  The DSMB will have full access to all data as needed for safety assessment and will have access to comparative results of safety data, aggregated by treatment arm.  To maintain the integrity of the trial, the Funder, Principal Investigator and the study investigators will not have access to any unblinded or semi-blinded summaries of interim data prior to the conclusion of the trial and the final database lock.  Access to semi-blinded information will be restricted to the DSMB and Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician and Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor.  The Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician will generate an Open Report that includes aggregate information and a Closed Report that includes unblinded information by randomized treatment assignment.  The DSMB may direct questions and request further data from the Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician, Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor or Study Management Team directly. The DSMB will determine what is communicated to blinded persons regarding additional requests. 2.2 DSMB Report The DSMB Report should provide information that is accurate to the extent possible, although all data will not be clean.  Follow-up should be complete, if possible, to within three months of the date of the DSMB meeting, and the data snapshot should occur 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 67  
approximately one month in advance of the meeting.  Some "last-minute" data (e.g., Serious Adverse Events, Enrollment, and Follow-up Rates) will be even more current.  The reports should be sent to the DSMB Members at least eleven days prior to the date of the meeting.  Based upon the enrollment rate, the Study Management team will determine target dates for the DSMB meetings.  The report will be based mainly on monitored data, but will include all safety data available at the time the report is prepared.   If major changes occur due to data corrections, those changes will be highlighted in future DSMB Reports.   Each DSMB Report will have two main sections:  an Open Section (blinded information) that contains information on recruitment, eligibility violations, baseline characteristics, data on completeness of follow-up and compliance, and other study management issues; and a Closed Section (unblinded information) which contains safety information displayed by treatment arm, analyses of Adverse Events, and efficacy data based on intent-to-treat analyses of primary endpoints.  The details of these reports can be found in the Data Safety Management Plan (DSMP).  DSMB Members will receive both the Open and Closed Sections of the Report.  The Principal Investigator may communicate information from the Open Section of the DSMB Report to the Study Management Team. This DSMB Report will be assembled by Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician in consultation with the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor. DSMB Members will return their Closed Reports to the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor at the conclusion of each DSMB meeting.  The DSMB may retain their copies of the Open Report.  Open and Closed Minutes are recorded by the Chair of the DSMB.  Copies of the Open Minutes are distributed to the Principal Investigator and DSMB.  Copies of the Closed Minutes are distributed only to the DSMB, and are archived by the chair until after the study database has been locked and treatment results unblinded. The DSMB may wish to request clarification on existing reports or additional information.  The Unblinded Coordinating Center Statistician will create ad hoc reports to address these questions. The Study Management Team and other persons may be informed about these ad hoc requests at the discretion of the DSMB. 2.3 Scheduled DSMB Meetings The following table depicts a proposed meeting schedule for the DSMB.  This schedule can be altered as necessary by the Principal Investigator or DSMB.  Alterations will be attached in Appendix 2 and will not require amendment to this charter.

To call an unscheduled meeting, the DSMB Chair will contact the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor.  Typically, the Principal Investigator will not be told the reason for the meeting.  Information to be communicated to the Principal Investigator regarding the meeting is determined by the DSMB. 2.4 DSMB Meeting Structure The meetings will typically begin with an Open Session, followed by a Closed Session. All Closed Sessions will also include an Executive Session. There may also be a final open session where the DSMB may verbally give recommendations and answers questions from the Principal Investigator and Study Management Team.  2.4.1 Open Session In order to allow the DSMB to have adequate access to insights from the Study Management Team, an Open Session of the DSMB meeting will be held during each DSMB meeting.  Members of the Study Management Team, and other persons as needed, may be present during the Open Sessions (either in person or by telephone). The blinded information covered in the Open Session will be contained in the Open Report. 2.4.2 Closed Session Closed DSMB Sessions involving only DSMB Members and the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor will be held after the Open Session to allow discussion of unblinded data from the Closed Report.  The information covered in the Closed Session will be contained in the Closed Report.  2.4.3 Executive Session 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 69  
Executive DSMB Sessions involving only DSMB Members will be held to allow discussion of study data without the members of the study team present. A representative of the Funder may be present at DSMB open sessions unless the DSMB Chair decides that the presence will inhibit free and open discussion or appear to compromise the DSMB’s independence.  The Funder may be permitted to attend Closed and Executive Sessions at the discretion of the DSMB Chair. 2.5 DSMB Recommendations During the DSMB meetings, issues relating to subject safety and scientific integrity of the trial will be reviewed and discussed.  Afterward, the DSMB may hold a brief meeting with the Principal Investigator to review the status of the study and make its recommendations.  These recommendations will primarily use the guidelines defined in this Charter or the DSMP.  The DSMB will also make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding the conduct and management of the trial.  A quorum, defined as 3 DSMB Members including the Chair, must be present or available by teleconference in order for the DSMB to make any formal recommendations. Further, a recommendation to stop the trial must be made by a majority vote of the DSMB (i.e., either unanimously or four to one in favor of the recommendation). Other recommendations may be made by simple majority. Any recommendations which could compromise the blind will be communicated in writing to the Principal Investigator within 5 business days of the meeting.  In the event that the study is recommended to be terminated, the Coordinating Center Statistical Advisor and the Principal Investigator will meet with the DSMB to review the semi-blinded report and discuss the reasons for this recommendation. At this time the Principal Investigator may become semi-blinded before deciding whether to accept the recommendation to terminate the study.  2.6 Meeting Minutes 2.6.1 Open Minutes The Open Session Minutes will be recorded by the DSMB Chair and will summarize the DSMB's findings during the Open Session in addition to the overall recommendation from the Closed Session discussions as to whether the trial should continue, continue with modifications or be terminated.  A copy of the Open Minutes will be sent to the 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 70  
Principal Investigator, who will disseminate the recommendations to the Study Management Team as appropriate.  These Open Session Minutes must be devoid of any statements having the potential to compromise the blinding of the study, since these minutes will be distributed to the Principal Investigator.   At a minimum, the following question should be addressed by the DSMB: • Does the DSMB feel that it is ethical to continue the trial as presently designed? The results of deliberations should be communicated to the Principal Investigator in writing following the meeting.  2.6.2 Closed Minutes The Closed Session Minutes will be recorded by the DSMB Chair and will summarize the discussion of the semi-blinded data and other issues the DSMB wishes to document but keep in confidence.

Appendix Seven: Data Safety and Monitoring Plan 1. Overview This Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) defines the oversight and monitoring activities that will ensure and maintain both the safety of participants and the scientific integrity and validity of the trial data. The plan also describes the procedures for adverse event reporting and details guidelines for recommendations related to trial continuance.  2. Data and Safety Monitoring Board Review of the ASCEND trial’s study performance and safety outcomes will be conducted by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB consists of 5 members, (Chair: Dr. Alan Kliger MD, Dr. Michael Hollifield MD, Dr. J Richard Landis, PhD, Dr. Michael Rocco, MD, Dr. Suzanne Watnick, MD). The DSMB is expected to meet twice annually (every 6 months) to review study performance and safety outcomes in Open and Closed Reports, and to review study enrollment reports quarterly. Ad hoc sessions may be scheduled as required should a serious adverse event need to be reviewed as a group.  Aggregate study performance and safety data will be presented during the open sessions of DSMB meetings. Safety and efficacy data will be presented by treatment arm during the closed sessions. Review by the DSMB provides assurances that the trial can continue, without jeopardizing patient safety. The DSMB is also responsible for protecting the confidentiality of the trial data and for monitoring the quality of both the data and study implementation procedures.   3. Study Sample Size and Design  Each recruitment site will enroll approximately 133 patients. The first randomization is block randomized on site, with random size block assignment within site to maintain balance between treatment groups. The second randomization is blocked on site and on treatment arm (engagement interview or control visit).   Randomized evaluation of an engagement interview will be conducted with up to 400 patients. In the pilot studies, 40% of HD patients accepted treatment for comorbid depression and the engagement interview increases the rate by 10-20. In order to have 80% power to detect a difference in proportions of 40% versus 55% (a 15% increase) we would need to enroll 100 patients per arm, or a total of 200 participants. Therefore our study design is well powered to detect the anticipated effect of an engagement interview.  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 74  
The sample size for the randomized comparison of Sertraline to CBT is 120 patients. The serial correlation in self-reported depression scales in data from published and unpublished studies in HD patients or those with advanced kidney disease by members of this consortium, over approximately 12 weeks, typically ranges between R = 0.40 and 0.70. Assuming a loss- to-follow-up of ≤ 15%, 120 randomized participants will provide 80% power with 2-sided α = 0.05 to detect a difference in the mean 12-Week QIDS-C between the treatment groups of between 0..40 (if R = 0.70) and 0.51 (if R = 0.40) of 1 standard deviation in the QIDS-C. This range of detectable effect sizes is well within the range of differences observed in the randomized and non-randomized trials of CBT or anti-depressant drug therapy for comorbid depression in HD patients. Moreover, the magnitude of effect size that is detectable is in the range of what is considered to be a clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms. Smaller effect sizes may exist that may be statistically significant in larger studies. However, they are unlikely to be clinically meaningful or relevant to patients in the selection of treatment options.   4. Monitoring Guidelines  Based on findings following review of study data by the DSMB, the Board may recommend: continuation of the trial, termination of the trial, or modifications to the protocol (e.g. adding new measurements for safety monitoring, discontinuing high risk subjects, extending the trial in time, increasing the trial sample). Decision guidelines in the ASCEND trial are based on group differences in adverse event rates as explained below.  4.1 Performance Monitoring  Performance monitoring will be an ongoing activity performed by the study principal investigator and statistician, and status reports will be reviewed by the DSMB during their regular meetings. Procedural reviews to address protocol compliance with respect to subject recruitment and eligibility, retention and follow-up, randomization and blinding, and quality of data will be conducted and monthly reports generated. Any protocol violation that affects patient safety will be reported to the DSMB immediately. Performance data will be reviewed in aggregate and by site. It is expected that: (1) the overall enrollment rate will not drop below the expected rate (15 patients per month for 24 months) by more than 50%. (2) missing treatment uptake will be no greater than 15% at the six-week follow-up; (3) the response rate for the QIDS-C will be no less than 85% at the 12-week time-point among those randomized to Sertraline or CBT;  
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 75  
Data will be entered on-line into a REDCap database hosted at the Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  Data will be entered into fields with automated validation and logical checks built in.  Outcome measures will be collected by Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI).  Compliance will be assessed based on the weekly conference calls and data submitted to the DCC on a weekly basis.  If it is determined by the study PI that either study protocol is not being followed or that reporting is inadequate at any site, further action will be taken to address these issues.  These actions may include additional in-person site visits if appropriate or additional educational/problem-solving sessions by phone or in person regarding the study protocol.  Compliance rates and any concerns regarding deviation from study protocol will be reported to the DSMB on a quarterly basis for review and determination if additional measures need to be employed such as protocol changes or discontinuing enrollment at that site.  The ASCEND study aims to enroll up to 400 subjects with the following distribution among the sites: 167 subjects each at Seattle and Dallas and 66 subjects at Albuquerque. We plan to start screening subjects on March 17, 2015 and stop recruitment on March 16, 2017. Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1 are performance monitoring examples that will be included in future Open DSMB Reports. Table 1.

A serious adverse event is defined as any experience that is fatal or life-threatening, is permanently disabling, or requires inpatient hospitalization.  Patients undergoing hemodialysis experience a large number of adverse events from their underlying health, co-existing illnesses, and concomitant medications. These adverse events include death, fluid overload, congestive heart failure, vascular access events such as thrombosis or infection or dysfunction, atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, infections such as pneumonia, and laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hyperparathyroidism. Adverse events possibly associated with use of Sertraline include suicide ideation and suicide attempts and bleeding.

Among patients randomized to CBT or Sertraline, all adverse events possibly associated with Sertraline will be reported in Table 4. All serious adverse events regardless of possible association to intervention will be reported in Table 4. The research team will follow the participants for a period of 30 days from the end of 12 weeks of participation for the occurrence of death or hospitalization. Detailed reporting of serious adverse events will be given in Table 5, by treatment group sorted chronologically. If adverse or serious adverse events occur in different proportion in the study groups and there are concerns regarding the negative effects of either intervention, then the research team in consultation with both the study statistician and the DSMB may make protocol changes or discontinue the study.  Any suicide attempt (occurring within six weeks of the study procedures) will be immediately reported by the PI to the DSMB chair. These events will prompt a review if the event rate in either study arm exceeds the indicated threshold.  Table 4.

1Suicidal ideation is defined as scoring moderate (9-16 points) or high (>= 17 points) risk on the MINI suicidality module. Estimates obtained from Chen et al, Psychosomatics 2010;51: 528-528e6 (prevalence of suicide plan or suicide attempt),  2 Hospitalization or death for hemorrhage from any site, including gastrointestinal, vascular access, and central nervous system. The estimates are based on several published estimates of populations of patients undergoing hemodialysis such as from the DOPPS (Sood et al, Kidney Int 2013; 84: 600-608)  Rates of death and hospitalization were estimated from annual rates reported in the USRDS Annual Data Report and projected for the 4-month study period

4.3 Treatment Efficacy Monitoring We will report aggregate 12-week QIDS-C scores by blinded treatment group for monitoring by the DSMB. We will also provide a z-score assessment of the evidence for the difference between treatment arms at 12 weeks. However, the DSMB is charged not to make a recommendation to terminate the study based on interim efficacy estimates. CBT and Sertraline are accepted standard of care treatments for depression. The study aims to provide valid estimates of treatment efficacy and early stopping for efficacy would jeopardize the primary analysis. Efficacy data is provided only to inform any safety or performance concerns that may arise.  4.4 Procedures for minimizing research-associated risk A number of strategies for minimizing research-associated risk to subjects are built into the study protocol.  CBT and Sertraline are standard treatments frequently used in clinical practice.  This protocol only randomizes the choice of treatment.  The doses being used are also standard doses without any additional risks posed to subjects.  Subjects will also be monitored more frequently than in usual clinical practice and at all follow up time points, subjects will be asked about adverse events and unanticipated health events that may or may not be related to the study procedures.  In this study, we have developed safety plans for addressing suicide ideation. We are also employing additional procedures for patients randomized to Sertraline to ensure safety for these patients. These procedures are described below.  4.4.1 Patients who endorse suicide ideation Since we will ask patients about suicide ideation (SI) during the screening phase as well as during the study, there is a high likelihood of identifying patients experiencing SI. If a patient endorses an SI item during screening or at the baseline visit, the site investigator will be notified. These patients will not be randomized to either CBT or Sertraline and will be referred to their primary care provider. If an individual reports active suicidal ideation or intent at any point during the trial, a cascade of events will be triggered to explore the risk of-and protect the subject from-self-harm. The site clinician will be immediately contacted who will in turn assess risk using the suicidality module of the MINI.  4.4.5 Patients randomized to Sertraline Tolerability of Sertraline will be monitored every two weeks for the first six weeks and every three weeks for the second six weeks with the use of FIBSER. Treatment for subjects

assigned to the Sertraline arm will be withdrawn if (1) they experience a serious adverse event attributable to the study drug and in the judgment of the site PI, the medication cannot be safely reinstituted; (2) the subject has intolerable side effects despite reducing dose to 50 mg/d; or (3) subject becomes pregnant. 5. Scheduled Reporting One month prior to each DSMB review, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will summarize monthly administrative reports that describe study progress including subject accrual by site, demographics, and the sites’ adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and other protocol requirements, including retention rates at each follow up point. These reports are prepared monthly and reviewed internally by the study research team for ongoing quality control. The DCC will also produce safety reports that list adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and in aggregate to the DSMB. With each review the DSMB will decide to approve the study and protocol as is, recommend protocol changes in the interest of patient safety, or stop the study based on overwhelming evidence of safety concerns.  The DSMB will provide the recommendation in a written letter to the principal investigator.  In addition the DSMB will inform the investigator of any changes in the proposed timing of future DSMB reviews. The review may result in an amendment to the protocol, which must be approved by the IRB.  The DSMB report will begin with a brief narrative section that describes the status of the study, progress or findings to-date, issues, and the procedures that produced the report (e.g., data obtained by a specific date). The report will provide a study description along with a current organization chart, current timetable and study schedule as well as a list of study clinical and administrative centers. Data will be presented that describe the administrative status of the study including recruitment and forms handling. Study data reports describe demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and provide a safety assessment. Tables will be provided by site as well as for the whole study population. AE/SAE rates for each group will be presented in the closed report. Finally, the report will include a brief evaluation by the DSMB, with recommendations as to whether or not the trial will continue.  The DSMB will transmit a copy of their recommendations to the Principal Investigator who will disseminate to the clinical investigators at each recruitment site. The clinical investigators are responsible for forwarding the information to their local IRB.  5.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Since reporting rules vary by institution, the following statements are a conservative guide to reporting adverse events for this trial and may be further amplified with DSMB guidance. 
 Study Protocol; Version 2.6 Page 82  
 Any suicide attempt that occurs during a subject’s window of study participation in the CBT vs Sertraline trial is reportable to the principal investigator and DSMB within 24 hours of the site investigator learning of the event. The notification to the DSMB and the IRB, will include a determination from the study Principal Investigator as to likelihood of relation to the study procedure. Every site IRB shall receive notification from the Principal Investigator, of any suicide attempt regardless of where the attempt occurred.  Unexpected adverse events which are serious, but not life threatening, and have a causal relation to the research, (unexpected in this context means not mentioned in the informed consent) must be reported to the DSMB within 7 days and to the local IRB within two weeks of the event. Serious adverse events will be reported to the DSMB chair, as they occur. The DSMB may call an emergency meeting, if necessary.

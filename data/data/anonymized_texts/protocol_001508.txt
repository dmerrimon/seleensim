61.  BACKGROUND
1.1 Study Disease
Testosterone is an anabolic steroid and the primary male sex hormone promoting development of 
male reproductive tissues such as prostate and testis. It can activate androgen receptors in its 
unchanged form or it can be converted to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5-α 
reductase before binding to the androgen receptor. Once bound, the receptor-hormone complex 
moves into the cell nucleus altering specific gene sequences on the cellular DNA and modifying 
transcription.  Through these actions, it promotes protein synthesis and thus growth of tissues that 
are sensible to its action (1). 
Testosterone deficiency is defined by an insufficient production of normal amounts of testosterone 
due to a failure of the testicles or pituitary gland.  It affects more than 10% of men worldwide (2) 
and occurs in association with aging, chronic disease, or other modifiable risk factors such as 
obesity and diabetes (1). Testosterone deficiencies have been associated with decreased muscle 
mass (3), lower bone mineral density (4), lower hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations (5), 
and diminished energy and sexual function compared to normal men (6, 7).
1.2 Study Interventions
Administration of exogenous testosterone as an efficacious treatment for male testosterone deficiency 
has been part of medical practice for more than 50 years.  Furthermore, testosterone therapy is 
becoming more widely available and has seen a greater than three-fold increase in use men 40 
years and older (8). Among the many benefits, testosterone therapy has been shown to improve 
bone mineral density, energy, and sexual function (7). 
Current delivery systems for testosterone include transdermal gels, patches, injection therapy, long 
acting subcutaneous pellets, and intranasal gels (9).  Oral formulations of testosterone are 
convenient, easy to use, and avoid the problems of other forms of TRT such as painful injections 
and transference to women and children, yet have long been unavailable in the United States.  Early 
attempts at oral testosterone development involved methylation, however, methyltestosterone was 
associated with significant hepatotoxicity (9, 10). Subsequent attempts involved fatty-acid 
esterification which bypass first pass portal metabolism by way of intestinal lymphatic absorption 
(testosterone undecanoate).  Although testosterone undecanoate avoided hepatotoxicity, 
absorption was highly dependent on fat consumption and lead to variable responses (11-14).
Jatenzo® is a novel formulation of oral testosterone undecanoate that provides a uniform response, 
independent of the lipid content in a meal, through a unique self-emulsifying drug delivery system. 
A phase 3 randomized controlled trial recently demonstrated that Jatenzo® was safely able to 
restore patients with low testosterone to eugonadal levels (15). Since its approval in 2019, Jatenzo® 
is the only FDA approved oral testosterone replacement option available in the United States.

71.3 Study Rationale 
With a favorable side effect profile and established efficacy, Jatenzo® offers patients another 
option for testosterone therapy.  Advantages of Jatenzo® over more commonly utilized options 
include ease of delivery, no risk of secondary transference, and avoiding painful injections.  
Despite these advantages, patient satisfaction with Jatenzo® over other forms of testosterone 
therapy has not been investigated. Our hypothesis is that Jatenzo® will not lower patient 
satisfaction in comparison to more commonly used forms of testosterone.
2.  HYPOTHESIS
Jatenzo® will not have lower patient satisfaction compared to other forms of testosterone therapy.
3.   OBJECTIVES
3.1 Primary Efficacy Objective
Primary outcomes include changes in patient satisfaction measured by TSQM-9 (Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) and changes in hypogonadal symptoms measured by 
qADAM questionnaire from baseline and at 3 and 6 months.
3.2 Secondary Efficacy Objective
Secondary outcomes will be patient treatment preference compared to prior testosterone therapy 
at 6 months as well as changes in serum testosterone, estrogen, hematocrit, and PSA from baseline 
at 3 and 6 months.
4.   STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Accrual goal
A total of 40 patients with a diagnosis of testosterone deficiency (testosterone <300 on two 
consecutive samples collected at least 2 weeks apart off all testosterone therapy) who are currently 
well controlled on testosterone therapy meeting the eligibility criteria will be recruited from the 
Department of Urology clinic. 
4.2 Duration of Study Participation
Total study duration will be 6 months and subjects will be provided with Jatenzo® for the duration 
of the study (26 weeks treatment course).

Clinic. Study data will be safely stored in a RedCap database. 
7.  STUDY DESIGN, CLINICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, LABORATORY AND 
SURGICAL EVALUATIONS
7.1 Study Design 
This is a prospective, single center, open label, single arm clinical study aimed to evaluate patient 
satisfaction with Jatenzo® for patients with testosterone deficiency in comparison to treatment with 
other forms of testosterone therapy. Subjects will be enrolled in the study based on selection 
criteria designed to represent the general population of men with low testosterone while 
minimizing risk to study participants. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled to meet scientific 
and regulatory objectives. After meeting the selection criteria, the subjects will stop their current 
testosterone therapy, undergo a washout period, and start Jatenzo® (237mg twice daily with food).  
Subjects will be followed for 6 months. 
7.2 Screening Evaluations and Procedures
The first visit for the patients will be for screening and medical evaluation. Patient’s medical 
history will be collected and documented, and a physical examination will be performed with vital 
signs.
Previous blood test results will be reviewed including a general chemistry panel and testosterone 
levels during chart review.
Patients will sign an informed consent and if they meet all inclusion criteria (and do not meet any 
exclusion criteria), they will be recruited to the study. 
7.3 Pre-Treatment Procedures and Evaluations 
The results of all screening evaluations must be within clinically acceptable limits, reviewed and 
approved by the investigator, prior to the start of treatment. Subjects who meet the inclusion 
criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will be recruited to the study.  While on their 
current testosterone therapy, patients will have a baseline evaluation of medication satisfaction 
measured by TSQM-9 (Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) and low testosterone 
symptoms measured by qADAM questionnaire.  They will also have baseline testing of serum 
testosterone, estrogen, hematocrit, and PSA.

Version 1.0
Date: July 20, 2020
127.4 Treatment procedures
Patient’s will stop their current testosterone therapy and undergo a washout period (4 weeks 
following their last gel or injection based therapy and 16 weeks following their subcutaneous pellet 
insertion).  Once the washout period is completed, they will start Jatenzo® (oral testosterone 
undecanoate) as 237mg twice daily with food (morning and evening).  At the 3 month follow up 
visit, testosterone will be checked (6 hours after taking Jatenzo®) and testosterone dosage will be 
titrated per FDA prescribing guidelines (16).
7.5 Follow-Up Procedures and Evaluations:
Follow-up visits will be conducted at 3 and 6 months. These visits shall include: 
Measuring TSQM-9 and qADAM scores of patients at the clinic. 
Taking serum testosterone, estrogen, hematocrit, and PSA.
Vital signs and physical exam.  Blood pressure will also be assessed at week 4 
(approximately 3 weeks after starting Jatenzo®). For new onset or exacerbation of pre-
existing hypertension, patients will be referred to their primary care physician for 
treatment.  If a dose titration occurs after the 3 month visit, patient will return roughly 3 
weeks after for blood pressure check (visit 4).
Reporting and recording adverse events.
Patient testosterone replacement therapy preference will also be assessed at 6 months. 
7.6Reimbursement 
The subjects prior to enrollment in the trial will be billed to the insurance or self-pay. Once 
enrolled in the trial, the medications and the visits will be covered as part of the study. Subjects 
will be provided testosterone study medication, oral testosterone undecanoate, free of charge. For 
transportation and parking for the study visits, the subjects will be provided a gift card for $50 at 
the end of the study.

8.  ADVERSE EVENTS
8.1 Expected Adverse Events 
A phase 3, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study of the efficacy of Jatenzo® in men 
with low testosterone demonstrated that the most commonly reported adverse reactions (>2% of 
patients) included headache, hematocrit increase, upper respiratory tract infection, hypertension, 
high-density lipoprotein decrease, and nausea (15).
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious injury or death 
Any adverse event and eventual complication must be recorded at any time during the treatments 
and follow up visits, and throughout the entire study duration. Patients will be instructed to alert 
the study investigator by telephone of any side effects occurring in the period after the treatment 
and until the study end. 
For Reporting of adverse events see section 9. 
9.  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
The study investigators will report to a surgeon monitor Dr. Satyanarayana Ramgopal in the 
Department of Urology (who is not involved in the study) to ensure data quality and subject safety. 
The investigators will conduct continuous reviews of the data and subject safety, keeping track of 
the number of subjects, significant toxicities in accordance with the protocol and observed 
responses, which will be discussed at research committee meetings. All grade 3-5 adverse events 
(CTCAE v4.0), regardless of association with oral testosterone, will be entered into study database 
and reviewed at research committee meetings. In addition, all adverse reactions considered 
- Study #: 20200971        Effective Date: 11/19/2020
Version 1.0
Date: July 20, 2020
14“serious” will be entered into research database and reviewed by the Surgeon monitor on an 
ongoing basis. If a death occurs within 30 days of treatment and is determined to be related to the 
study, the investigators will notify the Department Chair Dr. Dipen Parekh within 1 business day. 
If an increase in the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events is noted in the study, a report will be 
submitted to the Department Chair Dr. Dipen Parekh at the time the increased rate is identified. If 
at any time the principal investigator stops enrollment or stops the study due to safety issues, the 
Department Chair (Dr. Dipen Parekh) will be notified within 1 business day and a formal letter 
will be sent to the Department Chair (Dr. Dipen Parekh) to be received within 10 business days. 
In addition to reporting to the Department chair, all serious events will also be reported to the 
supervising IRB in the same timely manner. 
10.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary endpoints will be change in patient satisfaction measured by TSQM-9 (Treatment 
Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) and change in low testosterone symptoms measured by 
qADAM questionnaire after 3 and 6 months of treatment with Jatenzo®.
10.2 Secondary Study Endpoints
The secondary endpoints will be patient treatment preference compared to prior testosterone 
therapy as well as changes in Testosterone, Estrogen, Hematocrit, and PSA after 3 and 6 months 
of treatment with Jatenzo®.
10.3 Endpoint definitions
Patient satisfaction and low testosterone symptoms will be measured by TSQM version 9 
(Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication) and the qADAM questionnaire, 
respectively.  
Patient treatment preference will be evaluated with a questionnaire gauging interest in continuing 
Jatenzo® versus prior testosterone therapy.
Total testosterone will be expressed in ng/dL, hematocrit (%), estrogen (pg/ml), and PSA ng/ml.  
Hormone determinations will be done by peripheral venous puncture blood draw.

10.5 Statistical Analysis and Power calculation  
Analyses will be performed on the complete study population using SAS. Statistical testing will 
be performed at the two-sided 0.05 significance level unless specified. Statistical significance of 
TSQM-9 and qADAM results will be determined using paired t-tests (two-sided) or Wilcoxon 
matched pairs signed-rank tests (two-sided). Shapiro-Wilk normality test will be used to determine 
which test was appropriate. Change in Testosterone, Hematocrit, estrogen and PSA will be 
analyzed using the ANOVA and MANOVA.
11.  INVESTIGATORS RESPONSIBILITIES
11.1 Investigator Responsibility/Performance
The investigator (or a person designated by the investigator) should inform the patient of all 
pertinent aspects of the study, including the written information.
The investigator should provide the patient ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of 
the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. All questions about the study 
should be answered to the satisfaction of the patient. Neither the investigator nor the study staff 
should coerce or unduly influence a patient to participate or to continue to participate in a study.
11.2 Confidentiality
The identity of the patients in this study will be treated as confidential. Patients eligible to 
participate in the study following the pre-treatment visit will be assigned a unique patient code. 
The results of the study, including any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will 
not give the patients' name or include any identifiable references to them.
However, any records or data obtained as a result of the patient participation in this study may be 
inspected by the sponsor, by any relevant governmental agency, by the Hospital Ethics Committee, 
or by the persons conducting this study, provided that such inspectors are legally obligated to 
protect any identifiable information from public disclosure, except where disclosure is otherwise 
required by law or a court of competent jurisdiction. These records will be kept private in so far as 
permitted by law. 
11.3 Informed Consent and Permission to Use Protected Health Information 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from each subject 
participating in this study after adequate explanation, in lay language, of the methods, objectives, 
anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study.  The investigator must also explain that 
the subject is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to discontinue participation at any time 
- Study #: 20200971        Effective Date: 11/19/2020
Version 1.0
Date: July 20, 2020
16(for any reason) and receive alternative conventional therapy as indicated.  Prior to study 
participation, each subject will sign an IRB approved informed consent form and receive a copy 
of same (and information leaflet, if appropriate). 
The investigator or designee must explain to the subject before enrollment into the study that for 
evaluation of study results, the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study 
may be shared with the study sponsor, regulatory agencies, and the IRB.  It is the investigator’s 
(or designee’s) responsibility to obtain permission to use protected health information per HIPAA 
from each subject, or if appropriate, the subjects’ parent or legal guardian.
11.4 Source Documentation and Investigator Files
The investigator will maintain adequate and accurate records to document the conduct of the study 
and to ensure that study data can be subsequently verified.  These documents will be classified into 
two separate categories: (1) investigator study file and (2) subject clinical source documents that 
corroborate data collected on the CRF’s.  Subject clinical source documents would include 
hospital/clinic patient records, physician and nurse notes, original laboratory, radiology, 
pathology, and special assessment reports, QOL forms, and signed informed consent forms.  When 
the CRF or any form is used as the source document, this will be clearly stated in the investigator 
study file.
At a minimum, the following be documented in source documents:
Medical history/physical condition and diagnosis of the subject before involvement 
in the study sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria.
Study number, assigned subject number, and verification that written informed 
consent was obtained (each recorded in dated and signed notes on the day of entry 
into the study)
Progress notes for each subject visit.
Laboratory test results.
Condition and response of subject upon completion of or early termination from 
the study.
11.5 Recording and Processing of Data
Data for this study will be entered into electronic CRFs in research database (a web-based clinical 
research management application).  A CRF is required for every patient who received any study 
intervention.  The investigator will ensure that the CRF’s are accurate, complete, legible and 
timely. Separate source records are required to support all CRF entries.  All corrections to study 
data will be made by drawing a single line through the information to be corrected without 
obscuring it.  All corrections will be initialed, dated and explained, if necessary. Do not use 
“white-out” or obscuring correction tape.

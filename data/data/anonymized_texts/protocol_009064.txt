NAME OF SPONSOR: Gan & Lee  Pharmaceuticals  USA  PROTOCOL  No.:GL-GLAT2 -3002 
NAME OF STUDY TREATMENT:  Gan & Lee  Insulin G largine  Injection  
TITLE OF STUDY: An Open -label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Compare the 
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and S afety of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals Insulin Glargine Injection to L antus® 
(Insulin Glargine Injectio n) in Adult Subjects with Type 2  Diabetes M ellitus   
STUDY  CENTERS : Approximately  65 sites are  planned in  the United States   
STUDY  PERIOD : Subjects randomized to the Gan & Lee  
Insulin Glargine Injection group and the Lantus® group will 
receive treatment for 26  weeks.  PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The study start ed in 2017 and is expected to end in 2019  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate equivalence  of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® in terms of 
immunogenicity  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Immunogenicity: To evaluate the percentage of subjects with negative anti-insulin antibodies ( AIA) 
at baseline  who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26, the percentage of subjects 
with at least a 4 -fold increase in titer s compared to baseline value , mean change from baseline in 
AIA titers between treatment groups, the percentage of subjects with confirmed  positive  AIA who 
develop any anti -insulin neutralizing antibodies up to  visit Week 26 , and the percentage of subjects 
in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26  
• Safety: To evaluate the safety o f Gan & Lee  Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that of 
Lantus® 
• Efficacy: To evaluate the efficacy of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that 
of Lantus® 
 
Exploratory Objective:  
• To investigate the retrospective hypoglycemic rate and time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 
using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data  
STUDY DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Gan  & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection with that of  the reference 
medicinal product, Lantus®, in adult  subjects  with type 2  diabetes mellitus.  
At the s creening visit, subjects will sign the  informed consent form  (ICF), they will be screened for 
eligibility,  and the following information will be collected: adverse events, medical history (including 
diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and concomitant medications , vital signs, height, body 
weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The following procedures will be performed: 1 2-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), physical examination, and blood collection  for fasting blood glucose  (FBG)  test, glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1 c), AIA,  routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic 
chemistry panel  with serum lipids , thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , and free thyroxine [T4]). A 
urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this visit, 
the subject will be issued a glucometer, test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or designee will 
provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective capillary blood glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective manner. Subjects will be allowed to 
keep the glucometer after the study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations. Subjects will also 
receive a Hypoglycemic Events Record in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that o ccur during their participation in the study. At this visit, the subject will have an Abbott 
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System sensor applied to the back of the upper arm. The 
sensor, which calibrates itself during the first 12 to 24 hour s after application, will be worn for 8  days and 
will record the interstitial glucose concentration every 15 minutes. Data from the 2
nd through the 8th day of 
wear will be used for the analysis. The subject will also be issued a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Rec ord for the 
4
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
8-day period, in which they will record the time of their meals and insulin use. After 8  days, the subject may 
remove the sensor and bring it to the randomization visit  in a provided biohazard bag; if the end of the 8 -day 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor 
can be removed at the visit  by site staff . The information obtained through CGM will have no direct impact 
on treatment advice and is intended for research purposes only. S ubjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic 
Events Record and their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit. Between the screening and randomization visits, subjects already taking basal insulin will have their insulin dose optimized based  
on their fasting glucose results, and will also have any appropriate adjustments in their o ther antidiabetes 
medication (OAM) dosing that may be required because of the optimization of their insulin dosing. Subjects not currently on insulin will have thei r OAM dosing optimized in preparation for starting basal insulin 
therapy.
 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -label fashion to 
receive either Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection or Lantus® for 2 6 weeks. Subjects currently taking 
insulin will continu e using their OAMs  and will substitute  investigational product (IP)  for their basal  insulin. 
Subjects not currently taking insulin will co ntinue their OAMs, will add IP, and will have the dosing 
optimize d. 
The Sponsor will ensure that all insulins will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or 
reimbursement issues. This applies to the non -study insulins and this should be discussed with the Study 
Monitor . 
At the randomization visit (V isit 2) , subjects will receive a supply of insulin pens with IP. The Investigator or 
designee will train the subject on all study procedures and proper dose administration.  
All subjects will attend 9 clinic visits (the screening  visit, the randomization visit, and visits at Weeks  2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief visits during which  a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits at 
Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contacted by telephone at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 . The Week 2 6 
visit (Visit 9) will be the end -of-treatment  visit.  
At all visits and phone contacts  (except for visits to apply a  CGM sensor) , the Investigator or designee will 
review glucose results  (especially focusing on hypoglycemia ), adverse events, changes in concomitant 
medications, and changes in IP, bolus  insulin , and OAM  use. At all study  visits, the following procedures 
will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing 
potential, and an FBG  test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c will be 
collected; at Weeks 12 and 26, subjects will wear their CGM sensor to the site for the staff to safely remove it; they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin  Dose Record for the site staff to review, and blood will be 
collected for routine hematology and chemistry, TSH, and free T4; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be collected for AIA; and at Week 26, a 12 -lead ECG and physical examination will be performed.  
If a subject discontinues the study prematurely (early termination – ET), site personnel will make a 
reasonable effort to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 (EOT visit). Additionally, it is also very 
important for site personnel to encourage  subjects to visit the site at Week 26 + 4 weeks (and Week 12 + 1 
week, if applicable) when blood samples can be obtained for the AIA and HbA1 c measurements.  
Site personnel will contact the subjects by telephone approximately 30 days after study completion  to query 
for serious adverse event information only.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Enrollment is planned for 5 50 subjects overall (2 75 subjects per treatment 
group). The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be 2  one-sided equivalence tests with α=0.05 . This 
sample size was chosen to achieve over 80% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects under 
the margins dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate . Sample size calculations were 
performed using EAS T Version 6.4 . 
STUDY TREATMENT(S):  Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Gan & Lee  Insulin 
Glargine Injection solution for s ubcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the integrated,  disposable 3.0-mL pre -
filled  Gan & Lee in jector  pen 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: Lantus® (insulin glargine injection) solution for 
subcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the SoloStar® 3-mL pre-filled insulin pen  
Lantus® contains insulin glargine, an insulin analog, and has a prolonged duration of action. Lantus® and Gan 
& Lee Insulin Glargine should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day. To be 
consistent with current Lantus® labeling, twice -daily dosing of IP is strictly prohibited. The dose regimen 
(dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Lantus® and Gan 
& Lee Insulin Glargine Injection can also be given together with OAMs .  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:  Subjects in both  group s will receive study treatment for  26 weeks  
STUDY EVALUATIONS:   
Primary Endpoint  
• Immunogenicity: The percentage of subjects in each treatment group who develop treatment-
induced AIA s, defined as newly  confirmed positive AIA development or important ( at least a 
4-fold) increase in titers, after baseline and up to visit Week 26

Exploratory Endpoints  
• Retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate  
• Time in hypoglycemia  and hyperglycemia  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the 2 one -sided tests (TOST) 
approach with α=0.05 via a test of difference in proportions based on normal approximation (- margin, 
+margin) where the margin is dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate in Lantus® . The 
estimand of interest on the immunogenicity analysis is the difference in treatment -induced AIA rates regardless 
if all subjects tolerate or adhere to study treatment o r receive other insulin treatments. Intercurrent events will 
be handled according to the treatment policy strategy. Treatment policy strategy is defined as  the strategy that 
considers  “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is used 
regardless of whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (ICH E9 R1 ) addendum.  The key secondary analysis 
will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority (EMA) of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative 
to Lant us® for HbA1 c by comparing the 90% confidence interval  (CI) (-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the 
TOST approach and by comparing the upper limit of the 95% CI with 0.4% from a pattern mixture model that 
uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment included as a 
fixed effect and baseline HbA1 c included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation 
will use the outcomes of patients who completed the study (including subjects who discontinued treatment, 
but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 recorded results  under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure 
will be specified in the SAP. Analysis  of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of 
HbA1
c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects 
according to randomized treatment with supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. A tipping point 
analysis  with varying assumptions about the differences on each treatment arm between outcomes in patients 
who withdrew from the study early and outcomes in patients who completed the study will be performed.  
Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be 
summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  
The secondary immunogenicity variables of the percentage of subjects with negative AIA at baseline who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26  and the percentage of subjects with confirmed positive 
AIA after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will  be compared between treatment groups using a normal test 
of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction.  The secondary immunogenicity 
variables of the percentage of subjects in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA at baseline and

at least a 4 -fold increase in titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 and the percentage of subjects with 
confirmed positive AIA  after baseline and up to visit Week 26 who develop any anti -insulin neutralizing 
antibodies after baseline and up to visit Week 26, will be compared between treatment groups using an exact 
test of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the 
corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set. The exact confidence limits are computed by inverting 2 
separate one- sided exact tests that are based on the score statistic.  The mean change from baseline in each 
treatment g roup in AIA titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will be tabulated descriptively . 
Safety variables will be summarized descriptively in the Safety Analysis Set consisting of all randomized  
subjects according to actual treatment received. All reported adverse events will be assigned a system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The number and percentage of subjects  with 
adverse events (all adverse events, hypoglycemia, serious adverse events [including fatal], adverse events leading to termination of study treatment and/or early withdrawal from the study, IP -related adverse events, 
and injection site reactions) will  be presented. Vital signs, body weight and BMI, ECG, and laboratory 
results will be summarized by treatment and visit.  
The secondary efficacy variables of number and percentage of subjects achieving a HbA1
c value <  7.0% at 
visit Week 26   and the number and percentage of subjects achieving a FBG test result of ≤ 8.0 mmol/L 
(≤ 144.0 mg/dL) in each treatment group will be compared using a test of difference of proportions based on 
the normal approximation and CIs.  
The retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate and time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be 
summarized for subjects in the Safety Analysis Set.

6. INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review  
Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that, if inadequately treated, can lead to significant 
morbidity, including macrovascular and microvascular complications, an d significantly 
increased mortality [ 1].  
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and in the initial stages of the disease, hyperinsulinemia. Even before overt hyperglycemia occurs, dysfunction of the β-cells of the pancreas has been demonstrated. Increased secretion of insulin may for a time 
compensate for insulin resistance, but with progressive loss of β -cell function  or mass, 
production of endogenous insulin decreases [ 2]. 
In addition to comprehensive management of lipids and cardiovascular risk factors, the reduction of hyperglycemia is the primary goal of therapy. Initial treatment strategies for 
managing hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes include lifestyle interventions with modest exercise and weight loss, and the addition of medications to enhan ce insulin 
sensitivity, such as thiazolidinediones, metformin, and secretagogues. Newer drug classes include glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, sodium- glucose transporter -2 inhibitors, and 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. At some point, many patients may require the addition of basal insulin, either because of difficulty achieving glycemic control despite combination therapy with oral drugs or insufficient secretion of endogenous insulin [ 3]. 
6.2 Compound Review  – Insulin Glargine  
Insulin glargine is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a longer duration of action than human insulin. The substitution of glycine for asparagine at A21 and the addition of 2 arginines at the C-terminus of the B chain result in stabilization of the molecule, leading to delayed and prolonged absorption after subcutaneous injection [ 4]. 
6.2.1 Nonc linical Studies  
An extensive characterization and comparison of structural and biofunctional properties of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine injection and Lantus
® has been conducted [ 5]. The structural 
characterization including primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures; size, hydrophobicity and charge heterogeneities; cell-based biofunctionality including the binding to the r eceptors of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, and the activation of the insulin-
signaling cascade and the stimulation of glucose uptake were demonstrated to be similar between Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection and Lantus
®. For in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacologic and toxicologic studies and clinical studies, reference is made to NDA 021081 [ 4]. 
6.2.2 Clinical Studies  
In 2016, Study GL- GLA -001, a phase I, exploratory, randomized, double-blind, 2- way 
crossover pilot study, demonstrated bioequivalence of Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection 
and United States (US) -sourced Lantus
®. Although this exploratory study provided a 
statistically robust conclusion of biosimilarity  based on pharmacokinetics, it was not powered 
to provide robust statistical conclusions in terms of pharmacodynamics . Gan & Lee Insulin 
19
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
Glargine Injection was well tolerated, and treatment- emergent adverse events were 
comparable to those with Lantus®. There were no significant signals that would indicate a 
difference in the safety profile between the treatments. A pivotal phase I study will be 
performed concurrently to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynami c effects of Gan 
& Lee  Insulin G largine Injection compared with US - and European- sourced Lantus®. 
6.3 Clinical Study  Rationale 
The purpose of this study is to compare Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection 100 U/mL with 
Lantus®, Sanofi-Aventis’ brand of insulin glargine injection 100 U/mL, and evaluate 
equivalence in terms of immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy, in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus . 
Insulin analogs are more costly than conventional insulins, and limited ac cess to affordable 
insulin may keep some patients from accessing important treatment options, leading to unnecessary complications [ 1, 6].  
Biosimilar products may result in significant price reductions compared to the cost of the reference products, even if the reductions are not of the magnitude seen with many generics [ 7]. 
Biosimilar drugs are not identical to the reference product. Because even small differences in the primary structure can result in clinically significant functional differences, there are concerns about potential risks to patients [ 7]. Insulin glargine has been shown to exhibit 
proliferative and anti -apoptotic effects in vitro in color ectal cancer cells; however, clinical 
studies have produced conflicting results regarding an association between insulin glargine and cancer risk [ 8]. And although a number of observational studies in 2009 found an 
association between insulin glargine and an increased risk for breast cancer in patients with type 2 diabetes, a recent study of more than 12,000 subjects with type 2 diabetes who were newl y started on insulin glargine showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer after a 
median 5-year follow-up period among those who were insulin-naive. A nonsignificant increase in risk was found among subjects who had switched to insulin glargine from other insulins [ 9]. 
Because biosimilar insulins have immunogenic potential, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA require an evaluation of safety and immunogenicity between biosimilars and their reference products, and the EMA has indicated these studies should be of sufficient 
duration (at least 6 to 12 months) to detect these differences. This study is designed in 
accordance with the guidan ce documents provided by the EMA [ 10] and the FDA [ 11]. 
The immunogenicity assessment will use the one- assay [ 12] and tiered approach [ 13]. 
Samples collected at all time points (including pre -dose) from both treatment groups will first 
be tested using the validated electrochemiluminescence method [ 14]. The rate and degree of 
immunogenicity, and data interpretation will also include consideration of other clinical attributes such as (but not limited to) symptoms of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions and the pharmacokinetic profile.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy 
of Gan  & Lee  Insulin Glargine I njection with that of the reference medicinal product, 
Lantus®, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form  (ICF), they will be 
screened  for eligibility, and the following information will be collected: adverse events, 
medical history (including diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and 
concomitant medications, vital signs, height, body weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The 
following procedures will be performed: 12- lead electrocardiog ram (ECG), physical 
examination, and blood collect ion for fasting blood glucose (FBG)  test, HbA1 c, AIA,  routine 
hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic chemistry panel with  
serum lipids , thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [T4]). A urinalysis , and 
for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this visit, 
the subject will be issued a glucometer , test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or 
designee will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective manner. Subjects will b e allowed to keep the glucometer  after the study, per local ethical and 
legal guidelines and regulations.
 Subjects will also receive a Hypoglycemic Events Record  in 
which they will record information about any hypoglycemic events that occur during their participation in the study.  
During the 2 weeks between screening and  randomization, subjects already on basal insulin 
will have their insulin dosing optimized according to Table 3 in Section  8.5.8. They will also 
have any appropriate adjustments in their other antidiabetes medication s (OAM ) dosing that 
may be required because of the optimization of the ir insulin dosing. Subjects who are insulin -
naïve will have their OAM dosing optimized to prepare them for starting basal insulin therapy. 
Also , at the screening visit, the subject will have a FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose 
Monitoring sensor  applied to the back of the upper arm accord ing to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Monitoring System is approved by the EMA  for people 
18 years of age or older with diabetes. The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring 
System sensor , which requires 12 to 24 hours to calibrate itself after application, will be worn 
for 8  days and will record the interstitial fluid glucose every 15 minutes.  Data from the 2
nd 
through the 8th days of wear will be used for each analysis.  The sensor will be blinded to the 
subject and no subjec t action will be needed. The subject will also be issued a Mealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of their meals and insulin use. After 8 days, the subject may remove the sensor, place in the biohazard bag provided, and bring it with them to the randomization visit. If the end of the 8-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM ) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can be removed 
at the visit  by the site staff . Subjects will bring both th eir Hypoglycemic Events Record and 
their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit.

Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open-
label fashion to receive either Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lantus® for 26 weeks. 
Subjects currently taking insulin will continue using their OAMs  and will substitute  IP for 
their basal  insulin as described in  Section 8.5.8. Subjects not currently taking basal insulin 
will c ontinue their OAMs, add IP , and undergo insulin dosing optimization and adjustments 
in OAM dosing as needed as described in Section 8.5.8. 
The Sponsor will ensure that all insulins will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical 
insurance or reimbursement issues.   
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will receive supply of insulin pens with IP  and 
the Investigator or designee will train subjects on all study procedures and proper dose 
administration. 
Subjects in both treatment groups will be assessed every 2 weeks after Visit 2 ( randomization 
visit) through Week 22 ( telephone call ) and then at Week 26; they will attend 9 clinic visits 
(the s creening visit, the randomization visit, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief 
visits during which a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits at Weeks 12 
and 26), and they will be contacted by telephone at Weeks 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. T he Week 
26 visit (Visit 9) will be the end-of- treatment  visit . 
At all visits and phone contacts (except for visits to apply a CGM sensor) the Investigator or 
designee will review glucose results (especially looking for hypoglycemia), adverse events,  
changes in concomitant medications, and changes in IP , bolus insulin, and OAM use. At all 
study visits, the following procedures will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, 
urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential, and an FBG test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c 
will be collected; during the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their  CGM sensors 
to the site for the site staff to safely remove it, and they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  for the site staff to review , and, blood will be collected for routine hematology 
and chemistry , TSH, free T4, and AIA testing; and at Week 26, a 12- lead ECG and physical 
examination will be performed . Figure 1 and Table 1 show the study design and study- related 
procedures, respectively.  
If a su bject discontinues the study prematurely, site personnel will make a reasonable effort 
to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 (end of treatment [ EOT] visit). 
Additionally, it is very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 (± 4 weeks) (and Week 12 ± 1 week if applicable) for a blood sample to be obtained for AIA and HbA1
c measurements.

8.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This open- label study is designed to evaluate Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection compared 
with that of Lantus® in subjects with type 2 diabetes to determine equivalence. Subjects will 
continue using their bolus insulin (which should not be changed for the duration of the study, 
with the exception of a dose change) and will substitute  IP for their basal  insulin. Subjects 
not currently using a basal insulin will add IP to their treatment.  
8.3 Study Duration  
Subjects will participate for 26 weeks. Recruitment will stop when approximately 
275 subjects have been randomized to each treatment group. The study will end when the last subject completes the end -of-treatment visit , or discontinues the study treatment, whichever 
occurs first.  
This study duration has been used in comparisons between other biosimilar basal  insulin 
analogs and their reference products.

Investigational product must be kept in an appropria te, limited -access, secure location . The 
storage area should be labeled “For Investigational Use.” The Investigator or designee must 
maintain a  log of temperature for the refrigerator in which  IP is  stored and  must record and 
evaluate the temperature of the storage site in accordance with all applicable standards.  
8.5.6.1.1 Gan & Lee  Insulin Glargine  Injection  
Before opening, store Gan & Lee Insulin Glargi ne Injection in a refrigerator at 36 to 46o F 
(2 to 8°C). Do not freeze or place next to the freezer or a freezer pack. Keep the unopened 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection pens in the outer carton to protect from light. After its first use, the pen must be stored not above 30°C (86
oF), for a maximum of 4 weeks. Do not 
refrigerate. Keep the pen protected from light.  
8.5.6.1.2 Lantus® 
Lantus® should not be stored in the freezer and should not be allowed to freeze. Discard 
Lantus® if it has been frozen. Protect Lantus® from direct heat and light. Unopened Lantus® 
that is not in use should be stored refrigerated at 36° to 46°F (2° to 8°C). After a Lantus® 
SoloStar® insulin pen is opened and in use, it should be stored at room temperature below 
86°F ( 30°C) for a maximum of 28 days. Once opened, the Lantus® SoloStar® pen should not 
be refrigerated.  
8.5.6.2 Study Treatment Accountability  
The Investigator is required to document the receipt, issue, and return or destruction of IP  
provided by the Sponsor , in accordan ce with GCP .

8.5.7 Gan & Lee  Insulin Glargine Injection Pen and the  Lantus® SoloStar® 
The Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection pen and the Lantus® SoloStar® are disposable, 
multiple -dose, “dial and push”- type variable dose  pens intended for the subcutaneous 
administration of insulin . The injector pen and the drug product (in a 3.0- mL pre-filled glass 
cartridge) form a single integral product and will be used in conjunction with needles in a 
suitable range of s izes to be determined by the Investigator’s team. The 3- mL pre -filled glass 
cartridge contains 300 units of insulin and a maximum deliverable dose of 1 to 80 units with a dose increment of 1 unit . The Investigator or designee will train subjects regarding proper 
use and handling of the insulin pens for the study and instruct subjects to bring used insulin kits to clinic visits  when all the pens needed in a kit have been used. At the end-of- treatment  
visit, subjects will bring all used and unused kits to the clinic. 
8.5.8 Dose Adjustments and Dose Escalation  
8.5.8.1 Subjects Already on Basal Insulin  
During the 2 weeks between screening and randomization, subjects will have their insulin 
dosing optimized according to Table 3. They will also have any appropriate adjustments in 
their OAM therapy that may be required because of the optimization of their insulin dosing. 
8.5.8.2 Subjects  Not Currently on Basal Insulin Therapy  
8.5.8.2.1 Pre-Randomization 
During the 2 weeks between screening and randomizatio n, subjects will have thei r OAM 
dosing optimized to prepare them for starting basal insulin therapy.  
8.5.8.2.2 Post-Randomization Insulin and OAM  Optimization  
Subjects will be prescribed a dose of Lantus
® or G an & Lee Insulin G largine Injection that 
will be individu ally adjusted according to the metabolic status of the subject and at the 
discretion of the clinical investigational team at the site. During the 4 weeks following 
randomization, these subjects will have their insulin dosing optimized according to Table 3. 
They will also have any appropriate adjustments in their OAMs that may be required because of the optimization of their insulin dosing. Optimizing the dose before the randomization visit will reduce the need for dose adjustments during the study. Subjects will follow the instructions provided by the Investigator regarding any dose adjustments and other details regarding the clinical management of glucos e and insulin.

8.5.8.3 Hypoglycemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia may change with a change of insulin regimen, 
depending on the action profile of the insulins used. Because Lantus® has a more sustained 
basal insulin supply, fewer nocturnal but more frequent early morning episodes of hypoglycemia can be expected. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable for subjects in whom hypoglycemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as subjects with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycemia), and for subjects with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if they have not been treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycemia). 
Subject adherence to the prescribed medication, diet, and exercise regimens; correct insulin 
administration; and awareness of symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. If normal or decreased HbA1
c values are noted, the Investigator should 
consider the possibil ity of recurrent, unrecognized (especially nocturnal) episodes of 
hypoglycemia. 
Investigators will advise each subject about circumstances in which warning symptoms of 
hypoglycemia may be different, diminished, or absent, and that hypoglycemia (and possibl e 
loss of consciousness) may occur before the subject is aware of any symptoms.  
Some factors that may increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia and require particularly close monitoring and possible dose adjustment include: 
• Markedly improved glycemic control after starting the study treatment 
• A known tendency to gradually develop hypoglycemia 
• Older subject age 
• Switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• Autonomic neuropathy 
• A long history of diabetes 
• Psychiatric illness  
• A change in the site of injectio n from one body area to another 
• Conditions that may improve insulin sensitivity such as decreased stress 
• Unusual, increased, or prolonged physical activity

• Intercurrent illness such as vomiting or diarrhea  
• Inadequate intake of food and/or liquids 
• Missed meals  
• Alcohol consumption 
• Uncompensated endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency  
• Concomitant medications that may enhance the blood glucose- lowering effect and 
increase susceptibility to hypoglycemia, such as angiotensin converting-enzyme 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics 
• Concomitant medications that block the sympathetic nervous system such as beta -
blockers 
 
8.5.9 Previous and Concomitant Therapy  
Administration of concomitant medications must be reported in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF , with dosage information, dates of administration, and indication for use. Investigators 
and site staff should use generic names for concomitant medications if possible. All fields should be completed on the eCRF. See Appendix 3 ( Section  17.3) for a list of allowed and 
prohibited concomitant medications. 
8.5.10 Treatment Compliance  
Investigators and site staff will review each subject’s treatment medication use at scheduled 
clinic visits and telephone calls, and at any interim clinic visits, and study treatment compliance will be assessed.  
8.5.11 Assignment to Treatment  
Randomization will be performed through IXRS. The Investigator or designee will access the IXRS to randomize enrolled subjects. The IXRS system will assign a unique randomization number and study medication kit number. No subject may be randomized more than once, and no randomization number will be assigned to more than 1 subject.

At the screening  visit, each subject will be issued with a glucometer, test strips, and other 
supplies for use during the study to document hypoglycemic episodes in a prospective 
manner . The Investigator or qualified site staff will train each subject on the correct use of 
these supplies and any related procedures, and subjects can obtain  additional supplies as 
35
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
needed at subsequent stu dy visits. Subjects will also be issued a Hypoglycemic Events 
Record  in which they will fully record information prospectively about any hypoglycemic 
events.  They will bring this record  to each study visit except those brief visits  for application 
of a CGM  sensor. Subjects will be allowed to keep the glucometer  after the study per local, 
ethical and legal guidelines and regulations. 
8.6.2 FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash  Glucose Monitoring System  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitori ng System is a glucose-monitoring device 
indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons (age 18 and older) with 
diabetes.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System aids in understanding the person’s  glucose profile and detecting  episodes of hyperglyc emia and hypoglyc emia.  
Interpretation of the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System readings will be based o n the trends and patterns analyzed through time using the reports available. 
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring  System consists of a sensor with an 
applicator, and reader that is used to start the sensor on the subject and gather the glucose 
data at the end of the CGM period. The s ensor has a small, flexible filament  that is ins erted 
just under the skin. The s ensor can be worn for up to 14 days. Multiple subjects can have 
their sensor started by the same reader. Once applied, a sensor will measure and store the glucose readings every 15 minutes. Each site will have a single reader that will  be used for all 
their subjects. R eadings from the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will 
not be made available to s ubjects in real time and so they will continue performing glucose 
self-testing with the glucometer according to the Investigator’s instructions. The FreeSty le 
Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will be used for data collection purposes only and will not be used to make treatment  decisions. The s ystem does not requir e any subject 
action . 
At the screening visit and between 8  and 10 days before the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, 
subjects will attend a brief visit so the Investigator or designee can apply a CGM sensor to the back of the upper arm  according to the instructions in the FreeStyle Libre Pro User 
Guide. Subjects will also receive a Mealtime & Insulin  Dose Record in which they will 
record the time of meals and insulin doses for the 8-day CGM period. 
Eight days after the screening visit, the subject may remove the sensor and will bring it to the 
randomization visit in a provided biohazard bag ; if the en d of the 8-day CGM period 
coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit by site staff . Subjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic Events Record and their Mealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visi t. 
For the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, t he subject will have worn the sensor  for the 8- day CGM 
period before the visit, and the site staff will remove the sensor at the visit. The Investigator 
36
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
or designee will use the reader to retrieve the data from the sensor, and the 8-day M ealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record  will be collected and reviewed. The data from the sensor does not need 
to be uploaded at the time of the visit, but the Investigator will retain each sub ject’s  sensor 
until it is confirm ed the data have been successfully uploaded.  Each sensor will be labeled 
with the subject and visit number and will be stored in a secure location until the end of the 
study after confirmation of successful upload. 
Investigators and staff will review  the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System 
warnings and limitations and  instruct subjects about the need to avoid medications and 
conditions that could interfere with the results .

ensure that the following steps are taken at an early termination (ET) visit: 
• Conduct an ET visit performing study activities listed under Visit 9 (Section 9.10 no later than 14 days after withdrawal or discontinuation from the study  
• If the subject fails to attend a scheduled ET visit, site staff will make at least 2 attempts to contact the subject via telephone and 2 attempts via written communications delivered by courier (delivery should be confirmed and documented). If the subject does not respond to any of these attempts at communication, he or she will be considered lost to follow- up 
• Complete all appropriate eCRF  pages, providing the date of and explanation for the 
subject’s withdrawal/discontinuation  
• When indicated, the Investigator should arrange for appropriate follow- up medical 
care for the subjects  
If a subject discontinues the study prematurely, it is very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 (± 4 weeks) (and Week 12 ± 1 week, if applicable) for a blood sample to be obtained for AIA and HbA1
c measurements.  
9.12 Follow- up Telephone Call

10. METHODS OF ASSESSMENT
10.1 Pregn
ancy Test ing
Subjects who are pregnant at screening or planning to become pregnant during the study will
be excluded from participation in the study. A ll women of childbearing potentia l will have a
urine pregnancy test at screening and at each clinic visit . Unless a female subject meets at
least 1 of the following criteria, she will be considered to be of childbearing potential:
•Postmenopausal, defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an
alternative medical cause
•Surgically or congenitally sterile
•Diagnosed as infertile and not undergoing treatment to restore fertility
10.2 Physical Examination  
Physical examina tions will be performed by a physician or delegate who must be listed on 
the 1572 as a sub-investigator. This responsibility should be documented on the Site 
Signature & Duty Delegation Log. The examination will include the following  organs or 
organ systems : general appearance, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, skin, cardiovascular 
system, respiratory system, abdominal system and nervous system (including a neurological examination; with an assessment of the reflexes, motor and sensory nerve assessment,  
sensory checks [ extremities ] and mental status assessment).  
The examining physician or delegate will document an assessment of normal or abnormal for 
each body system on the Physical Exam source document.  Any abnormal finding deemed to 
be clinically rele vant by the Investigator will be reported as an adverse event. See  
Section  11.1  for more details about reporting adverse events.  
10.3 Vital Signs  and Body Weight 
Systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure will be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm) after the subject has been in a supine/sitting  position for 
5 minutes. Pulse will be recorded simultaneously with blood pressure measurements.  
Body weight (kg) will be measured without shoes or jacket. Height will be recorded at 
screening to calculate BMI . 
During the study, the Investigator may repeat vital signs for safety reasons. Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported as adverse events . 
10.4 Electrocardiogram  
Computerized  12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained, after the subject  has been supine for 
5 minutes. Each lead will be recorded for at least 3 -5 beats at a speed of 25 mm/sec paper 
speed and 10 mm/mV amplitude. At a minimum, heart rate, P, PR, QRS, QT and corrected QT intervals (msec) will be recorded from the 12 -lead ECG. A copy of all ECGs will be 
retained on site and these may be collected for central review if required (i.e., in case emerging ECG data necessitate expert evaluation).  
44
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2 -3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
For the purposes of screening, the Investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG 
is normal or abnormal, and if abnormal, whether the abnormality will exclude the subject from participating in the study.  
Investigators may repeat ECGs for quality or safety reasons. Any abnormal finding deemed to be clinically relevant by the Investigator will be reported as an adverse event . Subjects 
with clinically relevant cardiovascular side effects or adverse events, or clinically relevant ECG changes must be withdrawn from the study (see S ection  8.4.3).  
10.5 Clinical Laboratory Testing 
The following routine clinical laboratory tests will be performed as indicated in Table 1 and 
Section 9. 
• Complete blood count (red blood cell [ RBC ] count, white blood cell [WBC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, RBC  indices, and a 5 -part WBC  differential 
[percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils])  
• Chemistry metabolic panel, inc luding glucose, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, total protein, total and conjugated bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and creatine kinase  
• Serum l ipid panel including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density 
lipoprotein, and triglycerides 
•  TSH and free T4  
The following additional blood tests will be performed at specific visits as outlined in Table 1 and Section 9. More information about sample collection and handling will be included in the respective laboratory manuals. 
• AIA (blood should be collected before the subject administers insulin) 
• FBG  test (venous) 
• HbA1
c 
10.6 Urinalysis  
Urinalysis, including glucose, protein, and ketones, will be performed at each study visit in the clinic.

11. SAFETY MEASUREMENTS  AND VARIABLES  
11.1 Adverse Events  
The definitions and reporting procedures provided in this protocol comply with the current 
CFR 21 Part 312. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition, regardless of the relationship to  the investig ational med icinal product. 
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product.  
Adverse events will be recorded beginning at the screening visit. Nonserious adverse events 
will be recorded from the time informed consent is signed through the subject’s last study visit (or termination if the s ubject terminates early from the study for any reason). Serious 
adverse events will be collected from the time informed consent is signed through and including 30 calendar days after the last dose of treatment with IP.  
The Investigator or designee will rec ord all adverse event s on the eCRF, regardless of the 
Investigator’s assessment of causality, including a description of the event, severity, time of occurrence, duration, any action ( e.g., treatment and follow -up tests), the event outcome, and 
the Investi gator’s assessment of the relationship to the study treatment. 
11.2 Serious A dverse E vents   
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• results in death 
• is life -threatening (refers to events dur ing which a subject was actually at risk of death, 
and not to events that might have become life -threatening if they had occurred in a more 
severe form or if the subject had not received treatment)  
• requires hospitalization or causes prolongation of exi sting inpatient hospitalization   
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• is a congenital abnormality/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject 
• is an important medical event  that does not meet any of the above criteria but may require 
medical intervention to prevent the outcomes listed above, or is considered important by the Investigator; examples of important medical events include:  
o Bronchospasm requiring treatment in the emergency department or at home 
o Development of a blood dyscrasia  
o Diagnosis of a substance use disorder  
11.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest is a noteworthy serious or nonserious event that a Sponsor may want to carefully monitor because it might be a potential precursor or prodrome for a more serious condition in susceptible individuals. In this study, hypoglycemia will be monitored as an adverse event of special interest. When an adverse event of hypoglycemia is 
46
Protocol  No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
entered into the electronic data capture system, the system will  prompt the user to provide 
additional information. 
11.4  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to PRA 
In addition to completing all eCRFs related to serious adverse events, the Investigator or 
designee must report all serious adverse events to PRA Drug Safety wi thin 24 hours after 
learning about the event, even if the information is incomplete. 
PRA Drug Safety  Contact Information:  
PRA Health Sciences – Charlottesville, VA, USA 
Drug Safety Helpline: 1 -800-772-2215 or 1-434-951-3489 
Fax: 1 -888-772-6919 or 1 -434-951-3482 
E-mail: CHOSafety@prahs .com
To be valid, t he initial serious adverse event report must  include the following minimal data: 
•A reporting source (t he Investigator’s name and/or site number , and contact
information )
•A subject identifier
•The ident ity of  IP
•A serious adverse event term, description, or outcome
Investigators will provide the following additional data as soon as possible, but these data are not required for the initial report if they are not immediately available : 
•Event start date
•Event end date if known; the end date is the date on which serious criteria were nolonger met; i .e., the event was no longer serious
•Severity (Grades 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 according to the Common Terminology Criteria forAdverse Events [ CTCAE] version 4.03)
•The Investigator’s assessment of causality ( unrelated, unlikely related, possibly
related, probably related, or definitely related )
•Any serious criteria that apply  to the event  (see Section  11.2 )
Investigators will su bmit follow -up reports for serious adverse events whenever additional 
pertinent information becomes available and  will provide copies of all pertinent documents 
such as hospital records, admission and discharge summaries, surgical records, laboratory reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. 
11.5 Monitoring of Subject s with Adverse Events  
Each subject must be carefully monitored for adverse events, including c linically significant 
abnormal laboratory test results, physical examination findings, and ECG results. At each 
study visit or communication, the Investigator or designee will ask subjects about any new symptoms or worsening of baseline symptoms that could indicate an adverse event . 
11.5.1 Abnormal Laboratory Test Results 
Changes or abnormalities in clinical laboratory results judged to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be recorded as adverse events. If an unexplained abnormal laboratory 
test resu lt occurs, the Investigator or designee will promptly repeat the test and monitor the 
47
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
subject until the result has returned to the normal range or an adequate explanation of the 
abnormality is found. 
11.5.2 Abnormal Physical Examination Findings  or ECG Changes  
Changes or abnormalities in physical examination findings or ECGs judged to be clinically 
significant by the Investigator will be recorded as adverse events. 
11.6 Overdose of Study Medication  
Any overdose of the study medication, with or without associated adverse events, must be reported to PRA Drug Safety. Overdose will be reported in the eCRF. All reports of overdoses must be filed in the Study Center File. Any adverse event  associated with the 
overdose will  be re ported on relevant adverse event /serious adverse event  sections in the 
eCRF.  
Investigators will instruct subjects how to manage the dose of their study medication and other medications for diabetes, and procedures to be followed if an overdose occurs. Subjects will be instructed to seek medical assistance immediately if they experience an overdose of study medication and to notify the Investigator as soon as feasible. 
11.7 Pregnancy  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless the Investigator suspects an IP 
may have interfered with the e ffectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, any 
pregnancy during the study and the outcome of the pregnancy (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, normal birth or congenital anomaly) must be reported to PRA. 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, she will discontinue IP immediately and 
report th e pregnancy to the Investigator. The subject will attend an end-of- treatment visit and 
should be followed by the Investigator through childbirth or termination of the pregnancy. 
The Inve stigator will submit an initial  report upon learning of the pregnancy, and a follow -up 
form when the outcome of the pregnancy is known. If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, the subject may continue in the study but the pregnancy should be reported in the same manner as described above. Any congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject will be reported as a serious adverse event. Investigators should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise.

12. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The data management and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by PRA Health 
Sciences.  
12.1 Data Management 
An e lectronic clinical database (Medidata Solutions) will be us ed and a Data Management 
Plan will be prepared by PRA Health Sciences. 
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available WHO Drug Reference Dictio nary. Coexistent diseases and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA).  
When the data base has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be 
locked. Any changes to the database after that time can be made only by written agreement between Gan & Lee  Pharmaceuticals  USA and PRA Health Sciences. 
12.2 Sample Size Estimation  
Enrollm ent is planned for 550 subjects overall (275 subjects per treatment group). The 
primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the 2 one- sided tests 
(TOST) approach with α=0.05. This  sample size was chosen to achieve over 80%  power on 
the equivalence test of proportion of subjects under the margins dependent on the observed treatment- induced AIA rate . For example, a sample size of 550 will provide approximately 
85% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects with t reatment -induced AIA 
using an event rate of 30% and a margin of 12% ( Table  4). The treatment -induced AIA is 
defined as newly  confirmed positive AIA develo pment or important ( at least a 4 -fold) 
increase in  AIA titers, after baseline and up to visit Week 26. For this sample size of 550, no 
dropouts are considered in the calculation. Subjects will be encouraged to come back for assessments even if they have discontinued treatment  early . 
The similarity margin, based on the actual observed event rate for the intended reference product, will be used f or final analysis after database lock as summarized in Table 4. Linear 
interpolation will be used for values between AIA rates in the table.

12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study 
database. The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol. Additional analyses may be added. Table, listing and figures shells will also be provided. 
12.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or 
Lantus
® treatment.  
Registration and randomization will take place using a centralized IXRS. At registration, the 
IXRS will assign a unique subject identification number that will be used on all of that subject’s eCRFs and serious adverse event  report forms.  
The study is not blinded. However, to avoid the introduction of operational bias into final study results and to increase the interpretability and reliability of the data , certain roles of  the 
Sponsor and study team will be blinded. Details will be provide d in the Data Blinding and 
Documentation of Aggregate Data Dissemination Plan (hereafter referred to as the Blinding Plan).

12.5 Analysis Sets 
12.5.1 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set is composed  of all randomized subjects who receive any IP , even a 
partial dose ( Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lantus®). Subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received. All safety  and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set.  
12.5.2 Full Anal ysis Set   
The Full  Analysis Set (FAS) is composed  of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the FAS 
will be grouped according to planned treatment. All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
using the FAS based on the subject’s randomized treatment . 
12.5.3 Per Protoco l Set 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set is composed of all randomized subjects who received at least 1  partial dose and do not have any important protocol deviations during the first 
26 weeks of the study. Subjects in the PP Analysis Set will be grouped a ccording to actual 
treatment received. The PP Analysis Set will be used for sensitivity analyses of confirmed positive AIA and HbA1c and demography summary. 
12.6 Statistical Methods  
In general, categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, and standard  deviation, median, minimum 25
th and 75th percentiles, and maximum. All 
summa ries will be presented by treatment groups as well as the total.  All statistical analyses 
will be performed using SAS®. The SAS® version number will be noted in the SAP.

Additional sensitivity analyses on the imputation, which  explore the limitation(s) of the data 
or assumption(s) of the primary analysis being evaluated in each sensitivity analysis and how 
the analysis addresses each, will also be discussed in the SAP . 
Missing data will be imputed for the HbA1 c analysis. The robustness of the imputation will 
be explored via sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation and including a tipping point 
analysis. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be presented in the SAP. 
12.6.2 Demographic and Baseline Data 
Demographic information and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the FAS, 
Safety Analysis Set, and PP Set. Descriptive statistics will be provided for age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body weight, height, and BMI.

A tabulation of the number and percentage of subjects randomized in each center will be 
presented.  
12.7 Primary Endpoint  
12.7.1 Incidence of Treatment -Induced Anti -Insulin Antibodies  
The primary analysis for immunogenicity wi ll be an equivalence test using the TOST 
approach with α=0.05, which is algebraically equivalent to comparing the limits of the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) for treatment-induced AIA development via a test of difference in 
proportions based on normal approximation  to (-margin, +margin) where the margin is 
dependent on the observed treatment-induced AIA rate in Lantus® and is defined in Table 4. 
The estimand of interest for the primary immunogenicity analysis is the difference in 
treatment-induced AIA rates regardless if all subjects tolerate or adhere to study treatment  or 
receive ot her insulin treatments . Intercurrent events will be handled according to the 
treatment policy strategy. Treatment Policy strategy is defined as the strategy that considers “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is used regardless of whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (See  ICH E9 R1 addendum 
[16]). Sensitivity analys es including worst -case imputation and using a ‘Composite Strategy’ 
will be conducted. 
12.8 Key Secondary Endpoint  
12.8.1 Change from Baseline in HbA1
c at 26 Weeks 
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority (EMA) of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus® for HbA1 c by comparing the 90% 
CI with (- 0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by comparing the upper 
limit of the 95% CI with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that  uses 
multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment included as a fixed effect and baseline HbA1
c included as a covariate. Separately in each 
treatment group, the imputation will use the outcomes of patients who complete d the study 
(including the subjects who discontinued treatment, but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1 c 
sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the 
test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority  will be tested using 
a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1 c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full 
Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with 
supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. A tipping point analysis with varying assumptions about the differences on each treatment arm between outcomes in patients who withdrew from the study early and outcomes in patients who completed the study will be performed. The estimand of interest for the HbA1
c analysis is the difference in change from 
baseline for HbA1c using the “treatment policy strategy.”

13. MONITORING PROCEDURES (Q UALITY ASSURANCE)  
The Sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to conduct this study in accordance 
with established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines. To fulfill these obligations and to stay  apprised  of study progress, the Sponsor's monitors or representatives will visit the 
investigative sites during study conduct, in addition to maintaining telephone and written communication. On-site visits, telephone calls, and regular inspection of the e CRFs will be 
conducted to assess subject enrol lment, compliance with protocol procedures, completeness 
and accuracy of data entered on the eCRFs, verification of e CRF data against original source 
documents, and occurrence of adverse events. The Investigator must provide the monitor with full access to all source and study documents.  
13.1 Risk and Quality Tolerance Limits and Routine Monitoring  
Sponsor assigned monitors will conduct regular site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring various aspects of the study. The Investigator must agree to Sponsor-authori zed personnel having direct access to the clinical (or associated) files and 
clinical study  supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for all study subjects considered for 
study entry for the purpose of verifying entries made in the e CRF s, and assist with th eir 
activities, if requested. Adequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by the Investigator. 
The site must complete the eCRFs in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to allow 
regular review by the study monitor. 
Perceived risks and quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be identified and documented before 
the start of the study. 
The S ponsor will review risk control measures periodically to ascertain whether the 
implemented quality management activities remain effective and relevant. The quality 
management approach and any important deviations from the predefined QTLs (and remedial actions adopted) will be described in the clinical study report. 
13.2 Inspections and Auditing Procedures  
The Sponsor or its representative may conduct a udits at the investigative sites including, but 
not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, the informed consent process, 
and comparison of e CRFs with source documents. All medical records (progress notes) must 
be available for audit. The Investigator agrees to participate with audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner.  
Government regulatory authorities may also inspect the investigative site  during or after the 
study. The Investigator or designee should contact the Sponsor/ contract research organization 
(CRO) immediately if this occurs. He/she must cooperate fully with regulatory authorities or 
other audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner. 
The purpose of an audit is to assess whether ethics, regulatory and quality requirements are 
fulfilled.

14.1 Electronic Case Report Forms  
Electronic CRF s will be used to store and transmit subject information. The file structure and 
format for the eCRF will be provided by the Sponsor or the ir representative and should be 
handled in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The eCRF s must be reviewed, electronically signed, and dated by the Investigator. 
Access to  eCRF s will be strictly password -protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by the examining 
personnel or the study coordinator. The eCRF must be completed as soon as possible after any subject evaluation or communication. If data is to be changed due to erroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit trail will track these changes. The eCRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to study monitors and other regulatory auditors. 
14.2 Data Collection  
During each study visit or telephone contact, the Investigator or designee  will maintain 
progress notes in the subject’s medical records to document all significant observations. At a 
minimum, these notes will contain: 
• The date of the visit and the corresponding week  or visi t number in the study schedule 
• The subject’s g eneral condition and status remarks by the subject , including any 
significant  medical findings. The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any 
reported adverse event , and the Investigat or's assessment as t o whether or not the 
reported event is IP -related  
• Changes in concomitant medications or dosages 
• A general reference to the procedures completed  
• The signature or initials of all physicians and other qualified medical designees making 
an entry in the medical record (or electronic equivalent)  
In addition, any contact with the subject  via telephone or other means that provides 
significant clinical information will also be documented in the medical record  as described 
above.  
14.3 Source Documents Maintenance  
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation. Source documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress notes), computer printouts, screening logs and recorded data from automated instruments.

14.4 Record Maintenance 
All data derived from the study will remain the property of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals . 
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP. All 
essential study documents including records of subjects, source documents, e CRF s and IP  
inventory must be kept on file. 
US FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.62[c]) require that records and documents pertaining to the 
conduct of this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including e CRF s, consent 
forms, laboratory test results, and medical inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for 2 years after marketing application approval. If no application is filed, these records must be kept 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the US FDA and the applicable national and local health authorities are notified. The Sponsor or their representative will notify the Principal Investigator of these events.  
Essential documents shoul d be retained until at least 2  years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or until a t least 2  years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of IPs . However, essential documents may be 
retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor. The Sponsor is responsible for informing the Investigator when these documents need no longer be retained. 
The Investigator will not dispose of any records relevant to this study w ithout written 
permission from the Sponsor and will provide the Sponsor the opportunity to collect such 
records. The Investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard copy source documents of all observations and data generated during this study. Such documentation is subject to inspection by the Sponsor, its representatives and regulatory authorities. 
If an Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires , the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility. 
Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the Sponsor. 
14.5 Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject ’s state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, an agreement 
will be obtained in writing.  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained. On e CRF s and 
other documents submitted to the Sponsor or the CRO, subject s must not be identified by 
name. Instead, subjects will be known only by the unique subject  number allocated to them 
to ensure confidentia lity on all study documentation. The Investigator will keep a separate 
log of these codes. 
To comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure subject  safety, it may be 
necessary for the Sponsor and its representative, the CRO personnel, the local research 
review board, or the health authorities to review subject s’ medical records as they relate to 
this study. Only the subject’s unique number on the e CRF s will identify him/her, but their 
58
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002

full names may be made known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized 
government or health care officials, if necessary, and to personnel designated by the Sponsor. 
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or the CRO (e.g., consent forms) will 
be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necessary to allow monitoring by the Sponsor and the CRO, and auditing by regulatory authorities. No documents identifying subject s by name will leave the investigative site and subject identity 
will remain confidential in all publications related to the study.

15. ADMINISTRATION PROCEDURES  
15.1 Regulatory Approval  
Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring 
that appropriate regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country 
requirements.  
No subject  may enter the study until this approval has been obtained. A copy of the approval 
(where one is provided, according to local country requirements) will be provided to the 
Investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance with ICH E6 Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and documented approval from the IRB/IECs of a protocol amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of 
telephone number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential amendment must be approved by the Sponsor. A written amendment must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/IECs assuming this responsibility. The 
Investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent im mediate hazard to subject s. In these 
cases, the IRB/IEC  must be notified within 5 days of the change.  
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IRB/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which require 
notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the loc al IRB/IEC, the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currently approved written ICF  will require modification. The modified ICF  must 
also be reviewed  and approved by the Sponsor, appropriate regulatory authorities, and the 
IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from subject s enrolled in 
the study before participation continues. 
15.3 Protocol Adherence and Deviations 
The Investigato rs and all staff involved with the study must read the protocol thoroughly and 
follow the instructions contained in it. However, exceptions will be made in emergency 
situations when the protection, safety, or well -being of the subject  requires immediate 
intervention based on the judgment of the Investigator or a responsible, appropriately trained, 
and credentialed professional(s) designated by the Investigator as a Sub-I nvestigator.

In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident, or error, the 
Investigator or designee must contact the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time by telephone. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not the subject should continue in the study. The Investigator, the Sponsor, and the Medical Monitor will document this decision. 
15.4 Publication Policy  
After completion of the study, the Investigator(s) may prepare a joint publication with the 
Sponsor. The Investigator(s) must undertake not to submit any part of the data from this protocol for publication without the prior consent of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA . 
15.5 Clinical Study Report 
A final clinical study report will be prepared according to the ICH  guideline on Structure and 
Contents of Clinical Study Reports. A final clinical study report will be prepared regardless of whether the study is completed or prematurely terminated. The Sponsor will provide each Investigator with a copy of the final report for retention.  
15.6 Contractual and Financial Details  
The Investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administrative representative) and the 
Sponsor will sign a clinical study agreement prior to the start of the study, outlining overall Sponsor and Investigator responsibilities in relation to the study. The contract should describe whether costs for pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid 
directly or indirectly. Financial Disclosure Statements will need to be completed,  as requested 
by FDA CFR 21 part 54. 
15.7 Insurance, Indemnity , and Compensation  
Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals USA undertakes to maintain an appropriate clinical study  
insurance policy. 
Deviations from the study protocol - especially the prescription of a dose other than that 
scheduled in the study protocol, other modes of administration, other indications, and longer 
treatment periods - are not permitted and shall not be covered by the statutory subject 
insurance scheme.  
15.8 Discontinuation of the Study  
This study may be terminated by the Sponsor. Reasons for discontinuation of the study may include the following situations: 
• Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable safety risk to subjects enrolled in the study 
• Discontinuation of study drug development  
The study may also be terminated prematurely if  both the Investigators and the Sponsor agree 
such action is in the best interests of subjects and  is justified on either medical or ethical 
grounds. Should early termination be necessary, subjects should stop taking the study 
medication immediately. Every documented effort should be made by the Investigator to 
61
Prot ocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019

WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA Genera l Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983

A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a 
whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt t hese principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when  providing medica l 
care.”  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
65
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and  
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current  
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and q uality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human  subjects 
and protect their health and rights. Some research populat ions are particularly  vulnerable and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research  subjects set forth in this 
Declaration.  
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health,  
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, Sponsors, 
institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest,  incentives for subjects and 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who a re harmed as a consequence of 
participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study 
access by study subjects to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or access to 
other appropriate care or benefits.  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must  be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into 
66
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to 
be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for resear ch subjects set forth in this 
Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse event s. No change to the protocol may  be made without consideration and 
approval by the committee. 
16. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate scientific training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy  
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professional and never  the re search 
subjects, even though they have given consent. 
17. Medical research involving a disadvantaged or vulnerable population or community is 
only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs and priorities of this population or community and if there is a reasonable likelihood that this population or community stands to benefit from the results of the research.  
18. Every medical research study involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to  the individuals and communities involved in 
the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or 
communities affected by the condition under investigation. 
19. Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly acces sible database before recruitment 
of the first subject.  
20. Physicians may not participate in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians must immediately stop a study when the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of positive and beneficial results.  
21. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the research subjects. 
22. Participation by competent individuals as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. 
Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no competent individual may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
23. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of their personal information and to minimize the impact of the study on their physical, mental and social integrity. 
24. In medical research involving competent human subjects, each potential subject must be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
67
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential  risks 
of the study and the discomfort it may entail, and any other relevant aspects of the study. The 
potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the  study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has 
understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given  informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research  or would pose a threat 
to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the population represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be 
performed with competent persons, and the research  entails only minimal risk and minimal 
burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to  
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be 
respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent  from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is availab le and if the research cannot be delayed, 
the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics 
68
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
committee. Consent to remain in the research should be obtained as soon as possible from the 
subject or a legally authorized  representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the  publication 
of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their 
research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH  
MEDICAL CARE  
31. The physician may combine medical research with medical  care only to the extent that 
the research is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the 
physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
32. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current  proven 
intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the  
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to  
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient- physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating  suffering.

Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate 
its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

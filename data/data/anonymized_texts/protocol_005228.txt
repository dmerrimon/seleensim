• Proportion of patients with treatment- emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to I NTERCEPT  
RBCs by the end of study (i.e., 75±15 days after the last study transfusion) .  
Study Procedures:  
Screening/Recruitment  
In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but do not require RBC transfusion, only 
patie n
ts with a relatively high likelihood to receive a RBC transfusion as determined by the Investigator (e.g., 
patients receiving aspirin , clopidogrel (or analogs) and/or GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a TRUST 
Score of >3 will be eligible for enrollment. Patients  ≥11 years of age undergoing complex cardiac surgery may 
be identified through pre -operative scheduling procedures in advance of their  surgery.  
Patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery are eligible for the study, subject to institutional 
revie
w board (IRB) approval of an appropriate informed consent process.  
All potentially eligible patients will be approached for study consent /assent  within 30 days prior to their 
surgical procedure. Subjects who consent /assent  to the study will be assigned a subject  ID number and undergo 
screening.  
Screening will includ e documentation of the patient’s  pre-surgical exposure to radiographic contrast media and 
number of prior pregnancies (females). Screening data may be derived from the medical record whe n 
performed within 30 days prior to their surgical procedure . Eligibility status and other study data  including all 
TRUST components  will be entered into the clinical database via an electronic data capture (EDC) system  
using electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). Patients who fail eligibility for any or multiple inclusion/exclusion 
criteria may be rescreened for eligibility closer to th e time of surgery . 
Randomization and Blinding  
Eligible subjects will be randomiz ed up to 7 days before  or on the day of scheduled surgery  (Day 0 ). An 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be used for electronic randomization of eligible patients. 
Randomization (in 1:1 ratio for Test:Control) stratified by site , pre-existing renal impairment (baseline sCr 
≥1.2 mg/dL  vs. < 1.2 mg/dL ), and cardiac surgery group (more at risk for renal complication s vs. less  at risk ) 
will be employed . Screened subjects who receive a red cell transfusion prior to randomization will no longer 
be considered for randomization, and their participation in the study will end. Patients may be rescreened for 
eligibility closer to the time of surgery.  
Treatment   
Once a subject is randomized, only study RBCs ( Test or Control , per the subject’s randomization) should be 
dispensed and transfused d uring the acute transfusion support period  (Day 0  to Day 7  post surgery, hospital 
discharge, or death, whichever is first), as clinically indicated and determined by the treating physician.  
In rare exceptions where  study RBCs are unavailable  or patient’s need for RBC transfusions exceeds the 
quantity of study RBCs in inventory at the hospital blood bank (e.g., during a  Massive Transfusion Protocol) , a

transfusion  using  non-study RBC  (conventional)  may be given to provide the patient with an appropriate and 
necessary treatment. In this case, a protocol deviation should be documented.  If a study RBC transfusion is 
given after randomization before surgery commences , a protocol deviation should also be documented.    
Treatment assessments will be divided into an acute transfusion support  period starting the day of surgery 
(Day 0 up to Day 7) during which study RBC (Test or Control) are administered, a post -surgical follow -up 
period of a minimum of 28 days after the last study transfusion to collect additional safety data, a clinical 
assessment at day 30 after surgery specifically for mortality and RRT status, and a visit at day 75 (±15) after 
the last study transfusion to assess mortality and RRT status, and collect samples for serological screening for 
antibodies specific to INTERCEPT  RBC s. 
In all patients , anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed according to the local standards of care.  
Following the acute transfusion support period, subjects may receive conventional RBC components if additional transfusions are needed, as indicated by their tr eating  physician.   
Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow -up 
Baseline  through Acut
 e Transfusion Support  Period (Pre -Op Day -1 up to Post -Op Day 7)  
A screen for antibodies specific for INTERCEPT RBCs should be performed every time that a routine IAT is 
performed during the acute 7- day study transfusion period.  
A blood sample for sCr will be taken at 48 ±4 hours after completion of surgery for both transfused and non -
transfused subjects. , A sCr will be determined on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support period up 
to 7 days post -surgery. Other parameters  including additional sCr  will be collected on eCRFs only when 
available in the medical record.  
Randomized subjects who do not receive an RBC transfusion following randomization within the first 48 
hours after surgery will be discontinued from the study and replaced.  
Daily sCr assessments  will be recorded up to and including  48 ±4 hours  for transfused and non- transfused 
subjects . Other post baseline laboratory parameters and adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for non -
transfused subjects . Vital status  will be reported for randomized and non -transfused subjects  at the time of 
discontinuation. 
Hemodynamic  and laboratory measures will be assessed pre- operatively (Day -1, Baseline ) and daily  as 
available in the medical record  from post -operative Day 1 through Day 7, hospital discharge or death, 
whichever occurs first. If a subject is discharged p rior to Day 7 but returns to the study site for a standard of 
care visit on Day 7, blood sample s should be obtained on that day for a complete blood count and sCr 
determination.   
Hemodynamic parameters that will be collected if available, include heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial 
pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry probe.

Laboratory parameters that will be captured on eCRFs  include BUN, creatinine  , AST , ALT, fibrinogen, 
bilirubin, troponin, hemoglobin, and platelet counts.  
Transfusion reactions  (TRs) , adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be assessed on a 
daily basis and documented in the eCRF  from the start of surgery or the start of the first study transfusion 
(whichever is first) through post -operative Day 7 and as available through day 28 after the last study 
transfusion.   Vital status will be reported for randomized and non- transfused subjects at the time of  
discontinuation.  
NOTE: The following applies to randomized transfused subjects only. 
Post-operative  Day 8  (or Post-discharge, if earlier) through 28 Days After Last Study Transfusion. Subjects 
will be monitored for TRs, AEs and SAEs following the 7- day acute transfusion support period, through 28 
days after the last study transfusion or death, whichever occurs first, according to the local standard of care. In 
an outpatient setting, weekly telephone surveillance calls to the subject will be performed  in order to collect 
safety events until the next follow -up visit . 
28 (±3) Days After Last Study Transfusion  or Pr e mature Discontinuation  from study . 
Subjects who have been discharged should be scheduled for the follow up visit 28 (±3) days after the last study 
transfusion to obtain additional safety information, including patient -reported AEs / SAEs ; laboratory results  
including sCr , DAT/ IAT ; a sample for HLA antibodies and antibodies  specific to INTERCEPT RBC s will be 
obtained. All randomized subjects who receive any study RBC transfusion must have their vital status 
documented at this visit,  or earlier , if the subject dies prior to the visit. If a subject has been discharged, other 
safety information (e.g., AEs and SAEs) may be  obtained through medical records, the subject’s physician, or 
a telephone interview with either the subject or a family member.    
30 Days After  Surge ry 
All randomized subjects who receive a study RBC transfusion must have their vital status and need for R RT 
(defin ed as hemo dialysis or peritoneal dialysis) documented at Day 30 after surgery. RRT that is provided 
prophylactically during surgery while patient is on a bypass machine (the pump), does not meet this endpoint. 
The vital status and RRT assessment o n Day 30 can be performed either from the medical records, from a 
phone call to the subject or family, or during the visit 28± 3 days after the last study transfusion (only if the last 
study transfusion was given at day 2 or later in the acute transfusion support period).  
End of Study: 75 (±15 Day s) After last Study Transfusion  
75 (± 15) days after the last study transfusion (End of Study) , serum samples for antibodies specific for 
INTERCEPT RBCs will be obtained, either in hospital, at a clinic visitor or offsite . Mortality and  the need for 
RRT will be  assessed .

Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The study will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary 
mission of the DSMB is to ensure patient safety  and review protocol compliance for data collec tion. The 
DSMB will be assembled by the Sponsor and composed of transfusion medicine and other experts  as per the 
DSMB charter. DSMB members will be indep endent of the Sponsor.  
Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rule  
Aside from the blinded interim analysis for sample size re-estimation  performed in October 2021, no other 
interim analysis is planned for this study to compare treatment differences with respect to efficacy or safety at 
any time prior to the completion of the study.  Specific stopping rules, defined for safety considerations, are 
defined in Section 4.6 of the protocol.  
Number of patients:  
A total of at least 292 evaluable, randomized and t ransfuse d patients, 146 per arm, are planned to generate 
sufficient efficacy and safety data for the Test and Control components in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients with  a ∆sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL from  pre-surge ry 
baseline to  within 48±4 hours after surgery , a non -inferiority test will be conducted to assess for treatment 
difference (Test  − Control ).  By assuming an event rate of 3 0% in the Control group and no more than 50% 
increase from the Control rate as the non- inferiority margin, a sample size of 292 patients  (146 per arm) will 
provide approximately 80% power to declare non -inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 alpha level, assuming the 
true treatment difference is zero .  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Age ≥ 1 1 years of age  
2. Weight ≥ 40 kg  
3. Scheduled complex cardiac surgery  or thoracic aorta surgery . The procedure may be performed either 
on or off  cardiopulmonary bypass machine (CBP or “pump”). For the purposes of this protocol 
“Repeat procedure” means that the subject had a previous cardiac surgery . Procedures that qualify as 
complex cardiac surgery include  but are not limited to,  the following:  
• Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, first or repeat procedure  
• Multiple Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts, first or repeat procedure  
• Single Valve Repair or Replacement, first or repeat procedure 
• Multiple Valve Repair or Replacement, first or repeat procedure

• Any raised sCr level, occurring after transfusion of a study RBC, of ≥0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 µmol/L) from 
the pre -surgery baseline within 48±4 hours of the end of surgery.  
If any subject meets th is criterion before receiving a study transfusion, that particular event will not be 
included in this analysis .   
Secondary efficacy outcome measures  include : 
• The proportion of patients with a diagnosis of stage I, II or III Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO 2012)  
based on changes in sCr levels  from pre -surgery baseline  and the need for rena l replacement therapy 
(RRT)  post-surgery .  
• Mortality or the need for RRT by 30 days post -surgery. 
Safety:  
The primary safety outcome measures are the:  
• Proportion of patients with any treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) possibly, probably or 
definitely related to study RBC transfusion through 28 days after the last study transfusion; and   
• Proportion of patients with treatment emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to INTERCEPT 
RBCs by end of study ( i.e., 75 ±15 days after the last study transfusion) .  
Additional safety assessments will include:

• Transfusion reactions (as defined by the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network [NH SN] 
Hemovigilance Module protocol) through 28 days after last study transfusion.  
• Treatment -emergent immunization to RBC allo -antigens through 28± 3 days  after the last study 
transfusion.  
• Treatment -emergent immunization to HLA allo -antigens through 28± 3 days after the last study

Statistical methods:  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the treatment difference (Test – Control) and its two -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will be estimated from Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by baseline sCr (sCr ≥1.2 
mg/dL vs. < 1.2 mg/dL) and cardiac surgery group (more at risk for renal complications vs. less at risk) 
performed. The upper bound of the two- sided 95% CI will be compared with the 50% of the observed Control

MH test will be used for assessment of treatment differences for the secondary efficacy endpoints.  As 
a sensitivity analysis, logistic regression will be utilized to estimate the treatment differences after controlling for baseline sCr, cardiac surgery group performed and other covariates to be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  Treatment -emergent AEs (defined as AEs with an onset date/time that is on or after the start 
date/time of the first study transfusion) will be summarized by treatment group, system organ class (SOC), and 
preferred term.  
Subgroup analysis by the randomization stratification variables (clinical site, pre-surgery renal impairment , 
and cardiac surgery group ) and by demographic variables such as age group (≤18, 19 to 65, and  >65 years 
old), sex, and race will be presented for  primary  and secondary efficacy endpoints .  Additional s ubgroup 
analysis may also be presented as suggested by the data.

 GENERAL  
Red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion is a critical supportive therapy for healthcare. 
Patients and physicians assume, when required, blood transfusion will be available 
and safe. However, serious transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) caused by viruses, bacteria and protozoa (Stramer 2009, MacLennan 2006); and fatal transfusion complications such as transfusion- associated graft -versus- host disease 
(TA-GVHD) still pose a threat to transfusion recipients (Kopolovic 2015). 
Currently, prevention of TTI includes pre-donation evaluation and selection of low-risk donors, followed by serologic and/or nucleic acid testing for selected known infectious pathogens.  
The advent of testing has greatly reduced TTI from blood products, particularly 
viral disease, and sepsis associated with the t ransfusion of bacterially contaminated 
red cell blood components is generally regarded as a very rare event. However, from 1976 through September 1998, 26 fatalities thought to be secondary to contaminated whole blood or red cells were reported to the U.S. FDA (Lee 1999). The majority of deaths reported to the FDA involved Yersinia enterocolitica . The highest reported 
incidence of Y. enterocolitica  contamination was reported in New Zealand, with an 
incidence rate of 1 in 65,000 and a fatality rate of 1 in 104,000 red cell units transfused (Theakston et al. 1997). Unrecognized cases, underreporting, and regional variation may account for observed differences in this incidence. Interestingly, passive reporting studies of bacterially contaminated red cells from 
the United States, France, and the United Kingdom that caused symptoms of 
infection show a relative paucity of Y. enterocolitica  cases (Perez et al. 2001, 
Kuehnert et al. 2001, Serious Hazards of Transfusion report for 2000-2001). Of the reported deaths, one was due to a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strain and 
seven were due to a variety of gram-negative organisms (including Serratia 
liquefaciens  in three cases). These organisms are all capable of growth at 
refrigerated temperatures (1 ° to 6°C). Sepsis associated with the transfusion of red 
cells contaminated with gram- negative bacteria is typically severe and rapid in onset 
(Brecher and Hay 2005). Patients frequently develop high fever (temperatures as high as 109°F have been observed) and chills during or immediately following transfusion. From 1987 to February 1996, 20 recipients of Y. enterocolitica  red cells 
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control (Cookson et al, 1996). Twelve of 
the 20 recipients died, and the median time to death was only 25 hours. Of the seven 
who developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, six died.

CLI 00125 , v8.0 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 20 of 295 
Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Prospective bacterial cultures of whole blood or red cells, however, have shown a 
much higher incidence of bacterial contamination (Damgaard et al 2015).  The organisms commonly cultured are Staphylococcus sp. or Propionibacterium sp.; 
those strains that have been reported to be isolated in association with adverse 
events linked to the transfusion of contaminated red cell concentrates include Pseudomonas sp., S. marcescens, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., S. epidermidis and B. cereus (Siblini et al 2004).   
Newly -emerging infectious agents also remain important risks to blood safety. 
Estimates of per -unit and per-patient aggregate infectious risks for conventional 
RBCs, including known and potential emerging infectious agents (EIA, modeled 
based on chikungunya and dengue viruses) were calculated by Kleinman and 
Stassinopoulos (2015).  Minimum and maximum per- unit risks were calculated as 
0.0003% (1/323,000) and 0.12% (1/831), respectively.  The minimum estimate is for known lower- risk pathogens while the maximal estimate also includes an EIA 
and endemic area Babesia sp. risk.  For patients with hemoglobinopathies who receive repeated RBC transfusions such as sickle cell disease ( SCD ), at the 
minimum risk level it is estimated that approximately 1/450 (0.22%) of patients will acquire an infection during their entire course of transfusion therapy (approximately 
30-50 years); at the maximum risk levels, infections risk inc reases to 43 -45% for 
patients with hemoglobinopathies, or almost 1 in every 2 patients (Kleinman and 
Stassinopoulos 2015). 
Leukoreduced RBC concentrates  contain <5 x10
6 white blood cells ( WBC ) that may 
induce TA- GVHD and/or alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) 
antigens. Gamma irradiation can effectively prevent TA -GVHD in transfusion 
recipients. However, almost half the cases of TA -GVHD occur in patients in which 
their treating physicians failed to identify risk using current guidelines for blood 
irradiation, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality (Kopolovic 2015). Moreover, irradiation adversely affects post-transfusion RBC recovery (Dumont 2008) and is associated with raised extracellular potassium levels in the transfused 
concentrates .  
To proactively address the risk of TTIs and TA-GVHD, Cerus has developed 
pathogen and leukocyte inactivation technology systems (INTERCEPT Blood 
System ™) for platelet and plasma components and is currently developing a system 
for RBC concentrates. These systems use nucleic acid -targeted compounds that 
intercalate into, and upon activation, covalently bind to nucleic acids of viruses, 
bacteria, parasites and leukocytes that may contaminate blood components, and 
form irreversible adducts and crosslinks thus preventing replication and TTI. This

damage cells and proteins. RBCs do not require nucleic acid for therapeutic function and thus retain therapeutic efficacy after pathogen i nactivation treatment. 
INTERCEPT treated RBC (INTERCEPT RBCs) components should not require gamma irradiation because the treatment process inactivates donor white blood cells with a high safety margin (Castro et al. 2016).  It is also possible that INTERCE PT 
treatment may interfere with antigen presentation by donor leukocytes, thereby 
reducing the incidence of HLA alloimmunization.  
Conventional leukoreduced RBC concentrates include approximately 20-40 m L of 
residual plasma that contains serum proteins and immunoglobulins ; these  are 
implicated in allergic TRs and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) . 
The INTERCEPT RBC process includes a terminal washing step that reduces the 
concentration of plasma proteins and may reduce the incidence of these reactions.  
The INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs inactivates a variety of bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The organisms evaluated to date include examples representing a range of different characteristics, such as enveloped (HIV and DHBV) and non-enveloped (Bluetongue virus), RNA genome (HIV and BVDV) and DNA genome 
(DHBV), and single stranded (HIV) and double stranded (DHBV) genomes. The 
bacteria evaluated represent Gram negative bacilli (Yersinia sp., Serratia sp., E. coli , 
Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas sp.) and Gram positive cocci ( S. epidermidis  and 
S. aureus ) that are significant especially for RBC transfusion. The protozoan 
parasites evaluated to date are Plasmodium falciparum  and Babesia microti . 
INTERCEPT RBCs have demonstrated adequate viability in terms of in vivo recovery and lifespan for transfusion (Cancelas 2015), and a recently completed Phase 3 clinical study (CLI 00076) in cardiovascular surgery patients conducted in 
Europe has demonstrated that INTERCEPT RBCs possess in vitro characteristics 
comparable to untreated RBCs with a comparable safety profile (Brixner 2015, Rico 2015). 
The proposed phase 3 study in patients undergoing complex cardiac surgery is 
intended to demonstrate that INTERCEPT RBCs are non -inferior to conventional 
RBCs with reg ard to clinical safety and clinical efficacy  for transfusion support of 
acute anemia during surgery with potential he modynamic instability . The study is  
designed to support the licensure of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood 
Cells .

 NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT  
The INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs is an investigational medical device used 
to prepare pathogen and leukocyte inactivated RBC components for transfusion.    
2.2.1 Description of Investigational Product 
The investigational device is the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells.  
The pathogen reduction process begins with a unit of RBCs derived from whole 
blood that is separated according to local regulations and standard operating procedures at the Blood Centers. RBCs are suspended in additive solution-5 ( AS-5). 
Leukocyte-reduction of whole blood or RBCs will be performed per manufacturer’s 
instructions. The INTERCEPT Blood System process is performed on a single unit 
of leukoreduced RBC in AS-5.  
For a detailed description of the investigational product, please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
 SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES  
The INTERCEPT treatment process uses amustaline and glutathione together with a 
processing solution in a single-us e disposable set to produce pathogen inactivated 
RBCs in SAG -M additive solution.  Cerus’ pre -clinical and clinical development 
program has evaluated the efficacy of amustaline for pathogen inactivation and 
safety profiles of treated RBCs and breakdown products with regard to systemic 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in accordance with International Council 
on Harmonization (ICH) standards for RBCs development of pharmaceuticals. 
These data are presented in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.

No physiologically relevant toxicity using INTERCEPT RBCs at doses higher than 
planned for this trial was observed in pre- clinical studies. Additional information 
about the toxicological evaluations of the treatment system is provided in detail in 
the Investigator’ s Brochure .  
2.3.2 Immunogenicity  
The mechanism of act ion of S-303 can also lead to reactions with macromolecules 
other than nucleic acids in the blood components, such as constituents of the red cell 
membrane. In early studies of the pathogen inactivation process for RBCs (referred 
to as “Original process”) there was evidence of antibody formation directed against 
INTERCEPT RBCs (also referred to as S-303- specific  RBC antibodies) in two 
patients participating in a chronic RBC transfusion study.  In order to minimize 
these non-specific and unwanted reactions w ith RBC surface molecules, an 
increased level of the quencher, glutathione (GSH), has been included in the current, pathogen inactivation process (referred to as “ Current process”) .  
Additional information regarding the potential for immunogenicity, and the studies 
that have been conducted is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.3.3 Clinical Studies  
Four clinical studies have been completed  with the current process of the 
INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs.  The studies are summarized in Table 2.1 
below and additional detail is provided in the Investigator ’s Brochure.

 SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL RISKS  
The potential risks of this study include those adverse reactions that are recognized to 
occur following any  transfusion of RBC components and could be anticipated to 
occur with either control or INTERCEPT-treated components including, but not 
limited to, delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs ), acute hemolytic 
transfusion reactions (A HTR s), delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs ), 
febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs ), allergic (urticarial) reactions, 
anaphylaxis, transfusion- related  acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion- associated 
circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion- related sepsis (TRS), or transfer of an 
infectious agent via transfusion/transfusion transmitted infection (TTI), respectively, 
transfusion- associated graft -vs-hos t disease (TA -GVHD), and allo -immunization to 
RBC and HLA antigens.  
The development of antibodies to INTERCEPT RBCs, or to neoantigens formed as a result of acridine binding to red cells, could occur as a result of transfusion with 
INTERCEPT RBCs. Acridine -specific antibodies were observed in an early and 
current ongoing blinded studies  (as described in the Investigator’s Brochure) and 
many  could be neutralized with acridine in solution, thereby defining specificity for 
this mo iety. The occurrence of these antibodies was not associated with any clinical 
events or observations. The Current process  has been optimized to decrease the 
likelihood of this event.  
A screening study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of natural antibodies 
with specificity for INTERCEPT RBCs (SUD 00742). Five plasma samples from 998 
subjects requiring chronic transfusion support for anemia and 12 plasma samples 
from 10,721 hospital subjects demonstrated low titer cross- reactions with 
INTER CEPT RBCs.  The cumulative prevalence of cross -reactive antibodies to 
INTERCEPT RBCs was 0.15%.  Each of the antibodies identified was characterized 
and none were found to be IgG
1 or IgG 3 subclass, the antibody subclasses most 
associated with physiologic hemolytic activity.  The majority demonstrated 
specificity for acridine.   
Several  instances o f treatment emergent antibodies with specificity for INTERCEPT 
RBCs were reported  during the ongoing Phase III clinical investigations. In each 
event, the antibodies were shown to be non- clinically significant without evidence of 
patient harm. These studies remain blinded and it is not known whether the patients 
received Test of Control RBCs.

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Natural antibodies to INTERCEPT RBCs are expected to occur in ongoing clinical 
trials. Risk mitigation is in place to protect patients and further evaluate clinical 
significance. All study subjects are screened before enrollment for INTERCEPT 
RBC-specific antibodies and subjects with natural cross- reactive antibodies are 
excluded. Subjects are regularly screened during the study including at approximately 
75 days after the last study RBC transfusion in all ongoing clinical trials. Subjects with treatment emergent antibodies are withdrawn from receiving study RBC and are 
fully evaluated for evidence of hemolysis. Stopping rules are in place related to the 
occurrence of delayed serological and hemolytic TRs associated with treatment 
emergent antibodies to INTERCEPT RBCs.  
Additional risks associated with Control components, that INTERCEPT treatment is 
designed to reduce, include risk of infectious contamination by viral or protozoan agents, such as HIV, HCV, HBV, malaria, and emerging viruses such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya. 
The risk of bacterial contamination is considered to be negligible with INTERCEPT 
RBC components and, although it has not been measured directly, is expected to be less than the risk of bacterial contamination with conventional RBC components, thus 
providing a potential benefit of receiving INTERCEPT-treated components. 
Finally, human error, clerical error and transfusion of RBC to the wrong patient 
remain risks of red cell transfusion. 
 DESCRIPTION OF AND RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT  
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are an appropriate study population because (i)  
these patients commonly require multiple RBC transfusions for support of acute anemia and might be expected to manifest complications ascribed to exposure to 
allogeneic blood, (ii)  cardiac surgery patients comprise a large group of recipients 
with acute anemia requiring RBC transfusion and  on a national basis account for a 
significant proportion of blood component utilization, and (iii) following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, patients are in a pro-inflammatory state which 
might make them particularly vulnerable to adverse consequences of RBC 
transfusion, especially decreased  tissue and organ oxygenation. While other types of surgical patients receive blood for acute anemia, they are either dif ficult to study in a 
clinical trial setting (e.g. , trauma patients) or they may have high rates of autologous 
blood transfusion use (e.g., orthopedic patients). Cardiac surgery is also one setting 
where a liberal RBC transfusion policy has been documented to increase overall survival, suggesting an important role in ensuring tissue oxygenation (Murphy 2015).

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  The acute nature of the transfusion support in the setting of surgical blood loss with 
many confounding variables unrelated to the properties of RBC components limits the utility of measuring post-transfusion hemoglobin increments, and other direct 
measures of therapeutic benefit  (Weiskopf 1998). In addition, evaluation of RBC 
component therapeutic efficacy is challenging because no single endpoint adequately reflects RBC transfusion efficacy in acute anemia. However, a reasonable approach is 
to assess a single key organ system such as renal as the primary endpoint.  
Accordingly, the primary efficacy measure in the proposed study is renal impairment 
defined by changes in serum creatinine .  
Lassnigg et al.  (Lassnigg 2004, Lassnigg 2008) found that m easuring repeat sCr 
concentrations within 48 hours of c ardiothoracic surgery and determining the ∆ sCr 
from pre -surgery baseline concentrations was  the most effective discrimination 
method to find patients at risk for adverse postoperative outcomes, including 
mortality by Day 30 post-surgery. In independent stu dies at two different European 
institu tions that incorporated all cardiac surgery patients who survived at least 48 
hours post- surgery , they found that ∆ sCr concentrations declined in the majority of 
patients and was associated with the lowest mortality (1.8%). Minimal increases  [0-
0.5 mg/dL were associated with a more than doubled mortality in both centers 
(5%/6%).   Used as a sole criterion, ∆sCr within 48 hours of surgery was more 
sensitive than the RIFLE (Mehta 2007) and AKIN (Bellomo 2004) definitions of 
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) as a correlate of poor outcomes. The most important findings of these studies were that 1) even a small absolute increase in sCr in the post-
cardia c surgery setting confers an adverse prognosis and increases the risk of death; 
2) a window of 48 hours following cardiac surgery was able to classify the risk 
groups; and 3) ease of use and early prediction ability of absolute sCr  changes alone 
challenge the RIFLE and AKIN classifications in these patients.   
Historically acute kidney injury (AKI) is known to complicate recovery from cardiac 
surgery in up to 30% of patients, and places patients at a 5 -fold increased risk of 
death during hospitalization ( O'Neal et al. 2016).  
AKI has been validated as a predictor of adverse outcomes after cardiac su rgery 
based on sCr assessment alone. Many analyses do not incorporate urinary output 
(UO) as a component of the AKI measure, especially in cardiac surgery patients . For 
example:

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  • Hobson et al. (Hobson 2009) describe 2973 cardiac surgery patients between 
1992 and 2002 and define AKI as a ≥50% increase in sCr from pre- surgery 
baseline. Survival was worse among patients with AKI and was proportional to 
its severity, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.23 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.42). 
• Loef et al . (Loef 2005) describe an association of in-hospital and long term 
mortality with post-operative sCr levels only, in 843 cardiac surgery patients in 1991 (hazard ratio of death 1.83;95% confidence interval 1.38 to 3.20). 
• More recently, Zhou et al. (Zhou 2016) confirmed the association of AKI based 
only on sCr criteria, with higher mortality and longer length of stay in 1036 
critically ill ICU patients.  
AKI that requires renal replacement therapy occurs in 2 –5 % of patients following 
cardiac surgery and is associated with 50 % mort ality (O'Neal 2016). For those who 
recover from renal replacement therapy or even mild AKI, progression to chronic kidney disease in the ensuing months and years is more likely than for those who do 
not develop AKI. Renal ischemia, reperfusion, inflammation, hemolysis, oxida tive 
stress, cholesterol emboli, and toxins are known to contribute to the development and progression of AKI. Transfusion with RBC may prevent AKI by ensuring tissue 
oxygenation during and after surgery, but is also hypothesized to exacerbate AKI by 
the release of non -transferrin bound iron, promotion of a pro- inflammatory state, 
impairment of tissue oxygen delivery, and exacerbation of tissue oxidative stress (Karkouti 2012). A comparison of AKI incidence using conventional and 
INTERCEPT- treated RBC in cardiac surgery therefore offers a sensitive predictive 
measure of the equivalence of long -term o utcomes following acute RBC transfusion 
for both benefits and potential harms. 
Lassnigg et al. (Lassnigg 2004, Lassnigg 2008) found an association of small changes 
in serum creatinine ( ∆sCr) in the first 48 hours after surgery with mortality by day 30, 
and an independent association of transfusion with adverse outcomes. I n the ReCePI 
study we will enroll cardiac patients that are likely to require RBC transfusions using 
the Transfusion Risk Understanding Screening Tool ( TRUST ) Score (Alghamdi 
2006) , and these patients are more likely to suffer post-surgery renal impairment than 
patients who are less likely to require transfusion.  
Cerus has completed two studies in cardiac surgery in patient populations similar to 
that proposed in ReCePI, and these data have been submitted to the FDA : RBC3A01, 
“S-303 Treated Red Blood Cell Use in Patients Requiring Acute Transfusion 
Support ,”(Benjamin et al. 2005) (submitted  to the FDA on March 30, 2005 under

The above studies inform the selection of the proportion of patients that are likely to 
meet the criterion of raised ∆sCr within 48 hours post the completion of cardiac 
surgery. A summar y table (Table 2.2) provides the data from our analysis of studies

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Based on these data, Cerus proposed a non-inferiority design in ReCePI to rule out an 
increase of ∆sCr ≥0.3mg/dL more than 50% from the Control rate with approximately 
80% power and one-sided alpha of 2.5%. This is based on a Control rate of ∆ sCr 
≥0.3 mg/dL of 30%.  At least  292 subjects  will be randomized and transfused. 
Randomization (in 1:1 ratio for Test:Control) stratified by site, pre -existing renal 
impairment (stratum with either sCr ≥1.2mg/dL or sCr<1.2 mg/dL at baseline), and 
cardiac surgery risk level (high or low risk stratum group 1 or 2, respectively ) will be 
employed.  
As per Lassnigg et al  (2004 and 2008) patients who die within 48 hours of the end of 
surgery and have received at least one study transfusion will be included in the 
modified intent- to-treat ( mITT ) analysis but excluded from the per protocol analysis. 
Patients who have not received a study transfusion within 48 hours of surgery will be excluded from the analysis and replaced. 
Additional endpoints will include mortality or the need for RRT (defin ed as 
hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) by Day 30 post-surgery; and  AKI as defined by 
modified Ki dney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ( KDIGO ) criteria . Any RRT 
that is provided prophylactically during surgery while patient is on a bypass machine 
does not meet this endpoint. The vital status and RRT assessment on Day 30 after surgery can be performed either from the medical records, from a phone call to t he 
subject or family, or during the visit 28 +/- 3 days after the last study transfusion if 
the window covers 30 days after surgery time point.

 ENDPOINTS  
4.1.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary efficacy  endpoint is the proportion of patients, who have received at 
least one study transfusion with a diagnosis of renal impairment defined as:  
• Any raised sCr level, occurri ng after transfusion of a study RBC, of ≥0.3 mg/dL 
(or 26.5 µmol/L) from the pre- surgery baseline within 48±4  hours of the end of 
surgery . 
If any subject meets this criteri on before receiving a study transfusion, that particular 
event will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis . The treatment 
comparison for the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed by a non- inferiority 
test (Test−Control) with a non- inferiority margin of 50% increase from the Control 
rate and two -sided 0.05 alpha level. Patients who receive a study transfusion but die 
within 48 hours after surgery will be included in the mITT  analysis but excluded from 
the per protocol analysis. 
The primary safety  endpoint s are: 
• Proportion of patients with any treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs) 
possibly, probably or definitely related to study RBC transfusion through 
28 days after the l ast study transfusion; and  
• Proportion of patients with treatment-emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to INTERCEPT RBCs by end of study (i.e., 75±15 days after the last 
study transfusion). 
TEAEs  by definition will comprise all untoward medical events occurring after the 
start of the first study RBC transfusion and during the study (i.e., adverse events, 
serious adverse events, unanticipated adverse device effects, TRs and within 28 days 
post last study RBC transfusion). The primary safety endpoint is focused on possibly, 
probably or definitely related adverse events to the study RBC transfusion, because 
these patients have many adverse events which are unrelated to study RBC 
transfusion.

 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
Potentially eligible subjects will be screened and will be considered for 
randomization.  If a subject is screened and receives a RBC transfusion prior to 
randomization, that subject will no longer be considered for randomization, and their 
participation in the study will end. Patients may be rescreened for eligibility closer to 
the time of surgery. An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be used for 
electronic randomization of eligible patients. Following screening and prior to 
surgery (up to 7 day s before surgery or day of surgery but before start of surgical 
procedure), the subject’s eligibility status will be re-checked and entered  in the eCRF . 
If eligible, the subject will be randomized  with a 1:1 ratio for Test: Control within 
his/her randomization stratum.  Randomization will be stratified by site, pre- existing 
renal impairment (sCr ≥1.2 mg/dL vs. < 1.2 mg/dL), and surgery group based on less  
(# 1-3 below) vs. more (#4 -7 below) risk for renal complications (based on Mehta 
2006 and expert opinion).  
Less Risk  
1. Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Graft, first or repeat procedure 
2. Multiple Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts, first or repeat procedure  
3. Single Valve Repair or Replacement, first or repeat procedure  
More  Risk  
4. Multiple Valve Repair or Replacement, first or repeat procedure  
5. Surgery involving both Coronary Artery Bypas s Graft(s) and Valve 
Repair(s), first or repeat procedure  
6. One or more of the following procedures, with or without Coronary 
Bypass Graft(s):  
• Left ventricular aneurysm repair,  
• Ventricular and/or atrial septal defect repairs,  
• Batista procedure (surgical ventricular remodeling),  
• Surgical ventricular restoration,  
• Congenital cardiac defect repair,  
• Aortic procedures, 
7.  Other complex c ardiac surgery or thoracic aorta surgery procedures not 
listed above

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  Patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery are eligible for the study, 
subject to institutional review board (IRB) approval of an appropriate informed consent process. 
Randomized subjects who do not receive any study RBC transfusions within the first 48 hours 
after completion of surgery  will be discontinued from study and replaced.  Serum Creatinine 
up to and including 48 ±4 hours post- surgery will be collected.  
Other post baseline laboratory parameters and  Adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for 
non-transfused  subjects. Vital status will be reported for randomized and non-transfused 
subjects  at the time of discontinuation .  
Only appropriate blood bank staff and unblinded delegates who monitor the production of the RBC components will be able to access the treatment  arm assignment.  Selected Blood Center 
staff will not be blinded due to their role required for collection, preparation, and releasing of 
Test and Control RBC components for transfusion to study subjects. An unblinded study 
monitor will review and verify source data collected at the blood banks. Operating room staff, 
surgical staff, ICU staff and others caring for participating patients, as well as the sponsor (and delegates) will be blinded to treatment assignment.  Study RBC components will be labeled in 
a manner to maint ain the blind. In order to protect the blind, on the day of planned transfusion, 
the final product (test and control) will be transferred  by the Blood Bank unblinded personnel 
into a commercially available  RBC storage container (Fenwal ™ Transfer Pack ™ Cont ainer – 
600mL, product code 4R2023) using a sterile docking technique.  Blood transferred into an 
ancillary container should be stored at 1
oC to 6oC and transfused within 7 days of transfer.    
 TREATMENT 
Eligible subjects will be c onsented/provide assent  and randomized to receive either 
INTERCEPT RBCs (Test) or conventional RBCs (Control) which will be transfused 
as needed  starting  from surgery at Day 0 until study post- operative Day 7, hospital 
discharge or death, whichever is first.  
Treatment assessments will be divided into an acute transfusion support period 
starting on the day of surgery (Day 0) until post- operative Day 7, hospital discharge, 
or death, whichever is first, and a post-surgical follow-up visit (28± 3 days) after the 
last study transfusion to collect additional safety data. A sample for sCr determination 
will be taken at 48 ±4 hours after the end of surgery to document the primary efficacy 
endpoint.  For non-transfused subjects, a blood sample for sCr will be drawn  at 48 ± 4 
hours post- surgery .  Patient status with regard to mortality and RRT on Day 30 post 
surgery will be documented. Anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed 
according to the local standards of the institution.

4.4.1 Test Product  
The INTERCEPT treatment will be performed on leukoreduced RBC components prepared from citrate phosphate dextrose ( CPD ) anticoagulated  whole blood and  
suspended in AS -5 additive solution (input) within 24 hours of collection.  The test 
component is allogeneic INTERCEPT treated RBC components prepared following 
the Instructions for Use for the INTECEPT Blood System for RBCs (SPC-EN 00581-AW) and stored in SAG- M at 1°C to 6°C for up to 35 days post-donation and 
administered intravenously.  Test RBC components will be released to clinical inventory after review of the batch production record associated with the INTERCEPT treatment process.   
4.4.2 Control (reference) Product  
The Control transfusion component is CPD or citrate phosphate double d extrose 
(CP2D) anticoagulated whole blood derived conventional leukoreduced RBC 
components suspended in an FDA approved additive solution (e.g., AS -1, AS-3 or 
AS-5) and  stored at 1°C to 6°C for up to 35 days post-donation and administered 
intravenously. The Control RBC components will be handled and labeled in a manner 
to maintain blinding. Control RBC components will be released to clinical inventory 
after review of the batch production record associated with the trial. 
 SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION  
The following groups of subjects will not be eligible for study enrollment or will be 
discontinued from the study and may be replaced.   
• Screened subjects who receive an RBC trans fusion before undergoing 
randomization will not be eligible for study enrollment. 
• Screened subjects who are not randomized before their surgery begins will not 
be eligible for enrollment. 
• Randomized subjects who do not undergo surgery within 7 days of 
randomization, will be discontinued 7 days after randomization. Patients may be 
re-screened for eligibility and randomization closer to the time of surgery.

• Enrollment Pause and Stopping Rules  
4.5.1 Definitions  
4.5.1.1 Enrollment Pause  
“Enro llment Pause” means that new patients will not be consented  or provide assent 
for the study and subjects  already screened will not be randomized .  Subjects  already 
randomized  and receiving study RBC transfusions will continue to receive study 
transfusions with IAT crossmatch with each RBC component and a new screen for antibodies specific to INTERCEPT RBC s every third day to optimize protection of 
enrolled recipients. The FDA will be notified of all DSTRs  specific to INTERCEPT 
RBCs.  
4.5.1.2 Clinical Stop  
“Clinical Stop” means complete cessation of recruitment activities and all study transfusions, thus stopping the active study transfusion phase of the study. Study 
participants will co ntinue receiving non-study conventional transfusions as needed. 
All safety monitoring tasks will continue as per protocol. 
4.5.1.3 Rules  
The s tudy may be temporarily paused or definitively stopped based on, but not limited 
to, the following rules/considerations: 
• Poor/slow accrual: The goal is to recruit at least 292 patients in the study. The 
study may be stopped by the Sponsor if enrollment rates are not deemed 
acceptable or financially sustainable. 
• Safety  
• The DSMB will review safety  data and make recommendations as per the 
current version of the DSMB Charter including interpretation of the stopping rules.

specific to INTERCEPT RBCs that causes accelerated RBC clearance, as 
evidence of an acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction ( AHTR  or 
DHTR ). The study will be stopped if one subject  who has been exposed to 
INTERCEPT RBC  demonstrate s a confirmed antibody with specificity to 
INTERCEPT RBCs and experiences a clini cally significant HTR with overt 
intravascular or extravascular hemolysis as assessed by the Investigator and 
reviewed by the DSMB.   
Stopping rules due to the occurrence of INTERCEPT RBC- specific DSTRs, DHTRs, 
AHTRs or hyperhemolysis syndrome are followed after discussion with Sponsor in 
the event of a positive antibody specific for INTERCEPT RBCs .

 ACCOUNTABILITY OF STUDY PRODUCT  
The Investigational Product includes both the INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs, 
a medical device used to prepare pathogen inactivated RBC components for 
transfusion, and the investigational biological product, INTERCEPT RBCs in 
SAG- M. 
The investigational device accountability will be verified by the unblinded study 
monitors throughout the duration of study. They will assure that the device 
components are under control at all times inclusive of shipment, storage, usage, and disposition. 
The investigational biologic product will be produced by each Blood Center 
according to the Study RBC Processing Procedures and accountability will be tracked using the Blood Center’s electronic data managem ent system.  
Both Test and Control RBC components are for the sole use of study participants. They may not be crossed back into general inventory at a blood center or clinical site. The disposition of all components prepared for the study (transfused, discarded or expired) will be recorded.  The investigational biologic product accountability will be 
verified by the unblinded study monitors throughout the duration of study. 
 SOURCE DATA 
The subjects’ medical records are the source data; the study data will be recorded in 
an EDC system  using eCRFs. Data worksheets used during the preparation of study 
RBC components are considered the source data for processing study RBC 
components.

transfusions, the subject should continue on study receiving only non-s tudy RBC 
transfusions if needed and should complete all safety assessments, including the study 
75 ±15 days post last transfusion follow-up visit.  REF 01606 (S-303 Reactive 
Samples: Management of Patients and Samples)  should be followed immediately 
after the INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies are identified. A specific data entry 
guidance is provided in CRF Completion Guidelines (CCGs) for the INTERCEPT RBC- specific antibody reactive test results.  
5.3.2 Early termination from Study  
Upon early termination from st udy the tests required of the termination visit will be 
performed.  If the subject is terminated from study (for any reason) before transfusion 
of any study RBC product, the subject will be replaced and no further follow up is required . For non-transfused subjects, a blood sample for sCr will be drawn at 48 ± 4 
hours.  Daily sCr assessments will be recorded up to and including 48 ±4 hours post surgery. Other post baseline laboratory parameters and  Adverse events (AEs) will not 
be collected for no n-transfused subjects.  Vital status will be recorded at the time of 
discontinuation. If the subject has received any study RBC product and it is possible, 
a physical examination, including general neurological examination, should be 
performed, concomitant medications and adverse events should be recorded, standard 
laboratory tests should be collected, and other blood samples should be obtained on 
day 28 ±3 and day 75 ±15 as described in the protocol. 
If consent /assent  for further follow -up is withdrawn, the subject should, a t minimum, 
be asked to provide a blood sample at the time of withdrawal for sCr, DAT, IAT and 
INTERCEPT RBC- specific antibody screen.

 TREATMENT PLAN  
6.1.1 Screening/ Randomization (Day -30 to Day 0 Pre -Surgery ) 
Patients will be identified through pre-operative scheduling procedures in advance of 
their complex cardiac surgery . Patients already hospitalized may be included. 
Patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery are eligible for the study, 
subject t o institutional review board (IRB) approval of an appropriate informed 
consent process. 
In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but do not require 
RBC transfusion, only patients with a relatively high likelihood to receive a 
transfusion as determined by the Investigator (e.g., patients currently on regimen of 
aspirin, clopidogrel (or analogs) and/or GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a 
TRUST score of ≥3 will be eligible for enrollment. A TRUST score of ≥3 
corre sponds to a high likelihood of requiring red cell transfusion within 96 hours of 
surgery .  Study consent /assent  will be sought in these eligible subjects within 30 days 
of their surgical procedure. Subjects who consent /assent  to the study will be assigned 
a subject  identification ( ID) number and undergo screening.  
The complete list of s creening assessments are outlined in T able 7.1a. Data may be 
derived from the medical record where performed within 30 days prior to their surgical procedure.  Blood samples for determination of HLA antibodies will also be 
collected at the screening visit and sent for testing at a specialty central laboratory.  In 
certain situations , it is possible for a mobile medical professional, authorized by the 
sponsor and requested by site personnel, to conduct a home health service visit at a 
subject’s home to collect  screening assessments . Patients who fail eligibility for any 
or multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria may be rescreened for eligibility clo ser to the 
time of surgery. 
All available components of the TRUST score (age, sex , Hb, weight, type of surgery, 
serum creatinine, surgical history and surgical task) will be collected on the case 
report form.  The TRUST score (or the minimum and maximum possible TRUST scores, if there are any missing components) will be calculated according to the published algorithm ( APPENDIX  1). 
Eligible subjects will be randomized up to 7 days before  or on the day of surgery, but prior to 
the start of surgery  (i.e., induction of anesthesia ). The adverse event collection period will 
begin at the beginning of surgery or the first study RBC transfusion, whiche ver is first .

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  For non-transfused subjects, a blood sample for sCr will be drawn at 48 ± 4 hours.  Daily sCr 
assessments will be recorded up  to and including 48 ±4 hours post surgery. Other post 
baseline laboratory parameters and Adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for non-
transfused subjects.  Vital status will be recorded at the time of discontinuation.   
The complete list of baseline assessments to be performed pre-operatively on the day before 
or on the day of surgery before surgery commences are outlined in T able 7.1b. 
6.1.2 Acute Transfusion Support Period ( Surgery [Day 0] to Post- operative 
Day 7, Hospital D ischarge or Death, Whichever is First) 
The complete list of assessments to be performed during the acute transfusion support period are outlined in T able 7.1c.  
During the acute transfusion support period (Day 0 to Day 7), hospital discharge or death, whichever is first, pati ents will be transfused with Test or Control RBCs . 
Induction and end of anesthesia are considered start and stop time of surgery. All 
transfusions administered through Day 7 will be of the assigned treatment arm as 
often as feasible without compromising pa tient care.   
A screen for antibodies specific for INTERCEPT RBCs should be performed every 
time that a routine IAT is performed during the acute 7-day study transfusion period. 
A blood sample for sCr will be taken at 48 (±4 hours) after completion of surgery, 
and sCr will be determined on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support 
period up to 7 days post-surgery. Other  parameters will be collected on eCRFs only 
when available in the medical record.  
Randomized subjects who do not receive an RBC transfusion following randomization within 
the first 48 hours after surgery will be discontinued from the study and replaced.  
For non-transfused subjects, a blood sample for sCr will be drawn at 48 ± 4 hours.  
Daily sCr assessments wi ll be recorded up to and including 48 ±4 hours post surgery. 
Other post baseline laboratory parameters and adverse events  (AEs)Es) will not be 
collected for non -transfused subjects. Vital status will be recorded at the time of 
discontinuation.  
Once a subj ect is randomized, i n rare exceptions where study RBCs are unavailable 
or a subject’s  need for RBC transfusions exceeds the quantities of the prepared study 
RBCs (e.g. , during a Massive Transfusion Protocol), non-study RBC (conventional) 
transfusion may be given to provide the subject  with an appropriate and necessary 
treatment. Non-study RBC transfusion data is captured in the eCRF. In this case, a 
protocol deviation should be noted. Transfusions will be administered according to

patient care needs.  Anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed according to 
the local standards of the institution.   
Hemodynamic and laboratory results  will be recorded  daily from post-sur gery 
through post-operative Day 7 , hospital discharge or death, whichever occurs first. If 
an assessment is performed more than once in a day, the first set of results should be 
entered into the eCRF.  
If a subject is discharged prior to the end of the acute transfusion support period (Day 
7) but for any reason returns to the study site (e .g., re -hospitalization or standard care) 
within this acute transfusion support period,  lab values routinely collected as 
standard of care should be recorded in the eCRF.  
If multiple assessments (hemodynamic parameters, vital signs, laboratory parameters) 
are taken in a calendar day, the reported value for first collection of the day should be 
recorded in the eCRF with the exception of s erum creatinine  .  Serum creatinine will 
be collected and recorded in the eCRF on a daily basis during the 7 day acute 
transfusion support period. If serum c reatinine  is measured  multiple times in a day, 
the worst daily value should be recorded in the eCRF.   In addition, a sample to 
measure sCr will be taken at 48±4 hours after the end of surgery and captured  on a 
specific CRF page for that time -point. 
For non-transfused subjects, a blood sample for sCr will be drawn  at 48 ± 4 hours 
hours post- surgery . Serum Creatinine up to and including 48 ±4 hours post-surgery 
will be collected.  
Urine output (mL/kg/hour) will be recorded in the eCRF daily  while a urinary 
catheter is in place.   
Other assessments during this trial period include details related to the specific 
surgical procedure (type of procedure, start and end times, RBC components transfused, all other blood components transfused, estimated blood loss from the surgical procedure, concomitant medications, intraoperative cell recovery and 
reinfusion, hemodilution, and nadir temperature). Additionally, daily estimated blood 
loss from chest tube(s) and from other sources, and day of chest tube removal will be recorded.  See Table 7.1c for a detailed list of study assessments.  
AEs and SAEs , including TRs  and protocol- specified AEs (see Section 7.3),  will be 
assessed  from the start of surgery or the start of the first study RBC transfusion 
(whichever is first) on a daily  basis  and documented in the eCRF through 
post- operative Day 7 . Adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for non -transfused

Table 7.1c for a detailed list of study assessments. 
NOTE: The following post-operative assessments apply to randomized transfused 
subjects only. 
6.1.3 Post-operative Period  (Day 8 [or Post-d ischarge, if earlier] through Day 
28 After Last Study Transfusion) 
The complete list of assessments to be performed during this  post-operative period 
are outlined in T able 7.1d. 
Laboratory results recorded in the eCRFs during this period will only be those 
assessed as clinically significant per the Investigator. Following the post-surgery 7-
day acute transfusion support period, the post-operative period starts on Day 8 after surgery and goes through the Day 28±3 visit. S ubjects will receive conventional non-
study RBC components if additional transfusions are needed, as indicated by their treating physician. 
Weekly telephone surveillance calls to the subject will be performed to collect AEs , 
SAEs  and TRs . If a surveillance call falls on the same week as the Day 28±3 follow-
up visit, the follow- up visit assessments will take precedent and a surveillance call is 
not required. 
6.1.4 Day 28± 3 After Last Study Transfusion or Early Termination 
The complete list of assessments to be performed during the Day 28±3 or Early 
Termination  visit are outlined in T able 7.1e.  
Subjects should be scheduled for a follow-up visit 28±3 days after the last study 
transfusion to obtain additional safety information, including subject -reported AEs, 
SAEs,  and laboratory results .  This visit may occur either in hospital, clinic visit, or 
offsite . In certain situations , it is possible for a mobile medical professional, 
authorized by the Sponsor and requested by site personnel, to conduct a home health service visit at a subject’s home to collect these assessments. Blood samples for 
determination of HLA antibodies will also be collected at the visit and sent for testing at a specialty central laboratory.  TRs, AEs and SAEs will be documented for 28 days 
after the last study  transfusion, or earlier if the subject dies prior to Day 28 post last 
study RBC transfusion. If a subject has been discharged prior to Day 28 post last study RBC transfusion, the vital status, need for RRT and other safety information (e.g., AEs and SAEs) may be obtained through medical records, the subject’s physician, or a telephone intervi ew with either the subject or a family member.

The complete list of assessments to be performed at Day 30 are outlined in T able 
7.1e.  
All randomized subjects who receive a study RBC transfusion must have their vital 
status and need for RRT (defin ed as hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) documented  
at Day 30 after surgery . RRT that is provided prophylactically during surgery while 
patient is on a bypass machine (the pump) does not meet this endpoint. The vital 
status and RRT assessment on Day 30 post surgery can be obtained  either from the 
medical reco rds, from a phone call to the subject or family, or during the visit 28±3 
days after the last study transfusion (only if the last study transfusion was given at 
day 2 or later in the acute transfusion support period).  
6.1.6 End of Study (75  ±15 Days After Last Study Transfusion) 
The complete list of assessments to be performed at the  75 ±15 day study visit are 
outlined in T able 7.1e.   
Subjects should be scheduled for a second  follow up visit on Day 75±15 days after 
the last study transfusion for vital stat us, need for RRT,  and for assessment of 
INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies at end of study, either in hospital, clinic visit 
or off- site. In certain situations, it is possible for a mobile medical professional, 
authorized by the Sponsor and requested by site personnel, to conduct a home health 
service visit at a subject’s home to collect these assessments.  If the assessment of 
INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies is positive, the positive S-303 specific DSTR 
should be entered on the Adverse Event eCRF.

 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
7.2.1 Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of renal 
impairment defined as an y increase in sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL ( or 26.5 µmol/L) from the pre -
surgery baseline within 48±4  hours after the completion of surgery .  If any subject 
meets this criteri on before receivin g a study transfusion, that particular event will not be 
included in this analysis. 
Treatment difference (Test −Control) will be compared between the subjects who were 
randomized to receive INTERCEPT RBC s vs. those randomized to receive 
conventional RBCs  with a non- inferiority margin of 50% increase from the Control rate 
and two-sided 0.05 alpha level.    
Secondary efficacy parameters that will be assessed include: 
• The proportion of patients with a diagnosis of stage I, II or  III Acute Kidney Injury 
(KDIGO 2012) based on changes in sCr levels from baseline and the need for 
renal replacement therapy (RRT ) post- surgery .  
• Mortal ity or the need for RRT by Day 30 post-surgery. 
7.2.2 Methods and Timing of Efficacy Parameters   
Hemodynamic and laboratory measures will be assessed pre -operatively (Day -1 or pre-
operatively on the day of surgery) and daily from post-operative Day 1 through post-operative Day 7, hospital discharge or death, whichever occurs first. Serum creatinine  
will be determined on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support period and , in 
order to capture the primary efficacy endpoint, a sample for sCr will be taken also at 
48±4  hours after the end of surgery.  
The rest of the efficacy parameters will be collected only as available in the medical 
record  (refer to Study Schedule of Assessments; Section 7 .1).  
An end of acute transfusion period a blood sample will be collected  at Day 7, hospital 
discharge, or death, whichever occurs first. If a subject is discharged prior to Day 7 but returns to the study site for a standard of care visit on Day 7, blood samples should be obtained on that day for a complete blood count and sCr determination.

 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.3.1 Safety Parameters   
The primary safety outcome measures are the:  
• Proportion of patients with any treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
possibly, probably or definitely related to study RBC transfusion through 28 days 
after the last study transfusion.  
• Proportion of patients with treatment emergent antibodies with confirmed  
specificity to INTERCEPT RBCs ).  
Additional safety assessments will inclu de, but are not limited to: 
• Treatment -emergent AEs through 28 days after the last study transfusion. 
• Treatment -emergent SAEs through 28 days after the last study transfusion. 
• Transfusion reactions (as defined by the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network [NHSN] Hemovigilance Module protocol) through 28 days after last study transfusion. 
• Treatment -emergent immunization to RBC allo -antigens through 28±3 days after 
the last study transfusion.  
• Treatment -emergent immunization to HLA allo -antigens through 28±3 days after 
the last study transfusion. 
7.3.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH E2A II/A/1,  21 CFR  312.32).

Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  7.3.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious A E (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening event (results in an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical events th at may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in this definition.  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, life-threatening or death according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria). Severity and seriousness need to be assessed for each 
adverse event recorded on the eCRF.  
SAE  must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours) after learning of the event. 
7.3.1.3 Unexpected Adverse Event  
Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with (a)  the applicable product 
information (protocol, informed consent /assent , Investigator’s Brochure or other 
product labeling), or (b) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder or condition of the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
7.3.1.4 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or possibly, probably or definitely related to  a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or

7.3.1.5 Definition  of Renal Impairment  
For the purposes of this study, renal impairment is defined as an increase in sCr ≥ 0.3 
mg/dL from the pre- surgical baseline concentration . 
7.3.1.6 Definition of Acute Kidney In jury (AKI)  
For the purposes of this study, a definition of an acute kidney injury during the study is based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI workgroup 
definition ( KDIGO 2012 ) criteria as : 
• An increase  sCr ≥50% of the pre -surgery baseline level within 7 days post-
surgery, OR  
• An increase in sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µ mol/L) from pre-surgery baseline within 48 
hours of surgery. 
For the purposes of this study, acute kidney injury s tages are defined as follows  
(KDIGO AKI workgroup) :  
Stage 1   Serum creatinine:  1.5–1.9 times baseline within 7 days after surgery  
OR 
≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 µmol/L ) increase within 48 hours of surgery 
 
Stage 2  Serum creatinine:  2.0–2.9 times baseline within 7 days after surgery 
 Stage 3  Serum creatinine:  3.0 times baseline within 7 days after surgery 
OR 
Increase in serum creatinine to ≥4.0 mg/dl (≥353.6 µmol/L ) 
OR 
Initiation of renal replacement therapy  
 
If a renal event during the study fulfills KDIGO laboratory criteria as specified above, 
this may constitute an AE/SAE of AKI as per Investigator’s clinical judgement.

For the purposes of this study RRT is defined as the institution of hemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis to treat acute or  chronic renal failure associated with a decrease in 
glomerular filtration rate  with or without fluid overload, severe acidosis, hyperkalemia 
or other electrolyte abnormalities . Dialysis performed solely to treat toxin/poisonings or 
performed preventativel y during surgery while on a bypass machine, will not be 
considered RRT in the terms of meeting a secondary endpoint. 
7.3.1.8 Treatment -emergent HLA antibodies  
For the purposes of this study, HLA Class I and II antibody testing will be performed in 
a central laboratory according to the method described by Triulzi et al. (Triulzi 2009). 
Screening tests for anti -HLA Class I and II will be performed with multi-antigen bead 
kits (LabScreen LSM12, LabScreen Mixed, One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data will be using two different normalized 
background ( NBG) ratio cut -offs.  The data will be analyzed using the manufacturer’s 
recommended cutoff of a NBG ratio of 2.2.  The data will also be analyzed  using NBG 
ratios of the mean plus three or five standard deviations of a log transformed distribution of values for plasma samples for non- transfused males, as described (Triulzi 
2009).  
7.3.1.9 Definition of Culture Proven Sepsis/ Septic Shock 
For the purposes of this study, transfusion related sepsis/septic shock is defined as a 
positive culture from blood and/or CSF and a study RBC product with matching 
bacterial strains, with at least 3 of the following signs of septic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS) (Levy  2003):  
• Temperature < 36°C or > 38°C 
• Heart rate > 90  bpm 
• Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or PaCO
2 < 32 mmHg 
• White blood cell count > 12,000 or < 4,000 cells /mm3 or >  10% bands 
7.3.1.10 Definition of Transfusion Reaction  
A transfusion reaction  is defined as an undesirable response or effect in a patient 
temporally associated with and possibly, probably or definitely related to the 
administration of blood or blood components. The current version of the CDC  NHSN 
Hemovigilance Protocol definitions must be used  when  recording transfusion reaction

 Clinically Significant Antibodies (Chapman et al. 2004) 
Clinically significant antibodies are those that are capable of causing patient morbidity 
due to accelerated destruction of a significant proportion of transfused red cells. 
  Delayed Serological Transfusion Reaction (DSTR) (Ness et al. 1990; 
Garratty 2012)  
The DSTRs  are where a particular alloantibody can be shown to be present in the 
patient’s  plasma, on the transfused donor RBCs and/or in an eluate from these RBCs, 
but no clinical or laboratory signs of hemolytic anemia (HA) are present. Regardless of 
the mechanism, the persistence of a positive DAT does not correlate with the presence 
or absence of clinical hemolysis (Ness 1990). 
The DSTR may be in the form of new antibodies or a rising titer of antibodies in 
patients with pre -existing antibodies (patients with pre -existing antibodies specific to 
INTERCEPT RBCs at baseline evaluation will be excluded in ReCePI ). DSTR will be 
categorized as described in the NHSN Hemovigilance Protocol v 2.5.2 ( APPENDIX  3). 
  Delayed Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (DHTR) (Ness  et al. 1990)  
A DHTR is defined as a DSTR that showed clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hemolysis. Table 7.3 shows some differential diagnoses of hemolytic transfusion 
reactions.  DHTR will be categorized as described in the CDC NHSN Hemovigilance 
Protocol v 2.5.2 ( APPENDIX  3). 
  Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR) (Ness  1990)  
An AHTR is defined as the rapid destruction of RBCs during, immediately after, or within 24 hours of cessation of transfusion. Clinical and laboratory signs of hemolysis 
are present AHTR will be categorized as described in the CDC NHSN Hemovigilance 
Protocol v 2.5.2 ( APPENDIX  3).  
 Hyper- hemolysis Syndrome  
Hyperhemolysis is characterized by a hemolytic transfusion reaction that leads to a life -
threatening anemia, with drops in Hb and Hct to levels markedly lower than those 
present before transfusion.

Transfusion with Study RBC Components  
 Assessment of Immune Reactivity to INTERCEPT RBCs  
At the time of RBC c rossmatch and at sp ecified times during the study [ screenin g 
(Table 7.1a) during the acute transfusion support period ( Table 7.1c ) and at Day 28 
(±3 days) and day 75 (± 15 days) ( Table 7.1e ) post first study transfusion; ], patient 
plasma/serum samples are tested for the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT 
RBCs. The RBC screening panel uses a gel card agglutination format and has been 
validated at the Blood Center of Wisconsin for this purpose. The primary RBC 
screen ing panel is composed of reagent RBCs from 3 blood group O donors and is 
analogous to routine screening panels used in regular blood banking practice. The 
secondary RBC screening panel is composed of reagent RBCs from 6 different blood 
group O donors and is analogous to secondary panels used in routine practice to identify antibody specificity for a range of common RBC allo-antigens and is used if reactivity is detected in the primary screening assay. The panel donors were specifically antigen -
phenotyped for major blood group systems similar to the commercially available 
reagent cells panels for antibody identification and differentiation. The primary and 
secondary RBC screening panel cells have been prepared as both INTERCEPT -treated 
and untreated RBCs. Each panel has three sets of RBCs made from the identical group O donors: untreated RBC; treated RBCs consisting of cells carrying a “high” level of S-
303 (amustaline) adducts (comparable to the INTERCEPT RBC s prepared with the 
“Original  process” and cells carrying a “low” level of S-303 ( amustaline) adducts 
(representative of  INTERCEPT RBCs prepared with the “C urrent  process ”. The 
primary screening panel is designed as a sensitive screening test for both common RBC alloantibodies and for INTERCEPT RBC -specific  antibodies. The secondary panel is 
designed to determine the specificity of any antibodies detected in the primary scr een 
and to distinguish common RBC alloantibodies from INTERCEPT RBC- specific 
antibodies. 
By including cells with both low and high acridine adducts there is an increased 
sensitivity for antibody against acridine adducts and, much in the same way that homozygous donors are used to produce commercially prepared red cells, there is a 
greater potential for detecting low affinity or low titer (weak) antibodies. Thus, the 
panels have the capability to detect an antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBCs even in 
the presence of alloreacti vity from an intrinsic antigen.

CLI 00125, v8.0 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 73 of 295 
Cerus Corporation considers this document to be confidential and  
not subject to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  The patient samples are tested against the screening panel(s) of reagent RBCs to 
identify an antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBC s. The gel card agglutination test 
results are scored (0, weak positive, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) and the reactivity is classified as follows:  
• If the antibody screening score is 0 for all the untreated and INTERCEPT RBCs 
on the primary RBC screening panel, the sample is considered “non- reactive” with 
no antibodies (neither an intrinsic alloantibody or INTERCEPT RBC- specific 
antibody) present in the patient’s serum and thus no requirement for antibody identification with the secondary antibody identification panel. Neither the secondary RBC screening panel nor additional tests are required. The patient 
continues to receive study RBC components according to the protocol. In addition, 
each unit of study RBC is crossmatched to the patient’s plasma using an antiglobulin (AHG) gel card test, providing a further level of protection to detect 
incompatibility, including that caused by INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies. 
• If the results of the primary RBC screening panel show concordant 3/3, 2/3, or 1/3 reactive with BOTH the INTERCEPT treated reagent RBCs and the corresponding Control untreated RBCs, the sample will be considered “presumed allo- reactive” 
antibody to an intrinsic red cell antigen. The sample is tested against the secondary 
RBC screening panel to identify and confirm the specificity of the allo -antibody 
producing the reaction according to standard blood banking rules (reactivity with 
three RBC cells bearing the RBC antigen, and non- reactivity with three RBC that 
lack the antigen). If the antibody that is causing the agglutination is identified and 
confirmed, then the sample is considered “allo- reactive” for that RBC alloantigen. 
In this setting, lack of reactivity with all (at least three) INTERCEPT treated RBC 
cells that lack the RBC alloantigen, will rule out INTERCEPT RBC  antibody 
specificity. The patient continues on study and will receive compatible (cross 
matched) study RBC components.  
• If INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies cannot be ruled out, or agglutination is 
visible for all the untreated RBC cells in the panel, (i. e., “pan -reactive”), the 
patient will be discontinued from the study transfusions and followed up at 
planned visits for safety until study completion.  
• If the primary RBC screening panel score is positive with 2/3 or 3/3 of the 
INTERCEPT RBCs carrying S-303 (amustaline)  adducts at either ‘high” and/or 
“low” level AND 0/3 with the corresponding Control untreated RBCs which lack 
S-303 adducts, the sample is classified as “reactive for -INTERCEPT RBC -
specific antibodies” and the sample will be sent to the cent ral testing lab for further 
characterization  of specificity .

performance of the test and manual interpretation of the results (Aubuchon 2008). The 
provisos below are put in place to ensure that patients are not inappropriately withdrawn from the study and are in keeping with the current blood bank policies that repeat 
reactive results with a minimum of two tests are required for a positive test in 
serological viral marker assays.   
• Should only 1/3 INTERCEPT RBC cells  in the primary panel test reactive for the 
S-303 labeled cells without reactivity for the untreated RBCs, that INTERCEPT 
RBC cell (at both high and low levels of surface bound acridine) and its untreated control will b e considered “ initially reactive ” and the test will be repeated in 
duplicate on that cell only  (of the three cells in the primary panel), and the 
secondary panel will also be tested . In this setting the secondary panel serves to 
increase the sensitivity fo r INTERCEPT RBC - specific antibodies by testing a 
larger number of INTERCEPT RBC cells. Negative reactivity to both repeat tests 
of the primary panel cell and negativity with the secondary panel will be 
considered a negative test. Reactivity in at least one of two repeat primary panel 
cells INTERCEPT RBC cells or any INTERCEPT RBC cell in the secondary 
panel without reactivity with the corresponding untreated RBC will be a considered positive test for INTERCEPT RBC  reactivity. The sample will be sent 
for ad ditional characterization at the Central immunohematology reference 
laboratory to include inhibition studies to determine specificity of observed reactivity. (see APPENDIX 2 for a Characterization plan for potential antibody to 
INTERCEPT RBCs - Addendum to the CLI 00125 Protocol).  
The above-mentioned Central Laboratory protocol will ensure that the minimum criteria 
for discontinuation of a patient  from study transfusions requires reactivity with at least 
two INTERCEPT RBC cells in the panel with  no reactivity with the corresponding 
untreated control, or repeat reactivity with a single INTERCEPT RBC cell with an 
unreactive determination with its untreated control.  
The patient will be followed up until completion of all study visits, and, if transfused with study RBCs, and evidence for clinical hemolysis will be investigated. A procedure, 
for patient and laboratory sample management for studies involving INTERCEPT 
Blood System for RBCs when a reactive S-303 result is obtained (S- 303 Reactive 
Samples: Management of Patients and Samples ; REF 01606), will be followed. 
To discriminate whether an antibody with specificity for INTERCEPT RBCs is physiologically active or clinically significant, any one of the following criteria indicative of accelerated RBC  clearance in the absence of active bleeding, organ -
mediated RBC sequestration, severe erythroid hypoplasia or other concurrent medical

Plasma/serum samples for patients with confirmed antibodies specific to INTERCEPT 
RBCs (i.e., a DSTR, DHTR or any ATR) will be assessed for hemolytic potential according to a defined Central Laboratory protocol, provided to the sites and filed in the 
Investigator Site File (see APPENDIX  2) to define physiologic significance. For the 
purposes of this protocol, the development of a new antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBCs in the patient and with evidence of accelerated RBC clearance, in the absence of clinical alternative explanations (e.g., concomitant RBC alloantibodies, sickle cell 
disease, etc.) will be classified as a hemolytic transfusion reaction. All INTERCEPT 
RBC- specific antibodies and all hemolytic TRs will be reported to the FDA  and DSMB. 
  Investigation of Hemolytic Potential 
Investigation of the hemolytic potential of any INTERCEPT RBC-specific antibodies 
found in the ReCePI study will be conducted by a Central Laboratory according to the 
document titled “Evaluation of Reactivity with INTERCEPT RBC” provided to the sites and filed in the Investigator Site File and the protocol in APPENDIX  2. Patient samples will be managed using the supplemental instructions for patient and laboratory 
sample management for studies involving INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs when 
a reactive S -303 result is obtained (S- 303 Reactive Samples: Management of Patients

• Antibody titer 
• Persistence and titer over time  
• Thermal spectrum and phase of reaction  
• Complement- mediated in vitro hemolysis  
• Investigation of concurrent antibodies to i ntrinsic RBC allo -antigens

The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be 
reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or 
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or 
• Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuation from the study 
participation , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, 
and/or 
• Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the Investigator or Sponsor. 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event. 
7.3.2 Methods and Timing of Safety Parameters 
The use of intravenous radiographic contrast media will be documented starting 7 days 
prior to surgery, as will details related to the specific surgical procedure (type of procedure, start and end times), RBC components transfused, all other blood components transfused, estimated blood loss from the surgical procedure, concomitant medications, intraoperative cell recovery and reinfusion, hemodilution, and nadir 
temperature. Additionally, daily estimated blood loss from chest tube(s) and from other sources, and day of chest tube removal will be recorded.  Safety events (TRs,  AEs  and 
SAE s) will be documented on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support period 
(through Day 7).  
Subjects will continue to be monitored through a post-surgical follow-up period for up 
to 28 days after the last study transfusion, or death, whichever occurs first.  During this period, subjects will be monitored for safety events .  Blood samples for laboratory 
studies, DAT/IAT and for antibodies specific to INTERCEPT RBC - associated antigens 
will be obtained at 28±3 days after the last study transfusion and at end of study. 
All s amples obtained for determination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) will be 
stored for up to 1 year after the study has completed.

 REPORTING PERIOD 
All safety events  will be collected  from the start of surgery or the start of the first study 
transfusion (whichever is first) through 28 days after the last study transfusion or death, 
whichever is first .   
Vital status and need for RRT of all subjects will be collected at 30 days a fter the end of 
surgery  and at the end of study visit (Day 75 ±15 days).   
Blood sample for assessment of sCr will be collected on post-operative day 2 ( at 48  ± 
4 hours post end of surgery) for the primary endpoint.  For non-transfused subjects, a 
blood sample for sCr will be drawn  at 48  ± 4 hours post- surgery . 
Blood samples for assessment of INTERC EPT RBC -specific antibody, HLA antibodies 
and chemistry and hematology laboratory studies at 28+3 days  after the last study

Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A 
severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes signi ficantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as 
serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events.  Consistency between severity and seriousness assessments should be ensured by the Investigator.   
7.5.2 Assessing Seriou sness of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will assess if an AE resulted in any one or more of the following 
outcomes that result in classification of the event as a n SAE: death, a life -threatening 
event (results in an immediate risk of death from the reac tion as it occurred), inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another important medical event  (Section  7.3.1.2).  
7.5.3 Assessing Causality of an Adverse Event 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events 
(serious and non-serious). An I nvestigator’s causality assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the Investigator does not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “possibly 
related to investigational product” for reporting purposes.  
Adverse events assessed by the Investigator to be related (possible, likely/probable) to 
the investigational product also must be evaluated as a Transfusion Reaction and 
classified per the CDC NHSN Hemovigilance Protocol ( APPENDIX  3).

the study transfusion  
Certain/Definite  When there is conclusive evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the 
adverse event can be attributed to the study transfusion  
7.5.4 Assessing Relationship to the INTERCEPT Blood System Device 
The Clinical Investigator in collaboration with the blood transfusion service staff  will 
assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the INTERCEPT Blood System for 
Red Blood Cells medical device used for preparation and or processing of the blood 
component caused or contributed to an AE. Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an INTERCEPT component caused or contributed to an AE 
includes assessing whether a device malfunction occurred during the preparation of the 
blinded study RBC component. 
7.5.5 Reporting Requirements    
The AE, SAE,  and TR  collection period will begin at the start  of surgery or the first 
study RBC transfusion, whichever is first. AEs including protocol specified AEs, TRs , 
and SAEs (see Section 7.3) are collected daily during the acute transfusion support 
period and as reported through 28 days after the last study transfusion.  Each AE is to be 
assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for an SAE . If an SAE  occurs, expedited 
reporting will follow regional and international regulations, as appropriate.  Adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for non- transfuse d subjects. Vital status will be 
reported for randomized and non-transfused subjects at the time of discontinuation . 
If an SAE  occurs, the Investigator must notify Cerus or its designated safety representative 
within 24 hours after becoming aware of the ev ent by entering in the eCRF .  When reporting 
SAEs  to Cerus, the Investigator will ensure the report includes the severity, seriousness criteria 
or criterion,  and causality  assessments as detailed in section 7.5. 
Recording the data directly into the eCRF is the preferred method to send  this information to the

information is provided in Table 7.6. If a device malfunction occurs at the participating 
hospitals sites, the site will complete a Device Malfunction Form . 
 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  AND INTERIM 
ANALYSI S 
The study data and safety will be monitored on a regular basis by an independent Data 
and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary responsibility of the DSMB is to 
ensure patient safety  and review protocol compliance for data collection . The DSMB 
will be assembled by the Sponsor and composed of transfusion medicine experts, surgeon(s) and a statistician. DSMB members will be independent of the Sponsor.  The DSMB will review safety data and make recommendations according to the current DSMB charter.  
Aside from the blinded interim analysis for sample size re- estimation  performed in 
October 2021 that resulted in the reduction in study size from 600 to ≥292 patients, no other interim analysis is planned for this study to com pare treatment differences wi th 
respect to efficacy or safety at any time prior to the completion of the study.  Specific stopping rules, developed for safety considerations, are defined in Section 4.6.

 STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1.1 Efficacy Analysis 
For the
 primary efficacy endpoint, the treatment difference (Test – Control) and its two-
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated from Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by baseline sCr (sCr ≥1.2 mg/dL vs. < 1.2 mg/dL) and cardiac 
surgery group (more at risk for renal complications vs. less at risk) performed. The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI will be compared with the 50% of the observed Control rate. Non-inferiority will be achieved if the upper bound is less than the 50% of 
the observed Control rate.  For the non- inferiority test, the null and alternative 
hypotheses (H0 and H 1, respectively) will be formulated as follows: 
𝐻𝐻
0: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶≥50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶     𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 .    𝐻𝐻1: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶<50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,    
 
where
 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 and 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 are the event rates for Test (INTERCEPT) and Control groups, 
respectively, and  𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the observed Control rate. 
Same C
MH test will be used for assessment of treatment differences for the secondary 
efficacy end points.  As a sensitivity analysis, logistic regression will be utilized to 
estimate the treatment differences after controlling for baseline sCr, cardiac surgery 
group performed and other covariates to be detailed in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).  
8.1.2 Safety Analyses 
Treatment - emergent AEs (defined as AEs with an onset date/time that is on or after the 
start date/time of the first study transfusion) will be summarized by treatment group, 
system organ class (SOC), and preferred term. Descriptive summarie s of safety 
measures will be based on observed data. No imputation of missing scores will be 
implemented . 
8.1.3 Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analysis by the randomization stratification variables (clinical site, pre-
surgery renal impairment, and cardiac surgery group) and by demographic variables 
such as age group (≤18, 19 to 65, and >65 years old), sex, and race will be presented for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. 
Additional subgroup analysis may also be presented as suggested by the data.

 DETERMINATI ON OF SAMPLE SIZE  
A total of at least 292 transfused  subjects , approximately 146 per arm, are planned to 
generate sufficient efficacy and safety data for the Test and Control components in 
patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, a non-inferiority test will be conducted to assess for 
treatment difference  (Test  − Control).  By assuming the proportion of patients with 
∆sCr ≥0.3mg/dL to be 30% in the Control arm and no more than 50% increase from the 
Control rate as the non- inferiority margin , a sample size of 292 patients ( 146 per arm) 
will provide approximately 80% power to declare non- inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 
alpha level, assuming the true treatment difference is zero .  
 CRITERIA FOR TERMINATION OF THE STUDY 
No statistical stopping rules  for efficacy  will be carried out for this trial. However, 
specific stopping rules for safety considerations based on development of specific 
immune reactivity to INTERCEPT RBC s and life- threatening or fatal adverse events 
will be implemented as described in Section 4.6.  
The Sponsor may stop the trial for any reason; the reason for trial cessation will be 
documented. 
 HANDLING OF DROPOUTS OR MISSING DATA 
For the primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, m issing  data will be noted as 
such without imputation. Multiple imputation may be explored as an additional 
analysis .  
 DEVIATIONS FROM THE STATISTICAL PLAN  
Any changes in the planned analyses specified in this protocol will be  documented. The 
reasons f or the modifications and  when the changes were made will also be 
documented.  
 SELECTION OF SUBJECTS TO BE ANALYZED  
The primary efficacy analysis group will be based on the modified intent- to-treat 
(mITT) population, including all randomized subjects who undergo cardiac surgery and 
receive one or more study RBC transfusions from randomization to within the first 48 
hours post- surgery , hospital discharge, or death, whichever occurs first, and 
summarized under their assigned treatment group, regardless of the type of RBC 
components transfused.

 MONITORING  
During trial conduct, Cerus or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good  Clinical Practices ( GCPs ) are being followed. The monitors 
may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on e CRFs are accurate. 
The Investigator and institution will allow Cerus monitors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
The trial site may be subject to review by the institutional review board 
(IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Cerus and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. 
It is important that the Investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during 
the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is 
devoted to the process.  
 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
Each red cell collection center and each processing center will be accountable for receipt and disposition of all investigational device inventory shipped to the site. All investigational devices used to manufacture the study RBC will be stored  at the Blood 
Centers,  in a secure area with access limited to authorized study personnel. Inventory 
records will be maintained and reviewed according to monitoring procedures. 
An investigational device  receiving,  and dispensing record will be maintained by the 
Blood Centers to maintain control of investigational devices used during the study. 
Unused Investigational Product (IP), study RBC units, should not be returned to the 
Blood Center, but must be destroyed by the Hospital or Clinic Blood Bank according to the Hospital/Institution’s Standard Operating Procedure ( SOP). Destruction of any IP 
must be properly documented on the IP Accountability log.  
Any device malfunction will be documented on the eCRFs . If an investigational device 
fails to perform in the exp ected manner, the Sponsor will be notified, and the event will 
be appropriately reported. If requested, defective devices will be returned to the Sponsor 
for inspection and analysis according to procedures.

 CONDUCT OF THE TRIAL  
The trial will be con ducted according to the protocol, the International Council on 
Harmonization E6 Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local/national 
regulatory requirements and laws.   
 PATIENT INFORMATION AND CONSENT    
The informed consent /assent  form must be agreed to by Cerus and the IRB/IEC and 
must be in compliance with ICH GCP, regional regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
The Investigator must ensure that each trial patient, or his/her legally acceptable 
representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the trial and possible risks associated with participation. The Investigator will obtain written informed 
consent/ assent  from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative before 
any trial -speci fic activity is performed. The informed consent /assent  form used in this 
trial, and any changes made during the course of the trial, must be prospectively 
approved by both the IRB/IEC and Cerus before use. The investigator will retain the 
original of each patient's signed consent /assent  form. 
 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) /ETHICS COMMITTEE (EC)  
This protocol will be submitted to an appropriate central or local IRB /EC and its written 
unconditional approval obtained and submitted to Cerus or its designee be fore 
enrollment of the first subject . 
Cerus will supply relevant data for Investigators to submit to the IRB /EC for the 
protocol’s review and approval. Written verification of IRB /EC unconditional approval 
of the protocol and the subject Informed Consent F orm (ICF) /assent form  will be 
transmitted to Cerus or its designee prior to enrolling any subjects in the study. This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and number (including version), 
identify documents reviewed, and state the date of approval. 
The Investigator must promptly report to the IRB /EC all changes in the research activity 
and all unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others. This includes 
all SAEs that have resulted in an expedited safety report to the regulatory authorities (serious, unexpected AEs possibly related to investigational product). Concurrently, the Investigator must send the study Sponsor documentation of such IRB /EC notification.  
The Investigator must not make any changes in the research without IRB /EC approval

human subjects. 
 CONFIDENTIALITY 
Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential, and disclosure to third parties other than those noted below is prohibited. 
Subject confidentiality will be further assured by utilizing subject identification code numbers to correspond to treatment data in the computer files. 
However, such medical information may be given to the subject’s personal physician, or 
to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the subject’s welfare. 
In addition, data generated as a result of this study are to be available for inspection 
upon request by local health authority auditors, the Sponsor (including any person or companies that are working for or with or owned by the Sponsor [including monitors and auditors]), or by the IRB /EC. Therefore,  absolute confidentiality cannot be

 CASE REPORT FORMS  
An eCRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The completed 
original eCRFs are the sole property of Cerus and should not be made available in any 
form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Cerus or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permission from Cerus. 
It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion of,  to review , and to approve 
all eCRFs. The eCRFs must be signed by the Investigator or by an authorized staff 
member. These signatures serve to attest that the information contained on the e CRFs is 
true. At all times, the investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the e CRFs. Patient source 
documents are the physician's patient records maintained at the trial site. In most cases, the source documents will be the hospital's or the physician's chart. In cases where the source documents are the hospital or the physician's chart, the information entered on 
the eCRFs must match those charts.  
In some cases, the eCRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, Cerus 
and the Investigator must prospectively document which items will be recorded in the source documents and for which items the eCRF will stand as the source document. 
 RECORD RETENTION 
Investigators/institutions and the Sponsor shall maintain all study records required (by 
subpart 21C FR 812.140) during the investigation and for a period of 2 years after the 
latter of the following two dates: the date on which the investigation is terminated or 
completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting 
a premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol.  Investigator/institution shall not destroy any such records prior to obtaining written permission from Cerus.

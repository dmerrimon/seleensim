General Study Information  
 
Principal Investigator:  Cassie Kennedy, MD               Study Title :  Wellness Coaching for Caregivers of Thoracic Transplant Candidates   
 Protocol version number an
 d date:  Version 2 – February 20, 2020 
 
Research Question and Aims  
 Hypotheses:  Caregivers will have traits and behaviors pre- transplant that will predict caregiver readiness, 
quality of life, and transplant recipient outcomes. Specifically, thoracic pre -transplant caregivers report stress, 
symptoms of anxiety or depression, and perceive high caregiver burden. These factors may be amenable to pre-transplant intervention to improve overall patient and caregiver outcomes.  Aims, purpose, or objectives:  We will conduct a pilot trial to test whether caregivers of heart and lung 
transplant candidates who receive wellness  coaching will experience improvement in caregiver -related distress . 
We will also explore the relationship between caregiving and factors such as uncertainty, resilience, stress level, 
and affect.  
 Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .)
: Heart and lung 
transplant recipients experience a range of psychosocial and medical issues for the duration of the transplant experience, including the initiation of the transplant evaluation, pre-transplant waiting period, perioperative recovery, and long- term adjustment post-transplant. Throughout the process, family caregivers play a major role 
in maintaining their loved ones’ physical and mental health but also undergo exposure to the stressors of Note: If this study establishes a human specimen repository (biobank) for research

 transplantation. Current evidence describes high stress, caregiver burden, and increased mood disorders in the 
pre-transplant caregiver journey. Currently, limited resources and interventions have been trialed in thoracic 
transplant caregivers to improve this distress.   
Study Design and Methods  
 Methods :  Describe in lay terms , completely detailing the research activities that will be conducted by Mayo 
Clinic staff under this protocol . 
 
This is a pilot study examining the effects of a health coaching intervention on the stress and burden of 
caregivers of patients awaiting heart or lung transplant. 
 
Identifying Caregivers for Participation  
 Potentially eligible caregivers for Mayo Clinic waitlisted adult heart, heart -lung, or lung transplant 
candidates (including names, address, and phone numbers of caregivers) will be acquired through the electronic medical record of the Mayo Clinic adult heart and lung transplant waitlisted patients. For waitlisted heart and lung transplant candidates without a caregiver specified in the medical record (including patients deferred, active, or with a waiting list status of “temporarily inactive” ), they will be sent via mail, PTRAX or Redcap an 
IRB-approved contact letter including information about this study as well as a caregiver nomination form and a 
HIPAA form. Patients will have the opportunity to nominate up to 3 caregivers for participation in this study, or they may decline to nominat e any caregivers. Non -responders will be contacted by phone to ask for caregiver 
nominations. 
 In addition, self- referral or word -of-mouth caregiver referrals would be considered if they otherwise met 
eligibility criteria.  Due to current practices of multi- site listing in the Mayo Clinic Transplant Enterprise, 
caregivers for patients on the heart and lung transplant lists at Mayo Florida or Mayo Arizona may also be considered for inclusion. Additionally, caregivers for heart or lung transplant patients at the Mayo Clinic who subsequently transfer their listing  to a different (non -Mayo) transplant cen ter would continue to be eligible for 
the study unless they withdrew consent.  Likewise, caregivers for heart or lung transplant candidates who receive their organ transplant during the course of the health coaching intervention would remain eligible to complete the study unless they withdrew consent.  
 
Approaching Caregivers for Participation 
 
Nominated caregivers or caregivers identified through the electronic medical record may be contacted 
by phone, mail, or in person to determine interest in this study. Caregivers not interested will have a mechanism to send a refusal. Non-responders will be sent a second interest letter. If the study team does not receive any correspondence from the caregiver, recruitment calls will be attempted 3 times. If the study team is unable to reach the caregiver for a call after 3 attempts, the participant will be declared a non-responder.  Caregivers may be contacted while the patient is  deferred or active on the tr ansplant waitlist.  If a waitlisted patient is 
transplanted, then the caregiver’s  eligibility for recr uitment will end once the transplanted patient is discharged

 from the hospital.  In such cases, a caregiver’s enrollment, baseline questionnaires, and randomization need to 
be complete prior to a patient’s post-transplant discharge in o rder for the caregiver to proceed with the study. 
 
Caregivers who agree to participate in this study will be randomized to either receive a wellness  
coaching intervention in which they will be assigned a wellness  coach trained in motivational interviewing who 
will call the patient weekly for 12 s essions for an approximately 30- minute intervention  or usual care (routine 
caregiver transplant education) . Randomization will be stratified to type of transplant the patient they are caring 
for is waiting to receive (e.g. heart or lung). Participants who miss a call will be allowed a make -up call with the 
goal of finishing 12 calls over a 16-week period. The wellness  coaching calls will be recorded and externally 
monitored by an independent expert to assure treatment fidelity, and all recordings will remain private. After completion of the intervention, all participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires a s econd time in 
addition to a qualitative/satisfaction survey by phone mail or by Redcap. Demographic data will be collected at 
the time of the initial questionnaires and verified with the follow -up questionnaires. If a participant leaves large 
sections or multiple pages of the questionnaires unanswered, they will be sent an IRB-approved letter asking that they complete the unanswered questions or indicate that the questions were purposely left unanswered.  
Psychometric surveys will be stored in a locked cabinet. Data will be entered into a secure password- protected 
REDCap database. Questionnaire and qualitative data will be kept in a password -protected REDCap database 
on our secure network. Audio files from health coaching sessions will also be stored in a password- protected 
folder on our secure network.

Data Analysis  
  Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pilot study, but end-point analysis plans are always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if not including all of the information.   Power Statement :  Not required for a pilot study. 
  Data Analysis Plan: Descriptive statistics and change in secondary endpoints. 
 
 Endpoints Primary: Acceptability and feasibility of wellness coaching for caregivers of thoracic transplant candidates. This 
will be obtained by looking at completion rate of intervention and qualitative surveys after the intervention is completed.  
Secondary :  Preliminary efficacy data for power calculation for larger R01 application and multisite study. We 
will look at change in reported outcomes of stress, caregiver burden, resilience, quality of life, affect, and mastery .

Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 10 Protocol Section  Description of Change  Rationale  
Section  9.1  Specification on the timing of the primary analysis: 
The primary analysis will be performed when all 
patients have completed the Induction Period at Week  16. The Induction Period summary tabl es for 
primary, secondary and other efficacy endpoints will be 
presented with the unblinded treatment groups. The 
analysis will be performed by an unblinded statistician(s) who is independent from the day -to-day 
study oversight and operation. This is not a n interim 
analysis since patients who responded at Week 16 will 
be re-randomized into the Maintenance period. Only 
overall treatment group results will be presented at this time; individual patient treatment assignments will not be released until end of st udy. 
The final time -course analysis, including the 
maintenance period analysis, will be performed when all 
patients have finished Week 52 and the database has 
been locked. Study tabulation datasets, analysis datasets and data listings will not be distributed, and the double -
blind individual patient treatment assignments for both periods will not be revealed until that time.  
Sensitivity Analyses:  
Removed the Non-Response Imputation (NRI) as a sensitivity analysis and will conduct an MCMC multiple imputation for all missing values, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tipping point analysis as sensitivity analyses.  Clarification on timing of the primary analysis and change to the specified sensitivity analyses to be 
conducted for this 
study.  
Section  9.2  Endpoint Section revised to specify a single primary endpoint for FDA and a co-primary endpoint for EMA:  
For FDA:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of 
patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥2 points from baseline to Week  16. 
For EMA: 
Co-primary endpoints will be used as follows:  
• Percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 
and a reduction ≥2 points from baseline to Week  16.  
• Percentage of patients achieving EASI -75 (≥75% 
reduction from Baseline in EASI score) at Week  16 Protocol will be 
conducted in the US 
and EU countries and endpoints for the EMA must be reflected in protocol  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 11 Protocol Section  Description of Change  Rationale  
Section  9.5  Sensitivity Analyses:  
Removed the Non-Response Imputation (NRI) as a 
sensitivity analysis and will conduct an MCMC multiple imputation for all missing values, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tipping Point analysis as sensitivity analyses.  Since the primary efficacy analysis assigns baseline values for the use of topical rescue medications, 
systemic rescue 
medications and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, the non -
response imputation is 
redundant and has been 
replaced with more appropriate sensitivity analyses.  
Section  9.6  Secondary endpoints have been separated and specified for the US and EMA.  
The hierarchical order for the secondary endpoints has 
also been specified for the US and EMA.  
For EMA, the protocol now specifies secondary 
endpoints at Week 52 for the Maintenance Period.  Protocol will be conducted in the US and EU countries and 
secondary endpoints, 
adjustments for multiplicity and the hierarchical order of analysis for EMA must be reflected in protocol  
Section  9.13  A sample size determination has been described separately, for EMA, based on success rates from the 
DRM06 -AD01 Phase 2b study, for both the IGA and the 
EASI-75.  Protocol will be 
conducted in the US 
and EU countries and 
the determination of the study sampl e size must 
be reflected in the protocol.

he/she has completed the last scheduled visit:  
• For subjects continuing into LTE, upon completion of week 52 visit and rolling into 
LTE study  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 15 • For subjects not continuing into LTE, when subject had either week 52 or  Early 
Termination Visit ( ETV ), and s afety follow up visit (12 weeks after last IP 
administration)  
Study Treatment:  
Lebrikizumab, 250 mg  (2 mL injection of 125  mg/mL)  
Placebo,  2 mL injection.  
Study Design:  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study which is 52 weeks 
in duration. The study is designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as monotherapy for moderate- to-severe atopic dermatitis utilizing a 16 -week  induction treatment 
period and a 36-week long- term maintenance treatment period . 
Eligible adult and adolescent (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) patients with moderate -to-
severe atopic dermatitis for at least one year, defined according to the American A cademy of 
Dermatology Consensus Criteria, an Eczema Area and Severity  Index Score (EASI) of ≥16, an 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 and a body surface area (BSA) of ≥10% will be enrolled.  
During the 16-week Induction Period, approximately 400 patients will be stratified and 
randomized 2:1 to either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and Week 2) or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W) . All study drug 
injections will be administered in the clinic. 
After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients who have responded to treatment [defined as 
having an IGA of 0 or 1 or a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI -
75)] will 
enter the Maintenance Period and will be re-randomized 2:2:1 to one of the following treatment groups: lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W , lebrikizumab 250 mg given every four weeks (Q4W) , or 
placebo Q2W . Patients will be instructed to self -administer study drug at home. 
Responders who received placebo during the first 16 weeks of the study and who are re-randomized to lebrikizumab arms will receive a loading dose of lebrikizumab of either 500  mg 
given at Week 16 or 500 mg given at Weeks 16 and 18, based on the active treatment group 
assigned in Maintenance.  
Patients who do not achi eve an IGA of 0 or 1 or an EASI -75 at Week 16, and those patients not 
maintaining an EASI-50 response following re-randomization at Week 24, 32, 40 or 48, will be assigned to an Escape Arm and receive lebrikizumab 250 mg as long- term treatment Q2W  
through Week 52. Patients not achieving an EASI-50 response after 8 weeks of treatment in the 
Escape Arm will be terminated from the study.  
Efficacy will be measured through the IGA, EASI, BSA, SCORAD, Pruritus and Sleep -loss 
scores.  
Safety will be assessed by m onitoring adverse events, serum chemistry, hematology and 
urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, pulse and blood pressure. An independent 
Data Safety Monitoring Board will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 16 accumulated saf ety data periodically throughout the trial.  Additionally, adolescents will be 
monitored for hormones. 
Serum samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and immunogenicity.  
Quality of life and impact of disease will be assessed using the POEM, D LQI/CDLQI , EQ-5D 
and PROMIS® Anxiety and Depression measures . Patients reporting comorbid asthma at study 
entry will complete the ACQ -5.  
Photographs of a selected target lesion will be obtained in a subset of patients participating in 
this study.  
Patient s completing this 52-week study will be offered the option of continued treatment in a 
separate long -term extension study (DRM06- AD07). 
Patients  who early terminate or choose  not to enter the long-term extension study will undergo 
a safety  follow -up visit approximately 12 weeks after the last study drug injection.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study shown 
in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures 
Primary Endpoint (s): 
For FDA: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a 
reduction ≥2 points from baseline to Week  16. 
For EMA:  
Co-primary endpoints will be used as follows: 
• Percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥2 poi nts from 
baseline to Week  16.  
• Percentage of patients achieving EASI -75 (≥75% reduction from Baseline in EASI score) 
at Week  16

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 25 1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. Atopic Dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease that is determined by genetic, environmental and 
immunologic factors (Werfel,  2016; Simon, 2019 ).  
Genetic studies of AD ( Auriemma, 2013; Bieber, 2012; Weidinger, 2018 ) have shown that genes 
encoding for cytokines involved in the regulation of the immune system ( IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) , 
are strongly associated with the development of AD ( He, 2003; Hummelshoj, 2003; 
Novak, 2002). In addition, variants of genes that  encode for proteins involved in skin barrier 
function such as filaggrin  (FLG ) and loricrin (LOR)  are also associated with AD 
(Van Bever , 2011). Since FLG plays a central role in skin barrier integrity, loss of function 
mutations of the FLG gene is considered a major contrib utor to the development of early 
childhood AD ( Bieber, 2008; Tanei, 2009; Bieber, 2012; Flohr, 2013).  
Reduced epithelial barrier function , which represents the first line of protection against the 
environment, is thought to lead to sensitization  to environmental allergens, associated with  
elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) ( present in about 50% to 80% of all patients with AD, 
particularly in children [ Werfel, 2016]) and consistent  with  the presence in t he skin of Type 2 
cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IL-25, IL-31, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin 
[TSLP]) and inflammation . Type 2 cytokines increase epidermal thickening, sensitization, 
inflammation, pruritus  and decrea se the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the barrier 
proteins FLG, LOR, and involucrin. IL -13 in particular can reduce epithelial integrity and barrier 
function through downregulation of FLG, LOR, and involucrin ( Kim,  2008) and can act on 
keratinocytes in the skin to downregulate their differentiation (Howell, 2008).  IL-13 also induces 
T-cell chemoattractants that mediate T -cell infiltration into AD lesions (Purwar, 2006 ) and may 
also induce IL -5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil 
chemoattractants ( Esche, 2004).  Increased expression of IL -13 has consistently been reported in 
AD skin lesions and is associated with disease severity ( Choy, 2012; Hamid, 1996; Jeong, 2003; 
La Grutta, 2005; Neis, 2006; Suarez -Farinas, 2013; Tazawa, 200 4). The ubiquitous presence of 
IL-13 in the skin of patients with AD supports the evaluation of anti- IL-13 therapies in patients 
with AD.   
1.1.1. Epidemiology of Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis  
AD is one of the most common chronic medical  diseases—15‒30% of children and 2‒10% of 
adults are affected, and the prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three 
decades ( Williams, 2008 ), with some geographic variability. With respect to disease sever ity, 
about 67% of AD pediatric patients have mild disease, 14 to 26% have moderate disease and 2 to 
7% have severe disease ( Silverberg, 2017). Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before 
age 5, with up to 70% of chil dren having spontaneous remission before adolescence 
(Bieber,  2008; Hua, 2014; Illi, 2004 ).  
1.1.2. Clinical Manifestations  
Clinically, AD is characterized by xerosis, erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), 
lichenification and intense pruritus  (Bieber, 2008) , which along with the distribution, chronicity 
and history of skin lesions, form the basis  for making  the diagnosis AD. F lares are frequently 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 26 triggered by exposure to environmental factors, irritants, and allergens  (Bieber , 2009 ). Several  
clinical patterns, with differing distribution s of skin lesions  in distinct age groups, have been 
noted ( Weidinger, 2016 ; Weidinger, 2018).  
The infantile stage (up to 2 years of age) is characterized by eczema that is usually localized to 
the face, scalp, and extensor aspects of the arms and legs. The lesions are characterized by 
pruritic, red, eczematous plaques, erythema, papules, vesicles, excoriations, oozing, and 
formation of crusts.   
The adult stage (from puberty onwards) is less predictable. Affected patients may have had only 
a few outbreaks since infancy, or they may have had a chronic, relapsing course. Lesions 
frequently localize to the face and neck (head -and neck dermatitis), as well in the flexures of the 
elbows and knees, and a considerable portion of patients (around 30%) develop at opic hand 
eczema, which may interfere with workplace activities.  Like affected children, adolescents and 
adults commonly have lichenification of the flexures and have facial dermatitis.  
Patients with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life (QoL) is significantly 
affected.  In one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health 
than diabetes and hypertension (Zuberbier, 2006 ). Patients with moderate -to-severe AD have a 
higher prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, which are directly related to the severity of the disease ( Williams, 2008 ). Depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction not only 
affect patients with AD, but also affect their caregivers  (Zuberbier, 2006 ). Compared with 
psoriasis, another common and debilitating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physical vitality, social functioning, role -emotional, and mental health scores (Kiebert, 2002) .  
1.1.3. Treatment for  AD 
The therapeutic approach to AD consists primarily of trigger avoidance, skin hydration with 
bathing, and use of moisturizers and anti- inflammatory therapies consisting predominantly of 
topica l corticosteroids (TCS).  In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of 
symptomatic relief but does not always adequately control the disease.  In those patients who 
have persistent moderate- to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, t he step -up 
options include topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs ), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive 
agents such as oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatment of moderate -to-severe AD 
(nationally licensed in many European countries, but not in the US), and its use is limited to patients ≥16  years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks. Recently, a clinically efficacious 
and relatively safe treatment,  anti-IL-4R monoclonal antibody, dupilumab , was approved for the 
treatment of adult and adolescent patients with  moderate -to-severe AD . In spite of these 
treatments, AD remains a major societal burden and a significant unmet medical need.   
1.2. Lebrik izumab 
Lebrikizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a mutation in the hinge region that  increases stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble 
human interleukin (IL) -13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL -13 signaling through the 
IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. Because lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 in a non-receptor binding 
domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody-bound 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 27 IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL -13Rα1), but the engaged receptor complex can not be 
activated.  
1.3. Study Rationale and Benefit- Risk Assessment  
1.3.1. Scientific Rationale  
The use of lebrikizumab for AD is supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating that 
AD is characterized by  the increased expression of IL- 13 in skin. Moreover, c linical trials 
(a Phase 2a study GS29250 [Section  1.3.1.1]  and a Phase 2b study DRM06 -AD01  
[Section  1.3.1.3])  with lebrikizumab  demonstrated sig nificant clinical benefit in patients with 
AD. Additional detailed discussion of  the lebrikizumab  studies  is provided in the lebrikizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3.1.1. Summary of Study GS29250 (TREBLE) 
Study Design 
TREBLE was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double- blind , placebo -controlled trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with 
persistent moderate to severe AD, inadequately controlled by TCS. The study consisted of 
3 study periods: a run- in period (2  weeks), a treatment period (12 weeks), and a safety follow -up 
period (8 weeks). Patients applied emollient at least once daily and TCS of medium potency to 
all active skin lesions twice daily  through the study. A total of 212 patie nts were randomized  as 
follows: 53 to the lebrikizumab 250 mg, single dose group; 53 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg, 
single dose group; 52 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group; and 54 to the placebo Q4W 
group.  
Efficacy Results  
• EASI -50 at Week 12 (primary endp oint) was achieved by patients treated with 
lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W, with a treatment difference between this group and 
placebo) of  20.1% p = 0.0261). 
• Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group demonstrated statistically significant differences 
from placebo in  EASI -75 and SCORAD-50 and adjusted mean change from baseline 
to Week 12. 
Safety Results  
• Injection -site reactions occurred infrequently (1.3% all lebrikizumab treated vs. 1.9% 
placebo); all events were non-serious, lasted a median of 1 to 3 days, and did not lead 
to treatment discontinuation or interruption. 
• Herpes viral infections and zoster occurred infrequently, but only among lebrikizumab -treated patients (6  of 156 [3.8%]); all events were non-serious, and 
none led to treatment discontinuation or dose interruption of lebrikizumab.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 28 • Eosinophil- associated adverse events ( AEs) were reported infrequently, but only 
occurred among lebrikizumab- treated patients (3.2%); however, all events were 
non-serious, did not result in interruption of treatment, and there were no other 
associated clinical symptoms noted.  
• Allergic conjunctivitis events were only reported in lebrikizumab -treated patients 
(8 of 156 patients [5.1%] vs. 0% in placebo treated patients); all events were non-
serious, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, all events recovered or resolved, 
and all patients had a history of asthma. Imbalances in allergic conjunctivitis events 
were not reported in previous lebrikizumab trials.  
• The overall incidence of skin infection (noted in the system organ class [ SOC ] of 
infections and infestations) was 9.6% in all lebrikizumab arms combined, compared to 22% in the placebo arm. 
Conclusions  
The results of this trial suggest ed that lebrikizumab (on a background of mandatory twice daily 
TCS treatment) provided  some treatment benefit, as measured through EASI and SCORAD, but 
also suggested that higher lebrikizumab dosing might provide greater clinical benefit. In 
addition, lebrikizumab was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with that 
observed in previous trials conducted in other indications.  
1.3.1.2. Summary of Study GS29735 (ARBAN) 
Study Design 
ARBAN was a Phase 2, randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of lebrikizumab  monotherapy in adult patients (18–75 years of age ) with persistent 
moderate to severe AD, who were inadequately controlled by TCS. A total of 55 patients were 
randomized to treatment: 28 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W and 27 to TCS.  
Efficacy Results  
• EASI -50 was achieved by 53.6% and 51.9% of patients in the  lebrikizumab and TCS 
groups, respectively, with a treatment difference of 1.7% . EASI -75 was achieved by 
39.3% and 37.0% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively, with a treatment difference 
of 2.3%.  
• IGA scores of 0 or 1 were observed for 7.1% of patients  in the lebrikizumab group 
and 25.9% of patients in the TCS group, giving a treatment difference of −18.8% (95% CI: −37.9%, 0.3%). 
• The percent of patients achieving SCORAD- 50 or SCORAD-75 showed treatment 
differences of − 19.3%  and −7.5% , respectively.  
Safety Results  
• AEs were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group 
compared with the TCS group (64.3% vs. 37.0%) ; a higher proportion of patients in 
the lebrikizumab group, compared with the TCS group, had an AE in the SOC of 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 29 infections and infestations (42.9% vs. 25.9%). U pper respiratory tract infections were 
more common in the lebrikizumab group (14.3% vs. 3.7%).  
• The overall incidence of skin infection (in the SOC of infections and infestations) was 
17.9% in the lebrikizumab group and 7.4% in the placebo /TCS  group. 
• No serious AEs (SAEs), deaths, anaphylaxis, malignancy, protocol -defined parasitic 
or targeted intracellular infections of interest, herpes viral infections or zoster, or eosinophilia- associated AEs wer e reported. 
Conclusions  
Lebrikizumab was well  tolerated at the dose of 125 mg Q4W; the safety profile was generally 
consistent with previous experience with lebrikizumab in previous trials.  
1.3.1.3. Summary of Dose Ranging Study DRM06 -AD01  
Study Design 
DRM06 -AD01 was a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose- ranging 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate to 
severe AD.  A total of 280 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (in a 3:3:3:2 
ratio): 73 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 250 m g); 80 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 500 mg) ; 75 to  lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (with a loading 
dose of 500 mg given at baseline and W eek 2) ; 52 to  placebo Q2W.  
Efficacy Results  
• Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups achieved EASI-50, EASI-75, or EASI-90 at 
Week  16 than the placebo group.  
• A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had both an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a 
≥ 2-point improvement in IGA score at Week 16 than the placebo group.  
• The lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W group had a statistically significantly greater 
proportion of patients who achieved a ≥ 4-point improvement in pruritus NRS 
compared with the placebo group. 
• Positive changes in pruritus correlated with positive changes in sleep; the 
lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had statistically significant 
percent reductions in sleep loss due to itching compared with pla cebo (p=0.0459 and 
p=0.0062, respectively).  
Safety Results  
• The incidences of conjunctivitis (2.6% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), herpes 
infections (2.2% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), and herpes zoster (0.9% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo) were relatively low.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 30 • Three patients (1.3%) in the lebrikizumab groups and 2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo 
group had an SAE. Those reported in the lebrikizumab groups were severe chest pain 
(1 patient in the 250 mg Q2W group), femur fracture of moderate se verity (1 patient 
in the 125 mg Q4W group), and panic attack of moderate severity (1 patient in the 
250 mg Q2W group). Those reported in the placebo group were severe chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, severe edema peripheral, and severe pulmonary 
embolism. All SAEs were considered by the investigator as not related to study drug. 
• Most AEs were considered not related to study drug; those considered related were 
reported for 16.2% of patients in the lebrikizumab groups and 5.8% of patients in the 
placebo  group  
Conclusions   
This Phase 2b  study showed that higher doses of lebrikizumab provided greater clinical benefit.  
All lebrikizumab doses induced statistically significant reduction s in EASI score s compared to  
placebo , and a good dose response was observed for all primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. T he best response for all endpoints was observed with the highest lebrikizumab dose 
(250 mg Q2W), although the next highest dose (250 mg Q4W) also induced significant improvement in virtually all endpoints.  All doses of lebrikizumab were well tolerated , without a 
dose response noted ; AEs were generally mild or moderate and considered unrelated to study 
drug. These results provided the bas is for dose selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies.  
1.3.1.4. Summary of DRM06 -AD03  Phase 1 PK Study  
Study Design 
DRM06 -AD03 was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel -group study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) and safety of lebrikizumab in healthy adult volunteers (18 to 45 years of 
age, inclusive). A total of 41 subjects were randomized as follows: 21 subjects received two 
1-mL (125 mg) SC injections and 20 subjects received one 2 -mL (250 mg) SC injection. The 
primary objective was to compare the PK (AUC, C
max) of the 2 lebrikizumab dosing regimens. 
Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for PK and Day 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for anti- drug antibodies (ADA).  
Pharmacokinetic Results  
For each AUC comparison (i.e., AUC
last, AUC inf, and AUC 0-57d) geometric mean ratios were 
close to 1 with 90% CI s within the range of 80% to 125% , except for AUC inf, which was just 
above the upper bound, with a value of 132% . The C max geometric mean ratio was 0.89 with  a 
90% CI  of 73% –108% .  
Conclusions  
Both the AUC and C max results indicated similar overall exposure between the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens evaluated in this study, i.e., two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC injections versus  one 2- mL 
(250 mg) SC injection. Data from this study support the use of the 2- mL (250 mg) pre -filled 
syringe with a pre -assembled needle safety device ( PFS- NSD ) in the Phase 3 pivotal trials.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 31 1.4. Rationale for Dose and T reatment Regimen  
The dosing regimen of 500 mg loading dose at baseline and Week 2, followed by 250 mg Q2W 
lebrikizumab was selected for study in the I nduction Period  (baseline to Week 16) in this trial, 
based on an evaluation of safety, efficacy and PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 and DRM06- AD03  
trials (see above) . For the M aintenance P eriod in this trial, both a 250 mg lebrikizum ab Q4W 
dosing regimen and a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W dosing regimen were  selected for  explor ation , 
in order to determine whether both regimens , one which involves less frequent dosing, might be 
effective in maintaining disease control over an extended period of time.  
The DRM06 -AD0 3 PK study conducted in healthy adults demonstrated that a single SC injection 
of 2- mL ( 250 mg)  of lebrikizumab delivered comparable levels of lebrikizumab as did two 1-mL 
(125 mg) SC injections . This simulated the co nditions under which study drug will be 
administered in Phase 3, further supporting the dose and treatment regimen for Phase 3 trials, 
lebrikizumab 250mg Q2W with a loading dose of 500mg given at Baseline and Week 2.  
Adolescent Patients  
In this  Phase 3 st udy, adolescent patients ( ≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) , will be included 
and will receive the same doses of lebrikizumab  described above for adults.  The justification  for 
this approach is as follows:   
Both adults and adolescent patients have similar disease characteristics, typified  by prominent 
Type 2 skin inflammation and similar clinical manifestations . In addition, both groups tend to 
have similar efficacy outcomes in response to therapies, including dupilumab ( Simpson, 2018; 
Treister, 2019 ). Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations of lebrikizumab dosing (population 
PK modeling of pooled data from 2259 adult asthma patients and a subsequent external posterior 
predictive check w ith lebrikizumab PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 trial in adult AD patients) 
revealed  similar kinetics for adults and adolescent  patients, 12 to <18 years of age. The maximal 
exposures are predicted to be slightly (≤ 35%) higher in adolescent patients than in adults for any 
given dose due to the lower adolescent weight ranges  and lebrikizumab exposure dependence on 
weight; however, the safety profile in adolescent patients, based on the exposure-response relationship analys is and  on partial extrapolation, is  comparable to that observed in adults.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study which is 52 weeks 
in duration. The study is designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab as 
monotherapy for moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis utilizing a 16 -week induction treatment 
period and a 36- week maintenance treatment period  (Figure 1) .  
Eligible adult and adolescent (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) patients with moderate -to-
severe AD for at least one year, defined according to the American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, an EASI Score of ≥16, an IGA score of ≥3 and a BSA of ≥10% will be 
enrolled.  
During the 16-week Induction Period, approximately 400 patients will be stratified and 
randomized 2:1 to either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and 
Week 2) or placebo by SC injection Q2W . All study drug injections will be administered in the 
clinic.  
After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients who have responded to treatment [defined as having an IGA of 0 or 1 or a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI- 75)] will 
enter the Maintenance Period and will be re-randomized 2:2:1 to one of the following treatment 
groups: lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W , lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W , or placebo Q2W . Patients will 
be instructed to self- administer study drug at home . 
Patients who do not achieve an IGA of 0 or 1 or an EASI-75 at Week 16 and those patients not maintaining an EASI-50 response following re-randomization at Week 24, 32, 40 or 48 will be 
assigned to an Escape Arm and receive lebrikizumab  250 mg as open- label treatment Q2W  
through Week 52. Patients not achieving an EASI-50 response after 8 weeks of treatment  in the 
Escape Arm will be terminated from the study.  
Efficacy will be measured through the IGA, EASI, BSA, SCORAD, Pruritus and Sleep- loss 
scores.  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, pulse and blood pressu re. An independent 
Data Safety Monitoring Board will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of 
accumulated safety data periodically throughout the trial.  Additionally, adolescents will be 
monitored for hormones. 
Quality of life and impact of d isease will be assessed using the POEM, DLQI/CDLQI, EQ -5D 
and PROMIS Anxiety and D epression measures . Patients reporting comorbid asthma at study 
entry will complete the ACQ -5.

Photographs of a selected target lesion will be obtained in a subset of patients participating in 
this study.  
Patients completing this 52 -week study will be offered the option of continued treatment in a 
separate long -term extension study (DRM06- AD07) . 
Patients who early terminate or choose not to enter the long-term extension study will undergo a 
follow up visit approximately 12 weeks after the last study drug injection for safety  follow -up. 
A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed  the last scheduled 
visit:  
• For subjects continuing into LTE, upon completion of week 52 visit and rolling into LTE study 
• For subjects not continuing into LTE, when subject had either week 52 or ETV, and safety follow up visit (12 weeks after last IP administration)  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study shown in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures.

5. STUDY  DRUG  
5.1. Investigational Medicinal Product  
Lebrikizumab is a sterile liq uid solution containing 125 mg/mL lebrikizumab, histidine acetate, 
sucrose, polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection, USP, pH 5.4‒6.0. Placebo solution is identical in appearance and content to the active solution except for lebrikizumab. All study drug (lebrikizumab and placebo) will be supplied as a sterile pre -filled syringe with a pre -assembled 
needle safety device (PFS -NSD). Each pre -filled syringe is intended for a single 2 mL dose 
(250 mg)  administered subcutaneously (SC).  
5.2. Storage and Labeling  
Study drug is to be stored under refrigerated conditions (2‒8°C) and protected from excessive light and heat. Study drug should not be frozen, shaken or stored at room temperature. Temperature excursions outside of 2‒8°C must be reported to the Sponsor or  the designee.  
Clinical trial material will be labeled according to country’s regulatory requirements.  
5.3. Patient R andomization  
Patients  will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any pa tient records, datasets or 
tissue samples that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; pa tient names or 
any information which would make the patient identifiable will not be transferred.  All patients 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 40 will be  randomly allocated  to receive the  study treatment using an electronic data capture system  
at the Baseline visit.  The allocation to treatment will be prospectively stratified by geographic 
region (US versus EU versus rest of world), age (adolescent patients 12 to <18 years versus 
adults ≥18 years) and disease severity (IGA 3 versus  4).At the Baseline visit (Day 1) , once a 
patient is considered eligible to participate in the study,  demographic and stratification  
information  will be entered  into the EDC  system  to receive a medication number assigning a kit 
to a patient.  
During the Maintenance  Period , the EDC will be used to re- randomize a patient to a maintenance 
treatment based on the IGA or EASI score  at Week 16 . 
5.3.1. Induction Period (Day 1 to Week 16) 
Patients will be randomized 2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W: 500 mg lebrikizumab administered at Baseline and 
Week 2 (loading dose ; two PFS- NSD) and 250 mg Q2W through Week 14  
• Placebo: 4  mL (two PFS- NSD) administered at Baseline and Week 2 and 2 mL Q2W 
through Week 14  
5.3.2. Maintenance Period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients who have responded to treatment [defined as 
having an IGA score of 0 or 1 or, at least a 75% reduction in EASI from Baseline to Week 16 (EASI -75)] will be re -randomized 2:2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:  
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W: 250 mg lebrikizumab given every 2 weeks through Week 50 
• Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W: 250 mg lebrikizumab given every 4 weeks through 
Week 50 
• Placebo: placebo given every 2 weeks  
Responders who received placebo during the first 16 weeks of the study and who are re-randomized to lebrikizumab arms will receive a loading dose of lebrikizumab of either 500  mg 
given at Week 16 or 500 mg given at Weeks 16 and 18, based on the active treatment group 
assigned in Maintenance. To maintain study blinding, all patients re- randomized in the 
Maintenance period will receive the same number of injections at all visits throughout the Maintenance Period using an appropriate combination of active and placebo injections ( Table  2).

5.3.3. Escape Arm  
Patients who require topical or systemic rescue treatment  (Section 6.3)  for atopic dermatitis  
during the Induction Period, or, are non -responders at Week 16 , will be eligible for treatment in 
an Escape Arm  where patients will receive lebrikizumab Q2W  from Week 16 through Week 52. 
In addition, patients who do not maintain an acceptable response during the Maintenance Period 
(have an EASI  score <50 % of baseline) , will be eligible for the Escape Arm.  
To enter the E scape A rm, patients must have been compliant with study visits during the 
Induction P eriod  or the Maintenance Period, respectively . Patients receiving systemic rescue 
medication (Section  6.3) will be required to washout for 5 half -lives prior to init iating treatment 
in the Escape Arm. All patients eligible for the Escape Arm will receive blinded loading doses, 
based on their prior treatment assignment (see Table  3 below ), followed by 250 mg lebrikizumab 
Q2W through Week 52 on study in an open- label  fashion. Patients in the Escape Arm must

5.4. Study B linding  
The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, study- site personnel, and the patient will be blinded to 
treatment assignment. The integrity of the clinical study will be maintained by observing the 
treatment blind. If knowledge of a patient’s treatment assignment is required for the patient’s 
clinical care and/or safety, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to breaking the blind.  
5.4.1. Unblinding T reatment Assignment  
Unblinding the treatment assignment of a patient may only be performed in emergencies where 
knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment is essential for management of the patient’s medical care. Unblinding the treatment assignment by the investigator under any other 
circumstances will be considered a protocol violation. The investigator should make every effort 
to contact the Sponsor or designee prior to unblinding a patient ’s treatment assignment. In the 
event of any unblinding, emergency or accidental, the sponsor must be notified within 1 business day.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 43 Unblinding will occur using the EDC  system . The Investigator must record the date and time the 
blind was broken, the names of the personnel involved, and the reason that treatment assignment 
information was required. The date and time that the Spons or or designee was notified will also 
be recorded.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered to all patients in the clinic by designated and trained site staff 
from Baseline to Week 14  (last injection prior to Maintenance Period).  
5.5.1. Instruct ions for Administration in the Clinic  
Syringes should be at room temperature prior to injection (refer to the applicable Instructions for Use provided by the sponsor).  
5.5.2. Instructions for Administration at Home  
During the Maintenance Period, patients or care givers will be instructed to self -administer study 
drug during the Maintenance Period .  
Study site staff will instruct the patient or their caregiver on the proper injection technique and 
the patient or their caregiver will demonstrate  for site staff proper injection technique  prior to 
beginning at- home administration . An instruction card  with details of the injection procedures  
will be provided to the patient/caregiver to take home, and dosing compliance will be captured 
via an electronic diary.  
Patients or caregivers who are not capable of administering study drug at home may continue to 
receive study drug injections in the clinic. 
5.6. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator must keep an accurate record of the number of cartons received, the study drug 
dispensed/used, and those returned to the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor or designee will 
provide forms to facilitate inventory control. All study- drug accountability forms and treatment 
logs must be retained in the Investigator’s permanent study file, and these records must be 
available for inspection at any time by the Sponsor, its designees, or by regulatory agencies. 
The study monitor will perform drug accountability for all study drug at the site, and will assist 
in returning all used, unused, and expired study drug, to the Sponsor/designees, or destroy it 
according to the study site’s standard operating procedure, if accepted by the Sponsor. 
6. CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS AND PROCEDURES  
All medications (including over- the-counter drugs, vitamins, and antacids) and over -the-counter 
emollient(s) taken/used at screening and throughout the study must be recorded. Patients should 
be instructed to consult with the Investigator prior to initiating any new medication (either self-administered non -prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by another physician) 
while participating in the study. The Investigator is expected to examine the acceptability of all 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 44 concomitant medications, topical preparations, and dietary supplements taken by patients 
participating in the trial.  
• Medication entries should be specific to product name (if a combination drug product) and spelled correctly.  
• The brand and specific product name for any over-the- counter emollient(s) should be 
noted and spelled correctly. 
• Informatio n on the dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, start date, 
discontinuation date, indication, and reason for use will be recorded.  
• The use of any concomitant medication must relate to an AE listed on the AE eCRF or the patient's medical history u nless it is a supplement or used as preventative care.  
6.1. Permitted and Prohibited Treatments and Procedures  
The use of concomitant medications for other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, acute infections) is permitted during this study. Inhal ed corticosteroids and bronchodilators to 
control asthma are permitted.  
The introduction of medications or therapies for other medical conditions known to affect AD (e.g., systemic corticosteroids, mycophenolate- mofetil, IFN -y, Janus kinase inhibitors, TCI, 
cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexat e, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy, 
phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitors such as crisaborole ) are not permitted  during the study. The use of 
systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of AD is prohibited and requires permanent discontinuation of Investigational Product. If used for treatment of AE (e.g. worsening of 
existing condition such as asthma exacerbation), it will still be tr eated as rescue medication as 
per Section 6.3. 
Acute infections can be treated with systemic antibiotics, use of which must be recorded in the 
eCRF.  Howe ver, chronic treatment with systemic antibiotics is not permitted .  
The use of a tanning booth/parlor is not permitted during the trial. 
Cannabinoid treatments for AD are prohibited. 
Planned or anticipated major medical  procedures or surgeries should be avoided during the trial.  
See Section 6.3 for details on approved rescue medications and  timing of use.  
6.2. Moisturizers  
Non-medicated moisturizers are to be used during the study. The patient may continue her/his 
current over-the-counter moisturizer regimen, if approved by the Investigator.  
6.3. Rescue Treatment  for Atopic Dermatitis  
Induction Period  
The use of topical or systemic treatments for atopic dermatitis is prohibited from Baseline 
through Week 16 in this study. P atients who experience intolerable AD symptoms and require 
treatment should , preferably, be started on topical treatments (e.g., mid-potency TCS ) prior to 
instituting systemic treatments for AD symptoms, in accordance with best practice.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 45 If systemic rescue treatments (e.g., oral corticosteroids, phototherapy, cyclosporin, etc.) are 
required, study drug must be discontinued. The patient should continue to attend all study visits 
through Week 16 and be assessed for safety and efficacy according to the schedule of events.  
Patients requiring topical or systemic rescue medication who complete the study through Week 16 
will be eligible to continue to the Escape Arm a fter the Week 16 visit has been completed. 
Patients who required systemic rescue medication must wait for rescue medication washout (≥5 half-lives of the medication) prior to entering the Escape Arm.  
Maintenance Period  
Intermittent use of topical rescue medications for AD is permitted during the Maintenance Period. Patients who may require short- term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD during the 
Maintenance Period will be assessed on a case by case basis and must be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor prior to initiating treatment.    
Escape Arm  
Intermittent use of topical rescue medications for AD is permitted for patients who are in the Escape Arm.  Patients who may require short- term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD 
during the Escape Arm will be assessed on a case by case basis and must be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor prior to initiating treatment.  Patients requiring long- term systemic treatment for 
symptoms of AD in the Escape Arm (e.g., non- responders) must be discontinued from the study.  
The Sponsor may supply the study sites with a mid-potency and a low-potency TCS that can be provided to patients for use, if needed (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream  and 
hydrocortisone 1% cream).  
All topical and systemic treatments for AD must be captu red in the eCRF.

Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 54 8. DETAILS OF ASSESSMENT S 
8.1. Screening Assessments  
8.1.1. Demographic Information 
Patient age, gender at birth, ethnicity and race will be collected.  Race and ethnicity information 
will only be used to support sub- group analyses assessing phenotype with treatment response.  
The collection of a patient’s race and ethnicity is particularly important, given recent descriptions 
of disease heterogeneity in AD, with diverse phenotypes and endotypes described based on age, 
disease chronicity, ethnicity, genetics, IgE status, and underlying molecular mechanisms 
(Czarnowicki, 2019).  
8.1.2. Medical History  
A complete medical h istory will be collected and include  immunization record (for adolescent 
patients)  clinically relevant medical conditions or surgeries , including more specific information 
on a history of conjunctivitis and herpes infection/zoster. Information on the patie nt’s AD and 
comorbidities (past history of asthma, allergic rhinitis,  food allergies, alopecia)  will be collected 
and include the date of onset, extent of involvement and past treatments for AD and comorbidities .  
8.2. Assessment of Efficacy 
Each patient’s AD will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient  over the 
course of the study. The sponsor will administer training on the required efficacy assess ments, 
detail on the specific instruments and training given are recorded in the study training materials.  
8.2.1. Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 
The IGA is a  static assessment and  rates the severity of the patient’s AD . The IGA is comprised 
of a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe)  and a score is selected using descriptors 
that best describe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point  (Table  4). It is not 
necessary that all characteristics under Morphological Description be present. Assessors must be 
trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. The IGA must be 
conducted prior to conducting the EASI and BSA assessments. A single assessor should be 
assigned to each individual patient for as many visits as possible, to avoid inter- assessor 
variability in scoring.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 55 Table  4: Investigator Global Assessment (I GA) 
Score  Grade  Definition  
0 Clear  Minor, residual discoloration; no erythema or induration/papulation; no 
oozing/crusting; no edema.  
1 Almost Clear  Trace, faint pink erythema with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting; no edema.  
2 Mild  Faint- pink erythema with papulation and edema perceptible upon palpation 
and no oozing/crusting; minimal induration.  
3 Moderate  Pink-red erythema with definite edema of skin papules and plaques; there 
may be some oozing/ crusting; palpable induration.  
4 Severe Deep/bright red erythema with significant swelling and obvious raised borders of papules and plaques with oozing/crusting; significant induration.  
8.2.2. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  
The EASI is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores 
ranging from 0 to 72, with the higher values indicating more severe and/ or extensive disease. 
Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment.  
8.2.3. Body Surface Area (BSA)  
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and 
is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by the Investigator or 
designee using the patient palm = 1 % rule. Assessors must be trained and certified by the 
Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. 
8.2.4. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)  
SCORAD is a validated clinical tool for assessing the extent and intensity of atopic dermatitis. 
There are 3 components to the assessment:  
• The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported 
as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the 
overall SCORAD calculation).  
• The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, 
excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following 
scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total 
points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation).  
• Subjective assessment of itch and of sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by 
the patient or relative on a VAS, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessne ss) and 10 is the 
worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20 (assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculatio n).  
The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103.   
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 56 8.2.5. Pruritus  
Pruritus will be assessed by the patient using a Pruritus Numeric al Rating Scale (NRS). The 
Pruritus NRS is an 11 -point scale used by patients to rate their worst itch severity over the past 
24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch imaginable.” Assessments 
will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary. Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
8.2.6. Sleep -Loss  
Sleep -loss due to pruritus will be assessed by the patient. P atient s rate their sleep based on a 
5-point L ikert scale  [0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all)] . Assessments will be recorded 
daily by the patient using an electronic diary. Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
8.3. Patient Reported Outcomes and Health- Related Quality of Life 
Patient reported outcome and quality of life measures should all be completed  prior to other 
study assessments.   
8.3.1. Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)  
The POEM is a 7 -item, validated, questionnaire used by the patient to assess disease symptoms 
over the last week. The patient is asked to respond to 7 questions on skin dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping. All 7 answers carry equal weight with a 
total possible score from 0 to 28 (answers scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2 days = 1; 3 -4 days = 2; 
5-6-days = 3; everyday = 4). A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. POEM responses 
will be captured using an electronic diary and transferred int o the clinical database.  
8.3.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  
The DLQI is a 10 -item, validated questionnaire used to assess the impact of skin disease on the 
quality of life of an affected person. The 10 questions cover the following topics: symptoms, 
embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close 
relationships, sex, and treatment, over the previous week. Questions are scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible total score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life). A high score is indicative of a poor quality 
of life. Patients ≤16 years will complete the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CDLQI)  and should continue to complete the CDLQI  for the duration of the study. 
DLQI/CDLQI is completed by the patient in the study clinic.  
8.3.3. EQ-5D 
EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and 
anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical visual 
analogue scale. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can 
be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to 
other health profiles. EQ-5D is comp leted by the patient in the study clinic.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 57 8.3.4. PROMIS® (Patient- Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) : 
Anxiety and Depression  
PROMIS® (Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System)  is a set of person -
centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and 
children. Pediatric and tools for anxiety and depression. Patients ≤1 7 years will complete 
pediatric versions for the duration of the study. The PROMIS measures will be completed by the 
patient in the study clinic.  
8.3.5. Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) 
Patients who report comorbid asthma prior to enrollment will complete the Asthma Control 
Questionnaire (ACQ-5)  in addition to other patient reported outcomes in this trial. The ACQ-5 
has been shown to reliably measure asthma control and distinguish patients with well- controlled 
asthma (score ≤0.75 points) from those with uncontrolled asthma (score ≥1.5 points). It  consists 
of 5 questions that are scored on a 7 -point Likert scale with a recall period of 1 week. The total 
ACQ- 5 score is the mean score of all questions; a lower score represents better asthma control. 
ACQ-5 is completed by the patient in the study clinic.  
8.4. Photography  
At a subset of study sites, some patients will have photographs taken of a representative area of 
AD involvement. Equipment and procedures will be outlined in a separate Photography Manual.  
8.5. Assessment of Safety  
8.5.1. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be conducted at screening and cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, 
neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height and weight will also be 
recorded. At subsequent study visits, a symptom- directed physical examination may be 
conducted at the discretion of the Investigator. Findings will be recorded as medical history or AE in the eCRF.  
8.5.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs, including body temperatur e, respiratory rate (breath per minute), pulse (beats per 
minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position, after sitting for at least 5 minutes. Any abnormal findings which are new or worsened in severity and cl inically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, will be recorded as an AE. Vital sign 
measurements will be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.5.3. Laboratory Evaluations  
Laboratory tests will be analyzed using a central laboratory and include hematology with differential, serology, a standard chemistry panel (including liver- function tests), total 
cholesterol, standard urine testing, and urine pregnancy test for women who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile. Blood and urine will be collected from each pa tient as specified

8.5.4. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the 
Investigator and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked about AEs in a 
non-specific manner using open-ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have 
you been since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when 
applicable. All AEs will be documented and recorded in the patient’s eCRF.  
Any patient who has an AE (serious or non- serious) will be evaluated by the Investigator and 
treated and followed until the symptom(s) return to normal or to clini cally acceptable levels, as 
judged by the Investigator. A physician, either at the  clinical site, or at a nearby hospital 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 59 emergency room, will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When 
appropriate, medical tests and examinations w ill be performed to document resolution of 
event(s).  
8.5.4.1. Reporting  
Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the study drug will be reported in the AE section of the eCRF. Events occurring prior to study treatment with the drug will be 
reported in the Medical History section of the eCRF. All AEs occurring during the study will be 
individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information 
regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will 
be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by the Investigator or meet the criteria of an 
SAE as described in Section  8.5.4.3. Unless an overall diagnosis is described , signs and 
symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred.  
The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respiratory infection). Severity is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (See Section 8.5.4.3.)  
The relationship of the AE to the study treatment should be determined by the Investigator and 
will be based on the following two definitions:  
Not related : The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug and is most likely 
attributable to another cause. 
Related:  A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical argum ents to suggest a 
causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
8.5.4.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)  
The following treatment emergent adverse events are being designated a dverse events of special 
interest (AESI):  
• conjunctivitis 
• herpes infection or zoster  
• parasitic infection or an infection related to an intracellular pathogen  
AESI s should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 48 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Additional data will be collected  for AESIs  on study- specific AESI f orms will be provided to the 
site. Patient records must include any follow- up information regarding these AESIs.   
Study drug should be discontinued if an adverse event is deemed persistent and if continuation of 
study drug would not be in the best interest of the patient. Discuss discontinuation of study drug 
or dose changes with the Sponsor or designee prior to implementation. 
 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 60 8.5.4.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that,  
• Results in  death  
• Is in the opinion of the Investigator immediately life threatening (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalizat ion or results in prolongation of an existing 
hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening, result in 
death, or require hospitalization, but based on appropriate medical judgment, it 
jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post- mortem findings/reports will be requested.  
8.5.4.4. Reporting of SAEs  
All SAEs, as defined in Section  8.5.4.3, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be 
docume nted to the extent that information is available.  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, an SAE occurring outside the specified time window 
(i.e., following patien t completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug -related, the 
event should be reported with 24 hours. 
SAEs must be recorded on study- specific SAE form s which will be provided to the site. The 
minimum information required for SAE reporting includes the identity of the PI, site number, 
patient number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious 
(i.e., the seriousness criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. 
Additional SAE information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat 
the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form. 
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by the Sponsor or its designee. 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 61 When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered:  
• Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be 
provided, the Investigator should report the diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term. 
• Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless 
the event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy 
report should be provided. 
Although most hospitalizations necessitate reporting of an SAE, some hospitalizations do not:  
• Hospitalization for elective or previously scheduled surgery, or for a procedure for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural comp lication that lead to prolongation of the hospitalization. 
• Events that result in hospital stays for observation of <24 hours and that do not require a therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnos is of cystitis and discharge to home on oral 
antibiotics).  
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant 
regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess the likelihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the 
current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug. 
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal resp onsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting  to 
the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IEC), and investigators.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
8.5.5. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communi cation that alleges deficiencies 
related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a trial intervention. The sponsor collects product complaints on investigational products and drug 
delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, 
monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Participants will be 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 62 instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em 
with the investigational product or drug delivery system so that the situation can be assessed.  
Time Period for Detecting Product Complaints  
• Product complaints that result in an adverse event will be detected, documented, and 
reported to the sponsor during all periods of the study in which the drug is used. 
• If the investigator learns of any product complaint at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonably related to a drug provided for the study, the investigator will promptly notify the sponsor. 
Prompt Reporting of Product Complaints to Sponsor  
• Product complaints will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the complaint.  
• The Product Complaint Form will be sent to the sponsor.  
Follow- up of Product Complaints  
• Follow-up applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention. 
• The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the product complaint.  
• New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated by the investigator and submitted to the sponsor. 
8.5.6. Pregnancy  
The investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately regarding a pregnancy in a (1) female 
clinical trial patient  or (2) female partner of a male clinical trial patient.  
Pregnant female patient s must be withdrawn from study drug.  
If a female  partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by the male 
patient , the male patient  will be advised by the study Investigator to have his female pregnant 
partner inform her treating physician immediately.  
The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clinically indicated and continue to follow 
the patient for ≥4 weeks after delivery. Medical d etails for both the mother and baby must be 
obtained.  
The Investigator must complete a study -specific Pregnancy Form upon confirmation o f a 
pregnancy. Pregnancy reporting forms will be provided to the site. 
8.5.7. Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Patient s experiencing any  hypersensitivity reaction should receive appropriate symptomatic 
medical care , as needed.  Patients should be instructed to inform the site if a hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs. At the next study visit, a blood sample must be collected for immunogenicity 
analysis.  The Sponsor or designee should be immediately consulted, particularly  if the 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 63 hypersensitivity reaction might be attributed to the study drug, and particularly if the reaction is 
severe, for discussions about discontinuing the study medication. 
8.6. PK and ADA Sampling  
Serum PK and ADA samples will be collected in all patients. Positive ADA results may be 
further evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. The procedural instructions will be provided in a 
separate PK and Serum Antibody Sampling manual. 
8.7. Study Termination  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time. Should the study be terminated, the decision and reason will be communicated in writing by the Sponsor to the Investigator and 
request that all patients be discontinued. Patients sh ould be scheduled for an Early Termination 
visit. The entire study will be stopped if:  
• Evidence has emerged that, in the collective opinion of the Investigators at each site with the concurrence of the Sponsor, or the sole opinion of the Sponsor, continuation of the study is unnecessary or unethical 
• The stated objectives of the study are achieved  
• The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug 
All data available for the patient at the time of study discontinuation must be recorded in the 
patient’s records and the eCRF. 
8.7.1. Early Termination of Study Patients  
The Investigator will make reasonable efforts to keep each patient in the study. However, 
patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntarily withdr awal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time 
• Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in 
the best interest of the patient  
• Serious protocol violation, persistent non- compliance or requirement for medication or 
procedure prohibited by the protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
Patients who are terminated early from the study will have an Early Termination v isit scheduled 
as soon as possible (see Section  7.20 ). All information, including the reason for early termination 
will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF.   
Two attempts of contact (e.g., telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of contact to the 
patient must be documented in a patient’s study records for all patients who are believed to be 
lost to follow -up.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 64 8.7.2. Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug must be discontinued for patients who experience the following: 
• Inter-current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree  
• Treatment -related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the judgment 
of the Investigator  
• Unacceptable tox icity 
• Pregnancy 
• Use of systemic rescue medication as outlined in Section  6.3  
Patients who discontinue study drug permanently during study participation must be scheduled 
for an Early Termination visit except those receiving systemic rescue medication, as per 
Section  6.3. 
8.8. Data Safety Monitoring Board 
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of members who are independent of the study sponsor and study investigators will monitor patient safety by 
conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data that is blinded by treatment group; if 
requested, the DSMB may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The DSMB will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The DSMB will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity o f the study 
results during the study execution. 
All activities and responsibilities of the DSMB are described in the DRM06 D SMB charter.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. General Statistical Methodology  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unle ss otherwise stated. Except where 
noted, all statistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of 
significance.   
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parame ters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be 
presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n umber of subjects  (n), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables.  
The Pruritus- NRS weekly mean will be calculated as follows: The mean of each patient’s 
baseline and post- baseline Pruritus -NRS scores will be computed for each week based on the 
previous 7 days. The weekly mean will be calculated if a patien t has responses for Pruritus -NRS 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 65 on at least 4 of the 7 days of the week. If the patien t has 3 or fewer Pruritus -NRS responses, the 
mean value for that item will be considered missing.  All Pruritus -NRS efficacy endpoint 
analyses will be conducted on the weekly m ean. The Sleep -Loss weekly mean will be calculated 
similar to the Pruritus -NRS weekly mean. All Sleep -Loss efficacy endpoint analyses will be 
conducted on the weekly mean. 
The primary method of ha ndling missing efficacy data will be as follows for both binary and 
continuous endpoints: for patients who receive topical rescue medication (per Section  6.3), any 
systemic medication for AD or withdraw from the study due to lack of efficacy,  set to the 
patient’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week  16. Markov chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC ) multiple imputation  will be used  to handle the remaining missing data . MCMC 
multiple imputation for all missing values, Non -Response Imputation (NRI), Last Observation 
Carried Forward (LOCF)  and Tipping point analysis will be used for sensitivity analyses. Details 
about missing data imputation during the maintenance will be described in the SAP. 
Demographic data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Patients’ 
baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with descriptive statistics 
among treatment groups to ensure comparable results.  
The number of patient s in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal 
during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by treatment group. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses  (induction and maintenance)  
will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the 
study treatments.  
9.1.1. Populations Analyzed 
Approximately 400 patient s (including approximately 50 a dolescent  patients [ ≥12 to <18 years 
of age weighing ≥40 kg]) will be randomized to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W or placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population and the per- protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the 
safety population. 
All patients who are randomized will be included in the ITT population. 
All patient s who are randomized and receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug will be 
included in the safety population. 
The PP population will include all patients in the ITT population who complete the Week 16 
evaluation without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any patient  or Investiga tor activity 
that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the 
precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include patients in the safety 
population who do not meet any of the following cr iteria: 
• Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
• Used an interfering  concomitant medication (see Section  6.3 for definitions of interfering  
concomita nt medications) or underwent a prohibited procedure; 
• Did not attend the Week 16 visit; 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 66 • Missed more than one post -baseline study visit prior to Week 16; 
• Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., patient s must receive at least 75% 
of the expected injections of study medication during participation in the study);  
• Out of visit window at the Week 16 visit by more than ±4 day. 
Patient s that discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or 
documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the 
blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
9.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
For FDA:  
The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥ 2-point 
improvement from Baseline at Week  16 and will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity, age).  
For EMA:  
Both co-primary endpoints: 
• Percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥2 poi nts from baseline 
to Week  16, and 
• Percentage of patients achieving EASI -75 (≥75% reduction from Baseline in EASI score) 
at Week  16 
will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata 
(region, disease severity, age).  
9.3. Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For dichotomous secondary endpoints, the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel  analysis will be used. 
For continuous secondary endpoints, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used with 
factors of treatment and randomization strata (region,  disease severity, age) and relevant baseline 
value.  
9.4. Missing Data  
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be as follows for both binary and continuous endpoints: for patient s who receive topical rescue medication ( per Section  6.3), 
receive systemic rescue medication or withdraw from the study due to lack of efficacy, set to the 
patient ’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week 16. MCMC multiple imputation 
will be used to handle the remaining missing data. Imputation will be conducted within each 
treatment group  independently so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group 
cannot influence missing value imputation  in another treatment group . For  each  imputation 
process, 25 datasets with imputations will be calculated. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the specified analysis. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single 
inference using SAS PROC M IANALYZE.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 67 For binary re sponses related to EASI and IGA, the binary response variables will be calculated  
based on the multiply imputed datasets that have been created. Because the MCMC algorithm  is 
based on the multivariate normal model, imputed values for IGA will not generally  be one of the 
discrete values used in IGA scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, to derive the binary IGA  
response variable, standard rounding rules will be applied to the imputed values. For example, if 
a patient has an IGA score imputed as 1.4 (and assuming a Baseline IGA score of 3), the  imputed 
value would be rounded down to 1, and the minimum change from Baseline of 2 would have 
been met. This patient would be considered a responder. 
For derivation of an EASI-75 response, no rounding will be performed. The imputed Week 16 
EASI value will be compared directly to the observed Baseline EASI value to determine whether a reduction of at least 75% was achieved. 
For derivation of the following Pruritus-NRS responses, no rounding will be performed. The 
imputed Pruritus -NRS value will be compared directly to the observed mean baseline Pruritus-
NRS value to determine whether the response was achieved:  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4- points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 4  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a 
≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 2  
• Percentage of patients with a Pruritus NRS of ≥4 points at Baseline who achieve a ≥4-point reduction from Baseline to Week 1  
Imputation of continuous data will parallel that of binary variables. The imputed values will be 
used for the following secondary endpoints: 
• Percentage change in Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score from Baseline to 
Week  16 
• Percentage change in EASI score from Baseline to Week 16  
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute IGA for the two treatment gro ups. The two 
seeds have been pre -specified by a random- number generator:  
• IGA: Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed = 671970387 
• IGA: Placebo Q2W : Seed = 1339715635 
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute Pruritus NRS for the two treatment groups. 
The tw o seeds have been pre-specified by a random- number generator:  
• NRS : Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed = 1461173528 
• NRS : Placebo Q2W : Seed = 1492214362 
A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute EASI  for the two treatment groups. Those 
2 random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: 
• EASI:  Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed=1015171075  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 68 • EASI:  Placebo Q2W : Seed=1806114500 
9.5. Sensitivity Analyses  
9.5.1. All Missing Values MCMC Multiple Imputation  
In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed values as collected for visits 
subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed 
using MCMC multiple imputation  for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0  or 1 and a ≥2-point 
improvement from Baseline at Week 16  and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75 
(EMA  co-primary endpoint) , EASI -90 at Week 16  and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥4 points, at 
Week s 1, 2, 4 and 16.  
9.5.2. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed values as collected for visits 
subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed 
using LOCF for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥ 2-point im provement from 
Baseline at Week  16 and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75 (EMA co -primary 
endpoint) , EASI -90 at Week 16 and Pruritus -NRS Improvement ≥ 4 points, at Week s 1, 2, 4 and 
16.  
9.5.3. Non-Response Impu tation  
In this  set of sensitivity analysis, for patients who receive topical  rescue medication ( per 
Section  6.3), receive systemic rescue medication , withdraw from the study due to lack of 
efficacy  and any other missing values, set to non-response subsequent to this time through 
Week  16 for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2- point reduction from Baseline to 
Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75, EASI-90 and Pr uritus -NRS 
Improvement ≥4 points, all at Week16.  
9.5.4. Tipping Point Analysis  
Assuming the primary analyses results of endpoints are statistically significant, in this set of 
sensitivity analysis, assumptions on missing data due to rescue medication and study 
discontinuation will be varied to investigate if there will be any tipping points. To assess the 
impact of rescue medication and missing data due to dropout, the r ates of response and non -
response (including rescue medication use and dropout) will be varied to assess the response 
rates that tip significant differences to non -significance. The primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 
1 and a ≥2- point improvement from Baseline  at Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: 
EASI -75 (EMA co -primary endpoint) , EASI -90 at Week 16  and Pruritus -NRS improvement 
≥4-points, at Week s 1, 2, 4 and 16 will be assessed using the tipping point analysis.  
More details about missing value imputation analysis will be described in the SAP. 
9.5.5. Subgroup Analyses  
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the following subgroups: 
Adolescents (Age 12 to <18 years) vs. Adults (Age ≥18 years), sex, race, baseline IGA score 
(3 or 4), region ( US, Europe, Rest of the World). Subgroup analysis will be conducted on the 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 69 primary endpoint of IGA (0,1), EASI -75, EASI-90 and percent of patients with pruritus 
improvement ≥4 points, all at Week 16.  
Sensitivity analyses will be addressed in a full statistical analysis plan.  
9.6. Multiplicity  Considerations 
The prespecified graphical multiple testing approach (Bretz, 2011) will be implemented to 
control the overall Type I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 for superiority tests for the 
hypotheses for the primary and major secondary endpoints. The graphical approach is a closed 
testing procedure; hence it strongly controls the family- wise error rate across all endpoints 
(Alosh, 2014).  The major secondary endpoints will be pre- specified in the SAP prior to first 
unblinded efficacy  analysis.  
FDA objectives:  
The graphical testing scheme will test IGA (0,1) first before proceeding to test the major  
secondary endpoints. Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelationships, Type I error allocation for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated 
propagation) will be pre -specified in the SAPs prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis. 
EMA objectives:  
The Week 16 endpoints of IGA (0,1) and EASI -75 represent a primary endpoint family. The 
graphical testing scheme will sequentially test IGA (0,1) first, followed by EASI -75 before 
proceeding to test the major secondary endpoints during induction period. Details of the specific 
graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelationships, Type I error allocation for 
the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre -specifi ed in the 
SAPs  prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis. A separate graphical approach may be employed 
for testing the maintenance period endpoints. 
9.7. PK Analysis  
Plasma concentration data will be tabulated and summarized (geometric mean, arithmetic mean, 
minimum, maximum, SD, and % coefficient of variation) by treatment group for each visit at 
which samples were taken.   
It is intended that data from this study will be combined with data from other studies to better 
characterize the PK of DRM06, as well as to explore the relationship between exposure and 
efficacy and/or safety outcomes. Further details on PK and PK/PD analyses will be provided in the PK/PD analysis plan. The results of these analyses will be described in a separate PK/PD 
report.  
9.8. Anti -Drug Antibody Data Analysis  
The ADA variables will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. Drug concentration data will be examined and the influence of ADAs on individual concentration- time profiles will be evaluated. 
Assessment of impact of ADA on safety and  efficacy may be provided. 
9.9. Immunogenicity Data Analysis 
Listings and appropriate summary statistics will be provided for immunogenicity data. 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 70 9.10. Exposure and Compliance  
The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by total 
number of days of exposure, total number of injections, number of missed injections, and 
number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An injection is considered the full set of injections specified by the protocol for a given treatment.  
A patient w ill be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of 
the expected number of injections while enrolled in the study. 
9.11. Adverse Events 
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset date on or after the date of 
the first injection of study drug. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, including the 
number of patients reporting an event, system organ class, preferred ter m, severity, relationship 
to study drug, and seriousness for the safety population. All serious AEs as well as AEs that led 
to study discontinuation will be listed by patient.  
Three sets of AE tabulations are anticipated, one for the initial period, one for the maintenance period, and one for the combined initial and maintenance period. The denominator used for the treatment period will correspond to the number of patients in the safety population.  
9.12. Other Safety Data 
Laboratory data will be presented in a b y patient listing. Any clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities will be captured as AEs. Changes from Baseline in safety laboratory values will be 
summarized by treatment group at each follow -up evaluation during the treatment period using 
descriptive statistics or frequency tables as applicable. Additionally, changes from Baseline in 
safety laboratory values will be summarized using shift tables according to normal ranges.  
Vital signs will be presented by treatment group as absolute values and changes from Baseline 
using descriptive statistics.  
Medical histories will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and presented in a by- patient 
listing. Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO-Drug dictionary. Concomitant medications will be summariz ed by treatment, drug class, and preferred term. Physical 
examination data will be presented in a by -patient listing. Growth monitoring of adolescents will 
be summarized.  
9.13. Sample -Size Determination  
For FDA:  
In the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non- response sensitivity analysis was 
approximately 34.7% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 7.7% for placebo. A sample size of 
96 for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 48 for placebo will  have more than 95% power to 
detect a statistically significant difference with a significance level  of .05. However, to ensure 
sufficient safety information is collected and to ensure sufficient responders for the M aintenance 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 71 Period, the sample size will be increased to  approximately  400 in total with a randomization ratio 
of 2:1 lebrikizumab:placebo.  
For EMA:  
In the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 
0 or 1 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non- response sensitivity analysis was 
approximately 34.7% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 7.7% for placebo, and the proportion of patients who achieved an EASI75 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non-response sensitivity analysis was approximately 48.0% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 
11.5% for placebo.  
A sample size of 96 for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W versus 48 for placebo will have more than 
95% power to detect a statistically significant difference with a significance level  of .0 5 for each 
of the co- primary endpoints, which imply and overall power of at least 90%. 
However, to ensure sufficient safety information is collected and to ensure sufficient responders for the Maintenance Period , the sample size will be increased to approximately  400 in total with 
a randomization ratio of 2:1 lebrikizumab:placebo.  
9.14. Interim Analyses  
The first database lock and unblinding will occur, and the interim analysis will be performed at 
the time (that is, a cut- off date) the last patient completes Week 16 or the early termination visit 
from Study AD04. This database lock will include all data collected by the cut -off date.  Only the 
induction treatment assignment will be unblinded at the time of this interim lock. Maintenance treatment assignment will r emain blinded. 
The second database lock and unblinding will occur, and the interim analysis including the 
maintenance period will be performed at the time (that is, a cut- off date) the last patient 
completes Week  52 or the early termination visit from Study DRM06 -AD04. This database lock 
will include all data collected by the cut- off date.   
The study will not be terminated early on the basis of efficacy following these interim analyses. 
A final database lock will the n be conducted after all patients have completed the follow-up 
period of Study DRM06 -AD04.  
Depending on the regulatory submission timeline, the second database lock and the final 
database lock maybe combined, that is, one final database lock will occur aft er all patients have 
either completed the follow -up period of Study DRM06 -AD04, or discontinued the Study early, 
or entered the long- term extension Study DRM06 -AD07.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 72 10. ADMINISTRATION  
10.1. Compliance with the Protocol  
The study shall be conducted as described in this protocol. All revisions to the protocol must be 
prepared by the Sponsor. The Investigator will not implement any deviation or change to the 
protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of 
an amendment, excep t where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patient s. 
Any significant deviation must be documented and submitted to the IRB/IEC, the Sponsor or 
designee, and, if required, Regulatory Authority(ies). Documentation of approval signed by the 
chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/EC(s) must be sent to the Sponsor and/or designee. 
10.2. Informed Consent Procedures  
The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will include all elements required by ICH/GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements and will adhere to G CP and to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The consent form will also include a statement that 
the Sponsor and regulatory authorities have direct access to patient records  and that the patient’s  
medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities . The ICF will also inform the patient that his/her personal study -related 
data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection law ; the ICF will 
describe the level of disclosure of data and seek appropriate consent from the patient for his/her data to be used in the manner described.  
Prior to the beg inning of the study, the Investigator will  have the IRB/IEC’s written opinion 
(approval/favorable ) of the written informed consent form and any other information to be 
provided to the patient s. 
The Investigator must provide the patient  or legally acceptable representative with a copy of the 
consent form and written information about the study in the language in which the patient is most 
proficient. The language must be non-technical and easily understood. The Investigator should 
allow time necessary for patient  or patient's legally acceptable representative to inquire about the 
details of the study, then informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the patient  or 
the patient 's legally acceptable representative, by the Investigator and /or by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion. The patient  or legally acceptable representative 
should receive a copy of the signed informed consent and any other written information provided 
to study patient s prior to patient 's participation in the study. 
The informed consent and any other information provided to patient s or the patient 's legally 
acceptable representative, should be revised whenever important new information becomes available that is relevant to the patient's consent, and should receive IRB/IEC approval/ favorable 
opinion prior to use. The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator should fully 
inform the patient  or the patient's legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the 
study and of any new information relevant to the patient 's willingness to continue participation in 
the study. This communicat ion to the patient should be documented in the source note.  
During a patient's participation in the study, any updates to the consent form or to the written information will be provided to the patient in writing . 
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 73 For patients considered to be minors accor ding to the national legislation in each country, the 
written consent of the parent or legal guardian must be obtained, as well as the assent of the 
minor according to his or her capacity to understand the information provided. Patients enrolled 
as minors who attain legal adulthood during the course of the study must consent in their own right at that time in order to continue participating.  
10.3. Data Protection and Confidentiality  
Study patients must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the patient who will be required to give consent for their data to be used as 
described in the informed consent.  
Patients must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality 
Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate 
IRB/IEC members, and  by inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant records, datasets 
or tissue samples that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant 
names or any  information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The Sponsor has processes in place to ensure data protection, information security and data 
integrity.  These processes include appropriate contingency plan(s) for appropria te and timely 
response in the event of a data security breach.  
10.4. Study Documentation and the eCRF 
This protocol is to be signed by the investigator responsible for the conduct of this study at the 
study site. A copy of the signed protocol signature page is to be provided to the Sponsor and retained in the study site’s Regulatory Binder.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study data is accurately  recorded on the 
eCRFs or other study data collection tools. All eCRF entries must be supported by the patient’s 
medical records or source notes. The Investigator must ensure that study observations and 
findings are legible and recorded accurately and completely.  
Original reports, traces and films must be reviewed, signed and dated , and retained by the 
Investigator for future reference.   
The Investigator is expected to promptly review all study data recorded in the patient’s source 
records. Completed eCRFs must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator or Sub-Investigator at the end of the study. Corrections to data entered into the eCRF will be 
handled through an electronic query. Corrections to patients’ medical or source records should be legible, initialed and dated. At the end of the study, an electronic copy of the investigator’s eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator. The Investigator is to retain this data. The 
Investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or correct ions on eC RFs. Refer to Sect ion 10.6 regarding 
retention requirements.  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 74 An Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for each patient treated 
with the study drug or entered as a control in the investigation. Data reported on the eCRFs that are derived from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the 
discrepancies must be explained.  
10.5. Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for the monitoring of the study. Study monitors will contact and visit the Investigators at regular intervals thro ughout the study to  verify adherence to 
the protocol, and assess the completeness, consistency , and accuracy of the data by comparing 
patient s’ medical records with entries in the eCRF.  
The study monitor must be allowed access to laboratory test reports a nd other patient records 
needed to verify the entries on the eCRF, provided patient  confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements. These records, and other relevant data, may also be reviewed by appropriate qualified personnel independent from the Sponsor or designee, who is 
appointed to audit the study. Patient  confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  
By agreeing to participate in this research study, the Investigators agree to co -operate with the 
study monitor to ensure that any problems detected during the monitoring visits are promptly resolved. 
10.6. Retention of Study Documentation  
The Investigator must retain study drug disposition records, copies of CRFs and all study- related 
source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
Institution procedures, or for the period specified by the Sponsor, whichever is longer. The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with the study. 
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator, IRB). Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor or designee. 
If the Investigator ca nnot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to 
store these in a secure archive facility outside the site so  they can be returned to t he Investigator 
in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the 
patient , appropriate copies should be made for stor age outside of the site.  
10.7. Publication Policy  
In accordance with the sponsor’s publication poli cy the results of this study will be submitted for 
publication by a peer-reviewed journal.

CONSENSUS CRITERIA F OR CHR ONIC ATOPIC 
DERMATITIS  
Atopic dermatitis: Diagnosis recommendations  
Patients with presumed atopic dermatitis should have their diagnosis based on the criteria 
summarized below. On occasion, skin biopsy specimens or other tests (such as serum 
immunoglobulin  E, potassium hydroxide preparation, patch testing, and/or genetic testing) may 
be helpful to rule out other or associated skin conditions.  
Level of Evidence: III Strength of Recommendation: C 
Essential features — must be present: 
• Pruritus  
• Eczema (acute,  subacute, chronic)  
• Typical morphology and age specific patterns* 
• Chronic or relapsing history 
*Patterns include:  
• Facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children 
• Current or previous flexural lesions in any age group 
• Sparing of the groin and axillary regions  
Important features — seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis: 
• Early age of onset  
• Atopy 
• Personal and/or family history  
• Immunoglobulin E reactivity  
• Xerosis  
Associated features — These clinical associations help to suggest the diagnosis of atopic 
dermatitis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting atopic dermatitis for 
research and epidemiologic studies:  
• Atypical vascular responses (eg facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch 
response)  
• Keratosis pil aris/ pityriasis alba/ hyperlinear palms/ icthyosis  
• Ocular/periorbital changes  
• Perifollicular accentuation/ lichenification/ prurigo lesions  
Study Protocol: DRM06- AD04 -A2/J2T-DM-KGAB- A2 Lebrikizumab 
Dermira, Inc.  FINAL 20May2020 Confidential  Page 83 Exclusionary conditions — It should be noted that a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis depends on 
excluding conditions,  such as:  
• Scabies  
• Seborrheic dermatitis  
• Contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic)  
• Icthyoses 
• Cutaneous T- cell lymphoma  
• Psoriasis  
• Photosensitivity dermatoses 
• Immune deficiency diseases  
• Erythroderma of other causes

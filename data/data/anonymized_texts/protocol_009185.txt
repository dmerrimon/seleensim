Amendment 4, 20 Dec 2021: Current Amendment  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Main Rationale for the Amendment  
The main rationale for this amendment is to offer currently enrolled participants and eligible 
participants who received the primary coronavirus disease  2019 (COVID -19) vaccination series 
(ie, Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen) outside the study to receive a booster dose.  This change is being 
made in accordance with the recent US CDC guidance recommending a COVID -19 booster dose 
in people aged ≥  18 years who are moderately and severely immunocompromised  which 
includes solid organ transplant (SOT) recipient s. 
In addition, this amendment will modify the time interval requirement between informed consent 
and date of tran splant from 6 months to 90 days to provide an opportunity for sites to enroll 
transplant recipients who are clinically eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine outside of the 
study.  
The Summary of Changes table provided below describes the major changes ma de in 
Amendment 4 relative to Protocol Amendment 3, including the sections modified and the 
corresponding rationales. The synopsis of Amendment 4 has been modified to correspond to 
changes in the body of the protocol.

Overall Study Design : 
This is a Phase 3b, open -label study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity 
of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in SOT recipients and healthy controls. Adult kidney and 
liver transplant recipients and healthy control participants wh o are at least 18 years of age will 
be enrolled.  
Approximately 240 adult participants (220 previously vaccinated or unvaccinated who have had 
a kidney or liver transplant and 20  unvaccinated healthy adults) will be enrolled.  At least 50 
SOT  recipients  who completed primary vaccination series with a non-Moderna COVID -19 
vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) (outside of the mRNA -1273 -P304 study ) 
will be enrolled  in Part B . 
In Part A, all  SOT recipients who were unvaccinated prior to enrollment will receive 2 doses of 
100 µg of mRNA -1273 28 days apart (window of -3/+7 days for the second dose)  (Group  A1). 
The SOT recipients will be offered the opportunity to receive a third primary dose of  mRNA -
1273 at Day  85 (window of -3/+7 days for the third dose)  as per the EUA Fact Sheet available 
at the time of protocol finalization  (Group  A2). All healthy participants will receive 2 doses of 
100 µg of mRNA -1273 28 days apart (window of -3/+7 days for  the second dose)  (Group  A5). 
The SOT recipients who were previously vaccinated with 2 doses of Moderna COVID -19 
vaccine under the EUA prior to enrollment will receive dose 3 on Day 1  (Group  A3). These 
participants will be referred to as “previously vaccin ated” throughout this document.  Under 
Amendment #4, unvaccinated SOT participants who will be enrolled will be given 3 100 µg 
doses in Part A then proceed to Part B to receive a 100 µg booster dose. Under Amendment #4, 
SOT participants previously vaccinate d with 2 doses of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine outside of 
the study who will be enrolled will receive a third 100 µg dose in Part A then proceed to Part B 
to receive a 100 µg BD.

For Part A, t he primary immunogenicity goal of the study is to evaluate serum antibody (Ab) 
responses obtained 28 days after the  third dose (Day 113 for unvaccinated SOT participants who 
receive the 3 -dose regimen and Day 29 for previously vaccinated SOT participants  ) of mRNA -
1273 in SOT recipients. Using the Ab threshold established from Study P301 (if available at the 
time of da tabase lock), an additional exploratory analysis will be performed by measuring the 
proportion of participants with a serum Ab level at Day 57 for unvaccinated participants of 2 -
dose regimen), Day 113 (unvaccinated SOT recipients of the 3 -dose regimen), an d Day 29 
(previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose  3) greater than or equal to the Ab 
threshold of protection against COVID -19, with a 2 sided 95% CI using the Clopper Pearson 
method by cohort arm.  
This study will monitor participants for a to tal of up to  12 months (12 mo nths after  the last dose 
of the vaccine for participants not receiving a BD or 6 months after their BD). The SOT 
participants who do not consent to receive a third dose of mRNA -1273  and healthy adult 
participants  will be monito red for a total of 12 months after their second dose. Safety 
assessments will include solicited local and systemic adverse reactions (ARs) for 7 days after 
each dose; unsolicited AEs for 28 days after each dose; MAAEs; SAEs; AESIs; AEs leading to 
discontin uation from dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal) from dose 1 through the 
end of study; concomitant medications associated with AEs, MAAEs, or COVID -19 or 
SARS -CoV -2 infection; participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms; biopsy -proven organ 
rejec tion; safety laboratory assessments; vital sign measurements; and physical examination 
findings as presented in the applicable schedule of events (SoE).  
From all unvaccinated SOT participants who receive 3 doses of mRNA -1273  (Group  A2), blood 
samples will be collected at baseline (Day 1), Day 29 (28 days after dose 1), Day 57 (28 days 
after dose 2), Day  85 (dose  3), Day 113 ( 28 days after dose 3), Day 265 (6 months after dose 3), 
and Day 450 (12  months after dose 3).  
From unvaccinated participants who recei ve 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (healthy adults [Group  A5] 
and SOT recipients who decline to receive a third dose  [Group  A1]), blood samples will be

From previously vaccinated SOT participants who receive dose 3 of mRNA -1273  (Group  A3), 
blood samples will be collected at pre -dose 3 (Day 1), Day  29 (28  days after dose 3), Day 180 
(6 months after dose 3), and Day  365 (12  months after dose 3) for assessment of the following 
endpoints and analytes:  
• Measurement of SARS -CoV -2-specific bAb and nAb responses  
• Development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (nucleocapsid protein), 
which will signify infection  with SARS -CoV -2. Participants who tested positive for 
Ab against SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid protein at baseline can continue in the 
study.  
From unvaccinated participants, blood samples for cell -mediated immunity (CMI) studies will 
also be collected at Day  1, Day 36, and Day 92 (SOT recipients receiving 3 doses  [Group  A2]) 
from a subset of up to 50  SOT participants, as well as, from 20  healthy controls (Group  A5) 
(Day 1 and Day 36), and from a subset of at least 50 previously vaccinated SOT recipients 
(Group   A3) at Day 1 and Day 8 for exploratory assessments to characterize T - and B -cell 
responses to vaccine.  
The NP swab samples obtained at illness visits will be used as sources of SARS -CoV -2 for 
genetic sequencing.  
SARS -CoV -2 bAb against the nonvaccin e antigen (nucleocapsid protein) will also be collected 
at Illness and Convalescent visits.  
The number of cases of COVID -19 will be assessed throughout the study. Once a participant is 
identified as a case of COVID -19, a convalescent visit will be schedule d approximately 28 days 
after the confirmed diagnosis for a clinical evaluation and immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
For unvaccinated SOT recipients  (Group  A1 and Group  A2), laboratory assessments for safety 
related to kidney function for ki dney SOT recipients (serum creatinine, urine protein, and 
UPCR) and liver function for liver SOT recipients (ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin) will be 
monitored on Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, Day 36, and Day 57 for SOT recipients who receive 2  doses 
only (Group  A1) and on additional Day 85, Day 92, and Day 113 for SOT recipients who receive 
3 doses  (Group  A2). 
For previously vaccinated SOT recipients  (Group  A3), laboratory assessments for safety will be 
monitored on Day 1 (dose  3), Day 8, and Day 29.

Part B – Booster Phase  
Part B is designed to offer participants in Part A, who are at least 4  months from the last dose, 
the option to receive  a BD ( 100 µg) of the prototype mRNA -1273  vaccine  (Group  B2, 
Group  B3, and Group  B5). Part B is also designed to enroll SOT partici pants who completed 
primary vaccination series  with mRNA  or non -mRNA  COVID -19 vaccine  under the EUA  who 
are at least 4  months from last dose . At least 50 SOT  recipients  who completed primary 
vaccination series with a non -Moderna COVID -19 vaccine under the EUA (outside of the 
mRNA -1273 -P304 study) will be enrolled in Part  B. In case a variant of concern emerges and 
available data show a decreased immune response after vaccination with the  prototype 100 µg 
BD, the Part B Booster Phase may test or replace the prototype 100 µg BD with a variant -
specific mRNA -1273 vaccine (ie , Omicron -specific or mRNA -1273.529 ).

Study Periods  
There will be 3 study periods: a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Follow -up Period.  
For unvaccinated participants (SOT and healthy) who receive the 2 -dose vaccine regimen  
in Part A  (Group  A1 and Group A5 ): 
The study comprises 8 scheduled visits, including a screening visit and 7 scheduled clinic visits. 
Electronic diary (eDiary) recording  of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity will occur on 
the day of each injection and for 6 days following injection. Safety follow -up via an eDiary 
questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 71 to Day 183 and again from Day  223 
to Day 36 3. Additional safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 
4 weeks from Day 85 to Day 197 and again from Day 237 to Day 377.  If the last dose is delayed, 
additional safety calls every 4 weeks should be scheduled when the gap between  the safety call

(eCRFs) should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
Safet y Oversight:  
The contract research organization’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the 
individual study site investigator(s) will monitor safety throughout the study.  
An independent safety review committee (SRC) consisting of transplant nephrologist(s) and 
hepatologist(s) not involved in the conduct of the study will monitor and adjudicate for events 
of organ transplant rejection starting after the first dose on Day 1 and throughout the study 
period. The SRC will operate under the rules o f an approved charter that will be written and 
reviewed at the organizational meeting of the SRC. Details regarding the SRC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
An independent cardiac event  adjudication committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and adult 
cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they 
meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria of “probable” or “confirmed” 
even ts, and to assess severity ( Gargano et al 2021 ). Any cases that the CEAC assesses as 
representing probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the 
Sponsor, which will then make a final decision on whether to suspend furthe r enrollment and/or 
study dosing based on an assessment of the overall potential risk to study participants or 
potential study participants.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizationa l meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
In addition, an Internal Safety Team (IST) will be created specifically to review safety and 
reactogenicity data after:  
• At least 10 SOT recipients have received their third dose of study vaccine 
(Group  A2 and Group A3 ) and have at least 7 days of reactogenicity data  
• At least 55 SOT recipients have received their third dose of study vaccine  
(Group  A2 and Group A 3), unless a safety event requires earlier review  
• Any other ad hoc safety concerns based on ongoing safety surveillance  
The IST will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at 
the organizational meetin g of the IST. Details regarding the IST composition, responsibilities, 
procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.

will be the only source documents allowed for solicited local or systemic ARs. In Part A, t he 
eDiary will also be used every 4 weeks to capture the occurrence of AE s, MAAEs, SAEs, AESIs, 
or AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal) as 
follows:  
• Starting at Day 71 through Day 183 and again starting at Day 223 through Day 363 for 
unvaccinated SOT and healthy participants of 2 vac cine doses  (Group  A1 and Group 
A5), 
• Starting at Day 127 through Day 239 and again starting at Day 279 through Day 419 for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients of 3 vaccine doses  (Group  A2), and  
• Starting at Day 43 through Day 155 and again starting at Day  194 throug h Day 306 for 
previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 (Group  A3). 
In Part A, safety telephone calls will be used every 4 weeks to collect information as 
specified in the applicable SoE about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs (including biopsy -proven  
organ rejection), SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study 
participation (withdrawal), concomitant medications associated with those events, and any 
nonstudy vaccinations (Section 7.5.8). In addition, study personnel will colle ct information 
on known participant close contact exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -
CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms:  
• From Day 85 through Day 197 and again from Day  237 through Day 377 for 
unvaccinated SOT an d healthy participants of 2 vaccine doses  (Group  A1 and Group 
A5); 
• From Day 141 through Day 253 and again starting at Day 293 through Day 433 for

concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vaccinations (Section 
7.5.8) . 
All safety laboratory assessments will be conducted at laboratories local to the study sites. To 
help monitor for potential event of organ transplant rejection in the SOT recipients, safety 
laboratory assessments will be performed, including assessments related to kidney and liver 
function (eg, serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR for kidney SOT recipients; and ALT, 
AST, A LP, and bilirubin for liver SOT recipients) at prespecified study visits. After Day 57 
(unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 2 vaccine doses  [Group  A1]) or after Day 113 
(unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 3 vaccine doses  [Group  A2]) or after Day 2 9 
(previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 [Group  A3] or SOT recipients who 
completed the primary vaccination series who receive  BD [Group  B4]), the investigator will 
review standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to kidney and live r function (as 
applicable), and report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or confirmed events of organ 
transplant rejection until the end of study.  
A confirmed diagnosis of organ transplant rejection will be based on histologic assessment or 
tissue b iopsy. The investigator must review results of safety laboratory assessments as soon as 
they are available. The schedule of sampling for safety laboratory assessments is presented in 
the applicable SoE.  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and dia stolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points 
indicated in the a pplicable SoE. At dosing visits, vital sign measurements will be collected once 
before injection and at least 30 minutes after injection (before participants are discharged from 
the study site).  
Physical examinations will be conducted according to the appl icable SoE. A full physical 
examination will be performed at Day 1 and symptom -directed physical examinations will be 
performed at other time points.  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the time poi nts indicated in 
the applicable SoE. The following analytes will be measured:  
• Serum nAb level against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by pseudovirus and/or live 
virus neutralization assays

binding assay specific to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein  
Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 Infection  
Study participants will have NP samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing by RT -PCR at time 
points specified in the applicable SoE. A study illness visit or a consultat ion will be arranged 
within 72 hours or as soon as possible to collect an NP or nasal swab sample (NP is preferred) 
to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR if a participant experiences any of the 
following:  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infect ion as defined by the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention  
• Close contact exposure to an individual confirmed to be infected with SARS -CoV -
2 
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection  
If the participant had known close contact exposure to COVID -19 (eg,  close contact exposure 
to someone with confirmed COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure form.  
If scheduled, the study illness visit may collect additional clinical information at the 
investigator’s discretion, including but not limited to  medical history, physical examination, 
blood sampling for clinical laboratory testing, and nasal, saliva, and/or NP swab sampling for 
viral PCR (including multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses, including SARS -CoV -2) to evaluate 
the severity of the clinica l case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. During this visit, 
a blood sample will also be collected for immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2. All findings 
will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection, t he investigator will notify the 
participant and the participant’s primary care physician of the diagnosis. If the study participant 
does not have a primary care physician, the investigator will assist them in obtaining one. The 
participant will also be ins tructed on infection prevention measures consistent with local public 
health guidance.  
Any confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection occurring in participants will be captured 
as an MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severi ty, 
seriousness, and outcome. Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 
28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, an NP swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood 
sample will be collected for potential immunologic assessment o f SARS -CoV -2 infection.

material from NP swab samples obtained at illness visits. Any SARS -CoV -2 genetic sequencing 
will be performed on t he same samples.  
In Part A, c ellular  immune response (eg, markers of CMI, T -cells, and B -cells) will be assessed 
on Day 1 before vaccination and at Days 36 and Day 92 in a subset of up to 50  unvaccinated 
participants who receive 3  doses of vaccine in the S OT group (kidney or liver)  (Group  A2); 
from 20  unvaccinated healthy study participants (Group  A5) (Day  1 before vaccination and 
Day 36); and from a subset of at least 50 previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive 
dose 3 (Group  A3) (Day 1 before vacci nation and Day  8). In Part B Booster Phase, CMI will 
also be assessed on BD -D1 before vaccination and BD-D8 from a ll participants in Part B.  In 
Part B Booster Phase, blood sample will be collected for future biomarker analysis.  
Statistical Methods:  
Sample  Size:  
The planned sample size of approximately 240 participants (220 unvaccinated or previously 
vaccinated participants who have had a kidney or liver transplant and 20 unvaccinated healthy 
participants) who receive 2 -dose regimen or 3 -dose regimen of 100  µg of mRNA -1273 , or 
100 µg BD regimen  are expected to provide useful estimates of Ab response at Day 29 for 
previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 in Part A , Day 113 for unvaccinated 
SOT recipients who receive the 3 -dose regimen,  at Day 57 for unvaccinated participants  who 
receive the 2 -dose regimen , and at BD -D29 (participants who receive a BD)  (primary 
endpoints), respectively, for comparison to results from Study P301 (if available at the time of

1.1. Study Rationale  
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common 
cold to more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe 
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted 
between animals and people. An outbreak of the CoV disease 2019 (COVID -19) caused by SARS 
coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has 
spread throughout China and to over 215 other c ountries, territories, and areas including the United 
States ( WHO 2020a ). On 11 Mar 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared 
COVID -19 a pandemic. As of 26 Mar 2021, the WHO dashboard ( WHO 2020b ) reported there 
have been 2,744,543 COVID -19 deaths worldwide and more than 500,000 deaths in the United 
States. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have reported that the highest 
risk of disease burden is in older adults (≥ 65 years old) and in people of any age who have seri ous 
underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious 
heart conditions, severe obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, and liver 
disease, and in those who are immunocompromised ( CDC 2020 a). 
Immunocompromised populations, such as individuals who are solid organ transplant (SOT) 
recipients, are at especially high risk for increased complications of COVID -19 because of their 
associated co -morbidities and chronic immunosuppression. A recent m eta-analysis of 215 studies 
assessing clinical outcomes of COVID -19 in SOT recipients (kidney, liver, heart, and lung) 
internationally showed an overall mortality rate of 18.6% (Raja et al 2020). Initial results on the 
clinical outcomes of COVID -19 estimat ed a high mortality rate ranging between 13% and 39% in 
kidney transplant recipients ( Azzi et al 2020  [patients in the US]; Cravedi et al 2020 [patients in 
the US, Italy, and Spain]; Lubetzky et al 2020 [patients in the US]; Mehta et al 2020 [patients in 
the US]; Nair et al 2020  [patients in the US]; Pereira et al 2020 [patients in the US]) and 12% in 
European liver transplant recipients ( Bechetti et al 2020 ). In a recent prospective cohort study, 
(Walsh et al 2020 ) a low proportion (17%) of SOT recipients mounted a positive antibody response 
to the first dose of SARS -CoV -2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, with those who receive 
anti-metabolite maintenance immunosuppression less likely to respond ( Boyarsky et al 2021a ). In 
the published follow -up study ( Boyars ky et al 2021b ), antibody response was assessed after the 
second dose. Overall, of the 658 participants, 98 (15%) had measurable antibody response after 
dose 1 and dose 2; 301 (46%) had no antibody response after dose 1 or dose 2; and 259 (39%) had 
no anti body response after dose 1 but had subsequent antibody response after dose 2. In addition, 
recent data based on post -Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) experience show that SOT 
recipients’ immune response to mRNA -based vaccination has been shown to be subst antially 
lower than what has been reported in the general population with antibody responses detectable in 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 59 only 30 -60% after 2 doses ( Benotmane et al 2021 ; Boyarsky et al 2021b , Grupper et al 2021 ; 
Marinaki et al 2021 ). 
A more recent small case series eval uated the antibody responses and vaccine reactions in 30  SOT 
recipients who had suboptimal response to standard vaccination (Moderna or Pfizer COVID -19 
vaccine) and subsequently received a third dose of the vaccine (either Janssen, Moderna, or Pfizer 
COVID -19 vaccine), the investigators observed that of the 6  patients with low -positive antibody 
titers before the third dose, all had high -positive antibody titers after the third dose. In contrast, of 
the 24 patients with negative antibody titers before the th ird dose, only 6 (25%) had high -positive 
antibody titers after the third dose. Two (8%) had low -positive antibody titers, and 16 (67%) 
remained negative ( Werbel et al 2021 ). 
In addition, a recently published article described a double -blind, randomized, co ntrolled trial of a 
third dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine (Moderna) as compared with placebo ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; Hall et 
al 2021 ). The results demonstrated that a third dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine in transplant recipients 
elicited a substantially higher immune response than placebo, as determined in the analysis of both 
primary and secondary trial endpoints. The third dose was considered safe when risk versus benefit 
was considered.  
Interim data are available from an ongoing Moderna Phase 2 study, mRNA -1273 -P201 (Study 
P201) where  healthy a dult participants in Study mRNA -1273 -P201 received 2 doses of either 
50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA -1273 and were administered a 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 6 to 
8 months after the second dose. Participants in mRNA -1273 -P201 who received the booster dose 
(BD), demonstrated enhanced immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 compared to pre -boost levels 
and met the noninferiority criteria stipulated in the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance 
on EUA for Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. Available data also  show that heterologous or mixed 
series of COVID -19 vaccine induced high immune response in the adult population  (Atmar et al 
2021 ). Additionally, no new safety signals emerged upon administration of the BD in Study P201. 
Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -1273 is favorable, 
particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of the Delta variant. 
Providing the option for a BD to all eligible participants currently enrolled in the study as well  as 
enrolling eligible SOT recipients who completed primary vaccination series under EUA is 
expected to generate valuable homologous and heterologous booster data in the 
immunocompro mised  population.  
The study vaccine, mRNA -1273, is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity study in an adult population at high risk of COVID -19 disease (Study P301). 
Success criteria for early efficacy were met at first interim analysis based on 95 adjudicated cases 
with a vaccine effica cy of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p -value < 0.0001). However, 
immunocompromised individuals were excluded from this study. The current study aims to

Confidential   Page 60 evaluate the antibody (Ab) responses following the second or third dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine 
among adult recipients of kidney or liver transplants. The data are expected to provide clinical 
information whether this population of immunocompromised participants are able to mount an 
antibody response following vaccination compared with adult participant s with normal immune 
function.  
1.2. Background and Overview  
The Sponsor has developed a rapid -response, proprietary vaccine platform based on a messenger 
RNA (mRNA) delivery system. The platform is based on the principle and observations that cells 
in vivo can take up mRNA, translate it, and then display protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. 
The delivered mRNA does not enter the cellular nucleus or interact with the genome, is 
nonreplicating, and is expressed transiently. Messenger RNA vaccines have been  used to induce 
immune responses against infectious pathogens such as SARS -CoV -2 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), cytomegalovirus ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus 
type 3 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), Zika virus ( NCT 04917861 ), and influenza virus ( NCT0307 6385  and 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
The Sponsor is using its mRNA -based platform to develop a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
encapsulated mRNA -based vaccine against SARS -CoV -2 (mRNA -1273). mRNA -1273 encodes 
the full -length spike (S) protein of SARS -CoV -2, modified with  2 proline substitutions to stabilize 
the S protein in a prefusion conformation (S2P). The CoV S protein mediates attachment and entry 
of the virus into host cells (by fusion), making it a primary target for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) 
that prevent infe ction ( Johnson et al 2016 ; Wang et al 2015 ; Wang et al 2018 ; Chen et al 2017 ; 
Corti et al 2015 ; Yu et al 2015; Kim et al 2019 ; Widjaja et al 2019 ; Corbett et al 2020a ; Ju et al 
2020 ; Robbiani et al 2020 ). It has been confirmed that the stabilized SARS -CoV -2 S2P expresses 
well and is in the prefusion conformation ( Wrapp et al 2020 ). More details on mRNA -1273 and 
its variants are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
The development of the mRNA -1273 vaccine is being accelerated to address the current 
SARS -CoV -2 outbreak as a result of the uniquely rapid and scalable manufacturing process for 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine.  
1.2.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
Nonclinical pharmacology, biodistribution, and toxicology studies have been completed using 
mRNA -1273 or other mRNA vaccines that encode various antigens developed with the Sponsor’s 
mRNA‑based platform using SM‑102 -containing LNPs. Data from the nonclinic al testing program 
support the clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA -1273 at doses up to 100 µg administered twice, 
intramuscularly (IM), 28 days apart.

• Results from the GLP developmental and reproductive toxicity study showed that 
administration of a 100 µg dose of mRNA -1273 to Sprague Dawley rats did not result 
in any adverse effects on dams, fetuses, or pups and demonstrated a strong transfer of 
SARS -CoV -2 S2P antibodies from dam to fetus and from dam to pup. Results from 
this study support the safety of mRNA -1273 for trials in pregnant women.  
In support of the development of mRNA -1273 for prophylaxis against SARS -CoV -2 infection, 
nonclinical immunogenicity, biodistribution, and safety studies have been completed with similar 
mRNA -based vaccines formulated in LNPs containing SM -102 (heptadecane -9-yl 
8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6 -oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate), the novel proprietary lipid 
used in the mRNA -1273 LNP formulation.  
A detailed review of nonclinical experience with mRNA -1273 vaccine is provided in the IB along 
with nonclinical experience with modified mRNA -1273 vaccines.  
1.2.2.  Clinical Studies  
The clinical development of mRNA -1273 vaccines to support its use in the adult population  
consists of 5 ongoing clinical trials being conducted in the U S: 
• Phase 1, open -label, dose ranging studies (Study 20 -0003; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; Study 21 -0002, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) sponsored by  the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases  
• Phase 2a, randomized,  observer -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -confirmation study ( Study 
mRNA -1273 -P201;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])

Confidential   Page 62 • Phase 3 randomized, stratified, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study  (Study mRNA -1273 -
P301; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the vaccine  
• Phase 3b, open -label study (Study mRNA -1273 -P304, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of the vaccine in adult SOT recipients and healthy controls.  
In addition, 2 ongoing trials are being conducted in the pediatric population:  
• Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo -controlled safety and imm unogenicity study of mRNA -
1273 in children 12 to less than 18 years of age (Study mRNA -1273 -P203; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
• Phase 2/3, study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 in children less 
than 12 years of age (mRNA -1273 -P204; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
In addition, Study mRNA -1273 -P205 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is an open -label, Phase 2/3  study with 
multiple parts to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of boosters for SARS -CoV -2 variants.  
The safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 was evaluated in Phase 1 (Division o f 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [DMID] 20 -0003) and Phase 2 (mRNA -1273 -P201) studies, 
which were important in selecting and confirming the dose of the vaccine used in the pivotal 
Phase  3 study.  
In Study 20 -0003 (Phase 1), 2 doses of 100 µg or higher  generated the highest titers of nAb or 
binding antibody (bAb) with an acceptable safety profile, and this observation was the basis for 
selecting the 100 -μg dose for use in the pivotal Phase 3 study. Importantly, the Ab levels after 
2 doses of mRNA -1273 e xceeded those from a pool of convalescent sera. Neutralizing activity 
was observed for the 100 µg mRNA -1273 dose as of Day 36 and was higher than that of the 
convalescent sera control group, and the median titers remained in the same range as the median 
titer in the convalescent sera control group at Day 119 across the age strata. In this study, the 
majority of the solicited adverse reactions (ARs) were mild or moderate. A higher incidence of 
severe solicited ARs was observed with the 250 µ dose (in the 18 to 55 -year age cohort) compared 
with the lower doses (25 µg, 50 µg, and 100 µg); thus, the 250 -μg mRNA -1273 dose was not 
evaluated in participants ≥ 56 years of age. One severe unsolicited adverse event (AE) related to 
mRNA -1273 and 1 severe clinically mea ningful elevation in serum lipase related to mRNA -1273 
were also observed with the 250 µg dose (in the 18 to 55 -year age cohort). Additionally, in Study 
20-0003, T helper cell 1 (Th1) directed CD4+ T -cells were observed to be induced across age 
groups, with limited indication of a Th2 -directed response, and similar responses were observed 
among all age groups for the 100 -μg dose. The predominance of a Th1 directed T -cell profile helps 
to mitigate concern of the risk of enhanced disease associated with Th 2 driven pathophysiology.  
mRNA -1273 -P201 (Study P201) is an ongoing Phase 2a, safety, reactogenicity, and 
immunogenicity study in healthy adults that provided confirmation of the immunogenicity of both

Confidential   Page 63 the 100  µg and 50  µg doses. The study was designed as a randomized, observer -blind, placebo -
controlled dose -confirmation study (Part A). Two mRNA -1273 dose levels, 50 µg and 100  µg, and 
placebo were evaluated in 2 age cohorts: Cohort  1 enrolled participants ≥ 18 to <  55 years old 
(300 participants), and Cohor t 2 enrolled participants ≥  55 years old (300  participants). A total of 
600 participants received either mRNA -1273 or placebo according to a 1:1:1  randomization ratio,  
ie, within each age cohort, 100  participants each received mRNA -1273 50 µg, mRNA -1273 
100 µg, or placebo.  
An amendment to the Study 201 protocol adapted the study design to include open -label 
interventional phases (Part B and Part C). Part B allowed unblinding of participants and offered 
2 injections of mRNA -1273 in an open -label manner, 28 d ays apart, to all participants who 
received placebo in Part A. Part B also offered a single BD of mRNA -1273 (50 µg) to participants 
who received 1 or 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (50 µg or 100 µg) in Part A. Part C was prompted by 
the need to proactively prepare f or vaccination strategies that might induce broader protection, 
including against emerging variants of SARS -CoV -2 such as B.1.351. Part C enrolled participants 
from Study 301 who received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 100 µg at least 6 months prior. Part C 
particip ants received a single injection of mRNA -1273.351 (20 µg or 50 µg) or mRNA -1273.351 
mixture (50 µg total – 25 µg of mRNA -1273 and 25 µg of mRNA -1273.351). mRNA -1273 
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in the participant population enrolled in this st udy at 
both dose levels and both age cohorts, as observed through 6 months after the second injection. 
Vaccination with mRNA -1273 in Study 201 resulted in robust immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 
in participants 18 years and older at both dose levels, and per sistence of immune response was 
observed up to 6 months after the second injection in Part A of the study. In Part A of Study 201, 
the time course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb and nAb) responses to mRNA -1273 was 
similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose  levels at each postbaseline time point (Days 29, 43, 57, 
and 209), although the 100 µg dose group had numerically greater responses (and was the dose 
selected for the pivotal Phase 3 efficacy study). In Part B of Study 201, administration of a 50 µg 
BD of mRNA -1273 6 months or more after the primary series improved the immune responses to 
1.7-fold the peak achieved after the primary vaccination series in the current mRNA -1273 -P301 
study, where efficacy of mRNA -1273 against COVID -19 was demonstrated. Safety  data based on 
preliminary results for 50 µg BDs of mRNA -1273 (selected participants in Part B) or mRNA -
1273.351 (Part C Cohort 1) are available. Percentages of participants with solicited local and 
systemic AEs were similar in the group who received mRNA -1273.351 as a BD compared to those 
who received mRNA -1273 vaccine as a BD. The majority of solicited local and systemic AE s 
were mild ( Grade 1) or moderate ( Grade 2). The frequency of any Grade 3 solicited local or 
systemic AE was 15% (3 of 20 participants) after the BD of mRNA -1273 and 10.5% (2 of 19 
participants) after the BD of mRNA -1273.351. There were no Grade 4 solicite d local or systemic 
AEs. The most common solicited local AE was injection site pain after injection in both groups

Confidential   Page 64 (68.4% for the mRNA -1273.351 vaccine and 90.0% for the mRNA -1273 vaccine). The most 
common solicited systemic AEs after the BD of the mRNA -1273.351 vaccine were fatigue 
(36.8%), headache (36.8%), myalgia (31.6%), and arthralgia (21.1%). The most common solicited 
systemic AEs after the BD of the mRNA -1273 vaccine were fatigue (70.0%), headache (55.0%), 
arthralgia (50.0%), and myalgia (45.0%). Fe ver was reported after the BD of mRNA -1273 in 3 of 
20 participants (15%) but not after the booster dose of mRNA -1273.351 (0 of 19 participants). 
There were no SAEs reported in this study.  
Interim results from the mRNA -1273 -P205 study are avai lable. Neutral izing antibodies against 
Omicron were assessed in a pseudovirus neutralization titer (ID50) (PsVNT)  assay conducted at 
laboratories established by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ Vaccine 
Research Center and Duke University Medica l Center  - Data includes sera from 20 booster 
recipients each of mRNA -1273 at the 50 µg and 100 µg dose levels, multivalent candidate mRNA -
1273.211 at the 50 µg and 100 µg dose levels, and multivalent candidate mRNA -1273.213 at the 
100 µg dose level.  
All g roups had low neutralizing antibody levels in the Omicron PsVNT assay prior to boosting. 
At Day 29 post boost, the authorized 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased neutralizing 
geometric mean titers (GMT) against Omicron to 850, which is approximately 37 -fold higher than 
pre-boost levels. At Day 29 post boost, the 100 µg dose booster of mRNA -1273 increased 
neutralizing GMT to 2228, which is approximately 83 -fold higher than pre -boost levels. The 
multivalent candidates boosted Omicron specific neutralizing an tibody levels to similarly high 
levels at both the 50 µg and 100 µg levels.  
Safety and tolerability data from the Phase 2/3 study of the 100 µg booster dose of mRNA -1273 
(N = 305) show that a  100 µg booster dose of mRNA -1273 was generally safe and well tolerated. 
The frequency and nature of solicited systemic and local AEs 7 days after receiving a booster were 
generally comparable to those seen after the 2-dose primary series. There was a tren d toward more 
frequent local and systemic solicited ARs following the 100 µg booster dose relative to the 
authorized 50 µg booster dose of mRNA -1273.  
Currently, a Phase 3 pivotal, randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind clinical study 
(mRNA -1273 -P301; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; Study P301) is being conducted in participants 18 years of 
age and older who were at increased risk of COVID -19 disease. In addition, prespecified cohorts 
of participants who were either ≥ 65 years of age or 18 to < 65 years of age with com orbid medical 
conditions were included. At the time of the 25 Nov 2020 data snapshot (which was the basis for 
the EUA), a total of 30,351 participants were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1 -122 days) 
for the development of COVID -19 disease ( Modern a mRNA -1273 I B). Success criteria for early 
efficacy were met at the first interim analysis based on 95 adjudicated cases with a vaccine efficacy

Confidential   Page 65 of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p value < 0.0001). Study P301 is expected to provide 
immunogenicity data where an Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 will be estimated.  
In Study P301, solicited ARs were reported more frequently among vaccine participants than 
placebo participants. The most frequently reported ARs after any dose in the vaccine gro up were 
pain at the injection site (92.0% any grade; 6.1% grade ≥ 3), fatigue (70% any grade; 10.1% 
grade  ≥ 3), headache (64.7% any grade; 5.7% grade ≥ 3), myalgia (61.5% any grade; 9.1% 
grade  ≥ 3), and chills (45.4% any grade; 1.4% grade ≥ 3). The majorit y of local and systemic ARs 
had a median duration of 1 to 3 days. Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some ARs in 
younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, 
arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, a nd fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in 
those aged 65 years and above. Grade 3 solicited local ARs were more frequently reported after 
dose 2 than after dose 1. In the participants who received the vaccine, solicited systemic ARs were 
reported numerically more frequently by vaccine participants after dose 2 than after dose 1. 
Grade  3 systemic ARs (fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) were reported more frequently 
after dose 2 than after dose 1.  
Unsolicited AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported at generally similar rates in 
participants who received mRNA -1273 and placebo from the first dose until the last observation. 
Unsolicited AEs that occurred in ≥ 1% of study participants who received mRNA -1273 and at a 
rate at le ast 1.5 -fold higher rate than placebo were lymphadenopathy related events (1.1% of versus 
0.6%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are similar to the axillary swelling/tenderness in the 
injected arm reported as solicited ARs. Hypersensitivity AEs were repo rted in 1.5% of vaccine 
recipients and 1.1% of placebo recipients. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included 
injection site rash and injection site urticaria, which are likely related to vaccination. There have 
been no cases of severe hypersens itivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after 
vaccination in the trial to date. Delayed injection site reactions that began >7 days after vaccination 
were reported in 1.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.4% of placebo recipients. Delayed injecti on site 
reactions included pain, erythema, and swelling and are likely related to vaccination.  
There were 3 reports of Bell’s palsy in the mRNA -1273 vaccine group (one of which was an SAE), 
which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group, which occurred 
17 days after vaccination. The currently available information on Bell’s palsy is insufficient to 
determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were 2 SAEs of facial swelling in vaccine 
recipients with a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of swelling was reported 
1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to vaccination. There was 
1 SAE of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior history of severe  headache 
and nausea requiring hospitalization. This event occurred 1 day after vaccination and was likely 
related to vaccination.

Confidential   Page 66 There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for 
specific categories of AEs (includi ng other neurologic, neuro -inflammatory, and thrombotic 
events) that would suggest a causal relationship to mRNA -1273.  
Efficacy and safety results based on the final analysis of Part A with a database lock of 
04 May 2021 are provided in the IB. The results  are generally comparable to the interim analysis.  
On 25  Aug 2021, Moderna announced that it had completed the rolling submission process for its 
Biologics License Application to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the full licensure 
of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273) for active immunization to prevent COVID -19 
in individuals 18 years of age and older. mRNA -1273 has been showing durable efficacy of 93% 
through 6 months after the second dose.  
In the post -EUA period, anaphylaxis has been repor ted following mRNA -1273 administration. 
There have been very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with 
COVID -19 mRNA vaccines; however, no cases of myocarditis were observed in the clinical 
program.  
A detailed review of the clinical experience with LNPs containing SM -102 (mRNA vaccines and 
placebo) is provided in the IB.  
1.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
1.3.1.  Potential Benefits from Participation  
The following benefits may accrue to participants:  
• The mRNA -1273 vaccine may be effective to prevent COVID -19. 
• Participants will have a baseline (Day 1) evaluation for SARS -CoV -2 infection and 
ongoing surveillance for COVID -19 throughout the study.  
• The study will contribute to the development of a vaccine against COVID -19 for 
immunocompromised individuals.  
1.3.2.  Risks to Study Participants and Risk Mitigation  
Immediate systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can occur following any vaccination. The 
risk of anaphylaxis after all vaccines is estimated to be 1.31 (95% CI, 0.90 -1.84) per million 
vaccine doses ( McNeil and DeStefano 2018 ). Anaphylaxis has been reported in the post -EUA 
period for mRNA -1273 (more than 7.7 million doses administered; CDC 2021a ), although not in 
the ongoing Study P301, at the time of the 25 Nov 2020 data snapshot ( Section 1.2.2 ). In the post -
EUA period, the rate of anaphylaxis following first dose of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine from 21 
Dec 2020 to 10 Jan 2021 was estimated  to be 2.5 cases per million doses administered, and most 
cases occurred in individuals with a history of allergic reactions or anaphylaxis unrelated to 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 67 vaccines ( CDC 2021b ). As a precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the study 
site for at least 30 minutes after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by the 
pain or anxiety caused by the injection and is not related to the substance injected. Therefore, it is 
important t hat standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoid injury from fainting.  
Intramuscular injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by the Sponsor containing the 
SM-102 lipid formulation commonly results in a transient and self -limiting local  inflammatory 
reaction. This typically includes pain, erythema (redness), or swelling (hardness) at the injection 
site, which are mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occur within 24 hours of injection.  
A summary of the safety profile of the mRN A-1273 vaccine observed during the ongoing 
Stud P301 is presented in Section 1.2.2 . 
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent SA RS-CoV -2 infection may cause a 
paradoxical increase in the risk of COVID -19. This possibility is based on the rare phenomenon 
of vaccine -associated disease enhancement, which was first seen in the 1960s with 2 vaccines 
made in the same way (formalin -inacti vated whole virus) and designed to protect children against 
infection with respiratory syncytial virus ( Chin et al 1969 ) or measles virus ( Fulginiti et al 1967 ). 
Disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for cases of more serious  
disease associated with dengue vaccination ( Thomas and Yoon 2019 ; WHO 2019 ). 
In order to address this theoretical risk, animal studies were performed in young and aged wild 
type mice and rhesus macaques (NHPs). These studies were designed to capture immun ogenicity 
endpoints that would be predictive of ERD and also to evaluate if, at protective or subprotective 
dose levels of mRNA -1273, evidence of disease enhancement would be observed after challenge 
of the animals with SARS -CoV -2. These nonclinical studie s demonstrated that mRNA -1273 is 
safe and well tolerated in different animal species; is immunogenic; drives a robust SARS -CoV -2 
specific Ab, neutralization, and Th1 directed CD4+ T -cell response; fully protects animals from 
challenge at dose levels as low  as 1 µg/dose in mice and 30 µg/dose in NHPs; and does not lead 
to ERD at protective or subprotective dose levels ( Corbett et al 2020a ; Corbett et al 2020b ). 
Clinical immunogenicity data from the DMID Phase 1 study of mRNA -1273 demonstrated high 
levels of nAbs and Th1 polarized CD4+ T -cell responses ( Jackson et al 2020 ), consistent with the 
immunogenicity observed in these nonclinical studies. Lastly, in Study P301, after a median 
follow -up of 2 months after the second dose of vaccine, the overwhelming majo rity of COVID -19 
cases occurred in participants who received placebo rather than mRNA -1273 ( Baden et al 2020 ), 
consistent with a low risk of ERD following vaccination with mRNA -1273. These data suggest 
that a paradoxical increase in the risk of disease, wh ile not eliminated, is likely to be low.

Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 68 In the context of the EUA for individuals 18 years and older for mRNA -1273, there have been 
very rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis occurring after vaccination with Moderna 
COVID -19 vaccine. Although causa lity has not been established, the majority of the cases have 
been reported in young males within 7 days after the second dose of the vaccine. These are 
typically mild cases and individuals tend to recover within a short time following standard 
treatment a nd rest ( Gargano et al 2021 ). 
The AEs after receiving a third dose of mRNA -1273 are described in Section 1.2.2 . In general, 
solicited local and syste mic adverse reactions after the BD (Study P201) were comparable to what 
had been observed with the primary series (Study P301).  The AEs after receiving a 100 µg booster 
dose of mRNA -1273 are described in Section 1.2.2 . The frequency and nature of solicited systemic 
and local AEs 7 days after receiving a  100 µg booster dose of mRNA -1273  were generally 
comparable to those seen after the 2-dose primary series. There was a trend toward more frequent 
local and systemic solicited  ARs following the 100 µg booster dose relative to the authorized 50  µg 
booster dose of mRNA -1273.  The AEs after receiving a fourth dose are currently being evaluated.  
It is unknown if the AEs after getting a fourth dose of mRNA -1273 are different from getting 2 or 
3 doses of mRNA -1273.  
1.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion  
In Part A, a ll healthy participants (Group  A5) will benefit from the 2 -dose regimen of 100 µg 
mRNA -1273  vaccine administered in 2 doses 28 days apart, the same regimen and dose that 
received EUA. All SOT unvaccinated recipients will receive the same 2 -dose regimen (Group  A1) 
and also be offered the option of receiving a third dose on Day 85 (Group  A2) (Section 3.1). All 
previously vaccinated SOT recipients who received 2 doses of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine 
outside of the study will receive a third dose  on Day 1  (Group  A3). In the booster phase Part B, all 
participants in Part A will be offered to receive a  100 µg BD of mRNA -1273  (Group  B2, 
Group  B3, and Group B5 ); Eligible SOT recipients who completed primary vaccination series 
under EUA will be enrolled and given a  100 µg BD of mRNA -1273  (Group  B4). 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study ( Section  7.6). 
Considering the limited nu mber of approved vaccines for COVID -19, the participants’ risk of 
COVID -19 outside the study during a pandemic, and the nonclinical and clinical data to date, the 
Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

3.1. General Design  
This is a Phase 3b, open -label study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 
mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in SOT recipients and healthy controls. Adult kidney and liver 
transplant recipients a nd healthy control participants who are at least 18 years of age will be 
enrolled.  
Approximately 240 adult participants (220 previously vaccinated or unvaccinated participants who 
have had a kidney or liver transplant  and 20 unvaccinated healthy adults) wi ll be enrolled.  At least 
50 SOT  recipients  who completed primary vaccination series with a non -Moderna COVID -19 
vaccine under EUA (outside of the mRNA -1273 -P304 study) will be enrolled in Part B  
(Group  B4). 
In Part A, all  SOT recipients who were unvaccinated prior to enrollment  will receive 2 doses of 
100 µg of mRNA -1273 (vaccine) 28 days apart (window of -3/+7 days for the second dose)  
(Group  A1). The SOT recipients will be offered the opportunity to receive a third primary dose of 
vaccine at Day  85 (window of -3/+7 days for the third dose)  as per the EUA Fact Sheet available 
at the time of protocol finalization  (Group  A2). All healthy participants will receive 2 doses of 
vaccine 28 days apart (window of -3/+7 days for the second dose)  (Group  A5). SOT recipients 
who were previously vaccinated with 2 doses of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine under the EUA prior 
to enrollment will receive dose 3 on Day 1  (Group  A3). These participants will be referred to as 
previously vaccinated throughout this document.  Under Amendment #4, unvaccinated SOT 
participants who will be enrolled will be given 3 100 µg doses in Part A then proceed to Part B to 
receive a 100 µg booster dose.  Under Amendment #4, SOT participants previously vaccinated with 
2 doses of Moderna COVID -19 vaccine outside of the study who will be enrolled will receive a 
third 100 µg dose in Part A then proceed to Part B to receive a 100 µg BD.  
In Part B, all eligible active participants in Part A will be offered to receive a 100 µg BD of mRNA -
1273 who are at least 4  months from the last dose. SOT recipients who completed primary COVID -
19 vaccination series under EUA will receive a 100 µg BD on BD -D1.

Confidential   Page 89 For Part A, t he primary immunogenicity goal of the study is to evaluate serum Ab responses 
obtained 28 days after the second or third dose of vaccine (Day 57 for unvaccinated participants 
of the 2 -dose regimen, Day 113 for unvaccinated SOT participants of the 3 -dose regimen, and Day 
29 for previously vaccinated SOT pa rticipants of dose 3  ). Using the Ab threshold established from 
Study P301 (if available at the time of database lock), an additional exploratory analysis will be 
performed by measuring the proportion of participants with a serum Ab level at Day 57 (for 
unvaccinated participants of 2 -dose regimen  ), Day 113 (unvaccinated SOT recipients of 3 -dose 
regimen), and Day 29 (previously vaccinated SOT recipients of dose  3) greater than or equal to 
the Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19, with a 2 sided 95% C I using the Clopper 
Pearson method by cohort arm.  
This study will monitor participants for a total of up to 12 months (12 months after their last dose 
of vaccine  for participants not receiving a BD or 6 months after their BD) . The SOT participants 
who do n ot consent to receive a third dose of mRNA -1273  (Group   A1) and healthy adult 
participants (Group   A5) will be monitored for a total of 12 months after their second dose. Safety 
assessments will include solicited local and systemic ARs for 7 days after eac h dose; unsolicited 
AEs for 28  days after each dose; MAAEs; SAEs; AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from 
dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal) from dose 1 through the end of study (EOS); 
concomitant medications associated with AEs, MAAEs, or C OVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection; 
participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms; biopsy -proven organ rejection; safety laboratory 
assessments; vital sign measurements; and physical examination findings as presented in the 
applicable SoE ( Section 10.1). 
From all unvaccinated SOT participants who receive 3 doses of mRNA -1273 (Group   A2), blood 
samples will be collected at baseline (Day 1), Day 29 (28 days af ter dose 1), Day 57 (28 days after 
dose 2), Day  85 (dose  3), Day  113 ( 28 days after dose 3), Day 265 (6 months after dose 3), and 
Day 450 (12 months after dose 3).  
From unvaccinated participants who receive 2 doses of vaccine (healthy adults [Group   A5] and 
SOT recipients who decline to receive a third dose  [Group  A1]), blood samples will be collected 
at baseline (Day 1), Day 29 (28  days after dose 1), Day 57 (28 days after dose 2), Day 209 (6 
months after dose 2), and Day  394 (12 months after dose 2).  
From  previously vaccinated SOT participants who receive 1 dose of mRNA -1273  (Group  A3), 
blood samples will be collected at pre -dose 3 (Day 1), Day 29 (28  days after dose  3), Day 180 (6 
months after dose  3), and Day  365 (12 months after dose  3). 
These blood sam ples will be for the assessment of the following endpoints and analytes:  
• Measurement of SARS -CoV -2-specific bAb and nAb responses

which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. Pa rticipants who tested positive for 
Ab against SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid protein at baseline can continue in the study.  
From unvaccinated SOT  participants  (Group  A1 and Group  A2), blood samples for cell -mediated 
immunity (CMI) studies will also be collected at Day 1, Day 36, and Day 92 (SOT recipients 
receiving 3 doses  [Group  A2]) from a subset of at up to 50 SOT participants, as well as, from 20 
healthy controls (Group  A5) (Day 1 and Day 36), and from a subset of at least 50 previously 
vaccinated SOT recipie nts (Group  A3) at Day 1 and Day  8, for exploratory assessments to 
characterize T - and B -cell responses to vaccine.  
The NP swab samples obtained at illness visits ( Section 7.3.1 ) will be used as sources of 
SARS -CoV -2 for genetic sequencing.  
SARS -CoV -2 bAb against the nonvaccine antigen (nucleocapsid protein) will also be collected at 
the Illness and Convalescent visits.  
The number of cases of COVID -19 w ill be assessed throughout the study ( Section Error! 
Reference source not found. ). Once a participant is identified as a case of COVID -19, a 
convalescent visit will be scheduled  approximately 28 days after the confirmed diagnosis for a 
clinical evaluation and immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
For unvaccinated SOT recipients  (Group  A1 and Group  A2), laboratory assessments for safety 
related to kidney function for kid ney SOT recipients (serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR) 
and liver function for liver SOT recipients (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and bilirubin) will be monitored on Day 1, 
Day 8, Day 29, Day 36, and Day  57 for SOT recipients who receive 2 doses only (Group  A1) and 
on additional Days 85, 92, and Day 113 for SOT recipients who receive 3 doses  (Group  A2). 
For previously vaccinated SOT recipients  (Group  A3), laboratory assessments for safe ty will be 
monitored on Day 1 (dose  3), Day 8, and Day 29.  
After Day  57 (for unvaccinated SOT participants who receive 2 doses  [Group  A1]) or after Day 
113 (for unvaccinated SOT participants who receive 3 doses  [Group  A2]), or after Day 29 (for 
previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose  3 [Group  A3]), the investigator will 
review standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to kidney and liver function and report any 
laboratory -related AEs and suspected or confirmed events of organ transplant rejection until the 
EOS . 
Part B  - Booster Phase  
Part B is designed to offer participants in Part A, who are at least 4  months from the last dose, the 
option to request a BD ( 100 µg) of the pro totype mRNA -1273  (Group  B2, Group  B3, and

Participants will be instructed on the day of the first dose and reminded on the days of the second , 
third , and fourth  doses (as applicable) how to document and report solicited local or systemic ARs 
in a provided eDiary. Solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to 
discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal), and biopsy -proven organ 
rejection will be assessed as described in Section 7.1, according to the time points in the applicable 
SoE ( Section 10.1). 
Participants may experience and report AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit. At the discretion 
of the investigator, additional examinations may be conducted at these visits as necessary to ensure 
the safety and well -being of participants during th e study. Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) 
should be completed for each unscheduled visit.  
3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
The study vaccine, mRNA -1273, is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity study i n an adult population at high risk of COVID -19 disease (Study P301). 
Success criteria for early efficacy were met at first interim analysis based on 95 adjudicated cases 
with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p value < 0.0001). 
Immunocompromised individuals were excluded from this study.  
The current study aims to describe the safety and Ab responses elicited following the last dose of 
vaccine among adult kidney and liver transplant recipients evaluated against the Ab responses of 
healthy adult participants in this study and in Study P301 (if available at the time of database lock) . 
This study is expected to provide initial clinical information whether vaccination with mRNA -
1273 can induce vaccine response in this population of immu nocompromised participants, and 
whether 3 doses of vaccine induces a greater response than a 2 -dose regimen. Recent data based 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 98 on post -EUA experience show that solid organ transplant recipients’ response to mRNA -based 
COVID -19 vaccines were substantially l ower compared to what has been reported in the general 
population with antibody responses detectable in only 30 -60% after 2 doses ( Benotmane et al 
2021 ; Boyarsky et al 2021b , Grupper et al 2021 ; Marinaki et al 2021 ). 
A small case series which evaluated the  antibody responses and vaccine reactions in 30 solid organ 
transplant recipients who had suboptimal response to standard vaccination show that SOT 
recipients who had low -positive antibody response before the third dose had high -positive 
antibody titers af ter dose 3 and some of those who had negative antibody response had either low - 
to high -positive antibody response after dose 3 ( Werbel et al 2021 ). 
In addition, a recently published article described a double -blind, randomized, controlled trial of a 
third  dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine (Moderna) as compared with placebo ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; Hall et 
al 2021 ). The results demonstrated that a third dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine in transplant recipients 
elicited a substantially higher immune response than placebo, as determin ed in the analysis of both 
primary and secondary trial endpoints. The third dose was considered safe when risk versus benefit 
was considered.  
Administration of additional vaccination is a strategy shown to improve immune response to viral 
antigens based on  clinical experiences with hepatitis B and influenza vaccines ( Nevens et al 2006 ; 
Natori et al 2018 ). 
Interim data are available from an ongoing Moderna Phase 2 study, mRNA -1273 -P201 (Study 
P201) where healthy adult participants in Study mRNA -1273 -P201 rec eived 2 doses of either 
50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA -1273 and were administered a 50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 6 to 8 
months after the second dose. Participants in mRNA -1273 -P201 who received the BD, 
demonstrated enhanced immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 compared t o pre -boost levels and met 
the noninferiority criteria stipulated in the US Food and Drug Administration Guidance on E UA 
for Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. Available data also show that heterologous or mixed series of 
COVID -19 vaccine induced high immune re sponse in the adult population  (Atmar et al 2021 ). 
Additionally, no new safety signals emerged upon administration of the BD in Study P201. In 
addition,  interim results from the mRNA -1273 -P205 study  show that the currently authorized 
50 µg booster of mRNA -1273 increased neutralizing antibody level s against Omicron 
approximately 37 -fold compared to pre -boost levels and a 100 µg dose of mRNA -1273 increased 
neutralizing antibody levels  approximately 83 -fold compared to pre -boost levels.  Based on 
cumulativ e evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -1273 is favorable, particularly in 
light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of the Delta variant. Providing the 
option for a BD to all eligible participants currently enrolled in the s tudy as well as enrolling 
eligible SOT recipients who completed primary vaccination series under EUA is expected to

Confidential   Page 99 generate valuable homologous and heterologous booster data in the immunocompromised 
population.  
With SARS -CoV -2 expected to be circulating i n the general population during the study, all 
participants will provide pre - and post -dose blood samples for Ab analysis through 12 months after 
the last dose of vaccine  in Part A or through 6 months after the BD in Part B . In addition, in Part 
A, unvacci nated participants will have NP swab samples collected, before the injections on Day 1 
and Day 29, and on Day 57 for those receiving the 2 -dose regimen, before injections on Day 1, 
Day 29, and Day 85,and on Day 57, and Day 113 for those receiving the 3 -dose regimen, and 
before injection on Day 1 and on Day 29 for previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive 
dose 3. In Part B, NP swabs will be collected before BD injection on BD -D1. Furthermore, with 
any signs or symptoms or MAAE suggesting SARS -CoV -2 infection in a participant, an additional 
nasal or NP swab sample and a blood sample will be taken to confirm the diagnosis of 
SARS -CoV -2 via serology and RT -PCR. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully 
collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
As it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the NP and/or nasal swab samples collected before study injection and the serologic 
assays for Ab responses to nonvaccine antigen(s) may help  discriminate between natural infection 
and vaccine -induced Ab responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
3.3. Justification for Dose and Choice of Study Population  
The 100  µg dose level is currently being investigated in a large Phase 3 efficacy study in  adults 
18 years of age and older (Study P301) . The 50 µg BD level is currently being investigated in a 
Phase 2 study in adults 18  years of age and older (P201) . Interim results from  the mRNA -1273 -
P205 study  show  that the 100 µg BD had robust GM titers against the Omicron  variant, which 
were higher numerically than what were observed for the 50 µg BD.  Therefore, based on this study 
and the results of the studies described in Section 1.2.2 , the Sponsor intends to study a single -dose 
level of 100 µg mRNA -1273 primary series and single 100 µg BD in this Phase 3b study in an 
adult immunocompromised population.  
There is no placebo treatme nt arm for this study. On 18 Dec 2020, the US FDA issued an EUA for 
the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine to be distributed in the US for use in individuals 18 
years of age and older ( FDA 2020 ) in response to the ongoing pandemic. On 12 Aug 2021, the US 
FDA issued an extension of the EUA for a third dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vaccine 
in certain immunocompromised individuals, specifically, SOT recipients or those who are 
diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of i mmunocompromise 
(FDA 2021 ). Recent US CDC guidance recommends a COVID -19 BD in people aged ≥  18 years 
who are moderately and severely immunocompromised which includes SOT recipients ( CDC  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 100 2021 c). Accordingly, the inclusion of a placebo treatment group would  be inappropriate. Instead, 
an open -label study was designed which intends to enroll adult SOT recipients (kidney and liver 
transplants) and healthy adults. Participants in the transplant cohort are therapeutically 
immunosuppressed to avoid transplant reje ction. The healthy cohort serves as a concurrent 
nonimmunosuppressed comparison group for the analysis of cellular immune response.  
3.4. End of Study Definition  
The EOS for the full study is defined as completion of the last visit of the last participant in the  
study or the last scheduled procedure as shown in the applicable SoE ( Section  10.1) for the last

Confidential   Page 107 5. STUDY TREATMENT  
5.1. Investigational Product Administered  
The term vaccine refers to 100 µg mRNA -1273 primary series vaccine and 100 µg mRNA -1273 
BD vaccine in this study. Each dose, regardless of the regimen (single -dose, 2 -dose, or 3 -dose 
100 µg mRNA -1273 ), administered in the study will be 100 µg mRNA -1273 . No placebo will be 
administered during this study.  
The mRNA -1273 vaccine is an LNP dispersion of an mRNA encoding the prefusion stabilized 
S protein of SARS -CoV -2, formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipids (1 proprietary and 
3 commercially available): the prop rietary ionizable lipid SM 102; cholesterol; 1,2 distearoyl sn 
glycero -3 phosphocholine; and 1 -monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol -2,3-dimyristylglycerol 
polyethylene glycol 2000. Vaccine is provided as a sterile liquid for injection, white to off -white 
dispersi on in appearance, at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 
87 mg/mL sucrose and 10.7 mM sodium acetate at pH 7.5.  
5.2. Randomization and Stratification  
This is an open -label, single treatment study: there is no randomization. An interacti ve response 
technology system will be used to sequentially assign a unique participant identification number 
within each cohort of the study (transplant recipient cohort or healthy comparison cohort).  
Approximately 240  adult participants (220 unvaccinated or previously vaccinated participants who 
received two 100 µg doses of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine who have had a kidney or liver 
transplant and 20 healthy adults) will be enrolled and vaccinated; there will be no stratification or 
enrollment in blocks.  At least 50 SOT  recipients  who completed primary vaccination series with a 
non-Moderna COVID -19 under EUA (outside of the mRNA -1273 -P304 study) will be enrolled in 
Part B.  
5.3. Dosing and Management of mRNA -1273 Vaccine  
5.3.1.  Preparation of Study Vaccine for Injection  
Each dose of vaccine will be prepared for each participant as detailed in the mRNA1273P304  
Pharmacy Manual. For Part A, t he volume of vaccine injected will be 0.5 mL, containing a 100 µg 
dose of mRNA -1273  as detailed in the mRNA -1273 -P304  Pharmacy Manual.  For Part B,  the 
booster phase, each injection will have a volume of 0. 5 mL and contain mRNA -1273 100 µg as in 
Part A. 
5.3.2.  Administration of Study Vaccine  
Each unvaccinated SOT and Healthy participant (Group  A1Group  A2, and Group A5 ) will receive 
two 100 -µg do ses of vaccine by IM injection, 28 days apart (ie, Day  1 and Day 29) into the deltoid

Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 108 muscle, according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -1273 -P304 Pharmacy Manual. 
Preferably, both doses should be administered into the same nondominant arm. Neither dose 
should be administered into an arm that contains an arteriovenous fistula. Unvaccinated SOT 
recipients will be offered to receive a third dose of vaccine (Group  A2) on Day 85 (56  days after 
dose 2). Previously vaccinated SOT recipients (Group  A3) will receive a single 100-µg dose (dose 
3) on Day 1.  In Part B  (Group  B2, Group  B3, Group  B4, and Group  B5), participants will receive 
a single 100-µg dose  on BD -D1. Under Amendment #4, unvaccinated SOT participants who will 
be enrolled will be given 3 100 µg doses in Part A then proceed to Part B to receive a 100 µg 
booster dose. Under Amendment #4, SOT participants previously vaccinated with 2 doses of 
Moderna COVID -19 vaccine outside of the study who will be enrolled will receive a third 100 µg 
dose in Part A then proceed to Part B to receive a 100 µg BD.  
At each visit when vaccine is administered, participants will be monitored for a minimum of 
30 minutes after admi nistration. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and monitoring 
for local or systemic ARs.  
Eligibility for a subsequent dose of vaccine will be determined by following the criteria outlined 
in Section 6. 
The study sites will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either onsite resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
approp riate protocols for the rapid transport of participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
5.3.3.  Study Vaccine Delivery and Receipt  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the following:  
• Supplying the vaccine  
• Confirming the appropriate labeling of the vaccine, so that it complies with the legal 
requirements of the United States  
The investigator is responsible for acknowledging the receipt of the vaccine by a designated staff 
member at the study site, including the following:  
• Confirming that the v accine was received in good condition  
• Confirming that the temperature during shipment from the Sponsor to the 
investigator’s designated storage location was appropriate  
• Confirming that the Sponsor has authorized the vaccine for use

Further description of the vaccine and instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation, 
administration, accountability, and destruction of the vaccine are described in the 
mRNA -1273 -P304 Pharmacy Manual . 
5.3.4.  Study Vaccine Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor will provide the investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantities 
of vaccine. The sterile vaccine is packaged in 10R glass vials with a 6.3 -mL or 8.0 -mL fill volume. 
The vaccine will have all required labeling per regulations and will be supplied to the pharmacy 
in an unblinded manner.  
The vaccine will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating procedures of 
the Sponsor or of its designee, Code of F ederal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Good Manufacturing 
Practice guidelines, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) GCP guidelines, guidelines for 
Quality System Regulations, and applicable regulations . 
5.3.5.  Study Vaccine Storage  
The Moderna COVID -19 vacci ne vials are to be stored in a secure area with limited access and 
protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration ( Section 5.3.1 ). Vials are 
to be stored frozen between -25°C and -15°C (13°F and 5°F).  Unpunctured vials may be stored 
between 8°C and 25°C (46°F and 77°F) for up to 12 hours. The refrigerator should have automated 
temperature recording and a 24 -hour alert system i n place that allows for rapid response in case of 
refrigerator malfunction. There must be an available backup refrigerator. The refrigerators must 
be connected to a backup generator. In addition, vaccine accountability study staff are required to 
keep a te mperature log to establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions.  
The study site is responsible for reporting any vaccine that was not temperature controlled during 
shipment or during storage. Such vaccine will be retained for inspection by the monitor and 
disposed of according to approved methods.  
5.3.6.  Study Vaccine Accountability and Disposal  
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the vaccine accountability study staff maintain accurate 
records in a vaccine accountability log of receipt of  all vaccine, study site vaccine inventory, 
vaccine dispensing, vaccine injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used 
and unused vaccine vials.  
A study site monitor will review vaccine accountability during study site visits and at the 
completion of the study during onsite and/or remote monitoring visits.

by the Sponsor. A certificate of destruction must be completed and sent to the Sp onsor or designee.  
Additional details are found in the mRNA -1273 -P304 Pharmacy Manual.  
5.4. Study Treatment Compliance  
All doses of vaccine will be administered at the study site under direct observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified study site 
staff will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of vaccine. If a participant does 
not receive vaccine or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the missed do se will 
be recorded. Data will be reconciled with study site accountability records to assess compliance.  
Participants who miss the second or third dose due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and 
not due to a safety pause will still be required to fo llow the original visit and testing schedule as 
described in the protocol and their regimen schedule. Unless consent is withdrawn, a participant 
who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second or third dose will remain in the study and 
complete all safety and immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s last 
scheduled study visit.  
The study site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every eff ort should be made to contact the participant 
and complete a visit within the defined visit window ( Section 10.1). If a participant does not 
complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be classified as a protocol deviation. The 
participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study visits. All safety requirements of the 
missed visit will be captured an d included in the subsequent visit.  
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
5.5.1.  Prior Medications and Therapies  
Information about prior medications (including any prescription or over -the-counter medications, 
vaccines, or blood products) taken by the participant wit hin the 28 days before providing informed 
consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be recorded in the 
participant’s eCRF. In addition, for previously vaccinated participants, the 2 previous doses of the 
Moderna COVID -19 vacci ne received prior to signing the informed consent will be recorded in 
the participant’s eCRF regardless of the timing.  
For SOT recipients, all immunosuppressant medications will be recorded in the eCRF page, 3 
months prior to Screening and throughout the s tudy. Any change in the maintenance therapy 
should be recorded and the reason for the change documented. Changes include any adjustments 
(temporarily or permanently), addition of new immunosuppressants, or switching from 1

not limited to, per center protocol, drug interaction, toxicity, or treatment or prevention of graft 
rejection.  
5.5.2.  Conco mitant Medications and Therapies  
At each study visit and each safety telephone  call, study site staff must question the participant 
regarding any medications taken and vaccinations received by the participant and record the 
following information in the eCRF:  
• All immunosuppressant medications, including but not limited to, glucocorti coids (eg, 
prednisolone), immunophilin binding agents (eg, calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR 
inhibitors), and inhibitors of de novo nucleotide synthesis (eg, mycophenolic acid, 
mizoribine, leflunomide, azathioprine) for 3 months prior to Screening and 
throughou t the study. Any immunosuppressants listed in the exclusion criteria if taken 
during the study should also be recorded.  
• All nonstudy vaccinations administered within the period starting 28 days before the 
first dose of study vaccine, including seasonal inf luenza vaccine administered for the 
current influenza season (typically October through April in the Northern 
Hemisphere).  
• All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations taken through 28 days after 
each dose of study vaccine. Antipyretics and analge sics taken prophylactically (ie, 
taken in the absence of any symptoms in anticipation of an injection reaction) will be 
recorded as such.  
• Any concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of an SAE or MAAE.  
• Any concomitant medications used to pr event or treat COVID -19 or its symptoms.  
• Participants will be asked in the eDiary if they have taken any antipyretic or analgesic 
to treat or prevent fever or pain within 7 days after each dose of vaccine, including 
the day of injection. Reported antipyret ic or analgesic medications should be recorded 
in the source document by the study site staff during the post -injection study visits or 
via other participant interactions (eg, telephone calls).  
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded  using the WHO Drug Dictionary. 
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator and the contract research 
organization’s (CRO’s) medical monitor will make a joint decision about continuing or 
withholding further injection of the particip ant based on the time the medication was administered, 
the drug’s pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will

Confidential   Page 112 compromise the participant’s safety or interpretation of the data. It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure  that details regarding the concomitant medications are adequately recorded 
in the eCRF.  
5.5.3.  Concomitant Medications and Vaccines that May Lead to the Elimination of a 
Participant from Per -Protocol Analysis  
The use of the following concomitant medications and/ or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study, but may determine a participant’s eligibility to receive a second or 
third dose or evaluability in the PP analysis (analysis sets are described in Section 8.2): 
• Any investigational or nonregistered product (drug or vaccine) other than the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine used during the study period  
• Any medications listed in the study exclusion criteria ( Section 4.1.1.2  and Section 
4.1.2.2 ) 
• Immunoglobulins and /or any blood products administered during the study period  
5.6. Intervention After the End of the Study  
Any SAE occurring after a participant’s scheduled EOS and considered to be caused by the vaccine 
must be reported to the Sponsor.

PARTICIPANT WITHDRAW AL FROM THE STUDY  
6.1. Criteria for Delay of Vaccine Administration  
6.1.1.  Individual Participant Criteria for Delay of Study Vaccination  
Body temperature (oral) must be measured on dosing visits before vaccine administration. The 
following events constitute criteria for delay of injection, and if either of these events occur at the 
time scheduled for dosing, the participant may receive the study injection at a later date within the 
time window specified in the applicable SoE ( Section 10.1), or the participant may be discontinued 
from dosing at the discretion of the investigator ( Section 6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F at the time of dosing (oral 
temperature preferred)  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by the investigator, can be vaccinated. 
Participants with a fever of ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F will be contacted within the time window 
acceptable for participation and re -evaluated for eligi bility. If the investigator determines that the 
participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes injection, the visit should be 
rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit if possible or at a time the participant is 
clinically sta ble according to the judgement of the investigator.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, an injection could be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
6.2. Discontinuing Study Vaccination  
Participants can discontinue study injection (ie, refuse the second or third dose) for any reason, 
without prejudice to fu rther treatment the participant may need to receive.  
The investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold a participant 
from further injection if the participant does any of the following:  
• Withdraws consent to participate in t he study ( Section 6.3) 
• Becomes pregnant ( Section 7.5.5 ) 
• Develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria ( Section 4.1.1.2  or Section 4.1.2.2 ) 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 114 • Experiences an unsolicited AE (other than reactogenicity) after injection that is 
considered by the investigator to be related to vaccine ( Section 7.5.10 ) and is assessed 
as severe ( Section 7.5.9 ) 
• Experiences an AE or SAE that, in the judgm ent of the investigator, requires vaccine 
withdrawal due to its nature, severity, or required treatment, regardless of the causal 
relationship to vaccine  
• Experiences a clinically significant change in vital sign measurements or general 
condition that, in t he judgment of the investigator, requires vaccine withdrawal  
• Experiences anaphylaxis ( Section  7.5.5 ) clearly related to vaccine  
• Experiences an event t hat meets the criteria for study pause rules ( Section 7.6.2 ) 
The reason(s) for withdrawal from further injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a pa rticipant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator could withhold the second or third 
dose based on a joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor ( Section 5.5.2 ). 
Every reasonable attempt will be made to follow -up with participants for safety throughout the 
entire scheduled study period according to their regimen, even if the participant does not rece ive 
the second or third dose or misses 1 or more visits. Unless participants withdraw consent, they are 
expected to remain in the study and complete all scheduled visits and assessments.  
6.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Participants wh o withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. A “withdrawal” 
from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the final visit planned 
in the protocol. The statistical management of participant withdrawals is  discussed in Section 8. 
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treat ment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If the participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will try to 
obtain agreement to follow -up with the participant until the event is considered resolved or stable 
and will then complete the EOS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the dec ision to withdraw a participant from the study was made by the 
participant or by the investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 115 • AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up (LTFU)  
• Physician decisi on (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminated by Sponsor  
• Withdrawal of consent by participant (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs) must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators will follow -up 
with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE until resolution of 
the event.  
A participant who withdraws from the study may request destruction of  any samples taken and not 
tested, and the investigator must document this in the study site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such  a withdrawal of consent ( Section 10.2.10 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research data that have already been collected for 
the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of these samples. Al l 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by local regulations)  
6.4. Lost to Follow -up 
A participant will be considered LTFU if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits 
without stating an intention to withdraw consent and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The study site staff must attempt to contact the  participant and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 116 • Before a participant  is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls, emails, 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalen t methods). These contact attempts (eg, dates of telephone calls, 
emails, and certified letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical 
record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or pr ocedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Confidential   Page 117 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants will sign  an ICF (as detailed in 
Section 10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study procedures at the time points specified in the 
applicable SoE ( Section 10.1). A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time 
during the study. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity i ssues, illness visit 
criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. The study site also has the discretion to make 
reminder telephone calls or send text messages to inform the participant about visits, review eDiary 
requirements, or follow -up on ongoing or outstanding issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), investigators may convert study site visits 
to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor . Such action should be taken to protect the 
safety and well -being of study participants and study site staff or to comply with state or municipal 
mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers  or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be followed as presented in Section 10.1. Adherence to the study design 
requirements is essential and required for study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue study 
treatment or participation in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline assessments provided the procedur es met the protocol -specified criteria and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the applicable SoE.  
7.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant, 
according to th e applicable SoE:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section 7.5.3 ) that occur during the 7 days 
following each injection (ie, the day of injection and  6 subsequent days). Solicited 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 118 ARs will be recorded daily using the eDiary ( Section 7.1.1 ). The definition of AR is 
presented in Section 7.5.1 . 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28 days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days). Unsolicited AEs are def ined in Section 
7.5.1 . 
• MAAEs throughout the study period.  
• SAEs throughout the study period.  
• AESIs throughout the study period.  
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal) 
throughout the study period.  
• Biopsy -proven organ rejection throughout the study period. A biopsy report will be 
needed for documentation.  
• Safety laboratory assessments:  
Part A  
− For unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive the 2 -dose regimen  (Group  A1), 
safety laboratory assessments related to kidney (for kidney transplant recipients) 
and liver function (for liver transplant recipients) will be monitored on Day 1, 
Day 8, Day  29, Day 36 , and Day 57. After Day 57, the investigator will review 
standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to kidney and liver function (as 
related to the SOT) and report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or 
confirmed events of organ transplant reject ion until the EOS . 
− For unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive the 3 -dose regimen  (Group  A2), 
safety laboratory assessments related to kidney (for kidney transplant recipients) 
and liver function (for liver transplant recipients) will be monitored on Day 1 , 
Day 8, Day  29, Day 36, Day 57, Day 85, Day 92, and Day 113. After Day 113, 
the investigator will review standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to 
kidney and liver function (as related to the SOT) and report any laboratory -related 
AEs and suspect ed or confirmed events of organ transplant rejection until the 
EOS . 
− For previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 (Group  A3), safety 
laboratory assessments related to kidney (for kidney transplant recipients) and 
liver function (for liver tra nsplant recipients) will be monitored  on Day 1, Day 8, 
and Day 29. After Day 29, the investigator will review standard -of-care

and report any laboratory -related AEs and sus pected or confirmed events of organ 
transplant rejection until the EOS . 
Part B  
− For SOT participants who completed primary vaccination series  (Group  B2, 
Group  B3, and Group  B4), safety laboratory assessments related to kidney (for 
kidney transplant recipien ts) and liver function (for liver transplant recipients) 
will be monitored on BD -D1, BD -D8, and BD -D29.  After BD -D29, the 
investigator will review standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to kidney 
and liver function, and report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or 
confirmed events of organ transplant rejection until the EOS . 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section 7.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section 7.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 infection from Day 1 through study completion 
(Section  7.1.6 ). 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study treatment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section 7.5.5 ). 
• Changes in immunosuppressant medications in SOT recipients  
7.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries  
At the time of consent, participants must confirm that they will be willing  to complete an eDiary 
using either an application downloaded to their smartphone or using a device that is provided at 
the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day 1, participants will be instructed to download 
the eDiary application or will be provid ed an eDiary device to record solicited ARs ( Section 7.5.3 ) 
on Day 1.  
At each injection visit, participants will be instructed on thermometer usage t o measure body 
temperature, ruler usage to measure injection site erythema and swelling/induration (hardness), 
and self -assessment for localized axillary swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection 
arm. 
At each injection visit, participants wi ll record data into the eDiary starting approximately 
30 minutes after injection under supervision of the study site staff to ensure successful entry of 
assessments. The study site staff will perform any retraining as necessary. Participants will 
continue to record data in the eDiary after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening and 
at the same time each day, on the day of injection and for 6 days following injection.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 120 Participants will record the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined in Section 7.5.3 , that 
occur on the day of each vaccine administration and during the 7 d ays after vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). If a solicited local or 
systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be 
prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in th e eDiary until it 
is resolved or the next vaccine injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of 
details of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination. 
Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day 7 should be reviewed b y the 
study site staff either during the next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site 
visit.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by the study site. If  body 
temperature is taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Measurement, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration); the size measurements will be performe d using the ruler 
provided by the study site.  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on the day of injection or for 
the next 6 days.  
The eDiary will be the only source documents allowed for solicited local or systemic ARs 
(including body temperature measurements). Participants will be instructed to complete eDiary 
entries daily. The participant will have a limited window on the following day to complete 
assessments for the previous day; quantitative temperature recordings and measurement o f any 
injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on the following day may be excluded from 
the analyses of solicited ARs.  
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone calls or at study site visits (including 
a solicited reaction ) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the source 
documents as a verbally reported event. An event reported in this manner must be described as a 
solicited event and entered on the solicited AR eCRF.  
Study site staff will review eDiary data with participants at visits 7 days after each injection.  
In Part A, t he eDiary will also be used every 4 weeks to capture the occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, 
SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study participation 
(withd rawal) as follows:  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021

Confidential   Page 121 • Starting at Day 71 through Day 183 and again starting at Day 223 through Day 363 for 
unvaccinated SOT and healthy recipients of 2 vaccine doses  (Group  A1 and Group A5 ), 
• Starting at Day 127 through Day 239 and again Day 279 through Day 41 9 for unvaccinated 
SOT recipients of 3 vaccine doses  (Group  A2), and  
• Starting at Day 43 through Day 155 and again starting at Day  194 through Day 306 
(previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3) (Group  A3). 
The timing of eDiary prompts and saf ety calls will not be adjusted when the last dose is delayed. 
If the last dose is delayed beyond the standard window, the following clinic visits should be 
adjusted:  
For the 2 -dose regimen  (Group  A1 and Group A5 ), the actual date of the last delayed dose s hould 
be used to adjust D36 (7 days after last dose), D57 (28 days after last dose), 6 months visit (180 
days after last dose) and 12 months visit (365 days after last dose).  
For the 3 -dose regimen  (Group  A2), the actual date of the last delayed dose shoul d be used to 
adjust dates for D97 (7 days after last dose), D113 (28 days after last dose), 6 months visit (180 
days after last dose) and 12 months visit (365 days after last dose).  
Additional safety calls every 4 weeks should be scheduled when there is a gap beyond 28 days 
between the safety call scheduled on D377 (for 2 doses  [Group  A1 and Group A5 ]) or D433 (for 
3 doses  [Group  A2]) and the last study visit.  
As specified in the applicable SoE, the eDiary will prompt the participant to complete an eDiary 
questionnaire that collects the following data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact with the 
study site  
• Known close contact exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 
infection  
• Any experience of symptoms  of COVID -19 
• Any MAAEs or SAEs  
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events according to the study period, 
or of symptoms of COVID -19, a follow -up safety telephone call will be triggered.  
Completion of eDiary questionnaires will alternate with safety telephone calls ( Section 7.1.2 ) as 
the procedure for safety follow -up approximately every 4 weeks:  
• Starting at Day 85 through D ay 197 and again starting at Day 237 through Day 377 for 
unvaccinated SOT and healthy recipients of 2 vaccine doses  (Group  A1 and Group A5 ), 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021

Confidential   Page 122 • Starting every 4 weeks from Day 141 through Day 253 and again from Day 293 through 
Day 433 for unvaccinated SOT rec ipients of 3 vaccine doses  (Group  A2), and  
• Starting at Day 57 through Day 169 and again starting at Day  208 through Day  320 
(previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose  3) (Group  A3). 
The follow -up eDiary questionnaires and the safety calls condu cted by the study staff will occur 
~2 weeks apart on a 4 week cycle.  
7.1.1.1.  Ancillary Supplies for Participant Use  
Study sites will distribute Sponsor -provided oral thermometers and rulers for use by participants 
in assessing body temperature and injection site r eactions, respectively, for recording solicited ARs 
in the eDiary. Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to those participants 
who do not have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2.  Safety Telephone Calls  
A safety telephone call  is a telephone call made to the participant by trained study site personnel. 
This call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information. In 
Part A, s afety telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant as i ndicated in the applicable 
SoE:  
• Every 4 weeks from Day 85 to Day 197 and again from Day 237 to Day 377 for 
unvaccinated SOT and Healthy recipients of 2  vaccine doses  (Group  A1 and Group A5 ), 
• Every 4 weeks from Day 141 to Day 253 and again from Day 293 to Day 433 for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients of 3 vaccine doses  (Group  A2), and  
• Every 4 weeks from Day 57 through Day 169 and again starting at Day 208 through Day 
320 for previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 (Group  A3). 
The schedule of safet y telephone calls will not be adjusted for each participant based on the actual 
day of the last dose, if delayed. Additional safety calls every 4 weeks should be scheduled when 
there is a gap beyond 28 days between the safety call scheduled on D377 (for 2 doses  [Group  A1 
and Group A5 ]) or D433 (for 3 doses  [Group  A2]) and the last study visit.  
In Part B, safety telephone calls will be performed on BD -D15, BD-D22, BD-D59,  BD-D89, BD -
119, and BD -D149  to collect information about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs (incl uding biopsy -
proven organ rejection), SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or study 
participation (withdrawal), concomitant medications associated with those events, and any 
nonstudy vaccinations ( Section  7.5.8 ).

Confidential   Page 123 The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs 
(including biopsy -proven organ rejection), SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from 
dosing and/or study participation (withdrawal), concomitant medications associated with those 
events, and any nonstudy vaccinations ( Section  7.5.8 ). In addition, study personnel will collect 
information on known participant close contact exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or 
SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVI D-19 symptoms. All safety 
information collected from the telephone contact must be documented in source documents as 
described by the participant and not documented on the script used for the safety telephone contact. 
As noted in Section 7.1.1 , an unscheduled follow -up safety telephone call may be triggered if an 
eDiary record results in identification of a relevant safety event.  
7.1.3.  Safety Laboratory Asses sments  
All safety laboratory assessments will be conducted at laboratories local to the study sites. To help 
monitor for potential event of organ transplant rejection in the SOT recipients, safety laboratory 
assessments will be performed, including assessm ents related to kidney and liver function (eg, 
serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR for kidney SOT recipients; and ALT, AST, ALP, and 
bilirubin for liver SOT recipients) at prespecified study visits. After Day 57 (unvaccinated SOT 
recipients who recei ve 2 vaccine doses  [Group  A1]) or after Day 113 (unvaccinated SOT recipients 
who receive 3 vaccine doses  [Group  A2]) or after Day 29 (previously vaccinated SOT recipients 
who receive dose 3 [Group  A3] in Part A or SOT recipients who completed the primary 
vaccination series  who receive BD  [Group  B4]) in Part B , the investigator will review 
standard -of-care laboratory assessments related to kidney and liver function (as applicable), and 
report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or confirmed events of organ transplant rejection 
until the EOS. The investigator must review results of safety laboratory assessments as soon as 
they are available. Schedules of sampling for safety laboratory assessments are presented in the 
SoEs - (Section 10.1). 
A point -of-care urine pregnancy test will be performed at the screening visit (Day 0) and before 
each dose of vaccine. One pregnancy test is sufficient if Day 0 and  Day 1 are combined in the 
same. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be performed, at 
the discretion of the investigator. Pregnancy is one of the exclusion criteria ( Section 4.1.1.2  and 
Section  4.1.2.2 ) in this study and is a reason for dosing discontinuation ( Secti on 6.2).

7.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and body tempera ture (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the time points

Confidential   Page 124 indicated in the applicable SoE. At dosing visits, vital sign measurements will be coll ected once 
before injection and at least 30 minutes after injection (before participants are discharged from the 
study site).  
Febrile participants at dosing visits (fever is defined as a body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F) 
may have visits rescheduled with in the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with 
minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the investigator.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same time point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign m easurements and then the blood collection.  
7.1.5.  Physical Examinations  
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at Day 1 as indicated 
in the applicable SoE ( Section 10.1). The full examination will include assessment of skin, head, 
ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, 
and musculoskeletal system/extremities. Any clinically significant finding identified during a 
study visit should be reported as an MAAE. Symptom -directed physical examinations will be 
performed at other time points.  
On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm th at received the 
injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes must be evaluated. Any clinically 
significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
Body mass index will be calculated at the screening visit (Day 0) only.  
7.1.6.  Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 Infection  
Study participants will have NP samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing by RT -PCR at time 
points specified in the applicable SoE ( Section 10.1). A study illness visit or a consultation will be 
arranged within 72 hours or as soon as possible to collect an NP or nasal swab sample (NP is 
preferred) to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR if a participant experiences any 
of the following:  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infection as defined by the CDC ( CDC 2020a ) 
• Close contact exposure to an individual confirmed to be infected with SARS -CoV -2 
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection  
If the partici pant had known close contact exposure to COVID -19 (eg, close contact exposure to 
someone with confirmed COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -19 exposure form.  
If scheduled, the study illness visit may collect additional clinical information at the i nvestigator’s 
discretion, including but not limited to medical history, physical examination, blood sampling for

multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses, includi ng SARS -CoV -2) to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. During this visit, a blood sample will 
also be collected for immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2. All findings will be recorded in 
the eCRF.  
If part icipants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection, the investigator will notify the 
participant and the participant’s primary care physician of the diagnosis. If the study participant 
does not have a primary care physician, the investigator will assist t hem in obtaining one. The 
participant will also be instructed on infection prevention measures consistent with local public 
health guidance.  
Any confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection occurring in participants will be captured as 
an MAAE along with rel evant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, 
and outcome. Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) 
after diagnosis ( Section 7.3.2 ). At this visit, an NP swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood sample 
will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection  
7.2. Immunogenicity Assessments  
Blood samples for immunogenici ty assessments will be collected at the time points indicated in 
the applicable SoE ( Section 10.1): The following analytes will be measured:  
• Serum nAb  level against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by pseudovirus and/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
• Serum bAb against SARS -CoV -2 spike protein measured by ligand binding assay 
specific to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein  
Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that backup samples are available and that vial volumes 
are likely to be adequate for future testing needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected 
will be recorded in the eCRF, and unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the 
blind a t the laboratory at all times and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. 
Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage requirements, 
will be provided in a separate study manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nA b levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by the Sponsor.  
According to the ICF ( Section 10.2.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be  used for future 
research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize the 
immune response to SARS -CoV -2, additional assay development, and the immune response across 
CoVs.

(unvaccinated SOT recipi ents who receive 3  doses  [Group  A2]), or at BD -D29 (for 
participants who receive BD), or later.  
7.3.1.  Surveillance for COVID -19 Symptoms  
According to the CDC as of 10 Jun 2020 ( CDC 2020b ), patients with COVID -19 have reported a 
wide range of symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Throughout the study, to 
survey for COVID -19, the participant will be instructed to notify the site if the following 
prespecified symptoms that meet the criteria for suspicion of COVID -19 occur. If any one of these 
symptoms lasts for at least 48 hours (except for fever and/or respiratory symptoms), the study staff 
will arrange an illness visit to collect an NP swab within 72 hours:  
• Fever (temperature ≥ 38°C/≥ 100.4°F) or chills (of any duration, including ≤ 48 
hours)  
• Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
• Cough (of any duration, including ≤ 48 hours)  
• Fatigue  
• Muscle or body aches  
• Headache  
• New loss of taste or smell  
• Sore throat  
• Congestion or runny nose  
• Nausea or vomiting  
• Diarr hea 
Surveillance for COVID -19 symptoms will also be conducted via eDiary prompts or telephone 
calls (alternating every 2 weeks) as specified in Section 7.1.1  and Section 7.1.2 , respectively.

weeks from Day 85 to Day 197 and again from Day 237 to Day 377.  
• For unvaccinated SOT participant s who receive 3 vaccine doses  (Group  A2), the eDiaries will 
be collected every 4 weeks starting on Day 127 through Day 239 and again from Day 279 
through Day 419. Safety calls will be made every 4 weeks starting on Day 141 through Day 
253 and again on Day 293 through Day 433.  
• For previously vaccinated SOT participants who receive dose 3 (Group  A3), the eDiaries will

It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with solicited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first 7 days after vaccination, when these solicited ARs are common, 
investigators should use their clini cal judgment to decide if an NP swab should be collected. The 
collection of an NP swab prior to the Day 1 and Day 29 vaccinations (for unvaccinated SOT and

vaccination (for previously vaccinated SOT recipients  [Group  A3]), and prior to BD -D1 (for 
participants who receive a BD in Part B)  can help ensure that cases of COVID -19 a re not 
overlooked. Any study participant who reports respiratory symptoms during the 7 -day period after 
vaccination should be evaluated for COVID -19. 
During the course of the study, participants with symptoms of COVID -19 will be asked to return 
within 72 h ours or as soon as possible to the study site to collect an NP swab sample (for RT -PCR) 
for evaluation of COVID -19 and collect a blood sample for immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection. Both study site visits and telemedicine visits are referred to  as illness visits 
(Section 7.1.6 ). The NP swab sample will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory 
infections. Additionally, a convalesc ent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) 
after diagnosis ( Section 7.3.2 ). At this visit, an NP swab sampling for viral PCR and a b lood sample 
will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection. In addition, the 
study site may collect an additional respiratory sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render 
appropriate medical care for the study particip ant as determined by local standards of care.  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for COVID -19 
and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72 hours of the study 
participant reporting sy mptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants who are 
hospitalized for COVID -19 without the opportunity for a clinic visit will also be considered cases, 
assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a respiratory sample is 
positive for SARS -CoV -2 by PCR at a clinical laboratory improvement amendments certified 
laboratory. Investigators are encouraged to try to obtain a respiratory sample during the course of 
hospitalization for submission to the study central laboratory, if fea sible. The investigator should 
determine if the criteria for severe COVID -19 have been met.  
Severe COVID -19 is defined in Section 7.3. 
All clinical findings will be recorded in the eCRF. All confirmed cases of COVID -19 will be 
captured as MAAEs, along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, 
seriousness, and outcome, and will be reported immediately to the Sponsor or designee 
(Section  7.5.4 ). 
7.3.2.  Follow -up/Convalescent Period After Diagnosis with COVID -19 
Any confirmed COVID -19 occurring in a participant will be captured as an  MAAE along with 
relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, and outcome. A 
convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, 
an NP swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood sam ple will be collected for potential immunologic

COVID -19 have been met. If the participant is hospitalized, medically qualified study site 
personnel will try t o obtain medical records and SARS -CoV -2 diagnostic results. If the participant 
is later discharged from the hospital during the 28 day period following diagnosis of COVID -19, 
the study site personnel will arrange for a resumption of the protocol schedule.  
7.4. Exploratory Assessments  
Qualitative and quantitative measures of viral load of SARS -CoV -2 will be assessed by RT -PCR 
of material from NP swab samples obtained at illness visits ( Section 7.3.1). Any SARS -CoV -2 
genetic sequencing will be performed on the same samples.  
In Part A, c ellular immune response (eg, markers of CMI, T -cells, and B -cells) will be assessed 
on Day 1 (before vacc ination) and on Day 36 and Day 92 in a subset of at least  50 unvaccinated 
SOT recipients (kidney or liver) who receive 3 doses  (Group  A2), from all 20 unvaccinated 
healthy study participants  (Group  A5) (Day 1 before vaccination and Day 36), and from a subset 
of at least 50 previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose  3 (Group  A3) (Day 1 
before vaccination and Day 8) . In Part B Booster Phase, CMI will also be assessed on BD -D1 
before vaccination  and BD -D8 from all participants in Part  B. 
Analysis of markers of CMI will be performed in a laboratory designated by the Sponsor.  
Blood samples for biomarker analysis  will be collected d uring BD -D4 (Part B of the study 
[Group  B2, Group  B3, Group  B4, and Group B5])  which will be stored for potential future 
biomarker assessment.  
Handling and preparation of the samples for analysis, as well as shipping and storage 
requirements, will be provided in a separate study manual.  
7.5. Safety Definitions and Related Procedures  
7.5.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not it is considered drug -related.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pr e-existing condition, including an increase 
in the frequency and/or severity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of vaccine even though they 
may have been present before the start of the study.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 132 Events NOT Meeting the  Adverse Event Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a ho spital).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.5.10 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and 
the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by the participant that is not speci fied as a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, for the 7 days after each dose of vaccine).  
7.5.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE (including an AR) is considere d an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator during 
the protocol -defined Follow -up Period must be reported to the Sponsor, whether or not it 
is considered related to the vaccine.  
• Is life -threatening  
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the Sponsor, 
its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, inpatient hospitalization indicates the participant was admitted to the  hospital 
or emergency ward for at least 1 overnight stay for observation and/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. The hospital or 
emergency ward admission should be considered an SAE regardless  of whether opinions 
differ as to the necessity of the admission. Complications that occur during inpatient 
hospitalization will be recorded as an AE; however, if a complication/AE prolongs 
hospitalization or otherwise fulfills SAE criteria, the complicati on/AE will be recorded as 
a separate SAE.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance, such a s uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
ModernaTX, Inc.  20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 133 accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Medic ally important event  
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeop ardize the participant or require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiri ng intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
7.5.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to th e occurrence and severity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after vaccine injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant reporting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section 7.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an eDiary 
on the day of each dose injection and for the 6 days after the day of dosing.  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in  Table 4 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS 2007 ). 
If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will 
be prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until it resolves 
or the next va ccine injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary 
should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond 
Day 7 should be reviewed by the study site staff either during the nex t scheduled telephone call or 
at the next study site visit. All solicited ARs (local and systemic) will be considered causally 
related to dosing.

otherwise meets the definition of an MAAE)  
• Solicited l ocal or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by the investigator (AE leading to 
withdrawal)  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days after injection  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to participant withdrawal from vaccine  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE  
7.5.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events  
A MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include  visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory test results follow -up, COVID -19 
[Section 7.3.1 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary care 
physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAE. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on the AE page of the eCRF.  
All confirmed COVID -19 cases ( Section 7.3.1 ) will be recorded as MAAEs and reported to the 
Sponsor or designee immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours, using the SAE 
Mailbox, the SAE Hotl ine, or the SAE Fax line ( Section 7.5.12 ). The investigator will submit any 
updated COVID -19 case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being ava ilable.  
7.5.5.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
investigator to the Sponsor i s required and documentation is in the form of a case narrative. Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Refer to 
Section  10.5, Appendix 5 for a list of AESIs pertinent to this study. All AESIs will be collected 
through the entire study period and must be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and 
in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system. If a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported AESI, and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site can report 
this informa tion on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax 
line ( Section 7.5.12 ).

Confidential   Page 138 Anaphylaxis  
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis  should be recorded as an AESI, a MAAEs, and reported as 
SAEs, based on criteria for a medically important event ( Section 7.5.2 ), unless the event mee ts 
other serious criteria. As an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee 
immediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours as per Section 7.5.12  (Reporting SAEs). The 
investigator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with 
anaphylaxis as show n below should be reported as a potential case of anaphylaxis. This is provided 
as general guidance for investigators and is based on the Brighton Collaboration case definition 
(Rüggeberg et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ -system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources. Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized 
by: 
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapid progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involving 2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
o Skin/mucosal:  urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes  
o Cardiovascula r: measured hypotension, clinical diagnosis of uncompensated shock, 
loss of consciousness or decreased level of consciousness, evidence of reduced 
peripheral circulation  
o Respiratory:  bilateral wheeze (bronchospasm), difficulty breathing, stridor, upper 
airway swelling (lip, tongue, throat, uvula, or larynx), respiratory distress, persistent 
dry cough, hoarse voice, sensation of throat closure, sneezing, rhinorrhea  
o Gastrointestinal:  diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting  
Acute Myocarditis and/or Pericard itis 
All suspected cases of probable or confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis should 
be recorded as an AESI, and reported as an SAE, if the event meets seriousness criteria. As an 
SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee im mediately and in all circumstances 
within 24 hours as per Section  7.5.12 . The investigator will submit any updated myocarditis, 
pericarditis, or myoper icarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. For 
reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent with the CDC case 
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 139 definitions as described below ( Gargano et al 2021 ), should be reported as a potential case of 
confirmed or probable myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.  
The CDC case definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help in the diagnosis and reporting 
of suspected cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis; however, the diagnosis of s uspected cases is 
left to the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
Acute Myocarditis Case Definition  
Presence of ≥ 1 new or worsening of the following clinical symptoms (persons who lack the listed 
symptoms but who meet other criteria may be classified as su bclinical myocarditis [probable or 
confirmed]):  
• Chest pain/pressure/discomfort  
• Dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing  
• Palpitations  
• Syncope  
AND  
For PROBABLE CASE:  
Presence of ≥ 1 new finding of the following:  
• Troponin level above upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
• Abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) or rhythm monitoring findings consistent 
with myocarditis  
o To meet the ECG or rhythm monitoring criterion, a probable case must include at 
least one of the following:  
▪ ST segment or T -wave  abnormalities  
▪ Paroxysmal or sustained atrial, supraventricular, or ventricular arrhythmias  
▪ AV nodal conduction delays or intraventricular conduction defects  
• Abnormal cardiac function or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram  
• Cardiac magnetic resonanc e imaging (cMRI) finding consistent with myocarditis 
(Ferreira et al 2018 ) 
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 140 For CONFIRMED CASE:  
• Histopathologic confirmation of myocarditis (using Dallas criteria [ Aretz et al 1987 ]) 
OR 
• cMRI findi ngs consistent with myocarditis in the presence of troponin level above 
upper limit of normal (any type of troponin)  
AND  
• No other identifiable cause of the symptoms and findings  
Acute Peri carditis  Case Definition  
Presence of ≥ 2 new or worsening of the following clinical features ( Adler et al 2015 ): 
• Acute chest pain (Typically described as pain made worse by lying down, deep 
inspiration, or cough; and relieved by sitting up or leaning forward, although other 
types of chest pain may occur)  
• Pericardial rub  on examination  
• New ST -elevation or PR -depression on EKG  
• New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiogram or magnetic resonance 
imaging  
Myopericarditis Case Definition  
Participants who meet criteria for both myocarditis and pericarditis may be descr ibed under 
myopericarditis.  
7.5.6.  Suspected or Confirmed Organ Transplant Rejection  
All cases of suspected or confirmed organ transplant rejection must be reported within EDC system 
as MAAEs. All cases of biopsy -proven organ transplant rejection should be report ed as SAEs, 
based on criteria for a medically important event ( Section 7.5.2 ). As an SAE, the event should be 
reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and, in all circumstances, within 24 hours as per 
Section 7.5.12  (Reporting SAEs).  Suspected cases of organ transplant rejection that meet the 
criteria for SAEs should also be reported as SAEs per the same processes. For confirmed AND 
suspected cases of organ t ransplant rejection, the investigator should provide all relevant data (eg, 
signs and symptoms, associated laboratory tests, diagnostic testing including imaging and 
procedures, and biopsy results) to the Sponsor within 24 hours of these data being availab le. 
After Day 57 (for unvaccinated  SOT recipients of 2 doses  [Group  A1]), after Day 113 
(unvaccinated  SOT recipients of 3 doses  [Group  A2]), or after Day 29 (previously vaccinated SOT

Confidential   Page 141 recipients who receive dose  3 [Group  A3]) or after BD -D29 for SOT partic ipants who receive a 
BD [Group  B2, Group  B3, and Group  B4]), the investigator will review the standard -of-care 
laboratory assessments and report any suspected or confirmed event of organ transplant rejection 
until the EOS.  
7.5.7.  Recording and Follow -up of Pregna ncy 
Female individuals who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test any time during the study should receive no further 
dosing with vaccine but should be asked to remain in the stud y and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment 
and until the end of their participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Spon sor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the study site learning of its occurrence, using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE 
Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section 7.5.12 ). If the participant agrees to submit this information, 
the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms w ill be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately (within 
24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome 
according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.5.8.  Elicitin g and Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after each dose. Other (unsolicited) 
AEs wil l be collected from Day 1 through 28 days after each dose.  
Both MAAEs and SAEs will be collected from participants as specified in the applicable SoE until 
the end of their participation in the study. Any AEs that occur before administration of vaccine 
will be analyzed separately from AEs.  
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 142 At every study site visit or telephone contact, participants will be asked a standard question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including COVID -19 symptoms) 
according to the scripts provided. P articipants will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, 
had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any nonstudy vaccinations.  
In addition to parti cipant observations, physical examination findings or data relevant to 
participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participan t 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU 
(as defined in Section 6.4). 
7.5.9.  Assessment of Severity  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE ( Section 7.5.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s daily activities. 
The T oxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative 
Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS 2007 ) will be used to categorize local and systemic reactogenicity 
events (solicited ARs), clinical laboratory test results and vital sign measurements observed during 
this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are presented in 
Section  7.5.3 . Specific criteria for vital signs and laboratory abnormalities are presented in 
Section  10.4, Appendix 4, and will be graded if outside of the reference range for the laboratory 
utilized. For laboratory abnormalities not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the 
guidelines for all unsolicited AEs will be used to describe severity.  
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by the investigator based 
upon medical judgment and the definitions of severity as follows:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These events cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intens ive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Determination of Severe COVID -19 is described in Section 7.3. 
Study staff should elicit from the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 143 documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s source 
documentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be 
performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset and duration of 
each episode. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the course of the event is reported once in 
the eCRF  at the highest severity observed.  
7.5.10.  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to vaccine is part of the documentation 
process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator wi ll assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the following 
classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a r elationship to the vaccine. Participant did 
not receive the vaccine OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the 
vaccine is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the vaccine.  
Related:  There is a r easonable possibility of a relationship to the vaccine. There is evidence of 
exposure to the vaccine. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of 
the vaccine is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the vaccine than by another cause.  
7.5.11.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the study, 
regardless of their relationship to vaccine or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to 
whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes the type of event, time of onset, investigator specifie d 
assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and relationship to vaccine, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. 
The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesse s, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions 
to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be 
followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by the investigator to be not clinically 
significant. Th e Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code all 
unsolicited AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. Howev er, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.

Confidential   Page 144 7.5.12.  Reporting SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by the investigator or that meets SAE criteria ( Section 7.5.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE); these 
include anaphylaxis and confirmed organ transplant rejection. The investigator will assess whether 
there is a reasonabl e possibility that the vaccine caused the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible 
for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US CFR Parts 
312 and 320. The investigator is responsible for notifying the institutional revi ew board (IRB) 
directly.  
If the eCRF is unavailable at the time of the SAE, the following contact information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
• SAE Mailbox: Safety_Moderna@iqvia.com  
• SAE Hotline (USA): +1 -866-599-1341  
• SAE Fax line (USA): +1 -866-599-1342  
Regu latory reporting requirements for SAEs are described in Section 7.5.16 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, d ocumenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to vaccine or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the study.  
7.5.13.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of vaccine dosing but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF 
and not in the AE section; however, if the condition worsens at any time during the study, it will 
be recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and nonleading manner  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6 days after each dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through 28 days after each dose.  
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 145 SAEs will be collected from the start of vaccine dosing until the last day of study participation.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any upda ted SAE data to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of it being available.  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by the investigator to be clinically significant (eg, leads to dose modifica tion or study 
drug discontinuation, or meets any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must be recorded in the 
source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that produced the 
value or result should be repeated until that v alue or result returns to normal or is stabilized and 
the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EOS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any t ime after a participant has withdrawn 
from or completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to 
the vaccine or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
7.5.14.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Electronic diaries have specifically been designed for this study by the Sponsor. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and severity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs)  and concomitant 
medications/vaccinations.  
The investigator is responsible for the documentation of AEs regardless of suspected causal 
relationship to vaccine. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate 
to determine the outco me of the AE and to assess whether the AE meets the criteria for 
classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about the 
occurrence of AEs.  
7.5.15.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequen t visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTFU, as defined in Section  6.4, 
including ongoing SAEs after study completion.

Confidential   Page 146 7.5.16.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the Sponsor of a SAE is essential so that 
legal obligati ons and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agenci es about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports m ust be prepared for suspected unexpected serious ARs 
according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific s afety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.  
7.6. Safety Monitoring  
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical m onitor, and the individual study site 
investigator(s) will monitor safety throughout the study.  
7.6.1.  Safety Review Committee  
An independent safety review committee (SRC) consisting of transplant nephrologist(s) and 
hepatologist(s) not involved in the conduct of  the study will monitor and adjudicate for events of 
organ transplant rejection starting from Day 1 and throughout the study period. The SRC will 
operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at the 
organizational meeting  of the SRC. Details regarding the SRC composition, responsibilities, 
procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
In Part A, the  investigator will review laboratory safety assessments of kidney and liver function 
performed as part of the study at Day 1, Day 8, Day 29, Day 36, and Day 57 for unvaccinated SOT 
recipients who receive 2 doses (Group  A1) and on additional Days 85, 92, an d 113 for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 3 doses  (Group  A2), and at Day 1 ( dose 3), Day 8, and 
Day 29 for previously vaccinated SOT recipients  (Group  A3), for close monitoring around the 
time of vaccination. In Part B, the investigator will review  laboratory safety assessments of kidney 
and liver function performed as part of the study at  BD-D1, BD -D8, and BD -D29. If any of the 
following criteria are met, the laboratory test(s) must be repeated within 3 days: an increase in 
serum creatinine ≥ 25% f rom baseline or increase in UPCR > 0.5 g/g from baseline in kidney SOT 
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 147 recipients, and an increase in ALT or AST > 3x the baseline in liver SOT recipients. Additional 
tests may be performed at the discretion of the investigator upon approval of the Sponsor . The 
investigator should perform a clinical assessment (eg, elicit a history/narrative of the event, 
perform a physical examination, request diagnostic tests such as imaging or biopsy) of any 
laboratory abnormality if there is suspicion of an organ transp lant rejection. Clinical referral to a 
transplant specialist for further assessment may be performed by the investigator if needed. A 
confirmed diagnosis of organ transplant rejection will be based on histologic assessment or tissue 
biopsy. After Day 57 (u nvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 2 doses  [Group  A1]), after Day 
113 (unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 3 doses  [Group  A2]), or after Day 29 (previously 
vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 [Group  A3]) in Part A , or after BD -D29 in Part B 
Booster Phase, the investigator will review standard -of-care laboratory assessments and report any 
suspected or confirmed event of organ transplant rejection until the EOS. The investigator or 
designee is responsible for reporting to the Sponsor, via the  EDC system within 24  hours of 
observation and subsequently routed to SRC for independent review, if any of the following is 
met: 
1. Any of the thresholds for kidney or liver function test is met, confirmed by repeat test, 
and clinically assessed as suggestiv e of organ transplant rejection,  
2. Any suspected event of organ transplant rejection based on clinically significant kidney 
or liver function test(s) associated with signs and symptoms suggestive of transplant 
rejection, or  
3. Any report of biopsy -proven organ transplant rejection.  
The SRC will assess if the event is a true case of organ transplant rejection. The Sponsor will then 
make a final decision on whether to suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on 
assessment of the overall potential safet y risk to study participants or potential participants who 
have undergone SOT.  
7.6.2.  Internal Safety Committee and Study Pause Rules  
An internal safety team (IST) will be created specifically to review safety and reactogenicity data 
after:  
• At least 10 SOT recipi ents have received their third dose of study vaccine and have at 
least 7 days of reactogenicity data  
• At least 55  SOT recipients have received their third dose of study vaccine, unless a 
safety event requires earlier review  
• Any other ad hoc safety concerns based on ongoing safety surveillance  
ModernaTX, Inc.   20 Dec 2021  
Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4   mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 148 The IST will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed at 
the organizational meeting of the IST. Details regarding the IST composition, responsibilities, 
procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
Study pause rules will be implemented and will only remain in effect until all study participants 
who consented to receive a third dose have received their third dose of vaccine. If the following 
occur, vaccin ation with third dose may be temporarily suspended until expedited Sponsor review 
of safety data take place to assess over all potential safety risk to SOT recipients:  
• Reactogenicity: Two Grade 4 solicited local or systemic reactogenicities that are 
relate d to the vaccine  
• Hypersensitivity: Five SOT recipients experiencing a severe systemic allergic 
reaction that is related to the vaccine  
• Adverse Event: Three SAEs or Grade 4 AEs (laboratory and vital sign abnormalities 
per Section  10.4, Appendix 4 reported as AEs by the investigator) that are related to 
the vaccine  
• Fatal Outcome: One death that is related to the vaccine  
The investigators, study medical monitor, and Sponsor w ill monitor for events that could trigger a 
study pause. The investigator or designee is responsible for reporting to the Sponsor, via the EDC 
system within 24 hours of observation, each event potentially meeting any pause rule criterion.  
7.6.3.  Independent Cardi ac Event Adjudication Committee  
An independent cardiac event adjudication committee (CEAC) that includes pediatric and adult 
cardiologists will review suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet 
CDC criteria of “probable” or “ confirmed” events, and to assess severity ( Gargano et al 2021 ). 
Any cases that the CEAC assesses as representing probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or 
pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, which will then make a final decision on whether to  
suspend further enrollment and/or study dosing based on assessment of the overall potential risk 
to study participants or potential study participants.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed 
at the o rganizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC composition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.  
7.7. Treatment of Overdose  
As the study treatment is to be administered by a healthcare profess ional, it is unlikely that an 
overdose will occur. Dose deviations will be tracked as protocol deviations ( Section 10.2.8 ).

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. The 
details of statistical analysis will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be 
finalized before the clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to  primary and/or 
secondary objectives or the statistical methods related to the study objectives after the study has 
begun but prior to any data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH 
Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol has 
been finalized, along with an explanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in the 
SAP or clinical study report (CSR) for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be 
clearly identi fied in the CSR.  
This is an open -label study aimed to describe the safety and Ab responses elicited following doses 
of mRNA -1273 vaccine among SOT recipients compared to the Ab responses of adult healthy 
participants in this study and Study P301. Using the  Ab threshold established from Study P301 (if 
available at the time of database lock), an additional exploratory analysis will be performed by 
measuring the number and proportion of participants with a serum Ab level at Day 57 (for 
unvaccinated  participant s who receive 2 doses), at Day 113 (for unvaccinated SOT recipients who 
receive 3 doses), at Day 29 (for previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3), and at 
BD-D29 (for participants who receive a BD  in Part  B), greater than or equal to the Ab threshold 
of protection against COVID -19. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.  
Given that the study does not have a concurrent unvaccinated SOT control group, descriptive 
statistics will be used to present safety data, and no comparisons with th e healthy adult participants 
will be made.  
8.1. Sample Size  
The study vaccine, mRNA -1273, is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity study in an adult population at high risk of COVID -19 disease (Study P301). 
Success criteria for early efficacy was met at the first interim analysis based on 95 adjudicated 
cases with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p value < 0.0001 of 
testing the null hypothesis of VE ≤ 30%). Study P301 is expected to provid e immunogenicity data 
by which an Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 will be estimated.  
This current study, which aims to evaluate Ab responses following a second , third , or fourth 
(booster)  dose of mRNA -1273 vaccine among kidney and liver transpl ant recipients, is expected 
to provide clinical data to determine whether vaccination with mRNA -1273 will induce vaccine 
response in this cohort of immunocompromised participants that is comparable to those of the 
participants in Study  P301 and comparable to those of the concurrently assessed cohort of 
participants in this study with normal immune function.

Confidential   Page 151 With 200 SOT participants, if the true AE rate of biopsy -proven organ rejection is 3%, there is 
approximately >95% probability to observe at least 1 sub ject reporting such an AE.  
The planned sample size of approximately 240 participants (220 unvaccinated or previously 
vaccinated participants who have had a kidney or liver transplant and 20 unvaccinated healthy 
participants) who receive 2 -dose regimen and 3-dose regimens of 100 µg of mRNA -1273 , or 
100 µg BD regimen are  expected to provide useful estimates of Ab response at Day 29 for 
previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 in Part A, and Day 113 for unvaccinated 
SOT recipients who receive th e 3-dose regimen,  at Day 57 for unvaccinated participants  who 
receive the 2 -dose regimen , and at BD -D29 for Part B participants  (participants who receive a BD) 
(primary endpoints), respectively, for comparison to results from Study  P301 (if available at th e 
time of database lock). The healthy adult participants will be used primarily as a biological control 
for the CMI analysis. This study is designed for estimation purposes, and no between -group 
comparisons are planned.

8.3.3.  Immunogenicity Analyses  
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses. The PP Immunogenicity 
Subset is the primary analysis set for immunogenicity unless otherwise specified. In Part A, t he 
primary immunogenicity objective of this study is to evaluate serum Ab  responses obtained 28 
days after the second or third injection of 100 µg mRNA -1273 (Day  57 for unvaccinated 
participants who receive 2 doses, Day 113 for unvaccinated SOT recipients  who receive 3 doses, 
and Day  29 for previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3) in adult kidney and liver 
transplant recipients.  In Part B , the primary immunogenicity objective of this study is to evaluate 
serum Ab responses ob tained 28 days after the BD.  
The study will also evaluate Ab responses obtained at Day 29  (28 days after dose 1), Day 209 
(6 months after dose 2), and Day 394 (1 year after dose  2) for unvaccinated participants who 
receive the 2 -dose regimen; at Days 1, 29, and 85, as well as 28 days and 6 and 12  months after 
the third dose for unvaccinated SO T recipients who receive the 3 -dose regimen;  at Day  1 (dose 3)

Confidential   Page 155 and Day 29 (28 days after dose 3), as well as 6 and 12 months after dose 3 for previously 
vaccinated SOT recipients ; and  at BD -D29 for participants who receive a BD . The results of the 
study wi ll be described and evaluated against the Ab responses of adult healthy participants in this 
study and Study P301 (if available at the time of database lock).  
Using the Ab threshold established from Study P301 (if available at the time of database lock), a n 
additional exploratory analysis will be performed by measuring the proportion of participants with 
a serum Ab level at Day 29 (previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3 ), Day 113 
(unvaccinated SOT recipients who receive 3 -dose regimen), an d Day 57 (unvaccinated participants 
who receive 2  doses)  in Part A, and at BD -29 (participants who receive BD) greater than or equal 
to the Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19, with a 2 sided 95% CI using the Clopper 
Pearson method by cohort arm.  
The GM level of serum Ab with corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each time point by 
cohort arm. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log transformed 
values then back transformed to the original scale for presentation. Addit ionally, the proportion of 
participants with a 2 ×, 3×, and 4 × rise in GM level from Day 1 will be measured.  
All nAb and bAb endpoints ( Table  1, Study Objectives and Endpoints) will be summarized at each 
time point with Day 29 (previously vaccinated SOT recipients who receive dose 3), Day 57 
(unvaccinated participants who receive 2 doses  ), Day 113 (unvaccinated SOT participants who 
receive 3  doses)  and BD -29 (participants who receive BD)  as the time points of interest. The GM 
levels and GMFRs of both nAb and bAb will be provided with corresponding 95% CIs.  
Reverse cumulative distr ibution curves for antibody titers for all time points will be presented.  
8.3.4.  Incident Cases of COVID -19 After Vaccination  
The number and percentage of participants with COVID -19 after vaccination in the SOT recipient 
and healthy comparison cohorts will be pro vided. The number and percentage of participants with 
severe COVID -19 will be provided similarly.  
For serologically confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection or COVID -19, regardless of symptomatology 
or severity, infection rate will be provided by the healthy cohort arm. 
As an additional analysis, the number and percentage of participants with symptomatic and 
asymptomatic COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection throughout the study will be summarized.  
8.3.5.  Exploratory Analyses  
The magnitude, phenotype, and percentage of cytokine producing S protein -specific T -cells will 
be summarized in Part A at Day 1, Day 36, and Day 92 for unvaccinated SOT recipients and at 
Day 1 and Day  8 for previously vaccinated SOT recipients, and at Day  1 and Day 36 for healthy

Confidential   Page 165 10.1. APPENDIX 1: Schedule of Events  
The primary SoEs are presented in  Table 8, Table 9, Table 9, and Table 10. 
If a participant cannot attend a study site visit (scheduled or unscheduled) with the exception of 
Screening (Day 0), BD-D1, Day 1, Day 29, or Day 85 (for unvaccinated 3 -dose regimen 
recipients), a telemedicine visit is acceptable if performed by appropriately delegated study site 
staff ( Section  7). If a participant visit to the study site is not possible (with the aforementioned 
exceptions), a safety telephone call should be performed that includes the assessments scheduled 
for the safety telephone calls.  
In Part A, if the visit for t he second or third dose (Day 29 for healthy participants or Day 85 for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 or Day 85 -3/+7 
days as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activi ties 
following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at home” or 
“shelter in place”), the visit window may be extended to Day 29 or Day 85 + 21 days.  In Part A, 
when the extended visit window is used, the remaining study clin ic visits should be rescheduled 
to follow the scheduled inter -visit interval from the actual date of the second (or third) dose. The 
timing of ediary follow -ups and safety calls will not be adjusted if the last dose is delayed. 
Additional safety calls ever y 4 weeks should be scheduled if there is a gap beyond 28 days between 
the safety call scheduled on D377 (for 2 doses) or D433 (for 3 doses) and the last study visit

Note : In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Em ergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), investigators may 
convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 visit may be performed over multiple visits if perfo rmed wit hin the 7 -day screening window. 
Demographic variables (ie, age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (ie, height, weight, body mass index, date of transplant, type of SOT, type of transplant, 
indication for transplant, ABO blood group sta tus, and relevant medical history) will be collected.  
2. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit as a result of the COVID -19 
pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at home” o r “shelter in 
place”), a safety telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the study site visit. The safety telep hone call should encompass all scheduled visit assessments 
that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled safety te lephone calls). Telemedicine will be 
permitted for all nondosing visits,  with the exception of Screening, if a participant cannot visit the study site as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Telemedicine visits must 
be permitted by the study site IRB and the participant via informed consent and have prior approval from the Spons or (or its designee).  
3. If the visit for the second dose (Day 29) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 29 -3/+7 days as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of 
study site activities following business continuity plans and/o r local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), the visit window may be extended to 
Day 29  + 21 days . When the extended visit window is used, the remaining clinic study visits D36 (last dose + 7 days) , D57 (last dose + 28 days) , 6 mo nth visit (last dose + 
180 days), and 12 month visit (last dose + 365 days)  should be rescheduled to follow the scheduled inter -visit interval from the actual date of the second dose. The timing of 
ediary follow -ups and safety calls will not be adjusted. A dditional safety calls every 4 weeks should be scheduled if there is a gap beyond 28 days between the  last safety call 
and the last study visit.  Participants who agree to receive a booster dose in Part B of the study will follow the schedule of events for Part B  (see Table 10). 
4. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 71 to Day 183 and again from Day 223 to Day 363. 
5. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 85 to Day 197 and again from Day 237 to Day 377.  
6. Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed to determine eligi bility prior to administration of vaccine dose on Day  1. 
Body mass index will be calculated only at the screening visit (Day 0). Symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed at Day 29, Day 57, Day 209, and Day 
394. Any clinically significant fi nding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
7. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm that received the injection should be examin ed and the associated lymph nodes must be 
evaluated. Any clini cally significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
8. Vital signs are to be measured pre - and post -dose on days of injection (Day 1 and Day 29). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood collection. 
Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F) before injection on Day 1, or Day 29 must have the visit resc heduled within the relevant visit window to 
receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at th e discretion of the investigator.  
9. The pregnancy test at Screening and Day 1 and before the second study injection will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test 
either via blood or point -of-care urine test can b e performed at any time.  
10. Samples for safety laboratory assessments (serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR for kidney transplant recipients only; A LT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin for liver 
transplant recipients only) must be collected prior to dosing on Day  1 and Day 29.  
11. After Day 57, the investigator will review standard -of-care kidney and liver laboratory assessments and report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or confirmed events 
of organ transplant rejection until the EOS.  
12. Samples for immunogenici ty (bAb against SARS -CoV -2 spike protein and neutralizing antibody against SARS -CoV -2) and assessment of SARS -CoV -2 bAb against the 
nonvaccine antigen (nucleocapsid protein) must be collected prior to dosing on Day 1, and Day 29.  
13. For assessment of cellular  immune response, blood samples will be collected on Day 1 (prior to dosing) and Day 36. Note that 20 healthy participants receiving 2 -dose 
regimen will also have blood samples collected at Day 1 (prior to dosing) and Day 36.  
14. The NP swab sample will be col lected prior to dosing and used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.

Confidential   Page 169 15. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the prespecified criteria of 
suspicion for COVID -19 (Section 7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an u nscheduled illness visit, to 
include an NP swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations including blood sample collection for immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection 
(bAb against the nonvaccine antigen [nucleocapsid protein]). If a study site visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by a 
Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP swab samples will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. N P swab samples will also be 
tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the study site may collect an additional NP sample for S ARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render 
appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined  by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to evaluate the 
severity of the clinical case.  
16. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, an NP swab sam pling for viral PCR and a blood sample will be 
collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
17. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with in struction pr ovided by study staff. Study participants 
will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day  of injection and for 6 days following injection. If a 
solicited local or systemic AR con tinues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic  AR in the 
eDiary until the AR is resolved or the next vaccine injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after each 
vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the fol lowing study visit.  
18. Trained study site personnel will call all participants to c ollect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing and/or 
study participation (withdrawal), information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstudy vacci nations. In addition,  study personnel will 
collect information on known participant close contact exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 
symptoms.  
19. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations will be r ecorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of 
an SAE, confirmed (biopsy -proven) or suspected events of organ transplant rejection, or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through the final visit ( Day 394).  
20. All immunosuppressant medications, for 3 months prior to Screening and throughout the study. Any change in the maintenance th erapy should be recorded and the reason 
for the change documented.  
21. Additional safety calls every 4 weeks should be schedu led if the last dose was delayed and there is a gap beyond 28 days between the safety call scheduled on D377 and the 
last study visit.

Note : In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS 2020 ), investigators may 
convert study site visits to telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 visit may be performed over multiple visits if performed within the 7-day screening 
window. Demographic variables (ie, age, sex, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (ie, height, weight,  body mass index, date of transplant, type of SOT, type 
of transplant, indication for transplant, ABO blood group status, and relevant medical history) will be collected.  
2. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. I f the participant is not able to attend a study site visit as a result of the COVID -19 
pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at home” or “shelter in 
place”), a safety telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the study site visit. The safety telephone call  should encompass all scheduled visit 
assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medica tions (eg, as defined in scheduled safety telephone calls). Telemedicine 
will be permitted for all nondosing visits, with the exception of Screening, if a participant cannot visit the study site as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. Telemedicine 
visits mus t be permitted by the study site IRB and the participant via informed consent and have prior approval from the Sponsor (or it s designee).  
3. If the visit for the  third  dose (Day 85) is disrupted and cannot be completed at Day 85  -3/+7 day s as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of 
study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at home” or “shelter in place”), the visit window may be extended to 
+ 21 Day 85. W hen the extended visit window is used, the remaining clinic study visits D92 (last dose + 7 days), D113 (last dose  + 28 days), 6 month visit (last dose + 
180 days), and 12 month visit (last dose + 365 days) should be rescheduled to follow the scheduled int er-visit interval from the actual date of the  third dose. The timing 
of ediary follow -ups and safety calls will not be adjusted. Additional safety calls every 4 weeks should be scheduled if there is a gap beyond  28 days between the last 
safety call  and the last study visit.  Participants who agree to receive a booster dose in Part B of the study will follow the schedule of events for Part B  (see Table 10).

Confidential   Page 173 4. Safety follow -up via an eDiary questionnaire will be performed every 4 weeks from Day 127 to Day 239 and again from Day 279 to Day 419.  
5. Safety follow -up via a safety telephone call will be p erformed every 4 weeks from Day 141 to Day 253 and again from Day 293 to Day 433.  
6. Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed to determine eligibility prior to administration of vaccine dose on  
Day 1. Body mass index will be calculated only at the screening visit (Day 0). Symptom -directed physical examinations will be performed at Day 29, Day 57, Day 85, 
Day 113, Day 265, and Day 450. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit sho uld be reported as an MAAE.  
7. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm that received the injection should be examin ed and the associated lymph nodes must be 
evaluated. Any clinically significant finding identified duri ng a study visit should be reported as an MAAE.  
8. Vital signs are to be measured pre - and post -dose on days of injection (Day 1, Day 29, and Day 85). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood 
collection. Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/≥ 100.4°F) before injection on Day 1, Day 29, or Day 85 must have the visit rescheduled within the 
relevant visit window to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be enrolled at the discretion of the inve stigator.  
9. The pregnancy test at Screening, Day 1, and before the second and third study injections will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a 
pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine test can be performed at any time.  
10. Samples for safety laboratory assessments (serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR for kidney transplant recipients only; A LT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin for liver 
transplant recipients only) must be collected prior to dosing on Day 1, Day 29, and  Day 85.  
11. After Day 113, the investigator will review standard -of-care kidney and liver laboratory assessments and report any laboratory -related AEs and suspected or confirmed 
events of organ transplant rejection until the EOS.  
12. Samples for immunogenicity (b Ab against SARS -CoV -2 spike protein and neutralizing antibody against SARS -CoV -2) and assessment of SARS -CoV -2 bAb against the 
nonvaccine antigen (nucleocapsid protein) must be collected prior to dosing on Day 1, Day 29, and Day 85.  
13. For assessment of cellu lar immune response, blood samples will be collected on Day 1 (prior to dosing), Day 36, and Day 92 from a subset of at least  50 unvaccinated 
SOT recipients (kidney or liver).  
14. The NP swab sample will be collected prior to dosing and used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
15. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the prespecified 
criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section 7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled 
illness visit, to include an NP swab sa mple (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations including blood sample collection for immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection (bAb against the nonvaccine antigen [nucleocapsid protein]). If a study site visit is not possible, the participa nt will be asked to submit a saliva 
sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP swab samples will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 
infection. NP swab samples will also be tested for the presenc e of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the study site may collect an additional NP sample for 
SARS -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. A dditionally, clinica l information 
will be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
16. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, an NP swab sampling fo r viral PCR and a blood sample will be 
collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
17. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while at the study site with in struction provided by study staff. Study 
participants will con tinue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of inje ction and for 6 days 
following injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the partici pant will be prompted to capture details of the solicited local 
or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR is resolved or the next vaccine injection occurs, whichever occurs first; capture o f details of ARs in the eDiary should not 
exceed 28 days after each  vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in the eDiary beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the fol lowing study 
visit.  
18. Trained study site personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any AEs, MAAEs, SAE s, AESIs, AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing 
and/or study participation (withdrawal), information on concomitant medications associated with those events, and any nonstud y vaccinations. In addition, study 
personnel will collect information on known  participant close contact exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant 
experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
19. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the 
treatment of an SAE, confirmed (biopsy -proven) or suspected events of organ transplant rejection, or MAAE will be recorded from Day 1 through the final visit 
(Day  450).

may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as a MAAE.  
3. On dosing day before injection, the arm receivi ng the injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated.  
4. Vital signs are to be collected pre - and post -dosing (participant will be seated for at least 5 minutes before all measurements are taken per Section  7.1.4 ) on the day of 
injection (BD -D1). Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing (BD -D1) must be rescheduled to receive the inject ion. Afebrile 
participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.  
5. The pregnancy test at the BD-1 visit  will be a point -of-care urine test. At the discretion of the investigator, a pregnancy test either via blood or po int-of-care urine test can 
be performed.  
6. Samples for immunogenicity (bAb against SARS -CoV -2 spike protein and neutralizing antibody against SARS -CoV -2) and assessment of SARS -CoV -2 bAb against the 
nonvaccine antigen (nucleocapsid protein) must be collected  prior to dosing on BD -D1. 
7. For assessment of cellular immune response, blood samples will be collected on Day 1 (prior to dosing), and Day 8 from previo usly vaccinated SOT recipients (kidney or 
liver).  
8. All participants who chose to receive a BD. Serum samp le from two ~4 mL blood draws. Biomarker plasma and biomarker serum samples will be stored for potential 
future biomarker assessment.  
9. Samples for safety laboratory assessments (serum creatinine, urine protein, and UPCR for kidney transplant recipients only ; ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin for liver 
transplant recipients only) must be collected prior to dosing on BD-D1. 
10. After BD-D29, the investigator will review standard -of-care kidney and liver laboratory assessments and report any laboratory -related AEs and s uspected or confirmed 
events of organ transplant rejection until the EOS.  
11. Post-dosing, participants will have a 30 -minute observation period.  
12. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by reactogenicity issues, illness visit criteria for COVID -19, or new or ongo ing AEs. If a participant meets the prespecified 
criteria of suspicion for COVID -19 (Section 7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled 
illness visit, to include an NP swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations including blood sample collection for immunologic assessment of SARS -
Co-V2 infection (bAb a gainst the nonvaccine antigen [nucleocapsid protein]). If a study site visit is not possible, the participant will be asked t o submit a saliva sample to 
the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP swab samples will be collect ed to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. NP swab 
samples will also be tested for the presence of other respiratory pathogens. In addition, the study site may collect an addit ional NP sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to be 
able to render approp riate medical care for the study participant as determined by local standards of care. Additionally, clinical information wil l be carefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
13. The NP swab sample will be collected prior to dosing on BD -D1 and used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
14. Trained study personnel will call all participants to collect information relating to any unsolicited AEs, MAAEs (including a ny signs and symptoms of COVID -19), 
AESIs, AEs leading to withdrawa l, SAEs, information on concomitant medications associated with those events, any nonstudy vaccinations , and any changes in 
immunosuppressant medications . 
15. Diary entries will be recorded by the participant at approximately 30 minutes after injection while a t the study site with instruction provided by study staff. Study 
participants will continue to record entries in the eDiary each day after they leave the study site, preferably in the evenin g, on the day of injection and for 6 days 
following injection. If a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be prompted to capture detail s of the solicited local 
or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR resolves; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary should not exc eed 28 days after vaccination. Adverse reactions recorded in 
eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the following study visit.  
16. Review of eDiary will occur on BD -D8. 
17. All concomitant medications and nonstudy vaccinations wil l be recorded through 28 days after injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatment of 
an SAE, confirmed (biopsy -proven) or suspected events of organ transplant rejection, or MAAE will be recorded from BD -D1 through the final visit (BD-D181). In 
addition, for SOT participants who completed the primary vaccination series under EUA, the previous doses of the COVID -19 vaccine will be recorded in the 
participant’s eCRF regardless of the timing.  
18. All immunosuppressant medications, for 3 mo nths prior to Screening and throughout the study. Any change in the maintenance therapy should be recorded and the 
reason for the change documented.

Confidential   Page 185 According to ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the proper 
conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on the eCRFs. 
The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Sponsor in the maintenance of 
complete, accurate, legible, well -organi zed, and easily retrievable data. The study monitor will 
advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, 
and inspection by providing direct access to the source data/documents. In addition, the study 
monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator all regulations applicable to the clinical 
evaluation of a vaccine as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation throughout 
the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; to verify 
completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study conduct 
to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the Clin ical Monitoring Plan. During the study, 
a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the investigational 
site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain accep table.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that vaccine accountability checks are 
being performed.  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical recor d system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent.  
• Confirm that AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs, that any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and that those SAEs that met criteria 
for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.

reasons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) will be promptly notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, potential 
benefit of the study, or participant safety, including changes of study objectives, study design, 
participant population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant administrative aspects, will 
require a formal amendment  to the protocol. Such an amendment will be released by the Sponsor, 
agreed upon by the investigator(s), and approved by the relevant IRB(s) prior to implementation. 
A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant amended documents,  and 
the ICF have been approved by relevant IRB(s) must be provided to the Sponsor before the study 
is initiated.  
Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted . These administrative changes will be released by 
the Sponsor, agreed upon by the investigators, and notified to the IRB(s).  
10.2.8.  Protocol Deviations  
The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of protocol deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the study site 
and implemented promptly.  
It is the responsibility of the study site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and 
report protocol deviations to the Sponso r or its designee. All protocol deviations must be addressed 
in study source documents and reported to study monitor. Protocol deviations must be sent to the 
reviewing IRB per their policies. The study site investigator is responsible for knowing and 
adher ing to the reviewing IRB requirements.  
10.2.9.  Data Protection

Confidential   Page 189 Individual participant medical information obtained as a result of this study is considered 
confidential, and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Information will be accessible to 
authorized parties or personnel only. Me dical information may be given to the participant’s 
physician or to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the participant’s well -being. 
Each participant will be asked to complete a form allowing the investigator to notify the 
participant’s pr imary health care provider of his/her participation in this study.  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records will be identified in a 
manner designed to maintain participant confidentiality. All records will be kept in a secure storage 
area with limited access. Clinical information will not be released without the written permission 
of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor, its designee, 
the relevant regulatory authority, or the IRB.  
The investigator and all employees and coworkers involved with this study may not disclose or 
use for any purpose other than performance of the study any data, record, or other unpublished, 
confidential information disclosed to those individuals for the purpos e of the study. Prior written 
agreement from the Sponsor or its designee must be obtained for the disclosure of any confidential 
information to other parties.  
10.2.10.  Sample Retention and Future Biomedical Research  
The retention period of laboratory samples will b e 20 years, or as permitted by local regulations, 
to address further scientific questions related to mRNA -1273 or antirespiratory virus immune 
response. In addition, identifiable samples can be destroyed at any time at the request of the 
participant. Durin g the study, or during the retention period, in addition to the analysis outlined in 
the study endpoints, exploratory analysis may be conducted using other Ab -based methodologies 
on any remaining blood or serum samples, including samples from participants who are screened 
but are not subsequently enrolled. These analyses will extend the search for other potentially 
relevant biomarkers to investigate the effect of mRNA -1273, as well as to determine how changes 
in biomarkers may relate to exposure and clinica l outcomes. A decision to perform such 
exploratory research may arise from new scientific findings related to the drug class or disease, as 
well as reagent and assay availability.  
10.2.11.  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
The Sponsor shares information about cl inical trials and results on publicly accessible websites, 
based on international and local legal and regulatory requirements, and other clinical trial 
disclosure commitments established by pharmaceutical industry associations. These websites 
include clini caltrials.gov, EU clinical trial register (eu.ctr), as well as some national registries.

10.2.12.  Data Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the study site under the supervision 
of the study site inve stigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded in the eCRF unless 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electr onically (eg, laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
physically or electronically signing the eCRF.  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports 
the information entered in the eCRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• Monitoring details describing strategy (eg, risk -based initia tives in operations and 
quality such as Risk Management and Mitigation Strategies and Analytical Risk 
Based Monitoring), methods, responsibilities, and requirements, including handling 
of noncompliance issues and monitoring techniques (central, remote, or on site 
monitoring), are provided in the Clinical Monitoring Plan.  
• The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study, 
including quality checking of the data.  
• The Sponsor assumes accountability for actions delegated to other indiv iduals (eg, 
CRO).  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data 
entered into the eCRF by authorized study site personnel are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of partici pants are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently

Protocol mRNA -1273 -P304 Amendment 4  mRNA -1273  
 
Confidential   Page 191 approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertainin g to the conduct of this 
study must be retained by the investigator for a period of at least 2 years after the last 
marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following the 
discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If this requ irement differs from any 
local regulations, the local regulations will take precedence unless the local retention 
policy is less than 2 years. No records may be destroyed during the retention period 
without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records m ay be transferred to another 
location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated, do cumented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A quality assurance representative from the Sponsor or a qualified designee, who is independent 
of and separated from routine monitoring, may periodically arran ge inspections/audits of the 
clinical study by reviewing the data obtained and procedural aspects. These inspections may 
include onsite inspections/audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is 
required for the purpose of these period ic inspections/audits.  
10.2.13.  Data Collection and Management  
This study will be conducted in compliance with ICH CGP guidelines. This study will also be 
conducted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study will use elect ronic data collection to collect data directly from the study site using 
eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data.  
Study  monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between the 
eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved in accordance with the principles of 
GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the Clinic al Monitoring Plan.  
Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using the 
WHO Drug Dictionary.  
10.2.14.  Source Documents  
Source documents are original documents or certified copies and include, but are not limited to, 
eDiaries, m edical and hospital records, screening logs, ICFs, telephone contact logs, and 
worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and

Confidential   Page 192 substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the invest igator’s 
study site.  
Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must 
be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The investigator 
may need to request previous medical recor ds or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, 
current medical records must be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the vaccine. So urce documents, such as any 
hospital, clinic, or office charts, and the signed ICFs are to be included in the investigator’s files 
with the participant’s study records.  
10.2.15.  Retention of Records  
The principal investigator must maintain all documentation relatin g to the study for a period of at 
least 2 years after the last marketing application approval or, if not approved, 2 years following 
the discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If this requirement differs from any local 
regulations, the local  regulations will take precedence unless the local retention policy is > 2 years.  
If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor or the regulatory authority to review any documentation 
relating to the study, the investigator must permit access to such records. No  records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
10.2.16.  Study and Site Closure  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the 
investigators, the IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO(s) used in the study of the reason 
for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
investigator shall promptly inform the participants and should ensure appropriate participant 
therapy and/or follow -up. 
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretio n of the Sponsor.  
The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or investigator may include, but are 
not limited to:  
• Continuation of the study represents a significant medical risk to participants

Confidential   Page 193 • Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB or 
local health authorities, the Sponsor’ s procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator  
• Discontinuation of further mRNA -1273 development  
Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all 
required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been 
performed.  
10.2.17.  Publication Policy  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, 
the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor before submission. 
This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments.  
The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and eth ical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual study site data. In this case, a 
coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determin ed by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  
The clinical study plan and the results of the study will be published on www.ClinicalTrials.gov 
in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(c). The res ults of and data from this study belong to the Sponsor.

directly before the Table of Contents.  
10.6.1.  Amendment 3: 23 Aug 202 1 
Amendment 3, 23 Aug 2021  
This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  
Main Rationale for the Amendment  
The main rationale for this amendment is to enroll participants who had a kidney or liver solid 
organ transplant (SOT) who previously received 2  doses of mRNA -1273 outside of the study in 
order for them to receive a third dose as part of the study.  
The Summary of C hanges table provided below describes the major changes made in 
Amendment 3 relative to Protocol Amendment 2, including the sections modified and the 
corresponding rationales. The synopsis of Amendment 3 has been modified to correspond to 
changes in the bo dy of the protocol. Minor grammar and formatting corrections were made 
throughout the document to enhance clarity and readability (which did not affect the conduct of

Section 2 Object ives 
and Endpoints  The primary immunogenicity 
endpoint: neutralizing antibody 
(nAb) titers for 3 -dose regimen 
was moved from a secondary 
endpoint to a primary endpoint 
and was also modified to include 
assessment of immunogenicity 
from both solid organ tran splant 
(SOT) recipients previously 
vaccinated with 2  doses of 
Moderna COVID -19 vaccine 
under EUA and unvaccinated 
participants).  
 
Reactogenicity in the primary 
objective was separated out from 
the safety objective.  
 
Additional secondary endpoints 
were incl uded to reflect the new 
arm. To implement the analysis of the 
new arm (participants who had an 
SOT who previously received 
2 Moderna COVID -19 vaccine 
doses).  
Section 2 Objectives 
and Endpoints  Day 85 timepoint (dose 3) was 
added for nAb and binding 
antibody (bAb) geometric mean 
titer (GMT) and geometric mean 
fold rise (GMFR) assessments in 
the secondary endpoints (for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients 
who receive the 3 -dose regimen).  To enable longitudinal assessment 
of changes in nAb and bAb GMT 
and GMFR relative to dose 3 for 
unvaccinated SOT recipients who 
receive the 3 -dose regimen. Blood 
sample collection for 
immunogenicity assessments are 
already being collected for 
Day 85.

Confidential   Page 209 10.6.3.  Amendment 1: 18 Jun 2021  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment  
The main purpose of this amendment was to change the design so that all the participants who are 
solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients will be offered the opportunity to receive a third dose of 
100 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine on Day 85.  
In addition, Amendment 1 incorporated 2 points from the Protocol Clarification Memorandum of 
15 April 2021:  
• Exclusion criterion #7 is  modified to specify that the history of donor -specific 
antibody be clinically relevant according to the investigator’s judgment  
• Specified the number of kidney transplant recipients, liver transplant recipients, and 
healthy controls whose blood would be sa mpled for assessment of cellular immune 
response. In addition, due the addition of a third dose, the number of sampling days 
for cellular immune response is increased to three (Day 1, Day 36, and Day 92); and 
the number of transplant recipients (55 liver a nd 55 kidney) and healthy participants 
(20) with blood sample collection for evaluation of cellular immune response is 
increased.

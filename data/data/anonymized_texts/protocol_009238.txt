 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Exploratory endpoints  
Parts 1 and 2  
• Tumor target gene expression and phenotypic markers including those for 
differentiation, apoptosis, inflammation and cell proliferation and their correlation with activity  
• Somatic mutation analysis o f tumor tissue and blood derived circulating 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  
Study design  This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, 2-part, single -arm, 2 -stage study of 
continuous oral dosing with tazemetostat 800 mg BID.  Subjects will be screened for elig ibility within 2 1 days of the planned date of the first dose of tazemetostat. 
Eligible subjects will be enrolled into two different parts: 
• Part 1 – Subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless 
of BAP1 status  
• Part 2 – Subjects with  relapsed or refractory BAP1 -deficient malignant 
mesothelioma   
Part 1  
Subj ects enrolled in Part 1 will receive a single 800 -mg tazemetostat dose on 
Cycle 1 Day 1.  Starting on Cycle 1 Day 2 , tazemetostat will be administered at a 
dose of 800 mg BID.  PK bl ood samples will be collected after the single 
tazemetostat 800  mg dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and on Cycle 1 Day 15 after repeated 
BID doses of tazemetostat 800 mg .  Plasma samples will be analyzed for 
tazemetostat after each set of six subjects complete the PK samplin g procedures 
on Cycle 1 Day 15.  In consultation with the investigators, the 400- mg tablets will 
be used in Part 2 if the PK and safety profiles of tazemetostat in Part 1 are acceptable.  
Part 2  
Subjects enrolled in Part 2 will receive tazemetostat 800 mg BID starting on Cycle 
1 Day 1.  PK blood samples will be collected on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, and on 
Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, and 4.  
A two -stage Green -Dahlberg design will be utilized for Part 2.  Statistical analyses 
of the primary endpoint in Part 2 will be performed when the first 30 subjects are 
enrolled ( End of Stage 1 and after all subjects are enrolled [End of Stage 2 ]).   
Parts 1 and 2  
Response assessment s will be performed every 6 weeks while on study.  Subjects 
will discontinue study treatme nt at the time of disease progression, development 
of an unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent , or termination of the study. 
Subjects also will undergo physical examinations (PEs); vital sign mea surements; 
ECOG assessments, blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, PK, and 
PD markers; electrocardiograms (ECGs); adverse event (AE) assessments;

Dosage and 
administration  Tazemetostat will be administered at the recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D) of 
800 mg/dose. Tazemetostat  will be administered BID with or without food with 
no less than 8 hours bet ween doses.  
Statistical methods  Sample size rationale :   The sample size of 12 subjects for Part 1 is sufficient for 
an initial assessment of the PK and safety profiles of the 400-mg tablet. The 
sample size in Part 2 is calculated on the primary endpoint using a two- stage 
Green -Dahlberg design.  The hypothesis will be tested using a one -sided test with 
α=0.05 and the type  II error rate will be controlled at 0.2.  
Null Hypothesis:  CR + PR + SD at 12 weeks ≤20% 
Alternative Hypothesis:  CR + PR + SD at 12 weeks  ≥35% 
 
Green -Dahlberg  CR + PR + SD at 12 weeks

Stage 2 Rejection of Drug (r)  16 
a. The interim analysis planned at the end of Stage 1 may occur sooner if the Sta ge 
1 rejection criterion is surpassed before all 30 subjects are treated and followed for 
12 weeks.  In this scenario, the total sample size (Stage 1 + Stage 2) would still remain unchanged at 55 subjects.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  • At the End of Stage 1, if there are ≤4 CR + PR + SD out of 30 subjects, then 
reject the new treatment and terminate the study for futility.  If there are 
≥5 CR + PR + SD out of 30 subjects, the study continues to Stage 2.  
• At the end of the study, if there are ≤16 CR + PR +SD out of 55 subject s, then 
reject the new treatment.  When there are ≥17 CR + PR +  SD out of 55 
subjects, then the new treatment is accepted.

a. Screening:   Screening Period extends from Day -21 to Day -1.  Screening laboratory assessments may be used as Day 1 assessments if performed within 
72 hours of the first dose of study treatment.  
b. Subjects must continue to meet eligibility criteria prior to first dose  of tazemetostat on Cycle 1 Day 1.  
c. Pre-study procedures and tumor assessment must be performed within 21 days before first dose of study treatment.  
d. Vital Signs:   Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), temperature (T) and respiratory rate (RR) must be measured after the subject has been sitting for five 
minutes  
e. ECG:  12-lead ECG reading must be performed at screening, at Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15, approximately 1 hour after administration of tazemetostat.  A single 
ECG will be recorded unless there is an abnormal ity, such as prolonged QTc(F) ≥ 480 msec, new arrhythmia, or other clinically significant finding.  If a n 
abnormality is observed, the ECG is to be performed in triplicate at least 2 minutes apart. Additional ECG readings will be performed prior to tazemet ostat 
administration on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.  On days when an ECG reading and a PK blood samp le collection are scheduled at the same time (Cycle 1 
Days 1 and 15 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 4), the ECG reading should be performed immediately prior to collection of the PK blood sample , if possible .   
f. Pregnancy Test:   A serum  or urine  pregnancy tes t must be performed at screening and within 21 days of the first dose of study treatment  for all females 
who are of childbearing potential.  A separate assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the  first 
dose of study treatment. Subsequent pregnancy tests should be performed on the first day of every cycle of study treatment and may be either urine or serum.

          [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  g. Laboratory Tests:  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories accordi ng to the laboratory’s normal procedures .  See Section 8.3.2  for a 
complete l isting of laboratory tests to be performed.   
h. Coagulation Profile:  Coagulations tests include prothrombin time (PT ) and partial thromboplastin time (P TT). 
i. PGx:  A single 6 -mL blood sample will be collected at screening.  
j. Circulating DNA:  20-mL circulating tumor DNA blood samples to be obtained at screen ing and at time of each tumor  assessment including at time of 
disease progression.  
k. PK Part 1: The 12 subjects in Part 1 will have 2-mL blood samples for PK analysis collected at the following time points:  Cycle 1 Day 1: pre -dose, 0.5, 1, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post -dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: pre -dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 post -dose.  
PK Part 2:   The subjects in Part 2 will have 2-mL blood samples for PK analysis collected at the following time points: Cycle 1 Day 1: pre -dose, and 1, 3, 
and 6 hours post -dose; Cycle 1 Day 15: pre -dose, 1, 3, and 6 hours post -dose; Day 1 of Cycles 2 through Cycle 4 : pre-dose.  All PK blood samples may be 
drawn from either a central venous catheter or a peripherally placed intravenous catheter. Exact time of draw must be recorde d.  
l. Tumor Tissue:  Archival tissue (block or 10-15 slides) will be requested for central confirmation of pathology, IHC, and additional molecular testing, e.g. , 
detection of somatic mutations and/or candidate biomarkers of response. If archived tumor material is not available , tumor biopsy obtained during screen ing 
is acceptable.  
m. Tumor Biopsy for Tazemetostat PD :  A minimum of 12 subjects will be required to provide pre-dose (to be collected at screening) and post-dose biops ies 
(formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded [FFPE ] blocks) to assess H3K27me3 starting at or following the first or  second tumor assessments (Cycle 3 or 5).   If 
the clinical study accrual has reached 75% and the  goals for subjects undergoing tumor biopsy have not been met, only those subjects  who can undergo 
tumor biopsy will be enrolled.  If the study subsequently  completes accrual  of 12 subjects with pre- and post-dose biopsies and the study accrual is still open, 
the study will then enroll all subjects irrespective of their ability to provide pre- and post-dose biopsies.  
n. Tumor Biopsy at Disease Progression:  An FFPE  tumor biopsy i s requested, where medically feasible, at disease progression in subjects who achieve a PR 
or better to tazemetostat.  
o. Tumor Assessment:  Tumor assessments by disease -appropriate standard criteria (modified RECIST for thoracic disease or RECIS T 1.1  elsewher e) using 
CT/MRI of known sites of disease as clinically indicated.  Bone scan should be performed only if clinically indicated.  Tumor as sessments must be 
performed at screening and every 6 weeks ( ±3 days) or sooner, if clinically indicated, from start of treatment.  18FDG-PET scan should be performed as 
clinically indicated at the investigator’s discretion, and is not a required tumor assessment.  
p. Disease Assessment and Survival  Status:  Survival follow -up will be conducted approximately every 12 weeks on a ll subjects, unless the subject 
withdraws consent . 
q. Post-Treatment/Early Termination:  A Post-Treatment /Early Termination  visit will be conducted within 3 0 days (±3 days) after the last dose of 
tazemetostat or prior to the start of a new treatment or therapy at the end of study or if the subject's participation is terminated early.  The post -
treatment/early termination  assessments will be required and, in t he event of a continuing AE, the subject will be asked to return for follow -up until the AE 
has resolve d or is deemed to be continuing indefinitely.  
r. Follow-Up:  Survival follow -up will be conducted approximately every 12 weeks on all subjects, unless they withdraw consent. Information on all anti -
cancer  therapies will be collected (the sponsor may choose t o stop the collection of therapies after the first anti-cancer  treatment following tazemetostat). 
This may be done by telephone contact.

2.1. Introduction  
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive malignancy a ssociated with asbestos exposure and 
carries a poor prognosis.  It was once thought to be rare but the incidence is increasing and will 
likely peak in the next 10 years in the US, UK and Europe, however the continued global use of asbestos threatens a worldwide epidemic in several developing economies [ Robinson 2005; 
Ceresoli  2007; Fennell  2007].  At diagnosis patients usually have pleural involvement, 
presenting with chest wall pain, pleural effusions and dyspnea, but disease can also be found on other serosal surfaces such as the peritoneum [ Robinson 2005].  Tre atment consists of 
pemetrexed and platinum based chemotherapy, with or without surgery and radiation.  Despite treatment, outcomes are poor with median overall survival (OS) reported to be between 9 and 17 
months regardless of stage at diagnosis [ Tsao  2009 ]. Currently, there is no standard of care i n the 
relapsed setting after progression following pemetrexed and cisplatin, originally reported over a decade ago [Vogelzang  2003].  
To date there hav e been no genetically stratified therapies identified for the treatment of 
mesothelioma. However,  in this patient population, BAP1 loss of function mutations , and protein 
loss determined  by IHC are observed in up to 23% a nd 66%, respectively [Bott 2011; Bueno 
2016; Cigognetti 2015; Guo 2015] .  Treatment of BAP1 mutant mesothelioma xenografts with 
EZH2 inhibitors significantly reduced BAP1 mutant tumor growth when compared to vehicle in two immunocompromised mouse  models; see Figure 1 [LaFave, 2015 and Epizyme internal 
communication]. Thus, EZH2 inhibition represents a viable therapeutic strategy for BAP1 -
deficient m alignant mesothelioma patien ts.  A wild type BAP1 xenograft model exhibited 
variable in vivo efficacy when performed in two distinct immunocompromised backgrounds, suggesting a possible, though less compelling, role for EZH2 inhibition in the mesothelioma microenvironment; see Figure  2 [LaFave 2015 and Epizyme internal communication].  
The cellular function of BAP1 is deubiquitination of specific nuclear proteins. Evidence exists for multiple genetic mechanisms that can lead to BAP1 loss of function, however, lack of BAP1 expression in the nucleus (identified by immunohistochemistry; IHC) will be considered as a 
surrogate of BAP1 loss of function for the purposes of enrollment to this study and these subjects 
will be considered BAP1- deficient.  
Enhancer of Z este homologue 2 (EZH2) is the catalytic subunit of the multi- protein polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that catalyzes the mono -, di-, and trimethylation of lysine 27 of

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  histone H3 (H3K27) [ Margueron 2011 ].  EZH2 mutatio n and/or over -expression has been 
observed in several cancer types, leading to an aberrant H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) state 
which is oncogenic [ Chase  2011].  For instance, somatic gain -o- function mutations within 
EZH2, fo und within subsets of non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), result in an oncogenic 
dependency on EZH2 production of abnormally high H3K27me3 levels, and resultant transcriptional reprogramming of the cell [ Morin  2010].   
In addition to genet ic alternations in EZH2 itself, genetic and/or protein loss of  other proteins , 
such as BRACA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1),  can lead to an oncogenic dependency on EZH2 
activity  [LaFave 2015] .  BAP1 is a nuclear deub iquitina se that removes monoubiquitin from 
Histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119), a histone mark which is catalyzed by the Polycomb 
Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) [Wang 2004; Scheuermann 2010]. PRC1 dependent H2AK119 
ubiquitination can lead to recruitment of the PRC2 complex and induction of H3K27me3 
[Blackledge 2014].  Genetic and/or protein  loss of BAP1 has been described in many human 
malignancies, such as  mesothelioma, uvea l melanoma, renal carcinoma, and  cholangiocarcinoma 
[Testa 2015; Harbour 2010; Pena- Llopis 2012; Jiao 2013]. Germline mu tations of BAP1, while 
rare, lead to a high familial incidence of mesothelioma and uveal melanoma in addition to  other 
cancer types [Testa 2012, Carbone 2012].  Conditional loss of BAP1 in vivo leads to increase d 
EZH2  expression in myeloid cells  resulting  in increased levels of H3K27me3 and repression of 
PRC2 target s.  These effects can be abrogated with concomitant conditional deletion of Ezh2 or 
treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor  [LaFave 2015].    
2.2. Tazemetostat  
2.2.1 Preclinical Pharmacology  
Tazemetostat (EPZ -6438) is a selective oral small molecule inhibitor of EZH2.  Tazemetostat 
inhibits both wild  type EZH2 and mutated EZH2 residues Y641, A667G and A687 with half 
maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
50) ranging from 2- 38 nmol/L.  The compound shows a 35-
fold selectivity over the most closely related HMT, EZH1 , and greater than a 4500-fold 
selectively over other HMTs.  It selectively inhibits intracellular H3K27 methylation in a 
concentrati on- and time -dependent manner, leading to selective cell killing of cell lines  with 
either EZH2 gain -of-function mutations or an acquired dependence on EZH2 activity due to 
other mutations  [Knutson 2013].   
Oral ad ministratio n of EZH2 inhibitor s twice daily resulted in  antitumor activity in vivo against 
two BAP1 mutant human mesothelioma xenograft murine models. BAP1 mutant mesothelioma xenografts treated  with the  EZH2 tool compound EPZ011989 (Figure  1a, b [ LaFave 2015], and c

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  [Epizyme internal communications] ) and tazemetostat (Figure 1c)  demonstrated up to a four -fold 
reduction in tumor volume.  
NOD- SCID mice implanted with wild type  BAP1 mesothelioma cell lines and treated with the 
EZH2 tool compound EPZ011989 twice daily (Figure 2a,b), did not demonstrate a significant 
reduction in tumor volume.  Interestingly, EZH2 inhibition in a MSTO -211H xenograft model in 
SCID mice treated with  both the tool compound and tazemetostat (Figure 2c) did result in 
significant tumor reduction.  As SCID mice are more immunocompetent than NOD -SCID mice, 
this finding suggests a possible immune modulatory role for EZH2 in this setting.

2.2.2 Clinical Pharmacokinetics (PK)  
The clinical PK of tazemetostat and desethyl metabolite, EPZ-6930, have been characterized 
following single (Day 1) and multiple (Day 15) administration to subjects with advanced solid 
tumors or B -cell lymphoma (n=36). Doses administered were 100 mg BID as a suspension (n=3) 
or tablet (n=3) formulation and 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mg BID as a tablet  formulation. 
Tazemetostat was rapidly absorbed with a time to the maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax) of 
approximately 1-2 hours post- dose.  Plasma concentrations declined in a mono-exponential 
manner with a mean t 1/2 of approximately 3-5 hours, and quantifiable plasma concentrations of 
both tazemetostat and its metabolite, EPZ-6930 were measurable up to 12 hours post -dose.  The 
tazemetostat maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) increased in a greater than do se-proportional fashion after a single dose and in an 
approximately a dose -proportional fashion at steady- state.  After multiple dosing, there was a 
dose- dependent decrease in tazemetostat exposure between Days 1 and 15.  The accumulation 
ratio (R ac = AUC D15/AUC D1) at the recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) of 800  mg BID was 
0.58.  However, drug exposure at steady- state did not change beyond Day 15 as evidenced by the 
Ctrough levels from Days 15 to 29.  There was negligible change in Tmax or t 1/2 on multiple dosing 
across the dose range.  Preliminary results indicate that <5% of the administered dose was 
excreted in urine as unchanged ta zemetostat. The Tmax of tazemetostat was observed at 1 -2 hours 
post- dose and its elimination paralleled that of tazemetostat (t 1/2 = 3-5 hours). Preliminary results 
indicate that <5% of the administered dose was excreted in urine as unchanged tazemetostat.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Metabolite profiling and identification studies are planned to assess tazemetostat metabolism in 
humans. 
The effect of food on the PK of tazemetostat was evaluated in in subjects with advanced solid 
tumors or B -cell lymphoma (n=12) as part of study E7438-G000- 101. Administration of 
tazemetostat with a high -fat meal decreased geometric mean area under the concentration -time 
curve from zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞) and C max values approximately 6% and 28%, 
respectively, relative to administration in the fasted state. However, for both C max and AUC 0-∞, 
all values observed after administration of tazemetostat following a high -fat meal were within 
the range of values observed after administration in the fasted state. Administration of tazemetostat with  a high- fat meal also resulted in a 4 -fold increase in median T
max relative to 
administration in the fasted state. The relationship between tazemetostat AUC on Day 15 and 
inhibition of H3K27 methylation in skin observed in the dose-e scalation part of 
Study E7438-G000- 101 indicates that target inhibition is related to AUC. The decrease in 
systemic exposure as measured by AUC 0-∞ is not clinically significant, and therefore, 
tazemetostat can be taken without regards to meals.  
2.2.3 Clinical Pharmacodynamics (PD)  
 
Inhibition of H3K27Me3 in skin was utilized as a measure of target engagement in Study 
E7438-G000- 101.  IHC analysis of skin biopsies collected pre -dose and after 28 days of 
tazemetostat treatment revealed a post -dose decrease in H3K27Me3- positive cells acro ss all 
doses explored (100− 1600 mg BID). Interestingly, differences were observed in the 
tazemetostat -induced reduction in H3K27Me3 levels in different skin layers potentially pointing 
to different kinetics for H3K27Me3 turnover in the cells that occupy di fferent skin layers. A 
relationship between tazemetostat AUC on Day 15 and inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the stratum 
spinosum was observed and described by an inhibitory E max model. The tazemetostat AUC 0-12 at 
which the H3K27Me3 inhibition was 50% of maximal ( EC 50) was 848 ng• h/mL and the 
maximum effect (E max) was 51% inhibition.  
In this study pre - and post -treatment tumor biop sies will be evaluated to enable the assessment of 
tazemetostat dosing on H3K27Me3 levels in tumor tissue. H3K27Me3 IHC data will provide mechanistic insight into the impact of EZH2 inhibition on H3K27Me3 levels in cell populations within tumor. In additio n, these data will be evaluated in the context of tazemetostat exposure 
data to explore PK -PD relationships.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  2.2.4 Molecular Evidence of BAP1 Deficiency  
BAP1 loss of function mutations and protein loss determined by IHC are observed in up to 23% 
and 66% of pati ents with malignant pleural mesothelioma, respectively [Bott 2011, Cigognetti 
2015].  For the purposes of this protocol BAP1 deficiency  will be defined as locally determined 
lack of nuclear BAP1 positivity using IHC on archive tumor tissue  (required for Part 2) .  
Central retrospective analysis of BAP1 expression and DNA sequencing will be pe rformed to 
assess the  presence of either somatic and /or germline BAP1 mutations.  
2.2.5 Clinical Safety and Effica cy 
In 2013, the first -time-in-human (FTIH), single -agent, Phase 1/2 safety and PK study (E7438 
G000- 101) of tazemetostat in adult subjects with adva nced B -cell lymphomas and solid tumors 
was initiated in France.  In the dose -escalation part of the study, subjects with advanced solid 
tumors or B -cell lymphomas for which there is no known effective therapy were recruited.  All 
subjects received oral tazemetostat twice daily (BID) until disease progression or a dose -limiting 
toxicity (DLT).  As of 07- Nov. 2015, 58 subjects have been enrolled and treated at five dose 
levels of 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1600 mg BID.  The diagnoses for the 21 subjects with B -cell 
NHL included follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B -cell lymphoma including one subject with 
primary media stinal lymphoma and one marginal zone lymphoma.  The solid tumor cohort was 
enriched with subjects who were INI1 or SMARCA4- deficient with five subjects with malignant 
rhabdoid tumors (MRT), 3 subjects with epithelioid sarcoma and three subjects with 
SMARC A4-deficient tumors.  The median age of subjects enrolled is 59 years (range: 19 - 84 
years).  
The dose -escalation portion of E7438-G000- 101 has been completed.  The protocol -defined 
maximum tolerated d ose (MTD) was not reached.  The highest evaluated dose  of 1600 mg BID 
was safe with only one DLT (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] 
version 4.03 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia) observed in 6 subjects.  There was one other Grade 4 serious adverse event (SAE) of possible treatment -related neutropenia reported in a subject in the 
expansion cohort. The RP2D of 800 mg BID represents 50% of the highest evaluated safe dose and was determined by the sponsor and ratified by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) for use in the Phase 2 study in adults with INI1 negative tumors and the Phase 2 study in 
NHL adult subjects in Europe and Australia.  As of 07- Nov. 2015, the reported adverse events 
(AEs), regardless of attribution, occurring in >5% of subjects were:  asthenia, anorexia, 
thrombocytopeni a, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, anemia, dry skin, dysgeusia, 
dyspnea, muscle spasms, abdominal pain, hypophosphatemia, anxiety, depression, hypertension, influenza, insomnia, neutropenia, night sweats and peripheral edema. Only four Grade 3 or

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  greater treatment -related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 58 subjects with no evidence of 
generation of secondary malignancies, and minimal hematologic toxicity.   
Tazemetostat has shown clear evidence of  robust clinical activity in subjects with 9 of 1 6 
response evaluable  subjects with previously treated B -cell lymphomas  (2 CRs + 7 PRs ) and in 
subjects with genetically -defined INI1 altered tumors consisting of 3 of 11 subjects showing 
clinical activity (1 CR, 2 PRs , and 1 SD with tumor reduction staying on study > 26 weeks ).   
2.3. Benefit: Risk Assessments 
2.3.1 Animal Toxicology  
Non-clinical repeated -dose oral toxicity studies in Sprague -Dawley (S -D) rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys, which may be relevant to human safety, revealed the following toxicities and target 
organs in the two  species as follows:  
• In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract: ulcer/erosion in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, 
and/or ileum  
• In lymphoid tissues: lymphoid depletion  
• In lymphoid tissues in S -D rats only: lymphoblastic lymphoma in a non- dose related 
fashion in 11 of 40 rats at 300 mg/kg (mid- dose) and in 1  of 40 animals at 600  mg/kg 
(high dose).  No cases of lymphoma were observed in the 100 mg/kg/day 
tazemetostat dose cohort in rats or at any dose co hort (100- 600 mg/kg/day) in 
cynomolgus monkeys treated for 4 or 13 weeks.  The etiology and potential human 
relevance of the rat lymphoma is currently under continued laboratory investigation,  
but does not appear to be related to alterations in the Notch signaling pathway or endogenous rat leukemia virus reac tivation.  
• In bone in S -D rats only:  there was trabecular bone formation in the femur and 
sternum in the 4- and 13- week studies  
• In the serum of monkeys only:  increase of chloride due to bromide derived  from the 
tazemetostat bromide salt formulation (subse quent Phase 1 studies in humans have 
determined no detectable bromide levels)  
• In the liver of monkeys only: hepatocyte and Kupffer cell hypertrophy in the 4- week 
and 13- week studies, which was accompani ed by pigmentation of Kupffer cells and 
bile duct hype rplasia in some cases in the 13 -week study 
• In the kidney of monkeys only: glomerulopathy in the 13- week study  
Additional animal toxicology is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for tazemetosta t.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  2.3.2 Photo- Reactive Potential  
There are nonclinical data supporting a potential for phototoxicity, which has not been evaluated 
in humans. Hence, prolonged exposure to sunlight should be avoided during treatment. In 
addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid ultraviolet (UV) exposure such as wearing sun screen and sun glasses, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds. Refer to the tazemetostat IB for details.   
2.3.3 CYP3A Metabolism  
Tazemetostat is metabolized primarily by CYP3A.  Therefore, treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers  of CYP3A within 14 days prior to first dose of tazemetostat and for the duration 
of study treatment is prohibited. Tazemetostat was also shown to be a time -dependent CYP3A 
inhibitor and a CYP3A4 induce r (EC
50 value = 2.6 μmol/L) as well as an inhibitor of  the CYP2C 
family in vitro.  CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 substrates should be used with caution.  Medications that are substrates for CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and that have a narrow therapeutic range should be avoided if possible.  
2.3.4 Anticipa ted Safety Profile 
Based on the ongoing Phase 1 study in adults, the AEs occurring in >5% of subjects regardless 
of attribution were asthenia, anorexia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea,  
vomiting, anemia, dry skin, dysgeusia, dyspnea, muscle spasms, abdominal pain, hypophosphatemia, anxiety, depression, hypertension, influenza, insomnia, neutropenia, night sweats, and peripheral edema.  The possibly TRAEs seen in >5% of subjects included:  asthenia, 
nausea, anemia, decreased appetite, muscle spasms, diarrhea, dry skin, dysgeusia, vomiting, and 
abnormal hair growth.  There have been only two Grade 4 TRAEs: thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia. There has been no evidence of secondary lymphomas or  other secondary cancers in 
subjects exposed to tazemetostat to date.  Additionally, there is the unknown risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes and drug- drug interactions. Based on the pre clinical  toxicology of 
tazemetostat, the potential risks associated with treatment include GI AEs (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), lymphoid AEs (lymphoma in rats), liver AEs, renal AEs, bone AEs, and 
photosensitivity. 
2.4. Study and Dose Rationale  
2.4.1 Study Rationale  
The pre clinical  antitumor  activity of EZH2 inhibition in BAP1 mutant mesothelioma xenograft 
models highlights the potential clinical benefit of tazemetostat in BAP1 mutant mesothelioma.   
Given the available safety and initial activity data of tazemetostat in subjects with B -cell 
lymphoma and INI1- negative tumors in the Phase 1 FTIH study E7438-G000- 101, non- clinical

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  safety  profile, non- clinical efficacy data in xenograft models, and high unmet need in subjects 
with this poor prognosis cancer , especially in those with relapsed or refractory disease, there is 
an appropriate potential benefit to risk consideration to study taz emetostat in subjects with 
malignant mesothelioma.  
2.4.2 Dosage Rationale  
The safety, tolerability, clinical activity, PK, and PD assessments from the subjects treated  in the 
dose-e scalation part of Study E7438-G000- 101 were used to select the RP2D.  As of 07-Nov. 
2015, 58 subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or B -cell lymphomas had been 
included in the Phase 1, dose- escalation part of the study. Clinical activity of EPZ -6438 was 
observed at dose levels of 100, 200, and 800 mg BID, including objective responses observed in 
9 of 16 response evaluable subjects with B -cell lymphoma who have had tumor assessments 
while on study drug. Objective responses were observed in 5/10 DLBCL, 3/5 FL, and 1/1 MZL subjects. A  protocol- defined  MTD was not established with EPZ -6438 doses of up to 1600 mg 
BID.  
A relationship between tazemetostat AUC on Day 15 and inhibition of H3K27Me3 in the stratum spinosum was observed and described by an inhibitory E
max model. The tazemetostat AUC 0-12 at 
H3K27Me3 EC 50 was 848 ng •h/mL  and the E max was 51% inhibition.  The predicted inhibition of 
H3K27Me3 in the stratum spinosum skin layer at the observed median Day 15 AUC 0-12 in the 
800 mg twice daily dose cohort (3670 ng •h/mL) was over 80% of E max.  These results suggest 
that target inhibition in the skin was near maximal at 800 mg tazemetostat twice daily and doubling the dose to 1600 mg twice daily results in only an incremental increase in the inhibition 
of the H3K27 methylation.  Furthermore, the greatest number of objective responses was observed in the 800 mg BID cohort during the dose-e scalation part of the study.  Therefore, the 
RP2D of 800 mg BID was selected. This RP2D has been endorsed by the investigators and an IDMC.  
2.5. Good Clinical Practice  (GCP)  
The principal investigator will ensure that the basic principles of G CP, as outlined in 21 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR)  312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 
CFR, Part 50 (1998) and 21 CFR, Part 56, (1998) are followed.  
Since this is a covered cli nical trial, the principal investigator is adhered to 21 CFR, Part 54, 
(1998).  A covered clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant o r FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an

requires that investigators and all sub-investigator s must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Epizyme, Inc. or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided prior to the participation of the principal investigator and any sub-investi gator. The principal investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify Epizyme, 
Inc. of any change in reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. Study completion is defined as the date that the last subject ha s completed the

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1.  Study Sites  
This study will be conducted at 6 − 10 sites in the US and 3 − 4 sites each in France and the 
United Kingdom . 
4.2. Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open -label, 2-part, single- arm, 2 -stage study of tazemetostat 
800 mg BID administered ora lly.  Screening of subjects to determine eligibility for the study will 
be performed within 21 days of the first planned dose of tazeme tostat.   
In Part 1, 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma regardless of BAP1 
status will be tre ated and undergo PK blood sample collection after a single tazemetostat 800 mg 
dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and on Cycle 1 Day 15 after repeated BID doses of tazemetostat 800 mg.   
Subjects will receive a single oral 800 -mg tazemetostat dose on Cycle 1 Day 1.  Starting on 
Cycle  1 Day 2, tazemetostat will be orally administered at a dose of 800 mg BID.  
Part 2 will include subjects with BAP1 -deficient relapsed or refractory malignant mesothelioma. 
Subjects will receive orally administered tazemetostat 800 mg BID star ting on Cycle 1 Day 1.  A 
two-stage Green -Dahlberg design will be utilized with a stopping rule to allow early termination 
at the  end of Stage 1 if there is strong evidence of lack of efficacy based on results from the first 
30 treated subjects who meet the criteria outlined below.  If early stopping criteria are met, 
enrollment will be stopped.  To avoid disruptions in the study, e nrollment and treatment of 
subjects will not be halted in order to conduct the interim analysis.  
The interim analysis will be performed after the first 30 treated subjects enrolled have completed 
at least the 12 -week assessment, completed the final study v isit or terminated early from the 
study, whichever is sooner.  This is to ensure subjects have adequate time to respond to treatment.  As it is desirable to perform the interim analysis in a timely manner, both confirmed and unconfirmed responses will be i ncluded. 
The interim analysis planned at the end of Stage 1 may occur sooner if the Stage 1 rejection criterion is surpassed before all 30 subjects are treated and followed for 12 weeks.  In this scenario, the total sample size (Stage 1 + Stage 2) would st ill remain unchanged at 55 subjects.  
Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity  or 
withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.  Response assessment will be evaluated after 6 weeks of treatment and then every 6 weeks thereafter while on study.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Subjects also will undergo physical examinations (PEs); vital sign measurements; ECO G 
assessments, blood sample collection for hematology, chemistry, PK, and PD markers; 
electrocardiograms (ECGs); adverse event (A E) assessments; concomitant medication 
assessments; activity assessments, and pregnancy testing for females of childbearing pot ential.  
4.3. Rules for Suspension of Enrollment  
The investigators, IRBs/ECs, regulatory agencies and IDMC will be urgently informed and the IDMC convened to review the data and to make recommendations for potential changes in study conduct if one or more subjects develop any of the following AEs deemed to be definitely related to study treatment by the investigator and/or medical monitor , based upon close temporal 
relationship or other factors:  
• Death  
• Anaphylaxis (angioedema, hypotension, shock, bronchospasm, hypoxia or respiratory 
distress)  
• Secondary lymphoma  
Should study enrollment be suspended, the study will not be restarted until all parties have 
agreed to the course of action to be taken and the IRBs/ECs have been notified.

duration of the study.  
7.2. Restrictions During Study Treatment  
Subjects will abstain from ingesting Seville oranges and grapefruit or grapefruit juice and 
foods/beverages that  contain those, for 24  hours prior to the first dose of study treatment until the 
last dose of study treatment.   Subjects should avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight while 
receiving study drug.  In addition, subjects should take other measures to avoid UV exposure 
such as wearing sun screen and sun glasses, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding tanning beds. 
7.3. Dose Modification  
No modification of dose is required for the following ≥ Grade 3 non- hematologic toxic ities: 
• Transient fatigue or asthenia lasting  < 24 hours  
• Transient myalgia or arthralgia  lasting < 24 hours  
• Nausea that resolves to < Grade 2 within seven days (with or without anti -emetics)  
• Vomiting that resolves to <  Grade 2 within 48 hours (with or without anti -emetics)  
• Diarrhea that resolves to <  Grade 2 within 48 hours  
Other toxicities that, in the opinion of the investigator, are possible, probably or definitely related 
to study treatment, should be managed per Table 3. Toxicities that are felt by the investigator to 
be unrelated to tazemetostat but clinically significant should be discussed with the medical 
monitor . In the event of an urgent unrelated toxicity, study treatment should be inter rupted as per 
Table 3.  Dose re -escalation is not permitted.  
Of note, in the event of an occurrence of a secondary neoplasm, including T-cell lymphoma, 
study treatment will be permanently discontinued.  See Sections 4.3 and 11.5 or further

Toxicity must resolve to Grad e ≤ 1or baseline before study treatment is restarted.  Should the same Grade 4 toxicity  
recur at 600 mg BID, study treatment will be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade ≤1 or baseline.  Study treatment 
will be discontinued or resumed at 400 mg BID following discussion with the medical monitor.  
 
 
7.4. Continuation of Treatment  
In subjects that are potentially benefitting (CR, PR, or SD per modified RECIST or RECIST 1.1) 
from tazemetostat treatment and that have not incurred unacceptable toxicity, tazemeto stat 
administration may be continued.   Subjects will discontinue study trea tment at the time of 
disease progression, development of an unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or termination of the study.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Study treatment may continue if the following parameters are met  on Day 1 of each cycle: 
• Platelet count must be ≥  50 × 109/L; 
• ANC ≥ 1.0 × 109/L; and  
• Any Grade 3 or higher toxicity must have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline .   
Study treatment may be interrupted for up to 14 days.  Treatment interruptions longer than 
14 days need medical monitor  approval to proceed.  
7.5. Treatment Compliance 
The subject will be requested to maintain a medication diary of each dose of tazemetostat.  The dosing diary will be returned to the site staff at each visit.  
7.6. Treatment of Overdose 
In the event of an overdose of tazemetostat (defined as administration of more than the protocol -
specified dose), the investigator should contact the medical monitor  or their designee 
immediately and closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities.   
A subject suspected of overdose should be monitored until tazemetostat can no longer be detected systemically.  For reference, five half -lives of tazemetostat would be at minimum 
25 hours, longer in subject with delayed clearanc e.  Decisio ns regarding dose interruptions or 
modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor  or their 
designee based on the subject’s clinical evaluation.  
A plasma sample for PK analysis may be requested on a case-by- case basis.  If requested, the 
plasma sample should be collected at least within 7 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment.  
The quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing should be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
7.7. Tazemetostat Duration of Treatment  
Treatment with tazemetostat will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Subjects may receive tazemetostat for an approximate duration of 12 months.  (Note:  If 
treatment is discontinued prior to completing 12 months, subjects will be followed for a 
maximum duration of 12 months from start of study drug dosing) .  Those subjects who continue 
to derive clinical benefit from tazemetostat after 12 months of treatment may continue tr eatment 
on the current study as long as it is open and actively treating subjects. Once all subjects have

Investigators may be requested to perform addi tional safe ty tests during the course of the study 
based on newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring.  Appropriate local 
regulatory and ethical approvals should be obtained before any additional testing is performed.  
8.1. Consent  
All subjects must take  part in the informed consent process.  Adequate time must be allowed for 
the subject to ask questions and make a voluntary decision.  No protocol -specific procedures, 
including screening procedures are to be performed until the subject has signed and dated an IRB/IEC/CEC- approved ICF.   
8.2. Screening Assessments  
A signed, written informed consent must be obtained prior to any study- specific assessments or 
procedures being performed.  
All screening assessments, including tumor assessment, must be perf ormed within 21 days of 
enrollment.  
Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood counts, chemistries, imaging studies) and obtained prior to consent may be used for screening provided the procedure meets the protoc ol-defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the 
study. 
8.2.1 Demographics and Medical History  
A complete medical history will be taken.  Information to be documented includes demographic 
information, prior medical illnesses and conditions, and surgical p rocedures.  
8.3. Study Assessments

• Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat (HEENT)  
• Respiratory  
• Cardiovascular  
• Abdomen (including liver  and kidneys)  
• Musculoskeletal  
Weight is required to be measured on Day 1 of each cycle.  Height measurement is required at 
screening only.  
Any abnormalities or changes in intensity noted during the review of body systems should be documented in the source document and reported appropriately in the eCRF.  If a new clinically significant finding (e.g., not noted at screening) occurs from the initial tazemetostat 
adminis tration until the end of the study, an AE must be documented.  In addition, resolution of 
any abnormal findings during the study will be noted in source document and the eCRF if 
clinically significant.  
These assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 
8.3.1.2.  Symptom- Directed Physical Ex amination 
A symptom -directed PE is to be performed on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1  by a qualified license d 
individual.  This will consist of a focused review of systems and physical examination addressing any new symptoms, AEs, or complaints.  
These assessments will be completed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 
8.3.1.3.  Vital Sign Measurements  
Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), temperature (T) and respiratory rate (RR) must be measured after the subject has been sitting for five minutes.  
8.3.1.4.  ECOG Performance Status  
Subject’s performance status will be assessed using the ECOG performance status tool.  
8.3.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
All clinical laboratory assessments ( per Table 4, which follows)  will be performed at local 
laboratories according to the laboratory’s normal procedures.  Reference ranges will be supplied by the laboratory and used to assess the laboratory data for out of range pathological changes  and 
CTCAE grades, where applicable.

Starting from initial tazemetostat exposure, abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests that lead to a 
change in subject management (eg,  dose delay, requirement for additional medication or 
monitoring) are considered clinically significant and will be recorded on the AE eCRF page. Abnormal laboratory values which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical 
condition should be repeated until confirmed, explained, or resolved.  If laboratory values constitute part of an event that meets criteria defining it as serious, the event (and associated lab values) must be reported as an SAE (see Section  11.2.1).  
8.3.3 Pregnancy 
The effect of tazemetostat on fetal development has not been studied.  Consequently, precautions must be taken to avoid any pregnancy that could potentially be conceived during exposure to tazemetostat by EITHER male OR female subjects.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  8.3.3.1.  Definition of Childbearing Potential: Female Subjects  
A female subject is considered of childbearing potential if she:  
• Is anatomically and physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, and  
• Will be or could possibly be sexually active with a male while undergoing study 
treatment with the possibility of posing harm to a fetus  
A female subject is considered to be of non-childbea ring potential (i.e., physiologically incapable 
of becoming pregnant) if she:  
• Is post -menopausal (at least 12 months consecutive amenorrheic) , or 
• Is surgically sterilized (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral 
oophorectomy) with surgery at least 1 month before the first dose of study treatment  
• Has a documented congenital or acquired disorder that is incompatible with 
pregnancy 
8.3.3.2.  Definition of Childbearing Potential: Male Subjects  
A male subject is considered of childbearing potentia l if he:  
• Is anatomically and physiologically capable of causing a pregnancy in a female partner  
 and 
• Will be or could possibly be sexually active with a female (who is or may become 
pregnant) while undergoing study treatment with the possibility of posing harm to a 
fetus  
A male subject is considered to be of non- childbearing potential if he:  
• Has a documented successful vasectomy  
8.3.3.3.  Pregnancy Testing  
All f emale subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or 
serum ) at screenin g and within 21 days of the first dose of study treatment.  A separate 
assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours 
before the first dose of study treatment.  
Subsequent pregnancy tests should be performed on the first day of every cycle of study 
treatment and may be either urine or serum.  
Positive urine tests are to be confirmed by serum testing.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  8.3.3.4.   Prevent ion  
8.3.3.4.1. Female Subjects  
Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, 
that results in a failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, starting at 
screening, during study treatment, and for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment, and have a male partner who uses a condom  when using hormonal contraceptives .  
Acceptable highly effective contraception includes:  
• Placement of an intrauterine device 
• Established hormonal contraceptive me thods: oral, injectable, or implant.  
NOTE: Female subjects who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a 
stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment and must continue to use the same contraceptive during study treatment and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.   
Due to the potential of enzyme induction with tazemetostat, female subjects who use hormonal contraceptives should use an additional barrier method of birth control while on study treatment and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.  
Female subjects exempt from this requirement are subjects who practice true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of th e subject (periodic abstinence [e.g., 
calend ar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods], declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of the trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception), or have a male partner who is vasectomi zed. If currently abstinent, the subject mus t agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception as described above if they become sexually active during study treatment, and for 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment.  
8.3.3.4.2. Male Subjects  
Male su bjects of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms with their female partner of 
childbearing potential prior to enrollment, during study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of study treatment.  
8.3.4 Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
The ECGs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Ass essments (Table 1).  Machine-
read ECGs should be reviewed by the investigator at the time of assessment. A single ECG will 
be recorded unless there is an abnormality, such as prolonged Q Tc(F) ≥ 480 msec, new

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  arrhythmia, or other clinically significant finding.  If such an abnormality is observed, the ECG 
is to be performed in triplicate at least 2 minutes apart. On days when an ECG reading and a PK 
blood sample collecti on are scheduled at  the same time, the ECG reading should be performed 
immediately prior to collection of the PK blood sample , if possible .   
ECGs will be read by a Central Reader within 72 business hours and data from the Central Reader should be entered in the clinical database.  
8.3.5 Disease Assessment  
Disease assessment s will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments and 
Procedures (Table 1). 
Tumor assessm ents are to be performed by disease -appropriate standard criteria (modified 
RECIST  for thoracic disease or RECIST 1.1 elsewhere) using CT /MRI of known sites of disease 
as clinically indicated.  Bone scan should be performed only if clinically indicated.  
18FDG- PET 
scan should be performed as clinically indicated at the investigator’s discretion, and is not a required tumor assessment.  
8.3.6 Pharmacokinetics  
The first 12 treated subjects in Part 1 of the study will undergo PK blood sampling.  A PK blood 
sampling scheme will be used in all subsequent subjects  enrolled in Part 2 of the study.  Bl ood 
samples for PK analysis must be drawn per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).   
A separate Laboratory Manual detailing the PK sample collection, preparation, storage and shipping process will be provided.   
8.3.7 Pharmacogenomics (PGx) 
A single whole blood sample is to be collected during the screening phase (this sample may be  
collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 if unable to collect during screening) to provide DNA for analysis of genes involved in drug disposition (i.e., absorption, dist ribution, metabolism and excretion 
[ADME]).  This will support investigation of whether subject genotype, specifically of ADME genes, is related to the PK of tazemetostat.  In addition, DNA sequencing may be performed for 
determination of germline DNA varia nts in BAP1.  
A separate Laboratory Manual detailing the PGx sample collection, preparation, storage and 
shipping process will be provided.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  8.4. Correlative Assessments  
8.4.1 Archive Tumor or Biopsy at Screening  
An archival tumor block or biopsy is requested at screening from all subjects enrolled in the 
study.  The diagnostic pathology block or tumor tissue obtai ned at the time of the subject's initial 
diagnosis and/or at the time of subsequent procedures is acceptable.  The sponsor or its designee 
will return all b locks to the originating site on completion of the associated analyses.  If a tumor 
block is not ava ilable, 10 -15 unstained paraffin- embedded tumor tissue containing slides may be 
provided.   
If archive tumor material is not available a tumor biopsy obtained during screening is also 
acceptable.  
Independent central confirmation will not be required for study entry  (local pathology results 
showing BAP1- deficiency will be used for study entry). Central confirmation of diagnosis with 
appropriate IHC will be per formed.  
Tumor tissue may be analyzed for DNA, mRNA and/or proteins potentially associated for 
respo nse to tazemetostat up to and including whole genome sequencing.  
A Laboratory Manual detailing the tumor sample collection, preparation, storage and shipping process will be provided.  
8.4.2 Paired Tumor Biopsies to Assess Tazemetostat PD  
A pre- dose tumor biopsy (to be collected during screening) and post-dose tumor biopsy for PD 
analysis is requested from all subjects, when medically feasible, at the first or seco nd tumor 
assessment (Cycle 3 or 5) or any time between the two assessments.  A minimum of 12 patients 
will be required to provide pre- and post- dose biopsies.   If the  clinical study accrual has reached 
75% and the  goals for subjects undergoing tumor biopsy have not been met, only those 
subjects  who can undergo tumor biopsy will be enrolled.  If the study subsequently completes 
accrual of 12 subjects with pre- and post- dose biopsies and the study accrual is still open, the 
study will then enroll all subjects  irrespective of their ability to provide pre- and post-dose 
biopsies. 
A Labo ratory Manual detailing the tumor sample collection, preparation, storage and shipping 
process will be provided.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  8.4.3 Circulating Tumor DNA 
Blood samples are collected at screening and at each response assessment to provide circulating 
tumor DNA that can be used for identification of candidate biomarkers of response to tazemetostat.  
A separate Laboratory Manual detailing the circulating tumor DNA sample collection, preparation, storage and shipping process will be provided.   
8.4.4 Biomarkers of Response Assessment  
Correlations of trends in subjects’ clinical response to the molecular characteristics of their tumor (e.g., diagnostic molecular lesions, somatic mutations) may provide evidence of the biological basis for response to tazemetostat.  Such investigations ar e emerging as an effective 
strategy to inform future clinical development.   
8.4.4.1.  Tumor Tissue Sample(s)   
Tumor tissue will be assessed to centrally confirm BAP1 -deficiency that is required for 
enrollment .  These samples will be used to  identify candidate biomarkers of response to 
tazemetostat via methods, which may include characterization of subjects’ tumor heterogeneity using both protein and nucleic acid based methodologies up to and including whole genome sequencing of tumor RNA/DNA. Local pathology result s are acceptable for enrollment and 
eligibility determination.  
8.4.5 Assessment of Relapse/Resistance to Tazemetostat  
Subjects who initially respond to tazemetostat could subsequently e ither relapse or become 
resistant to tazemetostat through as yet unidentified  mechanisms such as drug- induced de -novo 
mutation.   
Tumor Biopsy:  A subsequent tumor biopsy, if medically feasible, at relapse in subjects who 
achieve a CR or PR to tazemetostat  will be requested to enable assessment of adaptive 
mechanisms of resistance.   Tumor characterization by DNA, RNA, or protein may be performed 
to define molecular changes observed in relapsed tumors.  
8.5. Future Use of Tissue Samples  
Not all of the tissue and blood components obtained during this study may be required for the tests that are part of the clinical trial. Following the conclusion of the study, the samples may be 
used for additional research. These samples will be held for a maximum of 15 years. This  
research will help to understand disease subtypes, drug response and toxicity, and possibly identify new drug targets or biomarkers that predict subject response to treatment. The use of the

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  9. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Documentation of all concomitant medication administered during study treatment will be 
recorded in the eCRF at each visit.  
Because there is a potential fo r interaction of tazemetostat with other concomitantly administered 
drugs through the cytochrome P450 system, over -the-counter medications, or alternative 
therapies must be recorded in the eCRF.  The investigator should be alerted if the subject is 
taking any agent known to affect or with the potential to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  
9.1. Permitted Medication(s)  
• Supportive care measures and symptomatic treatment for any treatment -related 
toxicity, including short courses of corticosteroids, if clinically indicated  
• Prophylactic use of standard anti -emetics  
• Intermittent use of dexam ethasone is permitted as an antiemetic (not to exceed 
0.3 mg/kg/dose dexamethasone or maximum dose of 20 mg) every 12 hours as 
needed   
• Blood and platelet transfusions, as needed per the judgment of the investigator 
9.2. Medications to be used with Caution  
Subs trates of P -gp, CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 should be used with 
caution.  Medications that are substrates of CYP3A, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 and have a narrow therapeutic range should be avoided if possible  
NOTE: A listing of CYP substrates can be found using the following link:

and should be discussed with the medical monitor  and should be conducted 
according to the 2006 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guideline 
for use of white blood cell (W BC) growth factors [ Smith, 2006].  
• Treatment with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 should not be taken 
within 14 days prior to first dose of study treatment and for the duration of study.   
NOTE:  A listing of CYP inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found using the

• Enzyme inducing anti -epileptic drug(s) (EIAED) including, but  not limited to, 
carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin and barbiturates, should not be taken within 
14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and for the duration of study 
treatment  
• All herba l remedies and (including remedies in the form of herbal teas/infusions) are 
excluded while enrolled in the study  
• Medicinal food suppleme nts such as calcium, folic acid , vitamin D, multi- vitamin , 
etc., which have been taken under the advice from a physicia n, should be continued at 
the same dose and regimen during the study provided there are no contraindication as  
above . These should be listed as conc omitant medications in the CRF.  
• Any other supplements or alternative therapies should be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to enrol lment in the study  or pr ior to initiating them during the study.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  10. WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
10.1. Withdrawal of Subjects from Treatment/Procedures  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
prejudice to future medical care by the physician or institution.   
Subjects (or legally authorized representatives) can decline to continue receiving tazemetostat and/or other protocol -require d procedures at any time during the study but can continue 
participation in the study (e.g., for follow -up information).  If this occurs the investigator is to 
discuss with the subject appropriate processes for discontinuation and the options for procedure s 
that may continue such as collection of data, including endpoints and AEs.  The investigator must document the agreement in the procedures that the subject  will continue with and the level 
of follow -up that is agreed to by the subject (e.g., in person, by telephone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records.)  
Reasons for removal fro m protocol -required treatment or procedures might include the 
following: 
• Disease progression  
• Subjec t request to end study treatment and/or procedures  
• Safety concern (e.g. , AE, failure to follow contraception or pregnancy, excluded 
medication required)  
10.2. Survival Follow -Up 
Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment will be followed (by phone, ema il or 
clinic visit) for survival every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow -up.  
Survival follow -up will continue until 80% of treated subjects have died.  At such time, the 
subjects who are continuing on study treatment  and have received 12 months of treatment on the 
current study will be followed and treated on a subsequent extension study.   
10.3. Subsequent Therapy After Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Once a subject has permanently discontinued study treatment, every effort should be made to 
have the subject complete the post -treatment follow -up visit  prior to initiating any subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy (approved or investigational).  Post -study anti -cancer therapy will not be 
provided as part of this study. The subject may receive subsequent anti -cancer therapy at the 
Tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -203

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  discretion of the treating physician.  The subsequent anti -cancer therapy should be documented 
on the eCRF.  
10.4. Evaluation of Response to Subsequent Anti -Cancer Therapy  
To identify a potential epigenetic priming effect of tazemetostat, subjects who are withdrawn 
from this study due to disease progression and who go on to receive subsequent induction 
therapy should be followed for response whenever possible.  Data to be recorded on the subsequent regimen should include agents received, best res ponse and DOR . 
10.5.  Withdrawal of Subjects from Study  
Withdrawal of full consent for a study means that the subjects does not wish to receive further protocol- required treatment, procedures and does not wish to or is unable to continue f urther 
study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of 
consent (e.g., death records).  The investigator must document this agreement regarding withdrawal of full consent as well as discuss appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.   
Reasons for removal of a subject from the study might include the following:  
• Death  
• Decision by sponsor to terminate the study 
• Subject request to withdraw from study  
• Lost to follow -up 
10.6. Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects on Part 2 of the study will not be replaced.  Subjects on Part 1 of the study will be 
replaced if there are not a sufficient number of samples to calculate PK param eters.  
10.7.  Progression of Disease in Subjects Continuing to Receive Clinical Benefit  
There may be some instances when subjects are noted to have modest disease progression.  F or 
example, a slight increase in target lesions but with stable non -target lesions, and in the absence 
of clinical deterioration are receiving contin ued clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator.  
In such a situation, the investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss the assessment of risk: benefit of keeping the subject on study.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  11. SAFETY  
11.1. Safety Parameters  
11.2. Adverse Event Definition  
11.2.1  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not related to the IP.  
Worsening of a pre -treatment event, after initiation of tazemetostat, must be recorded as a new 
AE.  For example, if a subject  experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing 
tazemetostat, but the dyspepsia becomes severe and more frequent after the first dose of tazemetostat, a new AE of severe worsening dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of on set) 
should be recorded i n the eCRF.  
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of an expected pharmacological action” per se  is not to be reported 
as an AE or SAE.  However, any signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from “lack of efficacy” will be reported as an AE or SAE, if  they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE.  
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations w here an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
11.2.2  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  NOTE:   The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of t he event.  It does not re fer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
NOTE:   In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization ar e AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:   The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to i nclude experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening  
or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These 
should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions  (in 
subjects without pre -existing seizure disorder) that do not result in hospitalization, or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
11.3. Labor atory Abnormalities  
A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value that is considered clinically significant  by the 
investigator and has caused a medical intervention or is accompanied by clinical symptoms.  
Laboratory abnormalities that have not required medical intervention should not be recorded as AEs and will be captured and reported in the laboratory secti on of the clinical study report 
(CSR).  If a medical intervention occurs, it should be recorded as a treatment with the abnormal

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  laboratory finding as the AE (e.g., anemia with treatment required and blood transfusion 
recorded as a procedure, hyperglycemia  with treatment required and change in insulin dose 
recorded on concomitant medications).  
The investigator should decide, based upon the AE criteria and the clinical condition of the 
patient, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore represents an AE.  
If, at the end of the treatment phase with the study drug, there are pathological laboratory values which wer e not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations should be 
performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (i.e., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values.  
11.4. Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities  
Other  safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measu rements), including 
those that worsen from baseline and events
 in the medical and scientific judgment of the 
investigator are considered to be cli nically significant, are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, in 
accordance with the definitions provided in Sectio ns 11.2.1  and  11.2.2 , respectively.   
Any other safety assessment that led to an interv ention, including permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay is also to be recorded as an AE or SAE.   
11.4.1  Disease -Related Events  
Events that meet the criteria for serious but are thought to be  associated with progression of the 
disease under study should be reported as SAEs but  will not typically be processed  as expedited  
reports to regulatory authorities .  
NOTE:  Disease progression per se should not be reported as an SAE.  
11.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest (A ESIs)  
For this study,  AESIs will include:  
• Occurrence of  T-cell lymphoma  (refer to Section 11.10 for instructions on continued 
reporting of these events) .  Refer to Section 4.3 for management of s econdary 
lymphoma 
• Events considered related to abnormal bone formation and confirmed by radiologic 
scan.

Amendment 3  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 66 of 88 
Confidential and Proprietary  Final , 27 November 2017  
 
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  • AEs associated with treatment overdose, misuse, abuse, or medication error; and any 
treatment -emergent significant laboratory abnormality.   
These AES Is are to be captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only 
if they met one of the above criteria.   
11.6. Grading and Severity  
The severity of all AEs and SAEs, including appropriate laboratory values, will be graded 
utilizing the CTCAE  v4.03.  The link to the CTCAE Version 4.03 is:  
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf  
In the event that an AE is not covered by the CTCAE, the assessment of severity will be 
determined by using the CTCAE general guideline:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local  or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL.a 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.b 
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
ADL = Activities of Daily Living; AE = adverse event 
Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the teleph one, managing money, etc.  
Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden. 
 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category 
used fo r rating the intensity of an event (as in ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, or ‘severe’); both AEs and 
SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An event is described as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in Section 11.2.2  which are based on patient/event outcome or 
action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning  
11.7. Relationship Categorization  
A qualified investigator must make the determination of relationship to tazemetostat for each AE 
or SAE.  The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by tazemetostat.   
11.7.1  Asse ssing Relationship to Study Treatment  
The following should be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to study treatment:  
Tazemetostat  Protocol Number EZH -203 
Amendment 3  
  
 
   
Epizyme, Inc . Page 67 of 88 
Confidential and Proprietary  Final , 27 November 2017  
 
 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  • Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the first dose of tazemetostat  
• The course of the event, considering especially the effect of discontinuation of study 
treatment or the reintr oduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event  
• The presence of  non- study treatment -related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event.  
The relationship of an AE to study treatment is to be classified as follows: 
• Not Re lated:  A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility.  
• Related:  A causal relationship between tazemetostat and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility (includes probably, possibly and definitely related).   
If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and tazemetostat is related, that deter mination will 
be used for purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
11.8. Outcome Categorization  
Outcome of an AE/SAE may be classified as resolved, resolved with sequelae, unresolved or 
death.  
All treatment- related AEs/SAEs will be followed to resolution (the  subject’s health has returned 
to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), or until an outcome is reached, stabilization occurs (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of 
the event), or the event is otherwise explained, regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating in the study.  Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document  resolution of the event(s).  
11.9. Timeframe for Reporting AEs and SAEs  
AEs: AEs will be collected from the time the first dose of study treatment is administered until 
the earlier of either 30 days after the discontinuation of study treatment or until the initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy.  
SAEs: SAEs will be collected over the same  time period as stated above for AEs.  In addition, 
any SAE assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  tests, or change in exi sting therapy), study treatment  must be recorded from the time a subject 
provides consent to participate in the study up to and including any follow -up contact. All SAEs 
will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.    
After discontinuation of study tre atment:  The investigator will monitor all ongoing 
AEs/SAEs until resolution or stabilization of the event or until the subject is lost to follow -up or 
has withdrawn consent.  Up until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until the 
initiation of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier, the Investigator will repor t any 
AE that they consider to be possibly related to study treatment.    
Note that any incidence of secondary lymphoma, even if occurring more than 30 days after the last 
dose of study drug, will be reported to the Sponsor as an SAE . 
11.10.  Reporting of SAEs  
All SAEs will be reported within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  The 
investigator must promptly notify the sponsor or its designee of all SAEs in order that the legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities of the sponsor or its de signee are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of the IP under clinical investigation.  The sponsor and its 
designee will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/EC /CEC and investigators.  
Any AE that is both unexpected (not consistent with the applicable product information) and also 
meets the definition of a serious adverse event/reaction would be considered a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (“SUSAR”). All SUSARs will be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. SUSARs are prepared for expedited reporting according to local regulatory requirements and are forwarded to Investigators as necessary. The Sponsor is legally obligated to report the event to the regulatory authorities within 7 days for fatal or life -threatening SUSARs or 15 days for all others.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will file it with the IB 
and will notify the IRB/EC /CEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  11.10.1  Regulatory Authoriti es, IRB/EC , and CECs  
The sponsor or its designee is responsible for notifying the investigational sites of all expedited 
SAEs.  The sponsor or designee shall also notify Central Ethics Committees (CEC) of new 
serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects, per country requirements.  
The investigator will notify the IRB/EC /CEC of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) or 
significant risks to subjects, per local country requirements.  The investigator must keep copies 
of all AE informa tion, including correspondence with the sponsor or local IRB/EC /CECs on file.  
It is the responsibility of the Principal investigator to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs that occur at 
his/her site.  Investigator s will be notified of all suspected, unexpected SAEs (7/15- Day Safety 
Reports) that occur during any clinical studies that are using the investigative compound.  Each 
site is responsible for notifying their IRB/EC /CEC of these additional SAEs.  
All studies that are conducted within any European country will comply with the European CTD 2005/28/EC and CTD 2001/20/EC.  All SUSARs will be reported as required to the Competent Authorities of all involved European member states.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  12. DATA MANAGEMENT  
Data from eCRFs and other external data will be entered into an Ele ctronic Data Capture clinical 
database.  These data will be electronically verified through the use of real -time checks 
processed during data entry, and through programmed edit checks as specified in the data 
management plan.  Discrepancies in the data wil l be brought to the attention of the clinical team 
and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of an electronic data que ry.  
Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database and an audit trial within the system will track all  queries and changes made to the data.   Quality control audit(s) will be performed.  
12.1. Coding  
Concomitant medications will be assigned a code using the version of the World Health Organization (WHO) dictionary (version June 2015 or higher) drug codes specifi ed in the data 
management plan (version June 2015 or higher).  Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical -Therapeutic- Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic 
classification.  A listing of concomitant medications by drug and drug class will be included in 
the CSR for this protocol.  
AEs will be classified into standardized terminology from the verbatim descr iption ( investigator 
term) according to the version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) 
coding dictionary (version 18.0, or higher) specified in the data management plan. AEs will be presented by Preferred Term (PT) nested within S ystem Organ Class (SOC).  Verbatim 
description and PT and SOC MedDRA -level terms for all AEs will be contained in the data 
listings of the CSR for this study.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  13. STATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. Hypotheses  
For Part 2 of the study, the null hypothesis is that DCR rate after 12 weeks of treatment 
(percentage of subjects with a CR, PR or SD at the Week 12 tumor assessment), as assessed at 
the Stage 2 analysis, is not clinically meaningful ( ≤20%).  The alternative hypothesis is that the 
DCR rate at 12 weeks is clinically m eaningful ( ≥35%) and , therefore, the study treatment 
warrants further development.  At the Stage 1 analysis, 30 subjects will be enrolled and treated , 
and the analysis and decision rules specified here are based on 30  subjects.  For the Stage 1 
analysis with 30 treated subjects, at least five CR+PR+SDs are needed for the part to declare a 
success i.e., to have demonstrated sufficient clinical activity.  At the end of the stud y, if there are 
17 or more CR + PR +SDs out of 55 treated subjects, the n the new treatment is accepted.  
13.2. Study Design Considerations  
13.2.1  Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 12 subjects for Part 1 is sufficient for an initial assessment of the PK and  
safety profiles of the 400 mg tablet.  
For Part 2 of the study, e valuat ion will be done using a Green- Dahlberg two- stage design, to 
allow early termination of the study due to the lack of efficacy.  The sample size is calculated on the primary endpoint.  The hypothesis will be tested using a one -sided test with α=0.05 and the  
type II error rate will be controlled at 0.2.  The numbers of subjects to be enrolled using a Green-Dahlberg two- stage design is listed in the table below.  
Green -Dahlberg  CR + PR + SD  
at 12 Weeks  
Stage 1 Sample Size (n1)  30 
Stage 1 Rejection of Drug (r1) 4 
Maximum Sample Size (n)a 55 
Stage 2 Rejection of Drug (r)  16 
CR = complete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease  
a. The interim analysis planned at the end of Stage 1 may occur sooner if the 
Stage 1 rejection criterion is surpassed before all 30 subjects are treated and followed for 12 weeks.  In this scenario, the total sample size (Stage 1 + 
Stage 2) would still re main unchanged at 55 subjects.  
Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled an d treated in Stage 1 (see Section 13.3.2 , Interim 
Analyses , for further details).   While evaluating the response for the first 30 treated subjects, the 
enrollment and treatment of subsequent subjects  will be continued.  If the study continues on to 
Stage 2 , a total of 55 subjects will be enrolled in the entire stud y.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  • The probability of early stopping under the null hypotheses is 0.255.  
• The probability of early stopping under the alternative hypotheses is 0.008.  
13.2.2  Sample Size Re -Estimation  
The sample size will not be re- estimated during this study.  
13.3. Data Analysis Considerations  
13.3.1  Analysis Populations  
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects  who receive at least one dose of 
tazemetostat.  The ITT population will be used for summaries and analysis of the efficacy 
endpoints. 
The Safety Population  will consist of all subjects in the ITT population who have at least one 
post- dose safety observation recorded.  The Safety Population will be u sed for summaries and 
analysis of the safety and tolerability.  
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) population set will include all subjects in the ITT population who 
have sufficient post -dose samples collected to allow estimation of the PK parameters.  The PK 
population will be used for PK analysis.  
The Pharmacodynamic (P D) population will include all subjects in th e ITT population who 
have sufficient samples collected to allow estimation of the PD parameters.  The PD population 
will be used for summaries and graphs of PD data.  
13.3.2  Interim Analyses  
If, in consultation with the investigators, the PK and safety profiles of  tazemetostat in Part 1 are 
acceptable, then the 400 mg tablets will be used in Part 2.  
For Part 2, t he decision rules at the end of Stage 1 are listed in the table below.  
 Part 2  
(Relapsed/Refractory Synovial Sarcoma) 
Null Hypothesis  CR+PR+SD at Week  12 <20% 
Alternative Hypothesis  CR+PR+SD at Week  12 >35%

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  The end of Stage 1 occurs when the first 30 treated subjects have completed at least the Week 12 
assessment, completed the final study visit or terminated early from the study, whichever is 
sooner.   
• At the end of Stage 1, if there are ≤ 4 CR + PR + SD out of 30 subjects, then reje ct 
the new treatment and t erminate the study for futility.  When there are ≥5 
CR + PR + SD out of 30 subjects, the study continues to Stage 2.  
• At the end of the study, if there are ≤16 CR + PR +SD out of 55 treated subjects, then 
reject the new treatment.  When there are ≥17 or mor e CR + PR +SD out of 55 
subjects, then the new treatment is accepted.  
The interim analysis planned at the end of Stage 1 may occur sooner if the Stage 1 rejection criterion is surpassed before all 30 subjects are treated and follo wed 12 weeks.  In this sce nario, 
the total sample size (Stage 1 + Stage 2) would still remain unchanged at 55 subjects.   
13.3.3  Key Elements of the Analysis Plan  
Complete details of the analysis plan will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Any deviations from, or additions to, the original analysis plan in this protocol will be 
documented in the SAP and the CSR.  
All data up to the time of study completion/withdrawal from the study will be included in the analysis, regardless of treatment duratio n. 
Since the duration of study treatment for a given subject will depend on efficacy and tolerability, the duration of follow -up will vary among subjects.  All available time -to-event data will be 
analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.  Subjects with shorter treatment and follow-up 
will not be considered to have missing data.  Consequently, there will be no imputation for missing time -to-event data.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by study part and overall.  
13.4. Efficacy Ana lyses 
13.4.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The data cut -off for the Week 12 analysis at the end of the study will occur after all treated  
subjects have completed at least the Week 12 assessment ; completed the final study visit ; or 
terminated early from the study.  The DCR at Week 12 is defined as the percentage of subjects 
with a response of CR, PR or SD at the Week 12 assessment, as per modified RECIST [ Nowak, 
2005] for thoracic disease or RECIST 1.1 elsewhere.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Subjects with non- evalu able or missing response will be treated as not having disease controlled; 
i.e., they will be included in the denominator when calculating the DCR.  As a specific example, 
subjects with disease progression or death prior to the Week 12 assessment will be included in 
the denominator.  In addition to the DCR at Week 12, an exact 90% CI for this rate will be 
provided. 
13.4.2  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The ORR and an exact 90% CI will be provided.  
Data cut -off for Week 12 is define d in Section 13.4.1.  The data cut -off for the Week 24 analysis 
will occur after all subjects have completed at least the Week 24 assessment, completed the final 
study visit, or terminated early from the study, whichever is sooner.   
Progression -Free Survival (PFS)  is defined as the interval of time between the date of the first 
dose of study drug and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any caus e. 
• For subjects who progressed or died after an extended period without adequate 
assessment, the time of PFS will be censored at their date of last adequate assessment 
prior to progression or death even if subsequent information is available regarding progression or death.  An adequate assessment is defined as an assessment where the investi gator determined response is CR, PR, or SD.  The date of response at that 
assessment will be used for censoring.  Specific rules for identifying extended loss to follow- up or extended time without an adequate assessment are provided in the SAP.  
• For subjects who receive subsequent anti -cancer  therapy prior to the date of documented 
progression or death, the time of PFS will be censored at the last adequate assessment (i.e., last assessment of CR, PR or SD) prior to the initiation of that anti- cancer  therapy. 
• For other subjects who do not progress or die, the time of PFS will be censored at the 
date of the last adequate tumor assessment.  
Overall Survival (OS)  is defined as t he interval of time between the date of the first dose of 
study drug and the date of death due to any cause.  For subjects who do not die, the time of death 
will be censored at the date of last contact.  Death due to any cause will be included.  
Within each  part and overall , PFS and OS will be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier method .  
PFS an d OS at 12 weeks, 24 weeks , and overall along with the associated 90% CIs will be 
provided.  If there are a sufficient number of PFS events (i.e., progressions or deaths), median 
PFS, first and third quartiles and 90% CI, will be estimated using the Brookm eyer-Crowley 
method [Brookmeyer, 1982].  If there are a suffi cient number of deaths, median OS, first and

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  third quartiles and 90%  CI, will be estimated using the Brookmeyer -Crowley method.  Figures 
and listings of PFS and OS will also be provided.  
Response  Duration,  for the subset of subjects with confirmed CR or PR response, is defined as 
the interval of time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented 
disease progression or death due to any cause, using disease -appropriate standardized response 
criteria.  
The DOR  will be calculated for each subject with a confirmed CR  or PR.  If sample size permits, 
the median DOR  will be calculated from the Kaplan -Meier estimates.  First and third quartiles 
will also be calculated along with a ssociated 90% CIs if there are a sufficient number of 
responders who subsequently progress or  die due to any cause.  A listing of DOR  will be 
provided. 
13.5. Safety Analyses  
13.5.1  Extent of Exposure  
The data on exposure to tazemetostat will be listed.  Details pertain ing to dose interruption or 
dose modification will also be listed.  Duration of exposure and percentage of treatment 
compliance will be summarized.  
13.5.2  Adverse Events  
The data listings of AEs in the C SR will contain the verbatim description, PT and SOC 
MedDRA -level terms.  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined by applying treatment -emergent signs and 
symptoms (TESS) philosophy.  AEs will be regarded as TEAEs if one of the following 
conditions is met:  
• Emerge after the time of first dose administration, havin g been absent prior to the first dose.  
• Re-emerge, having been present but stopped prior to the time of first dose administration.  
• Worsen in severity after the time of first dose administration relative to the pre -treatment state, 
when the AE is continuous.  
An AE with partial or completely missing start date and/or time will always be assumed as TEAE, unless it can be determined to be “prior to administration” from the incomplete start date/time or resolution date/time (e.g., month, year is before first administration date, or resolution date is before first administration date).

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Only TEAEs will be summarized.  Summaries of TEAEs will consist of the number and 
percentage of subjects reporting the AE by SOC  and by PT.  TEAEs which occur more than once 
for a su bject will be counted only once in the subject frequencies.  TEAEs with different CTCAE 
grade s for a subject will be counted at the worst (highest) grade for the same  SOC (likewise for 
PT).  TEAEs with different drug relationship for a subject will be counted at strongest 
relationship for the same  SOC (likewise for PT).  TEAEs with missing relatio nship to study 
treatment will be counted as “related”.  TEAEs with missing CTCAE grade will be counted as Grade 3 (“severe”).  
Summaries of TEAEs by study part and overall will be produced to present the number and percentage of subjects with:  
• Any TEAE  
• Any treatment -related TEAE  
• Any TEAE with CTCAE Grade 3 or higher  
• Any TEAE leading to study treatment discontinuation 
• Any Serious TEAEs  
• Any TEAE of special interest  
Listings will be provided for the following:  
• AEs 
• TEAEs leading to study treatment discontinuation  
• Serious TEAEs  
• Fatal TEAEs  
• TEAEs of special interest  
13.5.3  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
All clinical laboratory parameters will be standardized according to the Inter national System of 
Units (SI) prior to summarization.  Separate listings and summary tables (by study part and overall) will be produced for each laboratory test group (complete blood counts, serum chemistries [liver, renal and metabolism] and coagulation profile).  
Low, normal, and high (LNH) classifications will be applied to determine whether the laboratory test value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) its reference range. Shifts from baseline in LNH classification and CTCAE grades for each parameter  will be s ummarized by part and 
overall. The summary will include the worst case shift from baseline during the post -baseline

study drug.  Subjects with laboratory dat a outside the normal range will be flagged as “L” (Low) 
or “H” (High) in the data listing.  
13.5.4  Other Safety Measures  
The results of scheduled assessments of physical examination, vital signs, ECG, and ECOG performance status will be summarized by stu dy part an d overall.  Summaries will include data 
from scheduled visits.  Shifts from baseline will be summarized where appropriate.  All data will be listed.  
13.6. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentrations of tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ-6930 will be determin ed by a 
validated bioanalytical method.  Concentrations of tazemetostat and its metabolite will be listed by study part and nominal time.  Standard summary statistics will be calculated (i.e., mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum).    
All PK par ameters wi ll be calculated using actual times.  Population estimates of CL/F, Vd/F, 
and Ka for tazemetostat will be calculated with a non -linear mixed -effects model using 
NONMEM 7 software.  The effect of subject characteristics such as age, weight, body s urface 
area, and gender on the PK parameters may be investigated.  The PK data from this study may be combined with data from other studies to determine the final population PK model.  The final population PK model will be described in a separate report.  
13.7. Exploratory Analysis 
As data warrant, exploratory analysis may be performed on each exploratory endpoint listed below. In addition, exploratory analyses may be performed to examine the relationship between exposure to tazemetostat and clinical and safety en dpoints (including tumor size or change in 
tumor size from baseline). The results of these exploratory analyses may be reported separately from the CSR.  
• Tumor target gene expression and phenotypic markers including those for differentiation, 
apoptosis, inflammation and cell proliferation, and their correlation with activity  
• Somatic mutation analysis of tumor tissue and blood 
• Germline analysis for BAP1 variants

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Clinical supplies of tazemetostat will not be released to the site and recruitment of subjects will 
not begin until the IRB/EC /CEC written approval has be en received by the sponsor or its 
designee.  
The investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB/EC /CEC apprised of the progress of the 
study and of any changes made to the protocol and/or ICF.  The investigator must also keep the 
IRB/EC/CEC informed of any  serious and significant AEs.  
15.2.2  Informed Consent Process  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent from each subject 
before any protocol -specific assessments and/or procedures are performed.  All consent 
documentation must be in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP.  Each subject or the subject’s legally aut horized representative is requested to sign the ICF after the subject has 
received and read the written subject information and received an explanation of what the study involves, including but not limited to: the objectives, potential benefits and risk, i nconveniences 
and the subject’s rights and responsibilities.  A copy of the ICF (subject information sheet and the ICF, as applicable) must be given to the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative.  If applicable, it will be provided in a  certified translation of the subject’s local 
language.  Signed ICFs must remain in each subject’s study file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time.  
Each investigator will provide the sponsor or its designee with a copy of the IRB/EC/CEC-
approved ICF(s), and a copy of the IRB/EC /CEC written approval, prior to the start of the study.  
Additionally, if the IRB/EC /CEC requires modification of the sample subject information and 
the model ICF provided by the sponsor , the documentation supporting this requirement must be 
provided to the sponsor. 
The sponsor reserves the right to delay initiation of the study at a site where the ICF(s) do not 
meet the standards of applicable regulations and ICH GCP.  
15.3. Subject Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the sponsor and/or their designee(s), 
participating investigators, and any staff. This confidentiality includes the clinical information relating to participating subjects, as we ll as any genetic or biological testing.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor  may inspect all documents 
and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical 
records (office, clinic , or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subjects in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
15.4. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study will be performed by the sponsor or its designee(s).  At the monitoring 
visits, the pro gress of the study will be discussed with the investigator , or his/her representative.  
The ICFs will be reviewed for signatures and the eCRFs checked for completeness and accuracy.  Subject source data must be available for review.  The investigator and h is/her staff are expected 
to cooperate with the study monitor and be available during at least a portion of the monitoring visit to review the eCRFs and any queries/resolutions, answer questions, and provide any missing information.  
The study monitor will record the date of each visit together with a summary of the status and 
progress of the study.  Proposed actions will be confirmed with the investigator in writing.  
Telephone contact will be made with the investigator as necessary during the data collectio n 
period and during the data and report writing periods.  
15.5. Protocol Deviations  
Deviation s from the protocol should not be made unless it has been agreed to in writing by both 
the investigator and the sponsor and approved by the IRB/EC /CEC.  Investigative sites will 
contact the medical monitor to request clarifications regarding any aspect of the clinical study or eligibility of subjects.  
When an emergency occurs that requires a deviation from the protocol for an individual subject, the deviation will be only for that subject.  The investigator  or other physician in attendance in 
such an emergency will, if circumstances and time permit, contact the sponsor or their 
representative(s), immediately by telephone.  Such contacts will be made as soon as possible to permit a decision as to whether or not the subject (for whom the protocol deviation was affected) is to continue in the study.  The source documentation will completely describe the protocol deviation and state the reasons for such deviation.  In addition, the IRB/EC/CEC will be notified 
in writing of such protocol deviation.  
15.6. Protocol Amendment  
All amendments to the protocol must be documented in writing, reviewed, and approved by the investigator and the sponsor , and submitted to the IRB/EC /CEC for approval  prior to initiation,

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  except in cases where required for subject safety.  If the protocol amendment substantially alters 
the study design or potential risk to the subject, a new written ICF for continued participation in the study must be obtained from eac h subject or his/her legal representative.  
15.7. Suspension or Termination of Study  
Should conditions requiring further clarification arise before the decision to proceed with or terminate the study can be reached, the study will be suspended until the situation has been 
resolved. 
The sponsor has the right to terminate this study and remove all study material from the site at 
any time.  Examples of where this might occur include, but are not limited to:  
• When it becomes apparent that subject enrollment is unsatisf actory with respect to 
quality and/or quantity or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete on a chronic 
basis.  
• When the incidence and/or severity of AEs in this study indicates a potential health 
hazard caused by treatment with tazemetostat.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  16. ADMINIST RATIVE PROCEDURES  
16.1. Recording and Access and to Study Records  
As described in the ICH GCP Guidelines (ICH E6 Section 8.3), ‘essential documents’, including 
eCRFs, source documents, consent forms, laboratory test results and the IP inventory records 
must be maintained by the investigator.  
These records must be made available at reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if required, by a properly authorized representative of the US FDA in accordance with the US Code of Federal  Regulations, 21 CFR 312.68,  or other regulatory authorities in accordance with 
regulatory requirements.  
16.2. Case Report Forms  
eCRF s will be used for data collection for this study.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining adequate and accurate source documents from 
which accurate information will be transcribed into eCRFs, which have been designed to capture 
all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation.  The eCRFs should be completed by the investigator or delegate as stated on the Delegation of Authority Log.  
Overwriting of information or use of liquid correcting fluid is not allowed in the source document. 
Each investigative site will be visited as frequently as d ocumented in the monitoring plan by the 
sponsor or their designee to review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy.  The sponsor or 
their designee will highlight any discrepancies found between source documents and the 
completed eCRFs and ensure that appr opriate site personnel address the discrepancies.  When a 
discrepancy results in corrected  eCRF data, the correction will be reviewed again against the 
correct source documentation.  Uniform procedures will be discussed at the Site Initiation Visit.  
The eC RFs must be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator once all 
data has been entered and all queries resolved.  Once the study m onitor has verified the contents 
of the completed eCRFs against the source data, queries may be raised if  the data are unclear or 
contradictory.  The investigator must address all queries.  
16.3. Qualit y Assurance and Quality Control  
A site monitoring plan will be developed to ensure the human subject protection, study procedures, laboratory, study intervention admi nistration, and data collection processes are of 
high quality and meet the sponsor 's, ICH/ GCP, and other applicable regulatory guidelines.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  The investigator will permit authorized the sponsor or its designee(s) and the respective 
regulatory authorities to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study if needed.  
Initial site training will  be provided by the sponsor or its designee.  Training for new site staff 
will be provided by previously trained study nurses, study coordinators or other qualified s taff 
under the supervision of the primary investigator .  Additional training will be provided by the 
sponsor or its designee as needed.  
The designated Data Management Team will implement quality control ( QC) procedures 
beginning with the data entry system and generate data QC checks that will be run on the 
database.  Any missing data or data an omalies will be communicated to the site(s) for 
clarification/resolution.  
16.4. Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance w ith the sponsor or its 
designee's Standard Operating Procedures, protocols and working pra ctice documents, and the 
requirements of ICH/GCP guidelines.  Compliance will be achieved through a combination of 
study- specific audits of investigative sites and au dits at regular intervals of the sponsor or its 
designee's systems for data handling, analysis, and reporting.   
16.5. Confidentiality  
Data collected during this study may be used to support the development, registration, or marketing of tazemetostat.  After a s ubject or his/her legal representative have consented to take 
part in the study their medical records and the data collected during the study will be reviewed by the sponsor and/or its designee.  These records and data may be reviewed by the following: 
independent auditors who validate the data on behalf of the sponsor; third parties with whom the 
sponsor may develop, register or market tazemetostat; national or local regulatory authorities and 
the IRB/EC/CEC(s) which gave its/their approval for this study to proceed.  
Although subjects will be known by a unique identifier number, their year of birth will also be collected and used to assist the sponsor and/or its designee to verify the accuracy of the data, for 
example, that the laboratory results are assigned to the correct subject.  
16.6. Audit/Inspection  
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by this study will be available for inspection upon request by representatives of the US FDA as well as other national and local regulatory authoriti es, the sponsor and/or its designee, interested commercial parties, and the 
IRB/EC/CEC for each study site.

 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  16.7. Record Retention  
Essential documents should be retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications i n an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP.  These documents should be retained 
for a longer period however if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement wi th the sponsor or its designee.  It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  The investigator must obtain written permission from the sponsor or its designee prio r to the 
destruction of any study document.  
16.8. Provision of Study Results and Publication  
A summary of the study results will be made publicly available within 12 months  of reaching the 
end of the study, defined as the date of the last subject’s last visit.  A full CSR will be made 
publicly available no later than 18 months after the end of the study.  
If a manuscript is published in a peer -reviewed journal, then that init ial release may be an 
abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  
All manuscripts, abstracts or other modes of presentation arising from the results of the study must be reviewed and approved in writing by the sponsor , in advance of submission.  The review 
is aimed at protecting the sponsor ’s proprietary information existing either at the date of the 
commencement of the study or generated during the study.  
The detailed obligations regarding the publication of any data, material results or other information, generated or created in relation to the study shall be set out in the agreement 
between each investigator and the sponsor.

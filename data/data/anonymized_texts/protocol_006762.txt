Study Sites:   This study will be conducted at approximately 40 – 50 sites in approximately 10 countries 
worldwide
Study Population:   
Levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease patients with severe motor fluctuations and 
hyperkinesia/dyskinesia when available combinations of Parkinson medicinal products have not given satisfactory results.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 88 subjects (44 per each treatment group)
Methodology:   
Figure 1:  Study Design Schematic
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, randomized multicenter 26-week study comparing LCIG to optimized medical treatment (OMT).  The study will consist of 3 sequential periods:  Screening, Treatment and Follow-Up.  The OMT group will have the same schedule of visits/procedures throughout the study as the LCIG group except for visits related to NJ/PEG procedures and titration of LCIG.

Methodology (Continued):
The Screening Period (V1 – V3)
The Screening Period will be the same for all subjects screened into the study.  The Screening Period will 
consist of three visits, Visit 1 (V1), Visit 2 ([V2] [optional]) and the Randomization Visit (V3) in which the subject will be assessed to determine eligibility.  A movement disorder specialist should perform an interview of the subject at screening.  The duration of the Screening Period can be between 30 – 67 days to accommodate the required procedures, training and collection of diaries, and allow for stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.  All anti-PD medications and any other medications used to treat individual non-motor symptoms (e.g., Insomnia, depression, anxiety), must be stable with no adjustments to the frequency of administration, dose of administration or total daily dose.  Both anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS are required to be stable for a minimum of 30 days.  During the Screening Period, no study drug (LCIG) will be administered.  Visit 2 is optional and is based on the PIs discretion of individual subject need during stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.  Subjects who are deemed eligible by randomization criteria at Visit 3 will be randomized at the end of Visit 3 to receive LCIG or continue on OMT following baseline assessments.
Treatment Period (V4 – V8)
OMT Group:
Those subjects randomized to continue OMT will remain on their current optimized regimen and will 
have study visits at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12, and 26 following randomization (V3).  The OMT group will not have a V4 (NJ/PEG-J Placement).  The day after randomization (V3) will be considered Day 1 of their treatment period.
During the treatment phase, changes to anti-PD and NMS medications should remain stable and can only 
be made if medically indicated.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified," not only for serious safety reasons.
LCIG Group:
In accordance with the LCIG approved Product Label for countries participating in the study, those 
subjects randomized to LCIG must discontinue all other anti-PD medications (e.g., dopamine agonists, COMT-inhibitors, amantadine, MAO-B inhibitors, anti-cholinergics, and subcutaneous apomorphine etc.) prior to LCIG initiation on Day 1 (V4); these medications should be tapered off according to the prescribing information and the discretion of the Investigator.  With the exception of continuous subcutaneous delivery of apomorphine or levodopa containing formulations, these medications may be restarted if indicated by the subject's individual condition, but not within the first 28 days after LCIG initiation.
For those subjects randomized to LCIG, an optional, temporary nasojejunal (NJ) tube may be used 
initially to titrate the dose of LCIG.  Following the NJ phase, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal tube (PEG-J) will be performed by a gastroenterologist proceduralist.  Total time to titration via the NJ and PEG-J should not exceed 14 days.  Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of the permanent PEG-J tube without the NJ phase at the discretion of the principal investigator.  If the subject proceeds directly to PEG-J, titration should be completed within 7 days.  However, at the PI's discretion additional days of optimization may be made if indicated.  Subjects on LCIG will return for study visits at the end of Weeks 2, 6, 12, 26 and 27 following PEG-J placement.

Methodology (Continued):
LCIG Group (Continued):
Subjects and/or caregivers must come into the clinic or pharmacy between V7 (Week 12) and V8 
(Week 26) for clinical LCIG return and supply visits so that there is no risk of medication expiring.  The 
drug dispensing visits will occur at Weeks 17 and 22 (± 7 days).  Other assessments may be completed during these visits if required.
During the treatment phase, medications used to treat specific non-motor symptoms must remain stable 
for the duration of the study unless medically warranted.
Study Follow-Up
The OMT subjects will not have a follow-up visit (V9).For LCIG subjects who elect to discontinue LCIG and not continue with commercially available product, 
a V9 will be conducted one week after NJ/PEG-J removal and the follow-up period will be up until 
30 days after NJ/PEG-J removal.  For LCIG subjects who will transition to commercial product, the SAE/AE follow-up period will be 30 days after conversion to commercial.

Doses: LCIG:  For those randomized to LCIG, each subject's dose will be 
individually optimized in accordance with the LCIG approved product 
label for countries participating in the study.  The dose should be adjusted to an optimal clinical response for the individual patient, which means maximizing the functional ON-time during the day by minimizing the number and duration of OFF episodes (bradykinesia) and minimizing ON-time with disabling dyskinesia. 
Once optimized, dose adjustments to LCIG can be made up to Day 28.  
After Day 28 the dose should remain stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments are absolutely needed for safety reasons.  If modifications are needed, this should first be discussed with the medical monitor.
The total daily dose of LCIG will be composed of three components:  
(i) the morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses.  The continuous infusion is expected to run over a period of 16 consecutive hours each day.
Mode of Administration: LCIG is dispensed in a medication cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be connected to a portable subject-operated pump for infusion via NJ or PEG-J.
Reference Therapy: Optimized Medical Treatment
Doses: PI discretion and/or in accordance with approved product label of the prescribed medications
Mode of Administration: Oral, sub-lingual or transdermal
Duration of Treatment:   26 weeks

Efficacy:Efficacy Dataset and Treatment Period
The efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent-to-treat dataset which will include all subjects who 
are randomized to the optimized medical treatment, and all subjects who are randomized to LCIG and received at least one dose of study drug.  For assessments of efficacy the treatment period will begin the day after randomization (V3) for subjects randomized to OMT, and the day of first LCIG infusion following PEG-J placement for subjects randomized to LCIG treatment.  The treatment period will end on the day of the final visit for subjects randomized to OMT, and on the last day of LCIG study drug infusion for subjects randomized to LCIG treatment.  The last assessment prior to randomization will be considered baseline and the last assessment that is no more than 2 days after the end of the treatment period will be considered the final evaluation.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Primary Efficacy Analysis
There are 2 alternative primary efficacy variables, change from baseline to Week 26 for NMSS total 
score and change from baseline to Week 26 for PDSS-2 total score.  Either variable considered statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment is sufficient to declare success of the study.
The primary efficacy analysis model is a likelihood-based mixed-effects model repeated measures 
(MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline for each post-baseline observation using all observed data.  The model will include fixed, categorical effects for treatment, site, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, with continuous fixed covariates for baseline score and the baseline score-by-visit interaction.  The primary comparison will be the contrast between LCIG and optimized oral treatment at the Week 26 Visit.
The two-sided Pvalues obtained from the MMRM model for NMSS total score change from baseline to 
Week 26 and PDSS-2 total score change from baseline to Week 26 will be adjusted for multiplicity using 
the Hochberg procedure.  This method controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) at a pre-specified significance level (alpha = 0.05).  Specifically, the following steps will be followed:
!If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is ≤ 0.05 (i.e., both Pvalues are ≤ 0.05), both endpoints are 
considered statistically significant.
!If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is > 0.05, then compare the smaller Pvalue with 0.025.  The 
second endpoint is statistically significant if the Pvalue is ≤ 0.025; otherwise, neither endpoint 
is considered statistically significant.
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
There are 3 key secondary endpoints:
!PDQ-8 summary index
!CGI-C
!UPDRS Part II score
The key secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary 
efficacy variables.  For CGI-C, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.
If both primary efficacy variables are statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity, the Stepwise 
Gatekeeping Procedure will be utilized and the 3 key secondary endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg procedure with significance level of 0.05.
Other secondary endpoints below will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary efficacy 
variables:
!NMSS domain scores
!PDSS-2 domain  scores
!UPDRS total score, Part I score, Part III score, Part IV score
!PGIC
!Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) total and subscale scores
!Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) score
For the analysis on PGIC, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety:
Safety Dataset and Treatment Period
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety dataset which will include all subjects who are 
randomized to the optimized medical treatment, and all subjects who are randomized to LCIG and received at least one dose of study drug.  The treatment period for safety is the same as what is defined for efficacy.
Safety Analyses
Safety analyses will include summaries of adverse events, device-related product complaints, vital signs 
and special labs.
Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 88 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either OMT or 
LCIG.  There are no results on NMSS or PDSS-2 available from randomized trials comparing LCIG and OMT.  Interim data from ongoing Phase 3b Study M12-920 showed that the improvement in NMSS total score from baseline to Week 12 is 24.8 in the LCIG arm with standard deviation of 24.  Results from Zibetti et al (2013) showed that the improvement in PDSS-2 total score after an average of 3.5 months of LCIG treatment was 13.1.  The standard deviation was not provided and is estimated to be 12.2 assuming the correlation between baseline and follow-up visits is 0.5.
The significance level for this study is 0.05.  For sample size determination, it is assumed that the 
improvement in the OMT group is 33% of the LCIG group, i.e., the improvement is 8.2 on NMSS total score and 4.3 on PDSS-2 total score, and that the correlation between these 2 measures is 0.5, Simulation showed that a study with 37 subjects per group will have 90% power to declare statistical significance on at least one of these 2 alternative primary endpoints after multiplicity adjustment using Hochberg procedure.  It is further assumed that 10% of randomized subjects in either treatment group will not provide post-randomization efficacy assessment.  Additional simulations showed that 44 subjects per group will provide 90% power in the sensitivity analysis using baseline observation carried forward for subjects without post-randomization assessment.  Therefore the total planned enrollment is decided to be 88 subjects.

3.0 Introduction
The combination of levodopa-carbidopa continues to be a mainstay in the treatment of 
Parkinson's disease (PD).1-3  As PD progresses, PD patients treated with oral levodopa 
may develop persistent motor fluctuations characterized by unpredictable swings from mobility to immobility ("On-Off" phenome non) or levodopa-induced dyskinesia.  Motor 
fluctuations occur in about 40% of patients af ter 4 to 6 years of treatment with levodopa 
and up to 90% of patients may experience motor fluctuations after 10 years of levodopa therapy.
4  The mechanisms by which response fluctuations occur are only partially 
understood but are thought to include presyna ptic neuronal degeneration leading to a lack 
of buffering of released levodopa, postsynaptic changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity and number, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic influences of exogenously administered dopaminergic agents.
5,6  Fluctuations in plasma levels of levodopa occur due 
to the short half-life of levodopa and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying.  As a result, advanced PD patients suffer severe disability due to constant or unpredictable motor fluctuations, despite increases in the dose or frequency of their oral levodopa treatment.
Various approaches have been taken to cope with the increasingly unstable levodopa 
response.  Levodopa dose and frequency of administration are usually adjusted, although many patients find it challenging to take frequent oral doses of medication.  Oral formulations of levodopa are often prescribed in combination with long-acting dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO Inhibitors) and catechol O methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors as well as apomorphine injection on an as needed basis.  However, despite individually optimized treatment with these conventional medications, patients with advanced PD experience inadequate control of their motor performance.  A number of more invasive a pproaches have been explored and utilized 
with varying degrees of success; they include the continuous intravenous (IV) administration of levodopa,
7-10and deep brain stimulation (DBS).11  DBS has been used in 
the treatment of advanced PD patients and has demonstrated improvement of motor fluctuations in this patient population, but serious and severe adverse events have been

23
reported in approximately 13% – 40% of patients including intracerebral hemorrhage, 
intracranial infection and death.12,13  The procedure is also not available in all settings and 
not all PD patients are candidates for brain surgery.14  Continuous administration of IV 
levodopa is not clinically feasible due to technical limitations.  However, studies with constant-rate delivery (i nfusion) of levodopa to the blood ha ve clearly resulted in marked 
stabilization of motor performance in advanced PD patients.
9,10,15
In addition to motor symptoms and motor fluctuations, patients with advanced PD also suffer from a constellation of non-motor symptoms (NMS) that is often overlooked yet also causes significant disability and impairment to quality of life.  The pathophysiology 
of NMS is poorly underst ood, but dysfunction of both dopaminergic and 
nondopaminergic systems are implicated in their development.  Non-motor symptoms consist of autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, sialorrhea, sexual 
dysfunction, urinary retention, temperature dysregulation, and sweating), cognitive and 
affective disturbances, sleep disorders, and sensory complaints.
Martinez-Martin et al have recently demonstrated that non-motor symptoms have, as a 
whole, a greater impact on health related quality of life (HRQoL) than motor symptoms.
16  
Moreover, they have demonstrated that NMS progression contributes importantly to HRQoL decline in patients with Parkinson's disease.  Similarly, Hinnell et al demonstrated that depression, anxiety, and other non-mood, non-cognitive NMS had a greater impact on HRQoL (as measured by the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire [PDQ]-8) than motor symptoms.
17  In the PRIAMO study,18which assessed NMS in over 
1,000 PD subjects using a semi -structured interview questionnaire consisting of 12 NMS 
domains defined by the steering committee, 98.6% of subjects reported the presence of NMS.  The prevalence of NMS was evaluated by dividing PD subjects into 3 groups:  "naïve" subjects who had not been treated with dopaminergic agents, "stable" subjects who were under dopaminergic treatment and had no motor complications, and "complicated" subjects who had developed motor fluctuations and/or dyskinesia under dopaminergic treatment.  The most common  NMS and their prevalence in PD subjects 
were as follows:  fatigue (58%), anxiety (56%), leg pain (38%), insomnia (37%), urgency

EudraCT 2014-004865-26
24
and nocturia (35%), drooling of saliva, and difficulties in maintaining concentration 
(31%).  The NMS domains of gastrointestinal, pain, urinary, sleep, and skin disorders and "miscellaneous" were more frequent in the "stable" and "complicated" subjects than in the "naïve" subjects.  However, the frequency of cardiovascular symptoms, fatigue, apathy, attention/memory, psychiatric, and respir atory symptoms did not differ across the 
3 groups.  The prevalence of sleep disorders increased with disease severity.  Sleep disorders were reported by 47.9% and 81.6% of subjects with mild (Hoehn and Yahr stage = 1) and severe (Hoehn and Yahr stage = 4 – 5) disease respectively.  The mean 
number of NMS per subject was 7.8 during the prior month and the frequency of NMS increased with disease duration and severity of disease.  Using a structured questionnaire of 54 questions on various NMS, Witjas et al found that 64% of PD patients had experienced drenching sweats, 44% flushing, 44% oral dryness, and 40% constipation.
19   
These symptoms were associated with a high disability rating and poorer quality of life.  Other prevalent NMS include sleep disturbances (insomnia, daytime sleepiness, restless legs and intense vivid dreams), impaired me mory and concentration, depression, and 
dribbling.
20  PD patients suffer from a variety of s leep disturbances including excessive 
daytime sleepiness, fragmented sleep, REM (rapid eye movement) behavioral sleep disorder (RBD), periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), restless leg syndrome (RLS), sleep apnea and insomnia.  Ondo et al evaluated the prevalence of nocturnal sleep disorders in over 300 PD subjects with an average disease duration of 9 years and a mean Hoehn and Yahr score of 2.5 using a survey combining questions from various sleep scales.
21  The study demonstrated that 43% of subjects experienced RBD, 51% 
somniloquism (talking in their sleep), 39% snoring (indicative of sleep apnea), 20% RLS, and an average of almost 3 awakenings pe r night.  Additionally, the PRIAMO study found 
that 64% of PD subjects suffered from sleep disorders overall with 75% in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5 – 3 and 82% in Hoehn and Yahr stage 4 – 5.
18  Non-motor symptoms also 
lead to increased hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality in PD patients.  Findingeffective treatments for NMS in PD is equally important as treating motor symptoms to address significant patient impairment and reduced quality of life.

Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel (LCIG) has been marketed for 10 years.  The LCIG 
System is currently approved in 42 countries for the treatment of levodopa-responsive 
advanced PD.  In the majority of countries, it is marketed under the trade name Duodopa.  
LCIG is a suspension of levodopa-carbi dopa monohydrate (4:1) in an aqueous gel 
(carboxymethyl cellulose) with a viscosity that permits homogeneous distribution of micronized substance particles.  Upon upper intestinal administration, the compounds are dissolved in situ and levodopa is rapidly absorbed by an active carrier mechanism localized in the proximal small intestine.  LCIG provides continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic receptors in the brain by permitting plasma concentrations of levodopa within the individual's therapeutic window.  When delivered via continuous intestinal infusion therapy, LCIG  reduces "Off" time and increases "On" 
time compared to oral levodopa-carbidopa.
22  Some studies suggest that the improvement 
of LCIG infusion may be correlated with the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms while on oral treatment.
23  The delivery of LCIG directly to the upper intestine is anticipated to 
result in the following:2,15
●Continuous delivery of levodopa -carbidopa
●Avoidance of the effects of pulsatile gastric emptying
●Reduced variability in plasma-levodopa concentrations
●Decreased motor fluctuations and dyskinesia

LCIG is delivered to the proximal small intestine through a percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy with jejunal extension tube (PEG -J).  The LCIG is dispensed in medication 
cassette reservoirs.  The contents of the medication cassette reservoir are delivered via continuous administration by an infusion pump as illustrated in Figure 1 .  Efficacy of 
upper-intestinal administration of LCIG has been  demonstrated in Phase 3 studies.  In the 
pivotal Phase 3 study (Study S187.3.001/Study S187.3.002), compared to Levodopa-Carbidopa I mmediate Release (LC-IR), LCIG significantly improved "Off" 
time (LS Mean difference = –1.91 hours, P= 0.0015) and "On" time without troublesome 
dyskinesia ("On" time without dyskinesia + "On" time with non-troublesome dyskinesia, LS Mean difference = 1.86 hours, P= 0.0059) at Week 12.  At Week 12, compared with 
LC-IR, LCIG significantly decreased the per centage of the waking day in the "Off" state 
and significantly increased the percentage of waking day in the "On" state without troublesome dyskinesia.  LCIG also produced a significantly greater change from baseline in "On" time without dyskinesia compared to LC-IR.  Most adverse events were transient and were mild or moderate in intensity and were generally associated with the PEG-J procedure and its complications.  The most common adverse events were complication of device insertion (56.8%), abdominal pain (51.4%), nausea (29.7%), procedural pain (29.7%), constipation (21.6%) and incision site erythema (18.9%).
16
Improvements were also seen with LCIG in  disease-specific and global Quality of Life 
(QoL) measures, as assessed by Clinical Glob al Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), 
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 Item (PDQ-39) total scores, and EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) scores.
24
In a long-term open-label safety study (Study S187-3-004) conducted over 54 weeks with 324 subjects, a clinically meaningful reduction in "Off" time was apparent by Week 4 and persisted to the Week 54 endpoint.  All of the reduction in "Off" time (4.44 hours, P< 0.001) was accompanied by an increase in "On" time without troublesome dyskinesia 
(4.80 hours, P< 0.001), as was observed in the pivotal study.  This improvement was 
achieved with the majority of subjects (> 75%) requiring onl y levodopa-carbi dopa therapy 
for treating their PD symptoms throughout the study.  The most common adverse events 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
27
(≥10% of subjects) were complication of device insertion (34.9%), abdominal pain 
(31.2%), procedural pain (20.7%), nausea (16.7%), excessive granulation tissue (16.0%), 
postoperative wound infection (15.4%), fall (15.1%), constipation (14.5%), insomnia, (13.6%), incision site erythema (13.0%), and urinary tract infection (11.4%).  For each of these preferred terms, the adverse events for the majority of subjects were mild to moderate as assessed by the investigator.
Just as LCIG is effective in treating motor fluctuation in advanced PD, it has the potential 
to treat many of the NMS associated with PD as well.  Typically, treatment of any of these NMS require additive therapy and exposes th e patient to drug-drug interactions as well as 
the potential side effect from these therapies.  Non-motor symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease and even predate motor symptoms, but remain present in all stages of the disease and become more prominent as the disease progresses.
18  These 
symptoms can be more troublesome than the cardinal parkinsonian motor symptoms and contribute to significant disability, and to the worsening of quality of life of both patients and caregivers.
16,24
Although NMS have been implicated in PD since the original description by James Parkinson in 1817, only recently have they been well recognized as important features of the disease.
26  There are 2 primary reasons why NMS has not been recognized as 
important features of disease:  1) Lack of disease specific instruments to assess NMS and 2) Treatments for PD typically focus on control of motor symptoms; consequently, NMS 
tend to be underreported and inade quately treated in the clinical setting.
27,28  One study in 
the US demonstrated that existing depression, anxiety and fatigue are not identified by neurologists in over 50% of consultations, and existing sleep disturbances in over 40%.
29  
To date, there have been a few small investigator initiated studies assessing the effect of LCIG on NMS.  In a pilot study by Honig et al switching from oral medications to 
continuous infusion of LCIG reduced motor complications in advanced PD, as well as the burden of NMS.
30  In this prospective open-label observational study, 22 advanced PD 
patients (mean age 58.6 years, duration of di sease 15.3 years) were followed for 6 months 
and the effect of LCIG on NMS was assessed by the NMSS, Parkinson's disease sleep

EudraCT 2014-004865-26
28
scale (PDSS) and PDQ-8.  A statist ically si gnificant beneficial effect was shown in the 
NMSS total score (56% improvement from baseline) and 6 of the 9 domains of the 
NMSS:  cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and miscellaneous (including pain and dribbling).  These results paralleled the improvement observed in motor symptoms.  In addition, significant improvements were found on the PDSS (33% improvement from baseline) and in health-related quality of life (assessed by the PDQ-8).  The improvement in PDQ-8 scores was significantly correlated with changes in NMSS scores.
Reddy et al compared the effect of LCIG on NMS in 17 advanced PD subjects treated 
with LCIG versus 9 matched PD controls not treated with LCIG over 6 months.
31  There 
were no significant changes in NMS as measured by the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) in the control group while the LCIG treated subjects demonstrated a significant improvement in NMSS total score ( P= 0.004) and the subdomains of sleep, 
gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual function.  The differences in change from baseline to follow-up between the Duodopa treated group and the control gr oup was statist ically 
significant for NMSS total score ( P= < 0.027) and for the subdomains of cardiovascular, 
sleep, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous.
Pusuiainen et al examined the effects  of LCIG on NMS in 9 PD subjects over 
two months.
32  Statistically significant improvement was seen in the NMSS total score 
(52% decrease, P= 0.008) and the subdomains of sleep/fatigue, gastrointestinal, and 
miscellaneous.A retrospective study that evaluated change from baseline in NMS using the NMSS 
instrument in 14 subjects with advanced PD treated with LCIG for an average of 25 months also demonstrated 14% improvement in the NMSS total score but the results did not reach statistical significance.
30  Although some of the individual domains showed 
improvement with LCIG, none reached statisti cal significance.  Psychiatric symptoms 
were significantly improved as revealed by a significant reduction in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I, Neurops ychiatric Inventory, a nd Questionnaire for 
Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease.  Additionally, an improvement

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
29
in sleep quality and diurnal somnolence was d emonstrated by the significant reduction of 
the PDSS.
When specifically evaluating the effect of LCIG on sleep in Parkinson's disease patients, 
no previous studies have compared LCIG to optimized medical therapy using the PDSS-2 as an endpoint.  Results from a prospective baseline control study conducted by Zibetti et al showed that the improvement in PDSS-2 total score was 13.1 (34% improvement) after an average of 3.5 months of LCIG treatment.
33
Until recently, NMS were thought to be resistant to dopaminergic therapy.  However, 
dopaminergic agents have now been shown to improve depression, REM behavioral sleep disorder, nocturia, and erectile dysfunction.
34  Dopaminergic agents can also improve 
"Off"-related NMS, such as pain, anxiety,  flushing, and depression.  Although it is 
becoming more recognized that dopaminergic agents can treat certain NMS, their supposed effectiveness was limited by the lack of scales to assess NMS, and quantify their impact on a patient's overall wellbeing.  Motor and non-motor symptoms  closely correlate 
with fluctuating plasma concentrations of levodopa and the corresponding pulsat ile 
concentration of dopamine in the striatum.
35-37  Plasma levels of orally administered 
levodopa fluctuate significantly due to its short half-life and the variability in gastric emptying.
38,39  Treatments that offer continuous levodopa administration result in less 
variability in levodopa plasma concentration and are believed to provide more continuous dopaminergic stimulation, and, therefore, reduce the frequency and severity of motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and non-motor symptoms.
40,41  Therefore, reducing the amount of 
"Off" time should improve those fluctuating NMS.  Additionally, since LCIG is initiated 
and often maintained as monotherapy, tapering off of other anti-PD medications may also lead to improvement in certain non-motor sy mptoms.  Continuous delivery of levodopa, 
which has the potential to offer continuous dopaminergic stimulation has potential to lead 
to neuroplastic changes that may also improve those non-fluctuating NMS. 
An understanding of LCIG effects on NMS can provide important information for 
physicians, patients and caregivers when assessing the benefits of advanced treatment.

3.1 Differences Statement
In previous Phase 3 LCIG studies as part of the US registration package which studied 
adult subjects with advanced levodopa-respons ive PD with persistent motor-fluctuations 
despite optimized treatment with available PD medications, the primary efficacy endpoint was change in motor fluctuations (specifically "Off" time).  Study M12-920, an ongoing Phase 3b open-label single arm, baseline-cont rolled study, with an out-patient PEG-J 
procedure, evaluated the effect of LCIG on non-motor symptoms in advanced PD in 36 subjects using the NMSS; however effect of LCIG on sleep using the PDSS-2 is not being evaluated.  This study will be the largest, randomized, parallel group study evaluating the effect of LCIG on NMS compared to optimized medical therapy asassessed by both the NMSS and PDSS-2.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Benefits
LCIG provides continuous rather than intermittent stimulation of the dopaminergic 
receptors in the brain by maintaining constant plasma concentrations of levodopa.  The gel formulation, typically applied in a monotherapy regimen, allows a greater flexibility in individualized dosing, thereby allowing the plas ma concentration to be within the narrow 
therapeutic window of these advanced PD patients.
Efficacy of LCIG on motor symptoms in subjects with advanced PD has been 
demonstrated in Phase 3 studies.  In the pivotal Phase 3 study (3.001/3.002), compared to LC-IR, LCIG significantly improved "Off" time (LS Mean difference = –1.91 hours) and 
"On" time without troublesome dyskinesia (LS Mean difference = 1.86 hours) at Week 12.  LCIG also demonstrated a sta tistically and clinically significant impact on 
subject's quality of life as assessed with the PDQ-39 summary index and the UPDRS Part II score.  Subjects with advanced Parkinson's disease who qualify for the study are expected to benefit through better control of the motor fluctuations that are not adequately controlled with PD medications.
17  Additionally, as described above, small studies have

31
demonstrated improvement in NMSS total score, NMSS subdomains and PDSS-2 with 
LCIG either versus optimized medical therapy or in open-label, single-group studies.  
Risks
Due to the long experience with the oral drug combination of levodopa and carbidopa for 
the treatment of PD, the risks that are associated with both active pharmaceut ical 
ingredients are well known.  These and additional information on risks are available in the Investigator's Brochure.
42
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) related to LCIG, a therapeutic system consisting of the drug, the devices, and the placement procedure for  the NJ or PEG-J tubing,  have been identified and form the basis of the European Union Risk Management Plan.
43  
AESIs for this study are defined in Section 6.1.1.3 and comprise the following:
Known Risks
●Gastrointestinal and Gastrointestinal Procedure Related Events
Potential Risks
●Polyneuropathy
●Weight Loss
In the previous Phase 3 clinical program, as observed in an integrated summary of safety, AEs were common and occurred in 93.9% of the 412 subjects in the Open-Label LCIG Analysis Set (Phase 3 Studies S187.3.003, S187.3.004, and S187.3.005).  The most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were complication of device insertion (33.3%), abdominal pain (28.2%), postoperative wound infection (23.5%), insomnia (23.3%), fall (23.1%), procedural pain (20.9%), excessive granulation tissue (20.6%), nausea (20.4%), constipation (20.4%), a nd incision site erythema (20.1%) 
(Table 1 ).  These AEs are commonly associated with underlying PD or are frequently 
observed following PEG-J placement.  Treatmen t emergent adverse events reported in

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter  26-week study comparing LCIG to OMT on 
NMS associated with advanced PD.  This study will be conducted at approximately 40 –
50 sites that specialize in mo vement disorders in approximately 10 countries.

Figure 2. Study Design Schematic
The study is designed to enroll an adequate number of subjects such that approximately 
88 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment group of OMT or LCIG in 
order to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without over-enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.
The study will consist of 3 sequential periods:  Screening, Treatment and Follow-Up.
5.1.1 Screening Period
The Screening Period visits will be the same for all subjects screened into the study.  The 
Screening Period will consist of three visits, Visit 1 (V1), Visit 2 ([V2] [optional]) and the Randomization Visit (V3) in which the subject will be assessed to determine eligibility.  A movement disorder specialist should perform a sc reening interview of the subject.  The 
duration of the Screening Period can be between 30 – 67 days to accommodate the 
required procedures, training and collectio n of diaries, and allow for stabilization of 

Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
36
anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.  A stable regimen is defined as no 
changes to the frequency of administration, dose of administration or total daily dose.  During the Screening Period, no st udy drug will be administered.
Visit 1 (V1)
Following informed consent, at V1, study eligibility will be assessed through a series of tests and scales.  V1 assessmen ts may be performed over a period of multiple days.  Refer 
to Table 3 of Section 5.3.1.1 for a detailed list of assessments and procedures.  
●Laboratory results should be available before V3 (or optional V2) to review for 
continued subject eligibility. 
●The UPDRS, Part III, will be completed during the subject's "Off" and best 
"On" times.  The practically defined "Off" time UPDRS will be done in the 
morning prior to the subject taking their  first daily dose of anti-PD medication.  
At a minimum a subject should be 8 hours without anti-PD medication before 
the UPDRS is completed.  The best "On" time rating will usually be done 1 to 
2 hours post any morning dose of study drug or anti-PD medications but prior 
to lunch.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day throughout the trial.  The "Off" time UPDRS will only be done during 
Screening; all other UPDRS assessments will be done during "On" time.
●The PI should discuss with the subject the placement of an NJ and/or PEG-J and a decision made at this time if they will do the optional NJ period or go 
directly to PEG-J should they be randomized to the LCIG treatment group.  This is to allow for scheduling of the NJ and/or PEG-J at this time.
●The time period between V1 and optional V2 should not exceed 60 days.
●Additionally, a GI exam to determin e suitability for PEG-J placement and a 
dermatologic evaluation for the presence of melanoma must be performed 
prior to V3 (or optional V2).
●All anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS must be stable for at 
least 30 days prior to V3.

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
37
Optional Visit 2 (V2)
Visit 2 will occur between 30 to 60 days after V1.  Visit 2 is optional and is based on the 
Investigator's discretion of individual subject need during stabilization of anti-PD 
medications and medications to treat NMS.  Subjects must be on stable anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS for at least 30 days before V2.  However, the time period between V1 and V2 must not exceed 60 days.  If, in the PIs opinion, it is medically necessary for the time frame between V1 and V2 to exceed 60 days, the PI should discuss this with the medical monitor.
All anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS must remain stable between V2 
and V3.
Visit 3 (V3)
Visit 3 will be the randomization visit.  The timeframe from V2 to the V3 will be
3 – 7 days. 
Only those subjects who meet the following randomization criterion will be randomized at 
the end of V3 to one of the treatment groups:
●Subject must have a minimum PDSS-2 total score of 18 at Baseline 
assessment .
In addition at V3 the following should occur:
●Concomitant Medication (including anti- PD medications); Subjects' anti-PD 
medications must be stable during the 3 – 7 days between V2 and V3.
●Anti-PD Medication History:  NMS Medication History:  medications used to 
treat individual non-motor symptoms (e.g., Insomnia, depression, anxiety).  Subjects' medications to treat NMS must be stable during the 3 – 7 days 
between V2 and V3.
●Training on the LCIG System and Pu mp will be initiated only for subjects 
randomized for LCIG and their caregivers, as applicable.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
38
●UPDRS, Parts I – V will be completed during the subject's "On" time.
5.1.2 The Treatment Period
5.1.2.1 OMT Group
Those subjects randomized to OMT at the end of V3 will continue on their current 
anti-PD medication regimen for the duration of the study.  The PI will provide the prescription for continued OMT.  PIs should make any effort to keep all anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS stable for the duration of the study.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified" or if absolutely indicated for safety reasons.  The day after V3 will be consider ed Day 1 of the treatment period for the OMT 
group.  Subjects in the OMT Group will not have a Visit 4, while visits 5 through 8 will take place at the end of Weeks 2 through 26 respectively.  Data from all visits will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table 3 .
5.1.2.2 LCIG Treatment Group
Tapering of Anti-PD Medications Other Than Levodopa
All subjects randomized to the LCIG group should have all anti-PD medications, with the 
exception of levodopa formulations, tapered off within 14 days after randomization according to the prescribing information and the discretion of the Investigator.  All other antiparkinsonian medication, including dopamine-agonists, apomorphine, COMT-inhibitors, selective MAO-B inhibitors, amantadine, etc., must be discontinued prior to LCIG initiation.  A ll anti-PD medicat ions, other than subcutaneous continuous 
delivery of apomorphine and levodopa formul ations as outlined in the allowable 
medications section can be restarted 28 days after LCIG initiation if medically necessary for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms.
NJ and/or PEG-J Placement
LCIG is intended for continuous intestinal ad ministration.  A temporary NJ tube may be 
used initially with the infusion pump to deter mine if the subject responds favorably to this 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
39
method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a permanent 
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with a jejunal (PEG-J) tube is started.  Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of the permanent PEG-J tube and perform titration without the NJ phase if deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 
Visit 4 (V4), Day 1 Optional Nasojejunal (NJ) Phase and/or PEG-J Placement
Subjects will have the NJ and/or PEG-J tube placement procedure performed on Study Day 1 by a gastroenterologist proceduralist or qualified radiologist (or delegated experienced nurse for NJ).  V4 assessments must be performed on the same day that the NJ and/or PEG-J tube is placed with the followi ng exception:  if NJ is used and placed via 
the passive method, the radiological check will be completed when the tube is expected to be located in the correct position (which may take around 48 hours and local pract ice 
procedures should be followed).  The NJ and/or PEG-J tube will be placed such that the end of the tubing is just beyond the ligament of Treitz.  Once there is confirmation of tube placement all necessary procedures will be followed to attach the pump, with the LCIG cassette, to the NJ and/or PEG-J tube to initiate treatment with LCIG.  The gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon will check the subject's stoma site within 24 hours of the PEG-J placement. 
The optional NJ Period will end with the decis ion to either continue with treatment and 
the placement of a permanent jejunal extension tube by PEG-J placement procedure or to 
discontinue further treatment.  
Certain procedures will be repeated prior to PEG-J placement for those who underwent 
the NJ period as outlined in the table of  activities ( Table 3 ).  The NJ tube will be removed 
at the time of the PEG-J procedure, or upon discontinuation of treatment with LCIG.  If the subject does not enter the PEG-J placement procedure phase of the study, all End-of-Study Treatment assessments, define d for Visit 9, Week 27, should be completed.

LCIG Initiation and Titration
Following optional NJ and/or PEG-J placement on Study Day 1 and, at the discretion of 
the Investigator, the subject may begin initiation and titration of LCIG infusion on Study 
Day 1 once tube placement is confirmed.  A ll other oral anti-PD medications must be 
stopped prior to LCIG initiation.  The dose of LCIG should be adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response for the individual subject.  Optimal clinical response, or optimization, is defined as maximizing the functional "On" time during the day and minimizing the number of "Off" episodes (bradykinesia) and the time the subject is "Off."  In addition, optimization minimizes "On" time wi th troublesome dyskinesia.  This 
determination is made by the Investigator.  The dosage procedures for LCIG are described in Section 5.5.1 Treatments Administered.  
While the subject is in the hospital, the study staff may use the Dose Titration Diary as a tool to achieve dose optimization.  In the event it is used it should be completed hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged. 
Oral levodopa medication may only be used as a supplement during the night following 
discontinuation of the LCIG infusion.  During the day it should be used ONLY as rescue 
medication in case of acute deterioration, presumably caused by failure of the tubes and/or 
the pump or the onset of an acute illness.
It may take several days to optimize LCIG treatment.  In some subjects, optimization may 
take longer and subjects may remain hospitalized at the discretion of the Investigator.  For those subjects with an NJ placement they may or may not continue the NJ Period at home until the PEG-J is inserted.
During the initial titration phase, extra doses may be administered by the Investigator or 
subject every hour.  Pump programming should onl y be done by trained site personnel 
and all dose changes must be approved by  the Investigator.  After the nightly 
discontinuation of LCIG drug administration, levodopa-DDI (DOPA decarboxylase

EudraCT 2014-004865-26
41
inhibitor) tablets may be taken up to 2 hours (for oral LC-IR) or 4 hours (for oral LC-CR) 
prior to the administration of the next morning dose of LCIG and should not be counted as rescue.  While the subject is in the hospital, the study staff may use the Dose Titration 
Diary as a tool to achieve dose optimization.  In the event it is used it should be completed 
hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged.  All adjustments can be recorded on the Dose Titration Diary allowing the Investigator to appropriately  adjust, if needed, the following day's 
morning dose, continuous infusion rate and extra dose until the subject is optimized.  It is up to the discretion of the Investigator to determine how many titration days are necessary to obtain optimal clinical response.  Once optimized, dose adjustments to LCIG can be made up to Day 28.  After Day 28 the dose should remain stable for the duration of the study unless adjustments are absolutely needed for safety reasons.
During the titration, the subject (and if a pplicable, their care-partner) will receive 
refresher training on stoma care, tube care and the use of the pump, as well as all the 
necessary procedures for device maintenance and documentation of LCIG cassette use.
Titration can be done as an inpatient or outpatient.  In the event the subject is no longer 
hospitalized but still being titrated to LCIG the subject will visit the site or clinic as needed for treatment optimization.  These visits will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table 3 .
The gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon will check the subject's stoma site anyt ime 
from Day 2 to 7 after the PEG-J procedure.
Treatment:  Visit 5 (Week 2) Initial Post-PEG-J Evaluation Through Visit 8 
(Week 26)
Visit 5 will be conducted at Week 2, 14 days post NJ and/or PEG-J insertion.  If subjects 
are hospitalized for the full 14 days of the NJ and/or PEG-J Placement Procedure Period this visit will take place when the subject is st ill in the hospital.  If sub jects have been 
discharged prior to V5, it will be conducted as a site visit.  Study activities at V5 (Week 2) must be completed even if the subject titration is still occurring.  Visits 6, 7 and 8 at the 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
42
end of Weeks 6, 12 and 26 respectively will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the 
assessments completed as in Table 3 .
Allowed anti-PD medications (as indicated in Section 5.2.3.2 ) may be restarted or 
initiated if indicated by the condition of th e subject, but not within 28 days after PEG 
placement procedure.  
Drug Dispensing Visits
Subjects and/or caregivers must come into the clinic or pharmacy between V7 (Week 12) 
and V8 (Week 26) for clinical LCIG return and supply visits so that there is no risk ofmedication expiring.  The drug dispensing visits will occur at Weeks 17 and 22 (± 7 days).  Other assessments may be completed during these visits if required.
5.1.3 Study Follow-Up
Follow-Up Visit (V9) (LCIG Subjects not Continuing on Commercial Product)
For subjects who are not continuing on LCIG (through commercial sources in countries 
where LCIG is approved and marketed), the PEG-J tube will be removed following the End of Study activities.  A follow-up clinic visit will occur approximately one week later.
Commercial Transition Visits (LCIG Subjects Continuing on Commercial Product)
Study subjects in the LCIG group who complete participation in the study and for whom 
continuation of treatment with LCIG is judged appropriate by the Investigator will continue to receive LCIG until transition to commercial product is coordinated with the Sponsor's commercial affiliate.
Additional visits every 12 weeks from Week 26 will be schedule to monitor subject safety 
and allow for drug resupply until the subject transfer to commercial LCIG.  Refer to 
Table 3 of Section 5.3.1.1 for list of assessments.  Drug resupply visits will also occur at 
6 week intervals between the every 12 week safety assessments.

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
43
Upon transfer of subjects to commercial LCIG the monitoring of such therapy will be the 
responsibility of the subject's personal physician.  All necessary support will be provided 
by the Sponsor's local representative.  Follow-up care in these circumstances will be based on the judgment of the subject's personal physician and no formal collection of data will be conducted except for regular ADR-reporting in accordance with local instructions.
OMT Subjects
Study subjects in the OMT group who complete participation in the study are eligible to 
transition to commercial LCIG after end of study procedures if judged appropriate by their personal physician.  This transition is not study related.

5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
The AbbVie TA MD should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant 
or prior therapy(ies).
5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy (Prior to Randomization)
All medications taken by the subject during the study from 30 days prior to signing the 
Informed Consent Form are to be recorded in the eCRF.
5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
All changes to concomitant medications must be carefully documented on the 
Concomitant Medication eCRF form.
Allowable Medications
Anti-Parkinsonian Medications
The following classes of anti-Parkinsonian medications will be allowed during the study:
1. Levodopa formulations
●For the OMT group, all levodopa formulations are allowed
●For the LCIG group:
○levodopa formulations can only be used at nighttime (the 8 hours when the 
pump is not in use) or as rescue medication
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26

●long-acting levodopa formulations can only be used at nighttime (at 
least 4 hours prior the next day's morning dose)
●short-acting levodopa formulations with the exception of formulations containing entacapone can only be used at nighttime (at least 2 hours 
prior to the next day's morning dose) or as rescue medication
2. Dopamine agonists (not including apomorphine continuous infusion or PRN 
injection)
3. MAO-B inhibitors
4. Anti-cholinergics5. Amantadine
General Requirements
Screening to Visit 3:   All anti-Parkinson's disease medications must be stable* for at least 
30 days prior to V3 baseline assessments (NMSS and PDSS-2).
* A stable regimen is defined as no changes to the frequency of administration, dose of 
administration or total daily dose.
Randomization to End of Treatment Period:
●OMT Group:   all anti-PD medications should remain stable from 
randomization to the Week 26 visit and study assessments. Changes to the 
OMT arm can be made "if medically justified."
●LCIG Group:   all anti-PD medications except levodopa formulations must be 
tapered off after randomization and prior to LCIG initiation via NJ or PEG-J 
(in those going directly to PEG-J). Time of inverse titration should be done following the prescribing information and the Investigator's discretion, but 
should not exceed 14 days after randomization.  For those randomized to 
LCIG, all allowable anti-PD medications listed above can be restarted 28 days after LCIG initiation if medically necessary for the treatment of Parkinsonian 
symptoms.

All medication taken by the subject during the study (from signing the Informed Consent 
form through post-st udy follow- up) is to be recorded on the Concomitant Medication 
eCRF, except for study drug for subjects randomized to LCIG.  All changes to concomitant medications, this includes all medications taken by subjects randomized to OMT, must be carefully documented on the Concomitant Medication eCRF form.
Medications to Treat Non-Motor Symptoms (OMT and LCIG Groups)
Medications used for the treatment of non-motor symptoms (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, 
sleep disorders, fatigue, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, attention, sialorrhea, dysphagia, constipation, sexual dysfunction, pain, appetite, sweating) are allowed during the study except those for cognition or that have pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics interactions with levodopa as listed in Table 2 .  Medications have to be taken on a regular 
basis and will not be allowed if they are taken on an as needed basis with the exception of medication to treat pain post PEG-J procedure .  All medications for the treatment of 
non-motor symptoms must be stable for at least 30 days between V1 and V2 and through the Randomization assessments (N MSS and PDSS-2) at the Randomization visit (V3).  
These medications must then also remain stable for the duration of the study.  However, if absolutely necessary for a significant me dical need related to patient safety, the 
Investigator can make modifications to these medications or add additional medications after discussion with the medical monitor.  This will be considered a protocol deviation but the subject will not be discontinued from  the study.  Caffeine is allowed during the 
screening period and the duration of the study, but the same pattern of consumption should be maintained to avoid potential confounds of caffeine.
Required Concomitant Medication, Antibiotics
The use of prophylactic antibiotics is required prior to PEG-J procedure.  At minimum, a 
single dose of a 1stor 3rdgeneration cephalosporin (or an antibiotic with similar coverage) 
must be administered approximately 30 minutes prior to the PEG-J procedure.

5.2.3.3 Rescue Therapy (LCIG Group Only)
After NJ and/or PEG-J placement, subjects randomized to LCIG should fill a prescription 
provided by the Investigator for oral LC-IR tablets in case oral rescue therapy is needed.  
Once LCIG treatment has been initiated, the prescribed oral LC-IR rescue tablets should only be used during scheduled LCIG use (16-hour infusion) in case of serious medical needs such as the rapid deterioration of motor symptoms that does not respond to an extra dose of LCIG.  The subject should be instructed to record all oral levodopa tablets on the Subject Dosing Diary on the assigned days.
5.2.3.4 Post Infusion Night Time Therapy (LCIG Group Only)
Those subjects randomized to the LCIG group will be permitted to self-administer their 
typical night-time regimen of oral LC-IR or levodopa-carbidopa continuous-release (LC-CR) following the daily discontinuation of the 16-hour infusion, only if they were 
taking this during the 30 day stable medication period during screening and the dose must remain unchanged.  (The Investigator will provide a prescription for the doses of oral LC-IR or LC-CR that the subject takes on a regular nightly basis.)  After the nightly discontinuation of LCIG drug administration, levodopa-DDI tablets may be taken up to two hours (for oral LC-IR) or 4 hours (for oral LC-CR) prior to the administration of the next morning dose of LCIG and should not be counted as rescue.  The subject should record all oral levodopa-carbidopa tablets on the Subject Dosing Diary on the assigned days.
Those subjects randomized to the OMT group will remain on their normal, stable 
nighttime regimen if applicable.
5.2.3.5 Contraception Recommendations
If female, subject must be either postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile (refer 
to inclusion criteria for definitions of both) OR a Woman of Childbearing Potential, practicing at least one of the following meth ods of birth control, on Study Day 1 (or 
earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

5.3 Efficacy and Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
After a subject has signed the Informed Consent, the study activities described in Table 3
will be completed.  Subject visit days should ideally match the target clinic visit days.  
Every attempt should be made to bring the subject back on the target visit day.  A ± 3 day 
visit window will be allowed as necessary be ginning with the Week 2 visit and a ± 7 day 
visit window will be allowed as necessary beginning with the Week 6 visit.  All attempts should be made to return the subject to the planned visit schedule (e.g., if the subject is two days late for a Study Visit, the scheduling of the next visit date should be based on the original planned visit date).  All scheduled  visits are calculated based on Study Day 1 
(NJ and/ or PEG-J Placement Day for subjects randomized to LCIG and day after randomization for sub jects randomized to OMT).

V = Visit; D = Day; FU = Follow-Up; Wk = Week
a. Applicable only to LCIG subjects who prematurely discontinue LCIG treatment, or complete LCIG study treatment but will not tr ansition to commercial LCIG.  
b. Applicable only to LCIG subjects who complete LCIG study treatment and will transition to commercial LCIG.  Subjects will ret urn every 6 weeks to return used LCIG 
cassettes and be dispensed cassettes.  Safety assessments will be completed every 12 weeks until subjects' transition to commercial LCIG.
c. Visit 2 is optional and is based on the Investigator's discretion of individual subject need during stabilization of anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS.
d. Visit 4 for LCIG Treatment (LCIGT) group only.
e. Study-related assessments, procedures or activities may not occur prior to subject completing signed informed consent process .  
f. Update Medical/Neurological/PD History with any findings from Labs, Dermatologists, etc.
g. NMS Medication History is to be collected at V1.  These include but are not limited to medications used for the treatment of the 9 NMS domains of experience of 
cardiovascular/falls, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, GI tract, urinary, se xual function, and miscellaneous (pain, 
taste/smell, weight change, excessive sweating) should be collected.
h. At Screening Visit 1 and 2 and Randomization Visit 3 a full physical examination will be performed.  Symptom-driven physical examinations will be performed at subsequent 
visits.  On or prior to Visit 2, the Investigator and GI/surgeon or interventional radiologist, or their designated qualified p ersonnel will thoroughly evaluate the subject's risk of 
undergoing PEG-J procedure.  The dermatological exam will be performed prior to Visit 2.  If a suspicious lesion is present, a biopsy should be obtained for proper diagnosis 
and confirmation that lesion does not meet exclusion criteria.
i. For subjects randomized to LCIG, a temporary NJ tube may be used to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment with a PEG-J i s started. The NJ test phase should not last 
longer than 7 days.  Following the NJ test phase, a PEG-J will be performed by a gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon.  Total time to titration via NJ and PEG-J should 
not exceed 14 days.  Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of PEG-J if deemed appropriate by investigator.  The number of days to titrate will vary for 
each subject.
j. LCIG group only.  Radiological check of NJ and PEG-J to determine correct location should occur prior to LCIG infusion initia tion and prior to restart of LCIG post PEG-J 
placement.  Placement can be done at any time during treatment if indicated for worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms not responsi ve to extra doses.
k. PEG-J site, stoma check will be done within 24 hours of PEG-J placement and anytime from Day 2 to 7 post PEG.
l. On the day of the first LCIG infusion, orthostatic vital signs should be obtained at 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours post initial LCIG start.  An attempt should be made to obtain all other 
vital signs at a consistent time of day.  Vital signs should be repeated when PEG-J inserted.
m. Height will be measured at Visit 1 only.

Table 3. Study Activities (Continued)
n. PT/PTT will be performed at Screening Visits 1 and 3. In the event the PT/PTT result at V3 is abnormal the subject should not  proceed with the NJ and/or PEG-J placement 
and should contact the medical monitor.
o. Special labs to detect vitamin deficiencies, listed in Table 4 , will be performed at the times indicated in Table 3 .  If at any time during the study a subject displays symptoms 
of polyneuropathy, the Investigator must perform this lab panel and any other assessment that the Investigator feels is appropr iate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy 
symptoms.  Thyroid function tests will be done at Screening Visit 1 only.
p. Pregnancy Testing WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at Screening, and a negative urine pregnancy test at Study Day 1.  Monthly pregnancy testing 
should be performed during treatment, including at the last dose and until 5 × the half-life of the AbbVie product.
q. The "Baseline/Screening" C-SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered to the subject.  At each subsequent visit, th e "Since Last Visit" C-SSRS scale should be 
administered.
r. At V1, the UPDRS Part III is conducted in the on/off state, all other times in the on state.  During Visit 1 the UPDRS Part I II will be done during practically defined "Off" 
time and best "On" time.  The practically defined "Off" time UPDRS will be done in the morning prior to the subject taking thei r first daily dose of anti-PD medication.  At a 
minimum a subject should be 8 hours without anti-PD medication before the UPDRS is completed.  The best "On" time rating should  be done approximately 1 to 2 hours post 
any morning dose of study drug or PD medications but prior to lunch.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of  day throughout the trial.  The "Off" time 
UPDRS will only be done during Screening; at all other times a complete UPDRS (Parts I through V) will be done during "On" time.
s. While the subject is in the hospital, the study staff may use the Dose Titration Diary as a tool to achieve dose optimization .  In the event it is used it should be completed 
hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged.  All adjus tments can be recorded on the Dose Titration 
Diary allowing the Investigator to appropriately adjust, if needed, the following day's morning dose, continuous infusion rate and extra dose until the subject is optimized.
t. PEG-J removal will be complete 1 week before follow up visit.
u. At Week 27 follow up visit LCIG cassettes return only.
Note: All applicable clinical, safety, health outcome and cognition assessments will be administered only by individuals qualified by the Sponsor.

5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Table 3 are discussed in this section, with the exception 
of the collection of adverse event information and product comp laints (S ection 6.0).
Due to the length of assessments on Visit 1, a ssessments may be perf ormed over 2 days.  
Informed Consent
Voluntary written informed consent must be obtained from each subject (and if 
appropriate, their caregiver) prior to performing any study-related procedures.  Consenting will be performed according to local regulations.
Subject Medical and Neurological History
A complete medical history, including alcohol, drug, tobacco and nicotine-containing 
product use histories will be taken at the time indicated in Table 3 .  Additionally, chronic 
disorders (e.g., diabetes and hay fever) that began prior to Screening and are still present at Screening should be recorded on the Me dical History Form.  The Medical History 
obtained at V1 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  All psychiatric, neurological, behavioral and/or cognitive dia gnosis should be reported.  Updates should 
be made to the Medical/Neurological/PD History with any findings from Labs, Dermatologists, etc.
Subject Parkinson's Disease and NMS Treatment History
In order to qualify for enrollment in the study, the subject should provide the Investigator 
with a comprehensive history of their past anti-PD and NMS drug treatments.  This should be done according to the patient and/or caregiver recollection as well as available history in a subject's chart.  
NMS Medication History is to be collected at V1.  These include but are not limited to 
medications used for the treatment of the 9 NMS domains of:  experience of cardiovascular/falls, sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
63
attention/memory, GI tract, urinary, sexual func tion, and miscellaneous (pain, taste/smell, 
weight change excessive sweating). 
A careful review of the subject's PD history, previous and current PD treatments should
be performed by the Investigator (e.g., dosages, frequency of administration, duration of treatment, assessment and evaluation of the subject's response to those previous PD treatments) to determine if the subject is eligible for study participation.  
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
The MMSE44is a brief, 30-point questionnaire, administered by a trained rater, which 
provides a quantitative measure of cognitive mental status in adults and is widely used to 
screen for cognitive impairment and to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a 
given point in time, to follow the course of cognitive changes in a patient over time, and 
to document response to treatment.  In this study, MMSE will be used to screen for cognitive impairment.  The subject must have a score ≥ 24 at Screening Visit 1 to be 
eligible for study participation.  Lower scores indicate greater impairment.  The MMSE will be administered at Visit 1 as indicated in Table 3 .
Sleep Attack Assessment
To prospectively monitor for possible development of sleep attacks, the subject will be evaluated for sleep attacks at the times indicated in Table 3 .  The subject will be asked the 
following Sleep Attack Assessment questions:
Since your last visit or last time this question was asked, have you experienced any events 
in which you fell asleep suddenly or unexpectedly, including while engaged in some 
activity (e .g., eating/drinking, speak ing, or driving) or at rest, without any previous 
warning of sleepiness (e.g., feeling tired)?
●If yes, what specif ically happened?
●How many times did you experience such events?
●What were you doing at the time of each event?
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
64
●Prior to each event did you experience any sleepiness or drowsiness?  If yes, 
please explain/clarify.
●How long did each event last?
●Did you suffer any "bad" outcome/problem from each falling asleep event?
During the Screening Period, subjects should be asked to answer these questions based on 
their experiences during the three months prior to Screening Visit 1.  During the Screening Period, if the subject is currently or has been recently experiencing sleep attacks, they will be excluded from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care if the Investigator feels these are clinically significant.  The assessment of Sleep Attacks completed at the Screening Visit 1 will serve as baseline for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
At Screening V1, V2 and Random ization V3 a full physical examination will be 
performed.  Symptom-driven physical examinations will be performed at subsequent 
visits.
Neurological Examination
A Neurological Examination focusing on sympto ms and signs of polyneuropathy (light 
touch and pinprick sensation, vibratory sensation), deep tendon reflexes, and strength 
assessments will be performed at the times indicated in Table 3 .  The Neurological 
Examination should be b ilateral and be done during the subject's "On" time.
Any abnormalities or symptoms identified at Vi sits 1, 2 and 3 will not be recorded as 
adverse events but will be recorded in Medical History eCRF.  Any new abnormalities or symptoms or symptoms that change in severity or frequency following randomization for the OMT group and the first dose of IP for the LCIG group will be recorded as adverse events.
The Neurological Examination will assess:

●Cranial nerves – assessment of cranial nerves II – XII
●Motor system – assessment of tone, strength and abnormal movements
●Sensory system – including light touch, pinprick, joint position and vibratory 
sense
●Reflexes – assessment of deep tendon reflexes and plantar responses (Babinski sign)
●Coordination – assessment of upper and lower extremities
●Gait – assessment of base and tandem gait
The Neurological Examination performed at Vi sit 1, will serve as baseline for clinical 
assessment.
Dermatological Assessment
A comprehensive assessment by an experienced dermatologist for the presence of any 
suspicious skin lesions and subsequent evaluation for melanoma will be performed prior to V2 and at Week 26/Premature Discontinuati on.  If a suspicious lesion is present, a 
biopsy should be obtained for proper diagnosis a nd confirmation that lesion does not meet 
exclusion criteria.
Positive screens will be exclusionary.
GI Examination
On or prior to V2, the Investigator and GI/surgeon will thoroughly evaluate the subject's 
risk of undergoing PEG-J procedure.
NJ and/or PEG-J Placement (LCIG Group Only)
For subjects randomized to LCIG, a temporary NJ tube may be used to optimize the dose 
of LCIG before treatment with a PEG-J is started.  The NJ test phase should not last longer than 7 days.  Following the NJ test phase, a PEG-J will be performed by a gastroenterologist proceduralist, or surgeon.  Total time to titration via NJ and PEG-J should not exceed 14 days.  Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
66
PEG-J if deemed appropriate by investigator.  Total time to titration via the NJ and PEG-J 
should not exceed 14 days.  The number of days to titrate will vary for each subject.
Radiological Check of Tube Placement (LCIG Group Only)
Radiological check of NJ and PEG-J to determine correct location should occur prior to 
LCIG infusion initiation and prior to restar t of LCIG post PEG-J placement.  It can also 
be done at any time during treatment if indicated for worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms or non-responsiveness to extra doses. 
PEG-Site (Stoma) Check (LCIG Group Only)
Following the PEG-J placement, site personnel will review proper after-care instructions 
and checking of the stoma instructions with the subject and/or care-partner as provided in 
the patient care materials /booklets.
After the initial PEG-J procedure, the PEG-J and stoma must be inspected by a gastroenterologist proceduralist/surgeon/qualified radiologist (preferably the physician who placed the PEG-J), or their designated qualified personnel 2 – 7 days post PEG-J procedure. 
Vital Signs/Weight
Body temperature, orthostatic vital signs and weight will be performed at the times 
indicated in Table 3 .  All systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements are to be measured orthostatically.  Orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate are to be measured while the subject is supine (after 3 to 5 minutes) and standing (after 2 minutes).  Study staff should make efforts to measure with the same arm and method including recording of arm and method in the subject's source documentation.
On the day of the first LCIG infusion, orthostatic vital signs should be obtained at 0, 1, 2 
and 3 hours post initial LCIG start.  An attempt should be made to obtain all other vital signs at a consistent time of day.  Vital signs should be repeated when PEG-J inserted.

67
Vital signs will include body weight  will be measured at the times indicated in Table 3 .  
The subject will wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing.
Height
Height will be measured only at V1; the subject will not wear shoes.12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A single 12-lead resting ECG will be obtained at study visits indicated in Table 3 .  An 
attempt should be made to obtain all ot her ECGs at a consistent time of day.
ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes.  The 
subject should be instructed to remain completely stationary during the recording, without talking, laughing, deep breathing or swallowing during the time of recording (10 seconds).
ECG Data Review 
Site personnel will transmit ECG data to an ECG central laboratory for central processing and reading by a qualified cardiologist (central reader) who will independently review each ECG.  The central reader will evaluate a single ECG lead (Lead II, with V5 or V2 [in that order] evaluated if Lead II cannot be evaluated).  Heart rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration and QT interval will be measured for each ECG with 3 to 5 beats.  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) will be determined using Fridericia's correction method (QTcF).
The central reader will also provide the interpretation of the ECG (i.e., "Normal" or 
"Abnormal").  The central ECG laboratory will send the ECG report to the site within 3 business days.  The Investigator (or physician designee) will review the central reader'sreport/assessment and document his/her review by signing and dating the central ECG laboratory report.  Only the central ECG laboratory's data will be collected into the 
database.  The Investigator should review and reconcile if necessary his/her interpretation of the ECG (normal/abnormal) with the central ECG laboratory in case of relevant divergent assessments and reconcile as he/she determines is appropriate.

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
68
The original ECG tracing and the central reader's interpretation, each with the 
Investigator's signature and date, will be retained in the subject's records at the study site as source documents.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  All clinical laboratory  samples will be collected as indicated in Table 3
(see Table 4 for list of laboratory evaluations).  The laboratory test results obtained at 
Visit 1 will serve as baseline for clinical assessment.  All clinical laboratory samples should be collected after the completion of all other assessments.  The Investigator must review the laboratory assessments (initialed and dated) after the receipt of results.
All laboratory abnormalities that occur during the study must be evaluated by the 
investigator to determine if they indicate a new disease process, an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition, or require further action to be taken and therefore may 
need to be reported as adverse events.  Accordingly, for any values outside of the reference range, the Investigator will indicate on the report if the result is Clinically Significant (CS) or Not Clinically Significant (NCS).  If a laboratory abnormality meets criteria for a Potentially Clinically Significant (PCS) laboratory value, as defined in 
Appendix D , the investigator must either report an associated adverse event or document 
in source the reason(s) the finding was not considered an adverse event.
The PT/PTT will be performed at Screening Visits 1 and 3. In the event the PT/PTT 
result at V3 is abnormal the subject shoul d not proceed with the NJ and/or PEG-J 
placement and should contact the medical monitor.
Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at Premature Discontinuation/End of St udy 
and was judged to be clinically significant will be followed according to accepted medical 
standards until resolution of the abnormality.

Table 4. Clinical Laboratory Tests (Continued)
f. Special labs to detect vitamin deficiencies, including:  Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 6, folic acid, MMA, and 
homocysteine levels will be performed at the times indicated in Table 3 .  Abnormal Vitamin B 12of questionable 
clinical significance (indeterminate or low normal results at screening) require MMA and homocysteine laboratory 
assessments be reviewed for determination of B 12deficiency prior to entry into the study.  If at any time during the 
study a subject displays symptoms of polyneuropathy, the Investigator must perform this lab panel and any other assessment that the Investigator feels is appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.
Urine Screens for Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol
A urine screen for drugs of abuse and medical marijuana and alcohol will be performed at 
V1 (Table 4 ).
The panel for drugs to be tested will minimally include the tests listed Table 4 .  The urine 
drug screen analysis at Visit 1 will be performed by the certified central laboratory chosen for the study, and will be used for screening purposes.
The alcohol lab values will be recorded, as required by VHP and will be use as 
quantitative value for assessment of risk factors (e.g., polyneuropathy, etc.).
Special Laboratory Tests
Special labs to detect vitamin deficiencies, including:  Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 6, folic acid, 
MMA, and homocysteine levels will be performed at the times indicated in Table 3 .  
Abnormal Vitamin B 12of questionable clinical significance (indeterminate or low normal 
results at screening) require MMA and homocysteine laboratory assessments be reviewed 
for determination of B 12deficiency prior to entry into the study.  Only labs at Visit 1 are 
exclusionary.  If at any time during th e study a subject displays symptoms of 
polyneuropathy, the Investigator must perform this lab panel and any other assessment that the Investigator feels is appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms.  Thyroid function tests will be done at Visit 1 only.
Pregnancy Testing
●WOCBP must have a negative serum/urine pregnancy test result at Screening, 
and a negative serum/urine pregnancy test at Study Day 1.  Monthly pregnancy 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
71
testing should be performed during treatment, including at the last dose and 
until 5 × the half-life of the AbbVie product.
●Subjects with borderline pregnancy tests at Screening must have a serum pregnancy test ≥ 3 days later to document continued lack of a positive result.
●Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently 
surgically sterile as defined above) at Screening do not require pregnancy testing at any time.
Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
The MoCA has been widely utilized in clinical settings to study cognition in PD.  It was 
originally developed as a screening tool to assess mild cognitive impairment in the general population.  The MoCA will be administered to assess for cognitive impairment and w ill 
be administered at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.  The scale assesses seven cognitive domains, including visuospatial/executive, naming, memory/delayed recall, attention, language, abstraction and orientation.  The maximum total score that can be obtained is 30 and a cut off score of 25/26 on MoCA has demonstrated a diagnostic sensitivity of 90% for individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.  Additionally the movement disorder society has recommended the use of this scale due to its acceptable clinimetric properties
45and diagnostic utility.
Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI)
To monitor for development of intense impulsive behavior, the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI)
46will be administered at the times indicated in Table 3 or 
whenever relevant symptoms emerge.  The entire interview is to be completed at V1.  If 
the subject's impulsivity during the Screening Period is judged to be clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator, they will be excluded from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care.  Any subject noted to have intense impulsive behavior during the study as assessed by  the MIDI, or via clinical interview, will be 
evaluated immediately by the Investigator.  The study designated physician should also be notified.  The MIDI will be administered as indicated in Table 3 .

Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)47is a systematically administered 
instrument designed to assess suicidal behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal 
events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include 
frequency, duration, controllability, reason for id eation, and deterrents.  The C-SSRS is 
considered a low-burden instrument as it takes less than 5 minutes to administer.
Any subject noted to have suicidal id eation with plan within the last year, either via 
answering "yes" to question 4 and/or question 5 to the suicidal ideation portion of the 
C-SSRS, or via clinical interview, will be evaluated immediately by the Investigator.  The study designated physician will also be notified.  In addition, if the subject expresses suicidal ideation at any time during the study, the Investigator should be immediately notified as well as the study designated physician. 
Under no circumstances should a subject who has positively endorsed or expressed 
suicidal ideation be left alone, be allowed to exit the site, or go home before a qualified 
medical professional has evaluated the subject's risk.
The "Already Enrolled Subjects" C-SSRS will be the first assessment scale administered 
to the subject.  At each subsequent visit, the "Since Last Visit" C-SSRS scale should be 
administered.
The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in Table 3 .
Non-Motor Symptom Scale (NMSS)
Non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease can result in substantial patient 
burden.  The NMSS is a comprehensive validated tool measuring a broad range of non-motor symptoms in PD patients.  The scale is aimed to be practical and quantitative, encompassing the whole range of non-motor symp toms experienced by people with PD.  
The NMSS measures the frequency and severity of these symptoms and is comprised of 30 questions that cover 9 domains of patient symptom experience (cardiovascular/falls, 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
73
sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, GI 
tract, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous [pain, taste/smell, weight change, 
excessive sweating]).48,49  The NMSS measures the burden of non-motor symptoms by 
weighting each symptom by its frequency and severity; thereby, providing a quantitative measure that captures infrequent but severe symptoms (e.g., hallucinations) and less serious but frequent symptoms (e.g., fatigue, constipation) and provides the overall global burden for patients.  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  Severity and frequency are rated using a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe; major source of distress or disturbance to subject) for severity and from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent [daily or all the time]) for frequency.  The total NMSS score ranges from 0 to 360.  A negative change from Baseline to end of Maintenance indicates an improvement in NMSS.  It is required that only trained and certified health professionals will administer the scale.  For this study the NMSS will be performed by an approved, trained, blinded, central rater, who should be  a specialist on movement disorders with 
previous experience using the NMSS scale in advanced PD patients.  To be qualified by the Sponsor and the rater vendor, all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.  The qualified rater will complete the NMSS at the times indicated in Table 3 .
PDSS-2
Although a number of scales exist in evaluating sleep disturbances, only 3 are endorsed and recommended by the Movement Disorders Society.
50  One such scale specific for 
Parkinson's disease is the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), which has been modified to the PDSS-2.  The purpose of the PDSS -2 scale is to characterize the various 
aspects of nocturnal sleep problems in PD patients.  The PDSS-2 instrument has been shown to be reliable, valid, precise, and a potentially treatment responsive tool for measuring nocturnal disabilities and sleep disorders in PD.
51  PDSS-2 consists of 
15 questions evaluating motor and NMS at night and upon wakening, as well as disturbed sleep grouped into 3 domains:  motor symptoms at night (5 items), PD symptoms at night 
(5 items), and disturbed sleep (5 items).  Specifically, questions assess overall sleep

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
74
quality, insomnia, sleep fragmentation, RLS and PLMS, RBD, hallucinations, nocturia, 
nocturnal immob ility, pa in and cramps, morning akinesia, cramps and tremor, and sleep 
apnea.  The PDSS-2 was developed from the PDSS based upon the need for a treatment-measuring tool containing PD-specif ic sleep disorders.  The instrument was 
extended to address specific sleep disturbances such as RLS, akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea.  Daytime sleepiness was removed from the PDSS-2, as it is a more complex PD symptom.  To increase ease of use, the visual analogue scale of the PDSS was transformed into a frequency measure in the PDSS-2.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-ty pe scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very 
often]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.  The recall period is for the past week.  For this study the PDSS-2 will be performed by an approved, trained, blinded central rater, who should be specialist on movement disorders with previous experience using the NMSS scale in advanced PD patients.  To be qualified by the Sponsor and the rater vendor, all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.  The qualified rater will complete the PDSS-2 at the times indicated in Table 3 .
The PDSS-2 will be completed  at the times indicated in Table 3 . 
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)52is an Investigator-used rating 
tool to follow the longitudinal course of Parki nson's disease.  Every effort should be made 
by the Investigative sites to ensure that each subject is rated by the same rater throughout the subject's participation in the study.  The UPDRS assessment will be performed by an approved, trained rater.  To be qualified by the Sponsor and the rater vendor, all raters must have participated in the Rater Training and have a current valid Rater Certificate.
The UPDRS is made up of the following sections:
●Part I – Mentation, Behavior, and Mood
●Part II – Activities of Daily Living
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
75
●Part III – Motor Examination
●Part IV – Complications of Therapy (including dyskinesias)
●Part V – Modified Hoehn and Yahr Staging
Some sections require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.  UPDRS total score 
ranges from 0 to 176, with 176 representing the worst (total) disability, and 0 no 
disability.  Additionally, Questions 32, 33, and 34 of the UPDRS will be totaled to evaluate dyskinesias.
During Visit 1 the UPDRS Part III will be done during practically defined "Off" time and 
best "On" time.  The practically defined "Off" time UPDRS will be done in the morning prior to the subject taking their first daily dose of anti-PD medication.  The best "On" time rating should be done approximately 1 to 2 hours post any morning dose of study drug or PD medications but prior to lunch.  If possible, the UPDRS should be done at the same time of day throughout the trial.  The "Off" time UPDRS will only be done during Screening; at all other times a complete UPDRS (Parts 1 through 5) will be done during "On" time.
The UPDRS will be obtained at the times indicated in Table 3 .
Health Outcome Measurements
Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)
The CGI-C is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement or Change.  The 
CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories:  very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, very much worse.  Proportion of responders who had at least "minimally improved" in CGI-C ratings will be assessed.
A qualified rater will administer the CGI-C to the subject at the times indicated in Table 3 .
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
76
Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The PGIC53is a 7-point response scale.  The subject will be asked by the Investigator or 
qualified designee to rate their change in status using the following 7-point scale:  
1 = Very much improved, 2 = Much improved, 3 = Minimally improved, 4 = No change, 5 = Minimally worse, 6 = Much worse, 7 = Very much worse.
The responses of "Very much improved," "Much improved" and "Minimally improved" 
on the PGIC will be used to define responders.  A qualified rater will administer the PGIC to the subject at the times indicated in Table 3 .
Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8)
The PDQ-854is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that 
are relevant to subjects with PD, and which may not be included in general health status 
questionnaires.  The PDQ-8 is a self-adminis tered questionnaire.  Each item is scored on 
the following 5-point scale:  0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).
Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease 
such as tremors and stiffness.  The results are presented as eight discrete domain scores and as a summary index.  The PDQ-8 domain scores and summary index range from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status.
A qualified rater will administer the PDQ-8 to the subject at the times indicated in 
Table 3 .
Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS)
The Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) is a new scale developed specifically to measure severity in anxiety in Parkinson's disease.  Lack of adequate validation data in the existing anxiety scales led to the development of the PAS.  The PAS is a brief scale designed to measure anxiety in PD, rated by patients or clinicians.  It contains three dimensions: persistent anxiety, episodic anxiety, and avoidance behavior.  It is an easy and brief to 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
77
administer, and has better clinimetric properties than existing anxiety rating scales.55  
Additionally a recent study has found that the PAS modified dimensions A and B provide 
valid and reliable measures of anxiety in PD that are comparable across raters.56  A 
qualified rater will administer the PAS to the subject at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15)
The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is a short, self-report reliable and valid screening instrument for depression in the elderly.  Th e response items are in a "Yes/No" format.  
The GDS was originally developed as a 30-item instrument but it was time-consuming and difficult for some patients to complete hence a 15-item version of the GDS was developed.  The shortened form consists of 15 items chosen from the Geriatric Depression Scale-Long Form (GDS-L).  These 15 items were chosen because of their high correlation with depressive symptoms in previous validation studies.
57  The GDS-15 has adequate 
discriminant validity for the diagnosis  of major and minor depressive disorder.58  Of the 
15 items, 10 indicate the presence of depression when answered positively while the other 5 are indicative of depression when answered negatively.  The GDS items focus on the psychological aspects of depression, thus avoiding symptom overlap with other disorders or aging in general.  The GDS-15 can be completed in approximately 5 to 7 minutes, making it ideal for patients who are easily fatigued or are limited in their ability to 
concentrate for longer periods of time.  A qualified rater will administer the GDS-15 to the subject to assess depression at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.
King's PD Pain Scale
The King's PD Pain Scale is an easy to administer novel clinical PD specific pain scale 
developed with a focus on sub classification of nociceptive and neuropathic pain.  It was specifically developed to assess pain among Parkinson's disease patients since no validated PD specific scales existed to characterize the various types of pain in PD.  The scale consists of seven domains of pain including musculoskeletal, chronic, fluctuation related, nocturnal, oro-facial, local limb pain/edema/swelling and radicular pain.  The scale measures the frequency and severity of these symptoms.  The clinimetric properties 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
78
of this instrument have been recently evaluated.59  A qualified rater will administer the 
King's PD Pain Scale to the subject to assess for PD specific pain at Visits 3, 6, 7 and 8.59
Titration Visits (LCIG Group Only)
Dose Titration Diary and LCIG Prescription Record (LCIG Group Only)
While the subject is in the hospital, the study staff may use the Dose Titration Diary as a 
tool to achieve dose optimization.  In the event it is used it should be completed hourly until the dose is optimized and then once AM and once PM it will be completed until the subject is discharged.  All adjustments can be recorded on the Dose Titration Diary allowing the Investigator to appropriately adjust, if needed, the following day's morningdose, continuous infusion rate and extra dose until the subject is optimized.
The subject's pump settings for the first infusion of LCIG, the pump settings at the 
conclusion of each calendar day are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
Following the initial titration period, the site should record the subject's pump settings 
(morning dose in mL, continuous infusion rate in mL/hr, and lock level) at the conclusion of each clinic visit on the study drug prescription record.
Subject Dosing Diary (LCIG and OMT Groups)
The subject dosing diary should be completed during the 72-hour period (3 days) prior to 
each clinic visit, as indicated in Table 3 .  Subjects should be reminded with a phone call 
prior to each visit to complete the Subject Dosing Diaries and to reinforce the importance 
of Subject Dosing Diary completion.
Subjects in the LCIG group will record the date and actual clock time of the LCIG pump 
start and pump stop as well as LCIG extra doses in the diary.  In addition, the subject will be instructed to record all oral levodopa-carbidopa taken on the Subject Dosing Diary days.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
79
Subjects in the OMT group will record all anti-parkinsonian medications taken on the 
Subject Dosing Diary days in the diary.
5.3.1.2 Rater Requirements
All applicable clinical, safety , health outcome and cogniti on assessments will be 
administered only by individuals qualified by th e Sponsor.  Every effort must be made by 
the Investigative sites to ensure that each subject is rated by the same rater throughout the 
subject's participation in the study.
Prior to administration of respective scale(s ), designated raters will be trained on and 
certified (if appropriate) in the use of all the scales  used in this study.  The objective of 
this certification/tr aining is to ensure uniformity across s ites in the administration and 
scoring of these assessments.The Sponsor, in conjunction with the approved rater training vendor, if applicable, will 
determine the minimum rater qualifications for each of the rating scales.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to participation in the training process.  The names and qualifications of all site personnel to be involved in rating scale administration will be submitted for approval upon site selection.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified through the training vendor.  Qualified raters will be trained and tested for competency and, if they meet established requirements, certified at the Investigator meeting.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be approved by the Sponsor via the training vendor if applicable.
Only those persons who have been trained as raters for this study may rate the subjects.  
Raters who cannot participate in the initial pre-study training or who become involved in the study at a later time will not be permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized training program designed by the rater training vendor if applicable, approved by AbbVie, and supervised by the Investigator or his/her designee.  Raters may be reassessed periodically throughout the study.

Specific Rater Training Requirements
The UPDRS will be administered only by individuals qualified by the Sponsor and the 
rater training vendor.  Prior to administration, designated raters (Investigator or an experienced and medically qualified study site designee [e.g., NP, PA, DO, MD, or PhD] assigned by the Investigator) will be certified in the use of the UPDRS.  The objective of this certification/tr aining is to ensure uniformity across s ites in the administration and 
scoring of the scale.
The Sponsor, in conjunction with the rater training vendor, will determine the minimum 
rater qualifications for the rating scale.  All raters must meet these qualifications prior to participation in the training process.  The names and qualifications of all site personnel to be involved in the UPDRS, rating scale administration will be submitted for approval upon site selection.  The qualifications of the raters will be verified through the rater training vendor.  Qualified raters will be trained and tested for competency and, if they meet established requirements, will be certified.  Individual exceptions to these requirements must be approved by the Sponsor via the rater training vendor.
Only those persons who have been trained and certified as raters for this study may rate 
the subjects.  Raters who cannot participate in the initial pre-study certification/training or who become involved in the study at a later time will not be permitted to perform study ratings until they have satisfactorily completed an individualized certification/training program designed by the rater training vendor, approved by the Sponsor, and supervised by the Investigator or his/her designee.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure the raters at his/her site are appropriately trained and certified to administer the selected rating scales.  Raters will be reassessed periodically throughout the study.
Blinded Rater Training Requirements
The NMSS and PDSS-2 will be administered by blinded central raters on the respective 
scales at Rando mization, V3.  This w ill serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  
They will also administer both scales at Weeks 6, 12, and 26.  
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
81
It is required that only trained and certified specialists on movement disorders with 
previous experience using the NMSS scale in advanced PD patients will serve as blinded central raters and administer NMSS and PDSS-2.  The blinded raters will not have access to the results of other study assessments or medical records for the subject and will not participate in the care or management of the subject.  Each rating is based exclusively on an interview with the subject (and the subject's caregiver when available).
The blinded central rater will complete the NMSS and PDSS-2 at the times indicated in 
Table 3 with the baseline assessment occurring at Screening Visit 3.
Rater Training Requirements for All Other Secondary Scales
Appropriate study site personnel will be trained on the use of all other secondary scales used in this study.  Raters who become involved in the study after the Investigator's meeting will not be permitted to perform a ny study-specified ratings until they have 
satisfactorily completed the appropriate training program as designated by the Sponsor.  It 
is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure the raters at his/her site are appropriately trained to administer all rating scales.
5.3.1.3 Ancillary Support
Sites will be appropriately trained and provided support on the initiation and titration of 
LCIG prior to subject enrollment of the first subject at each site. 
Duodopa Study Specialist (DSS)
The Sponsor may provide ancillary support to the study sites by utilizing a Duodopa 
Study Specialist (DSS) to provide additional training to the Investigator and site personnel.  These DSS' training and consultation services will be similar to those provided in the previous Phase 3 program.  DSS services and training are methods of support in the implementation of the LCIG administration system at clinical sites.

5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  In addition, the 
Investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the Investigator considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protocol.  Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be 
replaced.
Subjects may develop adverse events or abnormalities in vital signs, ECGs, physical 
examinations, neurological examinations or laboratory determinations during their 
participation in the study.  If these occur, the Investigator may discontinue a subject from the study if, in their clinical judgment, continued participation would result in undue risk or further worsening of the condition.
The following adverse events require Premature Discontinuation:
●Subjects who develop a melanoma during the course of the study should be 
discontinued from participation and referred for appropriate follow-up care
●Subjects who develop impulsive behavior that is clinically significant, in the judgment of the Investigator, should be discontinued from participation in the 
study and referred for appropriate follow-up care
●As indicated by answering yes to quest ion 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS, subjects 
should be discontinued from participation in the study and referred for 
appropriate follow-up care
●Subjects who become pregnant should be discontinued from participation in the study and referred for appropriate follow-up care
In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study after they have 
begun the PEG-J placement procedure, the assessments for a Premature Discontinuation Visit should be pe rformed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
85
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the Investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory  clinical resolution of the laboratory result 
or adverse event is achieved.
The Study Termination eCRF must be completed for all subjects who have entered the 
study (i.e., have signed the Informed Consent).  Subjects dropping out prior to randomization w ill be considered Screen Failures and the reason for Screen Failure will 
be entered in the eCRF.  In case of Premature Discontinuation of the subject after randomization, the primary reason for Premature Discontinuation will be entered in the eCRF.
5.4.2 Removal of the PEG-J (LCIG Group Only)
For subjects randomized to LCIG, in case of premature discontinuation of the subject or 
subject not continuing on commercial treatment, after the PEG-J has been placed, the PEG-J should be removed via endoscopy.  The PEG-J should not be removed for 10 to 
14 days after placement or un til the stoma-tract is formed.  Institutional standards for 
follow-up care after removal of the PEG-J should be followed.  The tube must be removed 
endoscopically by a qualified gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon.  Follow-up visit with examination should occur 1 week following the PEG-J removal.
5.4.3 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, eith er in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.

5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects may be randomized to one of two treatment groups, OMT or LCIG.
5.5.1.1 OMT
Those subjects randomized to OMT at the end of V3 will continue on their current 
anti-PD medication regimen for the duration of the study.  The PI will provide the prescription for continued OMT.  PIs should make any effort to keep all anti-PD medications and medications to treat NMS stable for the duration of the study.  Changes to the OMT arm can be made "if medically justified" or if absolutely indicated for safety reasons.  The day after V3 will be consider ed Day 1 of the treatment period for the OMT 
group.  Subjects in the OMT Group will not have a Visit 4, while visits 5 through 8 willtake place at the end of Weeks 2 through 26 respectively.  All data will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF and the assessments completed as in Table 3 .
5.5.1.2 LCIG
LCIG is supplied as a homogenous suspension of levodopa (20 mg/mL) and carbidopa 
monohydrate (5 mg/mL) in an aqueous intestinal gel (carboxymethyl cellulose).  The intestinal gel is dispensed in a medication  cassette reservoir of 100 mL, designed to be 
connected to a portable subject-operated pump.  LCIG infusion is administered over a full 16-hour period each day.  At night, after disconnecting the pump, the tubing is flushed 
with potable water.
The total daily dose of infusio n LCIG will be composed of three components:  (i) the 
morning dose, (ii) continuous maintenance infusion dose and (iii) extra doses.Subject dosing is determined individually.  The starting total daily dose of LCIG infusion 
after placement of the PEG-J tube will be based solely on the daily dose of the oral levodopa component from the tablets of  levodopa- immediate (IR) taken immediately prior 
to NJ (or PEG-J) placement during the 16 hour waking day it was anticipated the subject 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
87
would be on LCIG therapy.  The rate of LCIG infusion is typically within the range of 1 
to 10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances and runs over a period of 16 consecutive hours.  The PEG-J tube s hould be disconnected from the infusion pump 
before bedtime and the tube should be flushed with 20 mL potable water (both the gastric and jejunal port).
The timing (time of day, interval) of dosing and specific instructions to subjects about 
when or how to take the dose will be supplied to the subject.  No restrictions are given with relation to the time of LCIG dosing relative to meals.
Initial Dose Titration
The initial infusion w ill be based on calculations described in this section.  Extra doses of 
LCIG may be administered to address immediate medical need throughout the day during 
initial titration and should be carefully recorded on the Dose Titration Diary.
The daily LCIG infusion dose may be adjusted based on the subject's response to the 
previous day's treatment and the amount of, if any of extra LCIG doses required.  If both the Investigator and subject are satisfied with the effectiveness of treatment, then no change in the LCIG infusion dose is require d.  If clinically indicated, changes in the dose 
either upward or downward can be made to further optimize the subject's treatment response.
If at any time during titration the subject develops severe dyskinesia or other 
levodopa-related complications, the LCIG infusion can be paused, if judged absolutely necessary by the Investigator, until symptoms improve to a clinically acceptable level.
Additionally, if at any time during titration, the subject develops a prolonged "Off" state 
that is unsafe or causes the subject unacceptable discomfort, rescue oral LC-IR dose can be administered, if judged necessary by the Investigator, until symptoms improve.
58
The continuous dose of LCIG should be adjusted to obtain the optimal clinical response for the individual subject.  Optimal clinical response is defined by maximizing the 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
88
functional "On" time and minimizing the number of "Off" episodes during the day.  This 
optimization also minimizes "On" time with troublesome dyskinesia.  This determinationis made by the Investigator.  
LCIG Infusion
LCIG concentration = 1 mL LCIG contains 20 mg of levodopa and 5 mg carbidopa 
(20 mg/mL).
Morning Dose
A morning dose will be administered as a bolus infusion by the pump to rapidly achieve a 
therapeutic dose level (over approximately 10 to 30 minutes).  This morning dose is generally 5 to 10 mL and corresponds to 100 to 200 mg of levodopa.
The total morning dose typically does not exceed  15 mL (300 mg levodopa).  Subjects are 
not administered a full equivalent of their us ual oral morning dose of levodopa-carbidopa.  
Continuous Maintenance Dose
The Maintenance Dose is adjustable in steps of 2 mg/hour (0.1 mL/hour).  The dose 
should be calculated according to the subject's previous daily intake of levodopa.  The continuous maintenance dose is adjusted individually.  It is usually kept at 2 to 6 mL/hour (40 to 120 mg levodopa/hour).  However, higher doses may be clinically indicated.  During the titration period, the continuous dose can be titrated in a step wise fashion that meets the clinical and medical needs of the subject.  The continuous maintenance dose is first calculated based on the subject's usual total daily dose minus the morning dose.  
During treatment, pump alarms may indicate kinking or knotting of the tube.  
Additionally there may be a sudden deterioration in treatment response with recurring motor fluctuations due to the distal part of the tube becoming displaced from the upper intestine into the stomach.  The locati on of the tube should be determined 
radiographically.  If necessary, the end of the tube can be repositioned to the proximal small intestine and the new placement confirmed radiographically.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
89
If a problem develops with the LCIG system and the LCIG infusion needs to be 
temporarily discontinued, the Investigator should then place the subject on a regimen of oral levodopa-IR tablets until the problem is resolved and the LCIG infusion can be 
resumed the following morning.  If the subject is placed on an oral regimen of levodopa IR tablets; the dose prescribed should be based on the dose the subject was receiving just prior to the LCIG infusion interruption and ad just the dose as clinically indicated to 
stabilize the subject.  
Extra LCIG Doses
During initial titration, extra doses may be administered on an hourly basis at the 
Investigator's discretion based on the subject's response.  Subsequently, subjects will be 
allowed to self-administer additional extra doses of LCIG (at intervals of no less than 2 hours) to address immediate medical needs, such as the rapid deterioration of motor function.  Extra doses may be given as required if the subject becomes hypokinetic during the day.  If the need for extra doses exceeds 5 times per day, the subject should be instructed to contact the Investigator. The Investigator should then consider the need to increase the subject's continuous daily maintenance infusion dose.  After the initial dose setting, fine adjustments of the morning dose, the maintenance dose and extra doses can be made as needed.  
Nasojejunal Tube
LCIG is intended for continuous intestinal ad ministration.  A temporary nasojejunal tube 
may be used initially with the infusion pump to determine if the subject responds 
favorably to this method of treatment and to optimize the dose of LCIG before treatment 
with a permanent PEG-J tube is started.  Only the NJ sets available through this clinical study should be used with LCIG.  The NJ should be inserted by a gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon or interventional radiolog ist.  NJ may also be inserted by the 
passive method.
Following the placement of the NJ it will be n ecessary to perform a radiological check for 
proper tube placement before initiating LCIG. If NJ is placed via the passive method, the 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
90
radiological check will be completed when the t ube is expected to be located in the correct 
position (which may take around 48 hours and local practice procedures should be 
followed).
Alternatively, subjects may proceed directly to placement of the permanent PEG-J tube 
and start titration without the NJ test phase if deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 
Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy with Jejunal Extension (PEG-J)
LCIG will be administered via the components of the percutaneous endoscopic 
gastrostomy – with jejunal extension (PEG-J) set.  Only the PEG-J sets available through this clinical study should be used with LCIG.
A thorough evaluation of the subject's risk of undergoing the PEG-J procedure will be 
performed by the Investigator and study gastroenterologist proceduralist or surgeon as part of the verification of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria prior to Screen V2.  Subjects deemed unsuitable for the PEG-J procedure will not be enrolled in the study.
The study gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon or qualified radiologist must take 
appropriate steps to evaluate and minimize the risk to subjects undergoing the PEG-J 
procedure including aftercare.  Additional evaluations for safety, other than those required by the protocol, are permitted at the Investigator's or Study GIs discretion (i.e., additional lab tests).
Placement of the PEG-J will be performed by a qualified gastroenterologist proceduralist, 
surgeon or qualified radiologist experienced with the placement of PEG-J tubes.  Each study site should have one study designated  gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon, or 
qualified radiologist and one backup who has experience with and a thorough knowledge of endoscopy and PEG placement, aspects of PD and neurological patients, placement and 
maintenance of PEG-J tubes, the LCIG Sys tem and any related procedures.  They must 
also participate in study staff guided training or equivalent.

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
91
The placement target for the end of the jejunal extension tubing is in the proximal small 
intestine past the ligament of Treitz.  Study si te personnel will be trained with regard to 
the proper care and maintenance of the LCIG Infusion System to ensure that high quality care is provided to each subject.
The use of prophylactic antibiotics is required prior to PEG-J procedure.  At minimum, a 
single dose of a 1
stor 3rdgeneration cephalosporin (or an antibiotic with similar coverage) 
must be administered approximately 30 minutes prior to the PEG-J procedure.
Following PEG-J placement and, at the discretion of the Investigator, the subject may 
begin initiation and titration of LCIG infusion.  LCIG initiation and titration will be performed in the hospital but may be continued as an outpatient (e.g., at a study site, titration center) with appropriate medical s upervision.  The Sponsor will ensure the 
Investigator and site personnel are trained on LCIG initiation and titration.
The gastric port of the PEG-J s hould not be used for the delive ry of nutrition and/or other 
medications unless judged medically necessary following consultation with the study 
designated physician.  If determined medically necessary, it is imperative that nutrition and/or other medications are delivered only through the gastric port and not the jejunal port.  The gastric port must be properly flushed and maintained as outlined in the provided aftercare procedure instructions for the PEG-J set.
Following the PEG-J placement procedure, aftercar e of the PEG-J system will initially be 
performed by trained study staff.  Instructi on and confirmation that the subject and/or 
care-partner have a good understanding of proper stoma aftercare and check of the stoma 
is required before discharge.  To ensure adequate adaptation of the stomach and abdominal walls and to reduce PEG-J infections, the aftercare procedure instructions provided by the Sponsor must be utilized.  During aftercare procedures, it is very 
important not to turn, rotate or twist the jejunal extension tube.
The gastroenterologist proceduralist, surgeon, or qualified radiologist, or their designated 
qualified personnel will examine the subject's stoma site between Study Day 2 and Study 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
92
Day 7 after PEG-J placement, and will continue to follow the subject's progress as an 
outpatient.  The gastroenterologist proceduralist/surgeon will continue to follow the subject's progress as an outpatient.

The Pump comes in a kit form that includes a holster, 2 batteries and an instruction 
booklet.  Should the holster g et damaged due to wear and tear, an additional pump bag 
and/or holster can be provided to the subject.
AbbVie will provide LCIG, devices and ancillaries to the site to initiate LCIG after NJ 
and/or PEG-J placement.  
Any replacement LCIG pumps will be shipped to the Investigator allowing the 
Investigator to program and dispense the pump directly to the subject.
5.5.2.2 Packaging and Labeling
The medication will be packaged in accorda nce with the applicable local and federal 
regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).
LCIG
Seven (7) medication cassette reservoirs of LCIG will be contained in an outer carton and 
this will comprise one kit.  The medication cassette reservoirs of LCIG and the carton will be labeled with all information as required by local regulations.  All labels must remain affixed to the primary and secondary packaging material.
5.5.2.3 Storage and Dis position of Study Drug
LCIG Storage
At the LCIG distribution depot, the cassettes with the LCIG suspension can be stored in 
the freezer (between –15°C and –25°C) for up to 2 years.  After thawing, the LCIG suspension can be stored in a refrigerator (between 2°C and 8°C) for up to 15 weeks.  Thawed LCIG suspension should not be re-frozen.  The cassettes should be kept in the 
outer carton in order to protect from light.  An LCIG cassette medication should be used within 16 hours after removal from the refrigerator.  Once an LCIG cassette has been 
disconnected from the pump, it may not be reused at a later time.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
94
All study site clinical drug supplies are to be stored in a secure, limited-access area in 
accordance with labeled storage conditions.  The Investigator (or an authorized representative) will maintain accurate records of the disposition of clinical drug supplies received at the site.  These records shall include the amounts of drug supplies and the dates on which drug supplies were received from the drug depot, dispensed to the subject (by the site), returned by the subject and returned to the study site (devices) (LCIG cassettes).  If errors or damages in the clinical drug supply shipments occur, the Investigator and subsequently, the subject, w ill be instructed to contact the study site 
immediately.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
Before the site is initiated, contact information and user guidelines for the IRT system will 
be provided to each site.  Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in 
the IRT system.
At Screening during Visit 1, each subject will be assigned a unique 5-digit number by the 
IRT system.  Following Visit 3, the site will contact the IRT to randomize the subject to OMT or LCIG.  Subjects randomized to OMT will continue on their current anti-PD 
medication regimen for the duration of the study.  For subjects randomized to LCIG, the site will obtain the study drug kit numbers to dispense at the designated Visits.  Study 
drug must not be dispensed without contacting the IRT.  Study drug may only be dispensed to subjects randomized to LCIG in the study through the IRT.
This is an open-label study and all eligible subjects will receive OMT or LCIG.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
LCIG subject dosing will be individually optimized.  Subject dosing will be titrated 
following either NJ placement or the PEG-J procedure.  Dose adjustments can be made 
throughout the course of the study as clinically indicated.  The LCIG infusion is expected to infuse over approximately 16 hours with a r ate of infusion within the range of 1 to 
10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
95
While the subject is titrated, the study staff should complete Dose Titration Diary hourly 
until the dose is optimized and then recording whenever the dosage is adjusted or the 
subject received extra or if required rescue doses.
5.5.5 Blinding
This is an open-label study.  All eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive OMT:LCIG.
Blinded centralized raters will be used to administer the NMSS and PDSS-2, the primary 
efficacy endpoints for this study, during Randomization at Visit 3 and Treatment Period 
visits.  Randomization, V3 will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.  The scales 
will also be performed at Visits 6, 12, and 26.  The scales are to be performed by a trained blinded central rater who will not have access to the results of other study assessments or medical records for the subject and who will not participate in the care or management of the subject.  Each rating is based exclusively on an interview with the subject (and the subject's caregiver when available).
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense LCIG study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study and randomized to LCIG treatment in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.  The site will review LCIG cassette usage at drug resupply visits and assess compliance at each visit.  
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
Initial study supplies and 6 weeks of LCIG cassettes will be supplied to the Investigator 
by the drug depot.  It is at the discretion of AbbVie and/or the Investigator to discontinue subjects from the study who fail to take and/or return the appropriate amount of study drug.
Treatment regimen compliance will be also be assessed by the Subject Dosing Diary.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
96
LCIG therapeutic systems are received intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be
documented by the Investigator signing a nd dating the Proof of Receipt (POR) after 
he/she receives LCIG from the depot for the initial supplies, and by signing the POR upon receipt of LCIG from the depot.  A current (running) and accurate inventory will be kept 
by the Investigator or the designated representatives in the IRT system, and will include shipping invoices and the date on which study drug was dispensed to the subject.  The IRT must be contacted when any sub ject discontinues the study.  The IRT w ill maintain a 
current and accurate inventory of all LCIG supplies, accountability, reconciliation, and returns for each site.  The investigational site and depot will also maintain current and accurate documentation of study drug details (i.e., kit number, number of used and unused cassettes) in the source document for each subject.  Returned study drug cassettes will be retained by the depot until returned for destruction.
An overall accountability of LCIG will be performed and verified by the Sponsor and the 
depot throughout the study.  All original LCIG cassettes (empty or containing unused LCIG) will be returned to the depot, according to instructions from AbbVie and according to local regulations.  Labels must remain attached to the containers.
Non-investigational medicinal product (standard of care) (e.g., generic name or brand 
name) must be obtained commercially.
5.5.8 Device Accountability
All pumps dispensed and returned and all tubes placed and removed will be tracked in the 
IRT and EDC system on the appropriate eCRF.  All devices must be accounted for throughout the study by the site.  All pumps, tubes, and accessories dispensed and returned and all tubes placed and removed will be tracked in the IRT and EDC system on the appropriate eCRF.  All devices must be accounted for throughout the study by the site.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open label study and all subjects will receive OMT or LCIG in an open-label 
fashion.
An open-label study design is appropriate for the following reasons:
1. LCIG is an approved product with demonstrated efficacy
2. Advanced PD is an orphan populations wi th a limited patient population available 
for recruitment
3. An open-label design ensures that subjects randomized to optimized medical 
therapy do not have to undergo the invasive NJ and PEG-J procedure unnecessarily
4. NJ testing period is not possible in a blinded study5. Per the Package Leaflet, Duodopa is init iated as monotherapy – tapering off of all 
other anti-PD medicati ons besides levodopa at initiation would not be plausible in a 
blinded study
6. The majority of patients are on other anti-PD medications in addition to levodopa 
and those randomized to OMT, would not be able to be maintained on levodopa 
monotherapy for 28 days safely
As there are no approved medications which treat NMS as a whole, this optimized medical therap y population is considered a ppropriate as a comparison group.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The NMSS was developed to evaluate the severity of individual non-motor symptoms in a patient with Parkinson's disease and to monitor the effect of an intervention on non-motor symptoms.
The PDSS-2 was developed to assess the profile of nocturnal disturbances in PD patients.

The UPDRS and PDQ-8 are currently accepted and validated methods of evaluating 
subjects with PD.  All safety assessments are standard measures used in pharmaceutical research.

5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Levodopa-responsive Pa rkinson's disease patients with severe motor fluctuations and 
hyperkinesia/dyskinesia when available combinations of Parkinson medicinal products have not given satisfactory results are eligible to participate.
63
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
Subject dosing is determined individually.  Prior to subject enrollment, all anti-PD medications have been optimized and stabilized during the Screening Period.  For subjects randomized to LCIG, the starting dose of the infusion after placement of the NJ and/or PEG-J tube will be based on the daily dose of the oral levodopa prior to or at the time of study entry.  Subject dosing will be individually optimized.
The total dose/day of LCIG is composed of three individually adjusted doses:  (i) the 
morning dose, (ii) the continuous maintenance dose and (iii) extra doses.  The needs of individual subjects may vary depending on their particular condition and calculation of 
necessary dosing will be individualized based.  The LCIG infusion is expected to infuse over approximately 16 hours each day with a r ate of infusion within the range of 1 to 
10 mL/hour (20 to 200 mg of levodopa/hour) in most instances.  The maximum LCIG dose administered in this st udy should not exceed 200 mg of levodopa/hour for 26 weeks.

99
●An active pharmacological agent
●Device component(s) (cassette, tubing, pump, connectors, etc.).
Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Sections 6.1
through 6.1.6 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end d ate, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possib ility" of being associated with study drug or 
the study device components, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
100
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.  Also, fluctuating PD symptoms during titration should not be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
A hospitalization prior to the first screening visit (SV1), allowing the subject to arrive at 
the clinic in the "Off" state, will not be regarded as an SAE.  If not associated with worsening of Parkinson's disease symptoms, a hospitalization for dose adjustments of LCIG will not be regarded as a SAE.  A hospitalization because of a Product Complaint, such as a device dislocation without AE (i.e., without health impairment) will not be regarded as an SAE.
Hospitalization for scheduled tube placement/rep lacement should not be  considered an 
SAE.

EudraCT 2014-004865-26
101
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in d eath or hospitalization, but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervent ion to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospitalization, prolongation of  hospitalization, congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  
Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, bl ood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) are:
●Gastrointestinal and gastrointestinal procedure related events
●Polyneuropathy
●Weight loss
For AESIs, serious and nonserious, meeting pre-defined criteria, specific questionnaires 
will be used to standardize the collecti on of follow-up information.  The AESI 
questionnaires are either sent to the site after Sponsor review or issued within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system once applicable.  The Investigator will email the completed questionnaires to the AbbVie Neuroscience Safety Management Team or enter the information into the EDC system once applicable.  If a subject develops signs and symptoms of polyneuropathy a standard panel of examinations will be suggested to the Investigator and certain laboratory tests (specified in questionnaire) will be required by the Sponsor.  The Investigator may perform additional other assessments that are deemed appropriate for further evaluation of polyneuropathy symptoms based on the presentation of the individual subject.  If weight loss is considered to be clinically significant, preventative measures will be taken to counteract weight loss.
For all AESIs, if the event meets seriousness criteria, the Investigator will report the event 
to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the event according to Section 6.1.5 .

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts 
the subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or 
life-threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
For the assessment of drug event relationship, LCIG should be considered a therapeutic 
system consisting of drug, devices and placemen t procedure.  Causalit y assessments are 
always made over the system as a whole.
For the assessment of drug event relationship, those randomized to OMT should evaluate 
relatedness to any of the subject's anti-PD medication.
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship. 
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship. 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
104
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, if the Investigator has not repor ted causality or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an Investigator's opinion of no reasonable po ssibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the Investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
Protocol-related nonserious adverse events that occur after signing the informed consent, 
prior to the start of study drug administration, will be collected.  All adverse events reported from the time of randomization until 30 days following last OMT dose, last study visit, discontinuation of study drug administr ation, removal of the PEG-J tube or Last 
LCIG Commercial Transition Visit have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol related non serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 3 .

6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by enteri ng the serious adverse event data into the 
electronic data captu re (EDC) RAVE
®system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to 
the site having access to the RAVE®system, or if RAVE is not operable should be 
documented on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event.

The sponsor will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC.  The reference document used for SUSAR reporting in the EU countries will be the most current version of the Investigator's Brochure.
6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1 ).
Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in  a study subject and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  The medical outcome for 
either mother or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous abortion, is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
For medical devices, a product complaint also includes all deaths of a patient using the 
device, any illness, injury, or adverse even t in the proximity of the device, an adverse

event that could be a result of using the device, any event needing medical or surgical 
intervention including hospitalization while using the device and use errors.
Any information available to help in the determination of causality by the device to the 
events outlined directly above should be captured.
6.2.2 Reporting
Product Complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported 
to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the study site's knowledge of the event via the eCRF or Product Complaint form if eCRF is unavailable.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a satisfactory c onclusion.  All follow-up information is to be 
reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor.  Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary.  All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing 
basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition (cassette, pump, tubing, etc.).  In instances where a return is requested, every 
effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an 
estimated date of return.
The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to 
investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
The Investigator should not implement any deviation from the protocol without prior review and agreement by the Sponsor and in accordance with the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) and local regulations, except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  When a deviation from the

treatment.  The treatment period will end on the day of the final visit for subjects 
randomized to OMT, and on the last day of LCIG study drug infusion for subjects randomized to LCIG treatment.
The last assessment prior to randomization will be considered baseline and the last 
assessment that is no more than 2 days after the end of the treatment period will be considered the final evaluation.
Safety Dataset
The safety analyses will be performed on th e safety dataset which will include all subjects 
who are randomized to the optimized medical treatment, and all subjects who are 
randomized to LCIG and have study device (NJ and/or PEG-J) placement.  For assessments of safety, the treatment period will begin the day after randomization for subjects randomized to optimized medical treatment, and the day of NJ placement (or PEG-J placement if no NJ) for subjects randomized to LCIG.  The treatment period will end on the day of the final visit for subjects randomized to optimized treatment, and on the last day of LCIG infusion or device remo val (whichever is later) in the study for 
subjects randomized to LCIG.  The last assessment prior to randomization will be considered baseline and the last assessment that is no more than 2 days after the end of the treatment period will be considered the final evaluation.
8.1.2 Demographic, Other Baseline Characteristics, Subject 
Disposition, and Concomitant Medication
Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
All demographic variables will be summarized for the safety dataset unless otherwise 
specified.
For continuous demographic variables, including age, weight, height and body mass index 
(BMI), descriptive statistics (number of subjects with non-missing data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for each treatment group, 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel

and for both treatment groups combined.  Overall treatment group differences will be 
tested using one-way ANOVA.
For categorical demographic variables, including gender and race, the number and 
percentage of subjects in each category will be provided for each treatment group, and for all treatment groups combined.  Overall treatment group comparability will be tested using Fisher's exact test.
For the ITT data set, baseline NMSS total score and PDSS-2 total score will be 
summarized.  One-way ANOVA will be used to assess the comparability of treatment groups.
Medical History
Medical history data will be summarized for the safety dataset using body systems and 
conditions/diagnoses as captured on the eCRF.  Parkinson's disease history will also be summarized.
Subject Disposition
The number and percentage of subjects contributed by each country and site will be 
summarized for each treatment group and for all tr eatment groups combined for the safety 
dataset.
The number and percentage of subjects who prematurely discontinue study will be 
summarized by tr eatment group and overall for the safety dataset for the primary reason 
as well as for all reasons collected.  In the summary, the number and percentage of subjects who discontinue due to any reason as well as due to each specific primary reason will be presented.  Subjects may report multiple reasons for prematurely discontinuing study, but the primary reason for discontinuation will be indicated in the eCRF and used to infer treatment group difference in subject's disposition.  The treatment group differences in the percentage of subjects who discontinued for any reason as well as for each specific reason will be assessed using Fisher's exact test.

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
112
Previous and Concomitant Medications
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded by the most recent World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary.  Previ ous and concomitant medications will be 
summarized by tr eatment group for the safety dataset.  No statistical testing will be 
performed.
8.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT dataset unless otherwise specified.  
Comparisons between OMT and LCIG groups will be performed with two-sided tests at the significance level of 0.050.
Unless otherwise specified, the "baseline" for efficacy variables is defined as the last 
assessment taken on or before the day of randomization, and the "final observation" refers to the last non-missing observation in the Treatment Period (including evaluations conducted within 2 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects randomized to LCIG).
8.1.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
There are 2 alternative primary efficacy variables, change from baseline to Week 26 for 
NMSS total score and change from baseline to Week 26 for PDSS-2 total score.  Either variable considered statistically significant after multiplicity adjustment is sufficient to declare success of the study.
NMSS Total Score
The NMSS was developed to assess non-motor symptoms in PD.  It is obtained through 
interview and rated by heal th professionals.  It contains 30 questions grouped into 
9 domains:  cardiovascular (2 items), sleep/f atigue (4 items), mood/cognition (6 items), 
perceptual problems /hallucinations (3 items), attention/memory (3 items), gastrointestinal 
tract (3 items), urinary (3 items), sexual function (2 items), and miscellaneous (4 items).  Each question is scored with respect to severity and frequency.  Severity is rated on a 
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
113
scale where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe.  Frequency is rated on a 
scale where 1 = rarely, 2 = often, 3 = frequent and 4 = very frequent.  Item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency.  Domain scores and a total score are obtained by summing the item scores.
PDSS-2 Total Score
The PDSS-2 was developed from the PDSS based upon the need for a 
treatment-measuring tool containing PD-specif ic sleep disorders.  The instrument was 
extended to address specific sleep disturbances such as RLS, akinesia, pain, and sleep apnea.  The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 [never] to 4 [very often]).  Scores are calculated for each domain as well as a total score.
Primary Analysis Model and Multiplicity Adjustment
The primary efficacy analysis model is a lik elihood-based mixed-effects model repeated 
measures (MMRM) analysis of the change from baseline for each post-baseline 
observation using all observed data.  The model will include fixed, categorical effects for treatment, country, visit, and treatment-by -visit interaction, wi th continuous fixed 
covariates for baseline score and the baseline score-by-visit interaction.  The primary comparison will be the contrast between LCIG and optimized oral treatment at the Week 26 Visit.
The two-sided Pvalues obtained from the MMRM m odel for NMSS total score change 
from baseline to Week 26 and PDSS-2 total score change from baseline to Week 26 will 
be adjusted for multiplicity using the Hoc hberg procedure.  This method controls the 
family-wise error rate (FWER) at a pre-specified significance level (alpha = 0.05).  Specifically, the following steps will be followed:
●If the larger of the 2 Pvalues is ≤ 0.05 (i.e., both Pvalues are ≤ 0.05), both 
endpoints are considered statistically significant.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
114
●If the larger of the 2 Pvalue is > 0.05, then compare the smaller Pvalue with 
0.025.  The second endpoint is statistically significant if the Pvalue is ≤ 0.025; 
otherwise, neither endpoint is considered statistically significant.
8.1.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis
Secondary Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variables
ANCOVA analyses will be carried out on change from baseline to final NMSS total score 
and change from baseline to final PDSS-2 total score.  The ANCOVA model will contain treatment and country as the main eff ects and baseline score as the covariate.
Sensitivity analyses will be carried out on the above variables with the same ANCOVA model using all randomized subjects.  In this analysis, Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) will be applied to subjects who do not have post-randomization assessment of NMSS or PDSS-2.
Key Secondary Efficacy Variables
Key secondary endpoints will consist of the following validated scales:
●UPDRS Part II score
●CGI-C
●PDQ-8 summary index
The 3 key secondary variables will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the 
primary analysis.  For the analysis on CGI-C, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.
If both primary efficacy variables are statistically significant after adjusting for 
multiplicity, the Stepwise Gatekeeping Procedure will be utilized and the 3 key secondary endpoints will be tested using the Hoc hberg procedure with significance level of 0.05.
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
115
Other Secondary Efficacy Variables
Other secondary endpoints include:
●NMSS domain scores
●PDSS-2 domain scores
●UPDRS total score, Part I score, Part III score, Part IV score
●Parkinson Anxiety Scale (PAS) total and subscale scores
●King's PD Pain Scale total and domain scores
These variables will be analyzed with the same MMRM model as the primary analysis.  
For the analysis on PGIC, the scores collected at the visits will be the dependent variable.
8.1.4 Safety Analysis
All safety analysis will be performed on the safety dataset unless otherwise specified.  
Comparisons between LCIG and OMT groups will be performed with two-sided test at the significance level of 0.05.
Unless otherwise specified, the treatment group differences in continuous safety variables 
(e.g., change from baseline to final observation on laboratory tests) will be assessed using an ANOVA model with the term of treatment, and the treatment group differences in binary safety variables will be evaluated using a Fisher's exact test.
8.1.4.1 OMT and LCIG Study Drug Exposure
The duration of OMT exposure will be calculated for each subject as the date of the last 
visit minus the date of random ization.  The duration of LCIG study drug exposure will be 
calculated for each subject as the date of the last dose of LCIG study drug minus the date of the first dose of LCIG study drug plus 1.  The duration of OMT and LCIG study drug exposure will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects with non-missing data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum).

M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
116
8.1.4.2 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Adverse events will be summarized by primary MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event for a given MedDRA PT will be counted only once for that term.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event within an SOC will be counted only once for the SOC total.  Subjects reporting more than one adverse event will be counted only once in the overall adverse event total.
Each adverse event will be categorized by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and by 
relationship to study treatment (reasonable possib ility, or no reasonable possibility).  
Detailed search criteria for adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be defined in a SAP prior to database lock.
A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as:
●For OMT group:  any adverse event that begins or worsens in severity the day 
after randomization and within 30 days following the last visit.
●For the LCIG group:  any adverse event that begins or worsens in severity from the day of the initial device placement (NJ or PEG-J)  through Week 26 
Visit for those subjects continuing to LCIG commercial treatment, or through 30 days after final device removal for those subjects not continuing LCIG commercial treatment.
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects will be prepared for the following:
●TEAEs
●TE Serious AEs (including deaths)
●TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of treatment
●TEAEs by maximum relationship to study drug
●TEAEs by maximum severity
●Treatment-emergent AESIs
Levodopa-Carbidopa Intestinal Gel
M12-927 Protocol Amendment 4
EudraCT 2014-004865-26
117
Serious adverse events with onset during the Screening Period for all subjects screened, 
adverse events and serious adverse events with onset after day of randomization and before day of initial device placement for the LCIG group, as well as adverse events during the transition period for LCIG subjects continuing LCIG commercial treatment will also be summarized.
8.1.4.3 Clinical Laboratory Variables
For each continuous clinical laboratory variable, analyses of the mean change from 
baseline to each scheduled visit and to the minimum, maximum and final value will be presented by treatment group.
Clinical laboratory observations will be categorized as normal, low, or high relative to the 
reference (normal) range associated with the laboratory that performed the assay.  For each clinical laboratory variable with a reference range, shift tables will be prepared for reference range category shifts from bas eline to minimum, maximum and final value.
Criteria for potentially clinically significant (P CS) values will be pre-specified for 
selected laboratory variables in an SAP prior to database lock.  For each variable, a summary of the number and percentage of subjects who have at least one post-baseline observation that meets the PCS criteria and is more extreme than their baseline value will be provided.
8.1.4.4 Vital Sign Variables and Weight
For each vital sign and weight variable, analyses of the mean change from baseline to 
each scheduled visit and to the final value will be presented by treatment group.  For this analysis, the average of multiple observations on the same day will be calculated and treated as the observation for the day.  For LCIG subjects' visits with multiple observations scheduled on the same day, the post-i nfusion change from the day's 
pre-infusion baseline will be summarized for each scheduled time point.

Criteria for potentially clinically significant (PCS ) values will be pre-specified for 
selected vital sign and weight variables prior to database lock.  For each variable, a 
summary of the number and percentage of subjects who have at least one post-baseline observation that meets the PCS criteria and is m ore extreme than their baseline value will 
be provided.
8.1.4.5 ECG Variables
For each ECG variable, analyses of the mean change from baseline to each scheduled visit 
and to the final value will be presented by treatment group.  For this analysis, the average of multiple observations on the same day will be calculated and treated as the observation for the day.  For LCIG subjects' visits with multiple observations scheduled on the same day, the post-infusion change  from the day's pre -infusion bas eline will be summarized for 
each scheduled time point.
Criteria for potentially clinically significant (P CS) values will be pre-specified for 
selected ECG variables prior to database lock.  For each variable, a summary of the 
number and percentage of subjects who have at least one post-baseline observation that 
meets the PCS criteria and is more extreme than their baseline value will be provided.
8.1.4.6 Additional Safety Variables
The following additional summaries of safety measures will be prepared.
●The responses to the MIDI
●The responses to the C-SSRS
●The responses to the Sleep Attacks Questionnaire
●Percent of subjects who are cognitive impaired (MoCA score ≤ 26)

8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 88 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
either optimized medical treatment or LCIG.  There are no results on NMSS or PDSS-2 available from randomized trials comparing LCIG and OMT.  Interim data from ongoing Phase 3b Study M12-920 showed that the improvement in NMSS total score from baseline to Week 12 is 24.8 in the LCIG group with standard deviation of 24.  Results from Zibetti et al (2013) showed that the improvement in PDSS-2 total score after an average of 3.5 months of LCIG treatment was 13.1.  The standard deviation was not provided and is estimated to be 12.2 assuming the correlation between baseline and 
follow-up visits is 0.5.
The significance level for this study is 0.05.  For sample size determination, it is assumed 
that the improvement in the OMT group is 33% of the LCIG group, i.e., the improvement is 8.2 on NMSS total score and 4.3 on PDSS-2 total score, and that the correlation between these 2 measures is 0.5.  Simulation showed that a study with 37 subjects per group will have 90% power to declare statist ical signif icance on at least one of these 2 
alternative primary endpoints after multiplicit y adjustment using Hochberg procedure.  It 
is further assumed that 10% of randomized subjects in either treatment group will not provide post-ra ndomization efficacy assessment.  A dditional simulations showed that 44 
subjects per group will provide 90% power in the sensitivity analysis using baseline observation carried forward for subjects without post-randomization assessment.  
Therefore the total planned enrollment is decided to be 88 subjects.
8.3 Randomization Methods
Approximately 88 subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
either optimized medical treatment or LCIG at the end of Visit 3.  Subject randomization will be stratified by country.

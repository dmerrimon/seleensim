2.0 STUDY SUMMARY
Name of Sponsor(s): 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Compound: 
Vedolizumab IV
Title of Protocol: A Randomized, Double -Blind, 
Placebo -Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Vedolizumab in the Prophylaxis of 
Intestinal Acute Graft -Versus -Host Disease in Subjec ts 
Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
TransplantationEudraCT No.: 2018 -002141 -11
Study Number: Vedolizumab -3035 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
vedolizumab compared to placebo as prophylaxis for intestinal acute graft -versus -host disease (aGvHD) in subjects
undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) for the treatment of hematological 
malignancies or myeloproliferative disorder . 
Subjects will be randomized into 2 arms at 1:1 ratio, vedolizumab v ersus placebo. Randomization will be stratified by
age(≥18 years or adolescents aged 12 to <18 years ),human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match (8/8 or 7/8), conditioning 
regimen (myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning), and with or without antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 
(antithy mocyte globulin -Fresenius [ATG -F] or thymoglobulin). Subjects will subsequently be followed and evaluated 
for development of intestinal aGvHD for the first 180 days after allo-HSCT. The study day numbering convention will 
be based on the first day of cell infusio n, which will be Day 0. Pretransplant procedure days are designated with 
negative numbers (eg, Day -1), whereas posttransplant procedure days are designated with positive numbers (eg, Day 
+13).
The study  consists of a 30-day screening period, 155-day treatment period, and a follow -up period for safety 
assessments and survival for up to 12 months after allo -HSCT. Subjects randomized tothe vedolizumab treatment arm
will receive vedolizumab intravenously (IV) at a 300 -mg dose at the start of the treatment period on Day -1 before 
allo-HSCT and then on Day +13, Day +41, Day +69, Day +97, Day +125, and Day +153. Subjects randomized in the 
placebo treatment arm will receive placebo IV on Day -1, Day +13, Day +41, Day +69, Day +97, Day +125, and 
Day +153.
The vedolizumab 300 mg dose has been evaluated in the previous graft -versus -host disease (GvHD) 
Vedolizumab-1015 phase 1b study, and the dose and schedule of vedolizumab in this study is similar to the approved 
dose and schedule of vedolizumab administered to subjects with ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease .
All subjects will receive a background GvHD prophylaxis regimen consisting of a combination of a calcineurin 
inhibito r (CNI, cyclosporine [CYS] or tacrolimus [TAC] ) with metho trexate (MTX) (Appendix B). ATG (ATG -F or 
thymoglobulin) may  be included in prophylaxis therapy per institutional practice and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 
may be used in place of MTX at the discretion of the investigator. TAC and CYS will be administered IV or orally 
during conditioning and subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to whole blood concentration and toxicity, 
per institutional practice. The recommend ed targeted whole blood concentration for CNI s and tapering schedule is 
provided (Appendix B).
Assessment of Intestinal aGvHD
Subjects will be followed and evaluated for development of intestinal aGvHD according to the Bone Marrow 
Transplant Clinical Trials Network modified International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry index summarized in 
Appendix F.

combinatio n CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX (MMF may be used in place of MTX at the discretion of the investigator). 
When considered part of standard prophylactic treatment for GvHD, ATG (ATG -F or thymoglobulin) may be used at 
the discretion of the treating physician; however, the proportion of subjects receiving ATG shall comprise no more 
than approximately 25% of the total number of subjects enrol led into the study. 
At the time of allo -HSCT, eligible status of underlying disease stage (hematologic malignancy or myeloproliferative 
disorder), as defined on the basis of the specific malignancy, is as follows: 
a.for subjects with acute leukemia or chro nic myelogenous leukemia, no circulating blasts and <5% blasts in the 
bone marrow; 
b.for subjects with myelodysplasia, no circulating blasts and 10% blasts in the bone marrow; 
c.for subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma, chemosensitive disease 
(partial response or complete response to last salvage therapy) at time of transplantation; 
d.for subjects with other non-Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma, a response to last salvage therapy or chemo -sensitive disease per institut ional guidelines; and 
e.for subjects with myelofibrosis and other myeloproliferative disorders, <5% blasts in the blood and bone marrow. 
Performance status must be assessed as 2 using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status for
subjects aged ≥18 years at randomization or as ≥60% using the Karnofsky performance status for adolescent subjects
aged ≥16years at randomization and Lansky performance status foradolescent subjects aged 12 to <16 years at 
randomization.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
Subjects who have received prior allogeneic transplants or who are planned to undergo umbilical cord blood 
transplant .
Subjects who are planned to receive ex vivo Tcell-depleted hematopoietic stem cells , in vivo T cell-depleting 
antibodies (wi th the exception of ATG -F or thymoglobulin), or posttransplant cyclophosphamide .
Subjects with anyactive cerebral/meningeal disease (including central nervous system involvement of the primary 
disease) or signs and symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or any history of PML. 
Subjects who are planned to undergo allo -HSCT for a nonmalignant hematological disorder (eg, aplastic anemia, 
sickle cell anemia, thalassemias, Fanconi anemia or immunodeficiency ).
Subjects with clinically acti ve systemic infection during screening. 
Excluded Concomitant Medications:
Any therapy for GvHD prophylaxi s, including approved, investigational or Tcell-depleting agents other than ATG
(ATG-F or thymoglobulin), and other than that specified in the inclusion criteria .
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoint for this study is intestinal aGvHD -free survival by Day 180in subjects after allo -HSCT for 
treatment of primary malignancy or myeloproliferative disorders. The study wil l also determine the number and 
percentage of subjects who experience tre atment -emergent adverse events or serious adverse events from the 
administration of the first dose of study drug through 18 weeks after administration of the last dose of study  drug . 
Secondary endpoints for this study are to determine: intestinal aGvHD -free,relapse -free ( of underlying malignancy) 
survival by Day +180 ; Grade C -D aGvHD -free(any organ involvement) survival by Day +180 ; NRM by Day +180;

EudraCT Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
Statistical Considerations:
All statistical testing will be performed at a 2 -sided 0.05 level of significance. To control the overall Type I error rate 
for the comparison between vedolizumab and placebo groups for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, a 
gatekeeping procedure will be used. Specifically, the statistical testing of the first secondary efficacy endpoint will 
only be performed if the treatment difference for pri mary efficacy endpoint is statistically significant, the next 
secondary efficacy endpoint will only be tested if the treatment difference for the first secondary efficacy endpoint is significant and so on for each subsequent secondary efficacy endpoint.
All time-to -event endpoints will be analyzed using log- rank tests. Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by 
randomization strata will be fit with hazard ratios reported. All dichotomous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using 
Cochran -Mantel -Haensze l tests for risk differences, stratified by randomization strata. Details of the data analy ses will 
be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 
Sample Size Justification: Assuming the rate for the primary endpoint is 34.1% for theplacebo group and 21.8% for 
the vedolizumab group, a sample size of 279subjects per gro up is expected to generate 148 primary endpoint events 
andprovide 90% power at 2 -sided 0.05 level of significance. Assuming the event rate for the first secondary endpoint 
is 39.5% for the placebo group and 27.1% for the vedolizumab group, this sample size is expected to generate 177 events for the first secondary endpoint and provide approximately 86% power at 2 -sided 0.05 level of significance.

curative therapy  for m any hematol ogic malignancies, but its use is limited by  the maj or 
complicat ion of graft -versus -host di sease (GvHD) [1,2]. GvHD is a commo n complication of 
allo-HSCT and a major cause of morbidit y and mortalit y.Acute GvHD result s from the activatio n 
of alloreactive donor lymphocy tes by  histocom patibilit y antigens on host antigen- present ing cells 
(APCs) [3,4].The risk o f GvHD and its severit y depends on several factors including recipient 
age, cell source, donor characterist ics, degree of histocompatibilit y between the donor and 
recipient, the condit ioning regimen used, and the GvHD prophylaxis strategy used [1,5-7]. Despite 
GvHD prophylaxis, approximately 40% to 70% of all allo -HSCT recipients (inclusive of pediatric 
and adult subjects) develop Grade 2 to 4 acute GvHD (aGvHD) [5,6,8-11]. Approximately 45% to 
56% of pediatric allo -HSCT (ranging from<1 to 20 years of age) from unrelated donors will 
develop Grade 2 to 4 a GvHD ,and nonrelapse morta lity (NRM) appears to be greater in those 
pediatric patien ts with intest inal invo lvement [12-14]. Classical aGvHD occurs around the time o f 
engraft ment (~10 -21 days following HSCT infusio n) up to Day  100 [15] and late aGvHD occurs 
greater than 100 days fro m allo-HSCT [16,17] .
aGvHD most commo nly involves the skin, liver, and gut and results fro m an act ivation of 
alloreact ive donor lymphocy tes by  histocom patibilit y antigens on host APCs [3,4]. 
Immunocom petent donor T cells migrate to lymphoid tissues soon after infusio n, recognize host 
alloant igens, and become activated upon interaction with host APCs [18]. Homing of these 
alloreact ive donor T cells to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which is dependent on the expressio n of 
the integrin α4β7 mo lecule on the donor T cells, is fundamental to th e pathogenesis o f intestinal 
aGvHD [19-21] . Data from the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research 
showed that 76% of Grade II to IV aGvHD cases in 2006 to 2012 had intest inal invo lvement [22]. 
Intestinal aGvHD is the most serious form and may be less responsive than liver and skin GvHD to 
first-line corticosteroids, and corticosteroid resistance develops in 73% of subjects with severe 
intestinal GvHD (stage 3- 4) [23,24] . 
Given the high level o f immunosuppressio n, the risk of opportunist ic infect ions is increased in 
subjects who develop intestinal aGvHD [25,26] and overall survival (OS) for stage 3 to 4 intestinal 
aGvHD has been reported as 25 in a study  from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center [24]. 
GvHD prophylaxis is emplo yed for all subjects undergoing allo -HSCT and routine prophylaxis 
commo nly consists of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in combination with a short course 
methotrexate (MTX) or mycopheno late mo fetil (MMF) [6,8,9,11 ,27]. CNI (cyclo sporine [CYS] or 
tacrolimus [TAC]) and MTX are typically administered during condit ioning, with subsequent CNI 
doses adj usted according to whole blood co ncentration and toxicit y. Tcell-deplet ing agents, 
including antithymocyte globulins (ATG) (ant ithymocyte glo bulin -Fresenius [ATG -F] or 
thymoglo bulin) or alemtuzumab, may be added to prophylaxis therapy; however, use of these

agents have raised concerns fo r delayed immune recovery and increased ri sk of  infect ion and 
relapse [27]. 
Reducing the risk of developing aGvHD wit hout systemic immunosuppressio n has the potent ial to 
improve overall outcomes in allo -HSCT and possibly  extend and/or save lives fro m this rare 
disease.
4.1.2 Vedolizumab IV
Vedolizumab (also called MLN0002) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal 
antibody  (mAb) di rected against the human lymphocy te integrin 4β7. The 4β7 integrin 
mediates lymphocy te trafficking to GI mucosa and gut- associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) 
through adhesive interaction wit h ant imucosal  addressin cell adhesio n mo lecule -1 (MAdCAM -1), 
which is expressed on the endothelium of mesenteric lymph nodes and GI mucosa [28-31] . 
Vedolizumab specifically binds the 4β7 integrin, select ively an tagonizing its adherence to 
MAdCAM -1 and as such, impairs the migration of gut homing leukocy tes into GI m ucosa. As a 
resul t, vedolizumab acts as a gut- selective immunomodulator [32]. Vedolizumab has been 
developed as a treatment for ulcerat ive colit is (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD), which are 
characterized by  inflammat ion of the GI tract.
Vedolizumab IV ( also known as ENTYVIO; KYNTELES; Ved olizumab for Inject ion, for 
Intravenous Use; Vedo lizumab Powder for Concentrate for Solut ion for Infusion; or MLN0002 
IV) is a ly ophilized solid which after appropriate reconst itution and dilut ion is intended for 
intravenous (IV) infusio n that has been gra nted marketing approval in several regio ns, including 
the US and EU. Vedolizumab IV is approved for the treatment of adults with moderately to 
severely act ive UC or CD who have had an inadequate response with, lost response to, or were 
intolerant to a tum or necrosis factor -alpha blocker or immuno modulator; or had an inadequate 
response with, were intolerant to, or demonstrated dependence on corticosteroids. The approved 
dosing and administration regimen foradults consists of 300 mg vedo lizumab infused IV o ver 
approximately  30minutes at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, then once every 8 weeks (Q8W) thereafter. 
Vedolizumab dosing every 4 weeks (Q4W) is also approved in most parts of the world. Previously 
conducted clinical studies in healthy subjects and subjects with UC and CD have characterized the 
efficacy , safety, tolerabili ty, pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic, and immunogenicit y of
vedo lizumab.
The ongoing clinical devel opment program ofvedolizumab IV includes clinical studies in 
pediatric subjects (aged 2 -17 years) with UC or CD that are summarized in the current edition of 
the invest igator’s brochure (IB).
4.1.2.1 Nonclinical
Several published key nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the prevent ion of 
GvHD . Nonclinical pharmaco logy studies in murine models of aGvHD suggest that the prevent ion 
of Tcell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the α4β7/MAdCAM- 1 interaction, may  prevent 
GvHD [33-35] .Ina mouse m odel of GvHD, when using donor cells sorted and purified based on

the presence or absence of α4β7, the absence of α4β7+ cells great ly delayed and re duced the 
presence of GvHD [19]. Like these results, α4β7 expressi on on donor Tcells has been shown to be 
important in the induct ion of GvHD [20].By blocking the infiltrat ion of cells into the intest ines,
vedo lizumab may act to reduce the severit y and intensit y of intestinal GvHD. Extensive 
nonclinical evaluati ons of  the cardiovascular, acute, local, subchronic, chronic, immuno logic, and 
reproducti ve toxi city of vedolizumab in pharmacologically responsive species (New Zealand 
white rabbits and cyno molgus mo nkeys) have been conducted . Vedolizumab bound wi th similar 
affinit y to rabbit, m onkey , and human α4β7 integrin. 
Results fro m a 13- week toxicit y study  in juvenile cyno molgus mo nkeys ident ified 100 mg/kg 
(human equivalent dose 1920 mg in a 60- kg human) as the no -observed- adverse- effect l evel.
(NOAEL) . Inclusion of sexually  immature monkeys in the 3- and 6 -month toxicit y studiessupport 
administration of vedo lizumab in clinical studies with adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and 
greater ). 
Nonclinical studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize 4β1 integrin [3]. 
4.1.2.2 Human Experience
As of 19 May 2019, approximately  6376 subjects (healt hy or pati ents wi th UC or CD, pouchit is, 
melano ma, or undergoing allo- HSCT ) have received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across all 
studies in the clinical development program. As reported in the 9th development safet y update 
report (DSUR, for the period 20 May  2018 to 19May 2019), global cumulat ive postm arket ing 
patient exposure to vedolizumab IVis est imated to be approximately  336,400 patient- years. 
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable and consist ent safet y profile in clinical studies and in 
postm arket ing experience. Adverse reactions that have been reported following vedo lizumab 
administration include: nasopharyngit is, bronchit is, uppe r respiratory tract infection, influenza, 
sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain 
in extremit ies, py rexia , fatigue, and inject ion site reactions . Risks associ ated wi th vedolizumab 
treatm ent have b een i dentified and categorized. Important ident ified risks are hypersensit ivity 
reactions, incl uding infusio n-related reacti ons(IRRs) and upper respiratory  infect ions, including 
nasopharyngit is, sinusi tis, bronchit is, and influenza . Most IRRs are mild/mod erate in intensit y and 
resolve wit h minimal or no intervent ion. Important potential  risks are infect ions, including 
gastrointestinal infect ions and systemic infections against which the gut constitutes a defensive 
barrier; serious infections, including opportuni stic infect ions such as progressive mult ifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML); malignancy; and liver injury . Reported serious infe ctions include 
tubercul osis, sepsis, Salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningit is, and cyto megalo viral colitis.
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of the 
underlying UC or CD. Similar safety profiles for vedolizumab have been observed in subjects who 
received vedo lizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects following long -term Q4W treatment for up 
to 8 y ears, and in subjects administered vedolizumab subcutaneously  (SC) . Wit h the except ion of 
inject ion site reactions, the safet y profile for vedo lizumab SC is consistent with that for 
vedo lizumab IV.

In the phase 1b Study  Vedolizumab -1015, conducte d in 24 subject s who underwent allo -HSCT, 
vedo lizumab (at 75 or 300 mg on Days -1, +13, and +42) was added to standard GvHD 
prophylaxis (TAC and MTX) therapy. All subject s engrafted and no new safet y signals were 
reported. In clinical studies, n o saf ety concerns were ident ified in subjects with aGvHD or 
undergo ing allo -HSCT , and the events reported were consistent with known risks in these patient 
popul ations.
In addit ion, no new safet y informat ion that alters the benefit:risk balance o f vedo lizumab was 
identified in the IBD clinical development program , including ongoing studi es in pediatri c 
subjects wi th UC or CD (DSUR, for the period 20 May 2018 to 19 May 2019).
Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies . Further detail on the safet yprofile 
of vedo lizumab can be found in the current edition of the IB. 
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
The obj ective o f this proposed study  is to eval uate the safet y and efficacy of vedo lizumab 
compared to pl acebo when added to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen in prophylaxis of 
intestinal aGvHD within the first 180 days after allo-HSCT from unrelated donors. Vedolizumab 
binds the 4β7 integrin, antagonizing its adherence to MAdCAM-1 and as such, impairs the 
migration of  gut homing leukocy tes into GI m ucosa , effect ively actingas a gut- selective 
immuno modulator [32]. Vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) is appr oved for treatm ent of  CD and UC and 
demonstrates efficacy in clinical remissio n in CD and UC. Inflammat ion and damage to the GI 
tract i s a m ajor m echanism  for am plificat ion of systemic aGvHD [36] and several key similarities 
exist with intest inal aGvHD and other immune- mediated diseases like inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD). In IBD, the migrat ion of T cells to the GI tract appears to play important role in induct ion 
and perpetuation of GI inflammat ion. Once in the GI tract, the interaction between effec tor T cells 
and APCs result in downstream uncontrolled production of inflammatory  mediators as well as 
recrui tment and activat ion of addit ional leukocy tes resul ting in chroni c gut inflammat ion [37]. 
The migrat ion of naive donor T cells to the GALT where they are act ivated and migrat ion of 
activated donor T cells to the target tissues, especially the intestinal mucosa, are essent ial steps in 
aGvHD in both children and adults [4,38]. Intestinal aGvHD in chi ldren and adults is often 
involved in Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD and is a major cause of morbidit y and mortality after allo -HSCT. 
Systemic immunosuppressio n for aGvHD prophylaxis increases the risk for infect ions and can 
affect the graft -versus -tumor effect. There fore, using standard nonspecific systemic 
immunosuppressive therapies invo lves a fine balance of prevent ion of life -threatening aGvHD 
against life -threatening infection and recurrence of underlying malignant disease. Therapy that 
targets the trafficking of cells to the GI tract and reduces GI inflammat ion without adding to 
systemic immunosuppressio n coul d have profound effects on the morbidit y and m ortali ty of
intestinal GvHD. 
Results fro m Vedo lizumab -1015, a phase 1b study that enrolled 24 subjects aged ≥18 years, 
demonstrated the safet y and tolerabilit yof adding vedolizumab on Day  -1 (before allo -HSCT) and 
then on Days +13 and +42 after allo -HSCT to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen

(TAC MTX) in subjects undergo ing allo -HSCT. Vedo lizumab dose findin g was cohort -based and 
followed a rule-based dose- finding study design wit h PK guidance. After a tolerated dose with 
acceptable PK was identified, the cohort at that dose level was expanded to further assess the 
tolerabilit y and effect iveness o f vedo lizuma b. Dose escalat ion started with a low dose cohort of
vedolizumab 75 mg IV. With no dose-limit ing toxicit ies(DLTs) and no engraft ment failures in the 
75mg dose cohort, the next cohort received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV . A total  of 3 subjects were 
enrolled in the 75 mg dose cohort and 21 subjects were enrolled in the 300 mg dose cohort .The 
300-mg dose cohort consisted of adult subjects for who m a myeloablat ive condit ioning or RIC 
regimen was planned and who were candidates for HLA- matched or 1 -locus (antigen or allele) 
mismatched unrelated or related donor allo -HSCT (using either peripheral blood stem cells or 
bone marrow as the cell source) for treatment of hematologic malignancy or myelopro liferat ive 
neopl asm.No subject in either cohort experienced a DLT and all subjects engrafted (median time 
to neutrophil engraft ment was 22 days in the vedo lizumab 75 mg dose cohort and 14 days in the 
vedo lizumab 300 mg dose cohort). The PK of 300 mg vedo lizumab in this subject population was 
similar to that of subjects with IBD and provides serum concentrations above 10 µg/m L up to Day 
100. The study  resul ts dem onstrate l ess than expected intest inal aGvHD events and less than 
expected Grade 3 -4 aGvHD events in the 300 mg dose cohort. By Day +100, 3 of 21 subjects who 
received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV developed maximum stage 1 lower intestinal aGvHD and no 
subjects developed stage 2 or greater lower intestinal aGvHD. By  12 m onths, l ower inte stinal 
aGvHD developed in 3 of 21 subjects ( 2 subjects developed maximum stage 1 intes tinal aGvHD 
and 1 subject developed maximum stage 2 intestinal aGvHD). In subjects who received 
vedo lizumab 300 mg IV, Grade 2 -4 aGvHD developed in 4 of 21 subjects by Day +100 and in 5 o f 
21 subjects by 12 months after allo -HSCT. Grade 3 aGvHD developed i n 1 of 21 subjects by Day 
+100 and in 2 of 21 subjects by 12months and no subject developed Grade 4 aGvHD by Day +100 
and by  12 m onths. Overall survival and non -relapse m ortalit y in the vedolizumab 300 mg cohort 
was 84 .7% and 5.6% by 12 -month follow-up, respectively. The results of this study support further 
evaluat ion of the vedolizumab 300 mg IV dose in subjects undergo ing allo -HSCT. 
The proposed v edolizumab dose and regimen in this phase 3 study is 300 mg o n Days -1, +13, +41, 
+69, +97, +125, and +153. This is based on the results of Vedo lizumab -1015 and, similarly, on the 
known safet y profile of Q4W vedolizumab schedule evaluated in phase 3 studies and lo ng-term
follow-up (LTFU) of IBD subjects. The proposed duration of vedo lizumab prophylaxis is inten ded 
to provi de coverage during the posttransplant period, when subjects are at risk of developing 
classic and late aGvHD.
4.3 Benefit:Risk Profile
The proposed phase 3 study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of vedolizumab 
compared to pl acebo when added to background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen as prophylaxis for 
intestinal aGvHD for subjects undergo ing allo -HSCT. The m echanism  of action of vedo lizumab, 
resul ts fro m no nclinical studies demonstrating the role of T cell trafficking in GvHD, and res ults of 
the phase 1b Study  Vedolizumab -1015, all  support further investigat ion of vedo lizumab in this 
indicat ion. Vedolizumab specifically targets the α4β7 integrin expressed on the surface of T

studi es in murine model demo nstrate that i nhibit ion of the α4β7/MAdCAM -1 pathway  via 
neutralizing ant i-MAdCAM- 1 antibodi es attenuat ed the development of the graft versus host
reacti on [33] and the absence of α4β7+ cells on donor cells greatly delayed and reduced the 
presence of GvHD [19]. Furthermore, in Study Vedoli zumab -1015, a l ow incidence of intest inal 
aGvHD was observed in adults undergoing allo -HSCT for a hematologic malignancy or 
myeloproliferat ive disorder who received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV in combinat ion withstandard 
GvHD prophylaxis. There remains an unmet medical need in patients undergoing allo -HSCT who ,
despite routine prophylaxis ,remain at ri sk of developing intest inal aGvHD and its associated 
complicat ions. 
Theavailable PK data, nonclinical toxico logy data, and clinical data aresupporti ve of the 
inclusion ofadolescent subjects aged ≥12 y ears and weighing ≥30 kg in this phase 3 study . In 
phase 3 studies in adult swith UC or CD, body weights ranged from  28.7 to 170 kg. Safet y data 
from these studi es showed that there was no difference in the incidenc e of treatm ent-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) based on weight or age (18- 70 years). Furtherm ore, a similar safet y 
profile has been observed in adult s with UC or CD who received vedo lizumab IV Q8W or Q4W . 
No addi tive ri sk of infection was ident ified among subjects who received a conco mitant 
immunosuppressant. Results of populat ion PK analyses in subjects with IBD indicate that a 
weight-based dosing regimen is not required and that a tiered flat -dose is appropriate for different 
weight groups. Age was not a clinically meaningful covariate. PK data from Study
Vedolizumab-1015 indicates that the PK of vedo lizumab in subjects undergoing an allo -HSCT 
who received 300 mg is similar to that of subjects with UC or CD. In addit ion, no new safet y 
inform ation that alters the benefit:risk balance of vedolizumab have been ident ified in the UC/CD 
clinical development program , including ongoing studies in pediatric subjects (aged 2 -17years) .
Therefore, the benefit:risk profile is expected to be similar in adults and ado lescent subjects aged 
≥12 y ears and weighing ≥30 kg. 
All subjects will receive a standardized GvHD prophylaxis regimen consist ing of a CNI (CYS or 
TAC) and MTX or MMF with or wi thout the addi tion of ATG(ATG- F or thymoglo bulin) .The 
dosing of vedo lizumab in co mbination with a CNI (TAC) and MTX was well t olerated in the phase 
1b clinical study  in this subject populat ion. Similarly , vedolizumab in conjunct ion with systemic 
immunosuppressive therapy  (such as MTX, 6 -mercaptopurine, and predni sone) has been well 
tolerated in clinical studies in subjects with IBD.
Thesubject populat ion was chosen because it represents a high -risk, vulnerable populat ion for 
development of intestinal aGvHD, a driver for poor outcomes, mortality, and for whom a 
significant unmet medical need exists. The risks of this subject populat ion include those that are 
associ ated wi th hematol ogical transplantati on. Specifically , allo-HSCT pati ents are at risk of 
infect ions (opportunistic, GI, and CNS infect ions); liver injur y; infusio n-related reacti ons (IRR) 
and hypersensit ivity react ions, and relapse or new primary  malignancy . The important i dentified 
risks specific for vedolizumab include IRRs and upper respiratory tract infections, including 
bronchit is, influenza, nasophary ngitis, and sinusit is. The important potential risks for vedolizuma b

6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, mult icenter study  to eval uate the 
efficacy and safety of vedolizumab when added to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen as 
prophylaxis for intestinal aGvHD in subjects undergoing allo -HSCT. The subject populat ion will 
consist of subjec ts withhematologic m alignancies or myelopro liferat ive disorders for whom
allo-HSCT from an unrelated donor is planned , using either peripheral blood or bone marrow as 
the stem  cell source .
Eligibilit y will be determined during the screening period, which may las t for up to 30days before 
Day -1 (desi gnation of the day  of the first IV infusion of study  drug ). Subjects who meet all 
eligibilit y criteria and provi de wri tten inform ed consent will be randomiz ed in to this study within 
2 days of the first dose of study drug on Day -1. Approximately  558 s ubjects will be rando mized in 
a 1:1 fashio n to 2 treatment arms (vedo lizumab IV or placebo IV). Rando mizat ion will be stratified 
by age(≥18 y ears or adolescents aged 12to <18 years ),HLA match or mismatch (8/8 or7/8), 
conditioning regimen ( myeloablat iveorreduced intensit y condi tioning ), and treatm ent wi th or 
without ATG (ATG- F or thymoglo bulin). Subjects randomized to the vedo lizumab IV arm will 
receive 7 doses of vedo lizumab IV, beginning on Day -1 before allo -HSCT an d then on Days +13, 
+41, +69, +97, +125, and +153 after allo -HSCT. Subjects rando mized to the placebo IV arm will 
receive 7 doses of placebo IV, beginning on Day -1 before allo -HSCT and then on Days +13, +41, 
+69, +97, +125, and + 153 after allo -HSCT . 
6.1.1 Schedule of Observations and Procedures
The study  consists of a 30- day screening period, 1 55-daytreatm ent peri od, a vi sit on Day  +180 
after all o-HSCT, and a posttreatment follow-up peri od for safet y assessments and survival to be 
completed by  12 m onths after all o-HSCT. The study  overview is depicted in Figure 6.a.
6.1.1.1 Screening
Subjects will be screened within 30 days before Day  -1. Subj ects will be screened in accordance 
with predefined inclusio n and exclusio n criteria as described in Sections 7.1and7.2. See 
Secti on9.4for procedures for documenting screening failures. Rescreening is permitted in 
consultation wit h the medical m onitor. 
Procedures t o be com pleted at screening can be found in the Schedule of Events (SOE) 
(Appendix A).
6.1.1.2 Randomization
Randomization will take place within 2 days of the fir st dose of study drug onDay -1. If the subject 
has sat isfied all of the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria, the subject should be 
rando mized using the interactive response techno logy system  (IRT) , as described in Section8.2.

Subjects will be administered the first dose of study  drug as described in Sect ion8.1.1 .The 
procedure for document ing screening failures is provided in Section9.4.
6.1.1.3 Final Visit or Early Termination
The final visit (end of study  [EOS]) will be performed 12 months after allo -HSCT . Subjects who
discontinue study  drug treatm ent (refer to Section 7.4) will co mplete an early terminat ion (ET) 
visit upon discontinuation and a final visit 12 months after allo -HSCT. The gl obal study  will end 
after the last subject has completed the final visit 12 months after allo -HSCT, or the subject has 
died, wi thdrawn consent, or been lost to follow-up.
6.1.1.4 Posttreatment Follow -up
The end -of-treatment visit will be conducted on Day  +180 after all o-HSCT. All subjects will 
participate in posttreatment fo llow-up as outlined in the SOE ( Appendix A) that will  begin after 
the Day +180 visit or after ET, will include a Day +280 final safet y visit (or 18 weeks after the last 
dose of study drug), and will conclude 12 months after allo -HSCT. In addition, upon completionor 
ET, all subjects or thei r parent s/legal lyacceptable representative will be administered by
telephone the LTFU safet y quest ionnaire 6 months after their last dose of study  drug. For all 
subjects receiving study  drug, the investigator must complete the EOS electronic case report form

Vital signs, physical examinat ions, AE assessments, and laboratory  values (chemistry , 
hematol ogy, liver funct ion tests [LFTs ]as specified in Sect ion9.3.15 ) will be obtained as 
described in the SOE ( Appendix A) to eval uate the safet y and tol erabili ty ofthe study  drug . To 
exclude subjects with PML, the PML checklist will be administered at screening and before each 
administration of study  drug beginning on Day -1 and thereafter as shown in the SOE 
(Appendix A).
Sparse blood samples for determination o f the serum concentration of vedo lizumab  will 
be co llected pre -and postdose on study  drug dosing day s as sh own in the SOE ( Appendix A). 
6.2 Justification for Study Design and Dose
6.2.1 Study Design
The subject populat ion was chosen because it represents a high -risk, vulnerable popula tion for 
development of intestinal aGvHD, a driver for poor outcomes, mortality, and for whom a significant unmet m edical need exists with no current ly approved m edical therapy . The incidence 
of Grade B -D aGvHD has been reported to be 39 for HLA -matched sibling donors and 59 for 
HLA -matched unrelated donors (MUD) in 1 study [9]and 33 for matched related donor 
recipients, 51 in 8of8 HLA -MUD recipients, and 53 in 7/8 HLA -MUD recipients, with OS
(45) lowest in the 7 of 8 HLA -MUD reci pients [39]. Among pediatric subjects with allo -HSCT 
from unrelated donors, up to 56% will develop Grade 2 to 4 aGvHD and 29% will develop Grade 3 
to 4 aGvHD [13,14] . The intestinal tract is often invo lved in Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD, and when the 
intestinal tract is invo lved in pediatric patients, NRM increases [40]. All subjects will rece ive a 
background GvHD prophylaxis regimen consist ing of a CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF . 
When considered a part of standard prophylactic treatment for GvHD, ATG (ATG- F or 
thymoglobulin) may be used at the discret ion of the treating physician; however, th e proportion of 
subjects receiving ATG shall co mprise no m ore than approximately 25% of the total number of 
subjects enrolled into the study. Subjects who have received or are receiving prophyla ctic agents 
other than those listed in the inclusio n criteria,including approved or other invest igational
therapi es, are excluded. 
6.2.2 Dose Selection
All subjects will receive a combination of CNI (CYS or TAC) and MTX or MMF [41-43] ,which is
commo nly prescribed as prophylaxis of GvHD for subject s undergo ingallo-HSCT. ATG (ATG -F 
or thymoglo bulin) may be included as noted in Section 6.2.1 .
The vedo lizumab dose and schedule for this phase 3 study are 300 m g on Days -1, +13, +41, +69, 
+97, +125, and +153. This dose selection is based on safet y, efficacy  and PK data from  Study
Vedolizumab-1015 and the IBD program. The dosing regimen selected is est imated to provide 
serum  concentrati ons above 10 μg/m L for 180 days. PK data from Study Vedo lizumab -1015 
indicates that the PK of vedo lizumab in subject s wit h GvHD who received 300 mg is similar to 
that of subject s with IBD . CCI

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 07
EudraCT Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
The 300 mg dose of vedolizumab was well tolerated in subjects in Study Vedo lizumab -1015 
without delay  of engraft ment (m edian 1 4days for the vedolizumab 300 mg cohort) or new safety 
concerns. Repeated vedolizumab dos ing during the 6 months after the allo -HSCT is proposed, 
during which time subjects are at the highest risk of developing intest inal aGvHD. 
The same vedo lizumab dose regimen to be administered to adults (aged ≥18 y ears) planned to 
undergo allo -HSCT for prophylaxis of intest inal aGvHD isconsidered appropriate for 
administration to adolescents aged 12 years and greater and weighing ≥30 kg . In phase 3 studies in 
adults wi th IBD, body  weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety  data from these studies showed 
no difference in the incidence of TEAE sanda similar safety  profile in adult s receiving
vedo lizumab IV Q8W or Q4W (Section4.3). A populat ion PK model was developed using pooled 
phase 1, 2, and 3 study data fro m the vedo lizumab IV clinical program in adults with UC or CD to 
characterize the PK o f vedo lizumab and to assess the impact of patient demographic 
characterist ics (eg, age an d body  weight) on PK. This model indicated that weight -based dosing is 
not required and that age was not a clinically meaningful covariate (S ection 4.3). In addit ion, 
resul ts from Study  Vedolizumab -1015 indicated that the PK of vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults
with aGvHD was similar to that in adul ts wi th UC or CD .
6.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study or Investigational Site
6.3.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study
The study  will be co mpleted as planned unless 1 or more of the fo llowing criteria are satisfied that

20.Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy wit hin 2 y ears bef ore the first dose of study  drug 
or previ ously diagnosed with another malignancy  and have any  evidence of residual disease. 
Subjects with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are not excluded if 
they have undergone complete resection. 
7.3 Medications and Treatments
7.3.1 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Treatments While On- study
Any invest igational agent (other than vedo lizumab), including agents other than 
corticoster oids for treatm ent of  GvHD.
Checkpo int inhibitors. 
Any therapy  for aGvHD p rophylaxis other than that specified in the inclusio n criteria 
(Appendix B). Should 1 of the GvHD prophylaxis agents specified in the inclusion criteria be 
discontinued due to toxicit y and an al ternative agen t started, the subject may be permitted to 
remain on study drug after consultation wit h the medical mo nitor.
All live vaccines fro m 30 day s before randomizat ion to at least 6 months after the last dose of 
study drug.
Either approved or invest igational monoclonal antibody  or equivalent biologics for the 
treatm ent of other condi tions (eg, rheum atoid arthri tis), other than localized injections (eg, 
intra-ocular inject ions for wet m acular degenerat ion).
Subjects m ust be instructed not to take any  medicati ons including over -the-counter products, 
without first consul ting wi th the investi gator.
7.3.2 Permitted Medications and Treatments
Other medications considered necessary  for the safety  and well -being of the subject may be 
administered at the discretion o f the invest igator. Corticosteroids may be init iated for treatment of 
GvHD; however, if lower intestinal tract aGvHD occurs, study drug must be discont inued (Sectio n 
7.4). Any conco mitant m edicat ions added or discontinued during the st udy should be recorded on 
the eCRF.
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence, such premedicat ion 
is unlikely  to be nec essary  or beneficial. At the discretion of the investigator, however, subjects 
may be administered premedicat ion beforeany study  drug administration. Use of topical
anesthet ic (eg, lidocain e, tetracaine , prilocaine ) is recommended for blood draws or IV in sertions 
for the comfort of subjects aged 12 to <18 years. This use will notbe recorded as a concomitant 
medicat ion. Corti costeroi ds, if given as a premedication, should be limited to the day  of
administration.

7.4 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject 
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from the study  or study
medicat ion shoul d be recorded in the eCRF using the fo llowing categori es.
The subject has experienced an AE that requires ET because cont inued partic ipation imposes 
an unacceptable risk to the subject’s healt h or the subject is unwilling to continue because of 
that AE, such as:
PML or tuberculosis
LFT Abnormalit ies
Study  medication shoul d be discont inued immediately with appropriate clinical fo llow-up 
(including repeat laboratory  tests, until a subject’s laboratory profile has returned to 
norm al/baseline status, see Section 9.3.15.3 ), if the fo llowing ci rcumstan ces occur at any
time during study  medicati on treatm ent:
–Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT )or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) m ore than 
8times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ), or
–ALT or AST more than 5times the ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks, or
–ALT or AST m ore than 3 times the ULN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin 
more than 2 times the ULN or internat ional normalized rat io (INR) more than 1.5 with 
no al ternate eti ology, or
–ALT or AST more than 3 times the ULN with appearance of fat igue, nausea, vo miting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, with fever and rash.
Significant protocol  deviat ion. The discovery  after the first dose of study  medicat ion that the 
subject failed to meet protocol entry  criteria or di d not adhere to protocol req uirements, and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’ s heal th.
Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 
were unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented . 
Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject wishes to withdraw fro m the study ,or the subject’s 
parent/legally  acceptable representative wishes to have the subject wi thdrawn from the study . 
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, 
where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded (ie, withdrawal due to an 
AE or l ack of  efficacy). 
Study  terminat ion. The sponsor, IRB, IEC, or regulatory  agency terminates the study .
Pregnancy. The subject is found t o be pregnant. 
Note: If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately. The procedure is described in Sect ion9.3.20 .

7.5 Procedures for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject
The investigator may discontinue a subject’s study  parti cipat ion at any t ime during the study when 
the subject meets the study termination criteria described in Section 7.4. In addition, a subject may 
discont inue his or her participat ion without giving a reason at any time during the study . Shoul d a 
subject’s participat ion be di scontinued, the primary  criterion for terminat ion must be recorded by
the invest igator. In addit ion, efforts should be made to perform all procedures scheduled for the ET 
visit, the final safet y visit,and the 6-month LTFU safet y survey . Discont inued or withdrawn 
subjects will not be replaced.
The consequence of study  withdrawal  is that no new informat ion will be col lected from the 
withdrawn subject and added to the exist ing data or any database.

8.2 Treatment Assignment and Dispensing Procedures
Only subjects who meet all of the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria are eligible 
for randomizat ion.Subjects will receive the treatment for the assigned treatment arm and 
according to the study  schedule.
The invest igator or invest igator’s designee will access the IRT at screening to obtain the subject 
study  number. The investigator or the invest igator’s designee will ut ilize the IRT to randomize the 
subject into the study. The medication ident ificat ion (ID) number of the invest igational drug to be 
dispensed will then be provided by the IRT by email notificat ion to the unblinded site 
pharmacist/nurse. To maintain the blind the IRT will ensure the investigator or designee is 
unaware of a medica tion ID assi gned to the subject. If sponsor -supplied drug is lost or damaged, 
the unblinded site staff can request a replacement from IRT. 
At subsequent drug -dispensing visits, the investigator or designee will again contact the IRTto 
request addit ional invest igational drug for a subject. The medicat ion ID number of the 
investigat ional drug to be dispensed will be provided by  the IRT to the unblinded site staff only.
The IRT will include all required informat ion as a separate entry  for each subject to wh om
sponsor- supplied drug is dispensed.
Addit ional information is provided in the study  manual. 
8.3 Investigation Blind Maintenance
The investigational drug blind will be maintained using the IRT. All subjects and study personnel 
except for those directly inv olved wi th study  drug preparati on will be blinded to study  drug 
assignment for the ent ire study .
8.4 Unblinding Procedure
The invest igational drug blind shall not be broken by the investigator unless informat ion 
concerning the investigational drug is necessar y for the m edical treatment of the subject. In the 
event of a medical emergency , the investi gational drug blind can be broken without permissio n 
from the sponsor, al though the m edical m onitor shoul d be contacted immediately . In non -urgent 
cases (ie, a non -medical emergency), the medical mo nitor must be contacted before the subject is 
unblinded. 
For unblinding a subject, the invest igational drug blind can be obtained by the invest igator, by
accessing the IRT. Addit ional informat ion for unblinding a subject is provided in the study 
manual. 
Subjects discont inuing study  parti cipat ion for any  other reason will be kept blind.
The sponsor must be notified as soon as possible if the investigational drug blind is broken. The 
date, time, and reason the blind is brok en must be recorded in the source documents and the same 
inform ation (except the time) must be recorded on the eCRF.

8.5 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor- Supplied Drugs
Drug supplies will be counted and reconciled at the site before being returned to the sponsor or 
designee or destroy ed at the site. The si te will  maintain source documents in addit ion to enteri ng 
data into the IRT.
The blinded invest igator or blinded designee and the unblinded investigational pharmacist or 
designee must ensure that the sponsor- supplied drug is used in accordance with the protocol and is 
dispensed only to subjects enro lled in the study. To document appropriate use of sponsor -supplied 
drug, the unblinded invest igational pharmacist or designee must maintain records of all 
sponsor- supplied drug delivery to the site, site inventory, dispensat ion and use by each subject, and 
return to the sponsor or designee.Upon receipt of sponsor -supplied drug, the unblinded invest igational pharmacist or designee must
verify the contents of the shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the 
quant ity is correct, and the medication is in good condit ion. If quantit y and condi tions are 
acceptable, the unblinded invest igational pharmacist or designee should acknowledge th e recei pt 
of the shipment in the IRT. If there are any discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual 
product received, Takeda must be contacted to resolve the issue. The packing list should be filed in 
the invest igator’s essent ial docum ent file.
The invest igator must ensure that 100% accoun tabili ty is maintained for all sponsor -supplied 
drugs received and dispensed during his or her entire participat ion in the study . The unblinded 
investigat ional pharmacist will maintain 100% accountabilit y, including but not limited to:
Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory  matches docum ented inventory .
Verifying that the log is completed for the medicatio n ID used to prepare each dose.
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that requir ed fields are com pleted accurately  and legibly .
Continuously mo nitoring expiration dates, if expiry  date is provi ded.
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor must be notified immediately.
The IRT will include all required info rmation as a separate entry  for each subject to whom 
sponsor- supplied drug is dispensed.
The unblinded invest igational pharmacist or designee will acknowledge all sponsor- supplied 
drugs in the IRT and maintain the drug accountability logs as described in the unblinded pharmac y 
manual. The fo llowing information will be recorded at a minimum: protocol number and tit le, 
name of investigator, site identifier and number, descript ion of sponsor -supplied drugs, date and 
amount dispensed, and the initials, seal, or signature of the person dispensing the drug.
Before site closure or at appropriate intervals, a representative fro m the sponsor or its designee will 
perform  sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y and reconciliat ion before sponsor -supplied drugs 
are returned to the sponsor or its designee for destruction or destroy ed at the si te. Accountabilit y

In addit ion, using the approved product informat ion for the medici nal products used as part of a 
subject’s routine care, including the condit ioning regimen, invest igators should advise subjects on 
the appropriate duration for use of contraception after the last dose of such medicinal products. 
8.7 Management of Clinical Events
8.7.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedicat ion 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence such 
prem edicat ions are unlikely to be nece ssary or beneficial. At the discret ion of the invest igator, 
however, subjects may  be administered premedication before any  study  drug administration. 
Corti costeroi ds, if given as a premedication, should be limited to the day  of administration. Study 
drug s hould be administered by a healt h care professio nal prepared to manage hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and medical support 
measure should be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed du ring the infusio n 
and until the infusio n is co mplete. 
Subjects, parents , or legal ly acceptable representative sshoul d be instructed to report the 
development of rash, hives, pruritus, flushing, urticaria, etc. that may represent an IRR to study 
medicat ion. If signs or symptom s of IRR are observed during the administration of study  drug, i t 
shoul d be immediately discontinued and the subject treated as medically appropriate. In the case of 
a mild react ion, study  drug administrati on m ay be reinit iated (with a ppropri ate prem edicat ion) at 
the discret ion of the invest igator. Subjects with severe or serious IRRs (eg, stridor, angioedema, 
life-threatening change in vital signs) must be withdrawn from the study .
In all cases of administration- related reacti on, the m edical m onitor m ust be informed as soon as 
practi cal. The disposit ion of subjects with less severe IRRs should be discussed with the project 
clinician. 
8.7.2 Leukopenia or Lymphopenia
Leukocy te and lymphocy te counts will be mo nitored for all subjects with a hem atological  panel
(see Section 9.3.15.3 ) and the use of prophylact ic myelo id growth factors (ie, granulocy te-colony 
stimulat ing factor) may be started with the product, dose, and route of administration at the 
discreti on of  the treating inst itution. If engraft ment has not occurred by  Day +21 ( defined as 
absolute neutrophil count >500/ mm3for 3 consecutive days or > 2000/ mm3for 1 day ), it is 
recommended that prophylact ic myelo id growth factors be started. Failure to engraft by  Day +28 
will be considered as primary  graft failure and shoul d be reported as an SAE, and study  drug 
shoul d be discont inued.
8.7.3 CMV Colitis
Regular assessments will include symptom -directed assessment for GI toxicit y and monitoring for 
CMV reactivation per institutional standards. Preempt ive CMV therapy will be init iated per 
institutional standards. Subjects with act ive CMV colit is during screening will  be excluded from

perform ed. Subjects with confirmed CMV colit is during the study will require dosing ho ld, and the 
medical monitor should be contacted bef ore resuming study  drug . In subject s suspected of having 
aGvHD for who m the cause of posttransplantation diarrhea and/or enterocolit is is unclear, the 
subject will require endoscopy and histologic analyses o f intestinal biopsy specimens as clinically 
appro priate.
8.7.4 Malignancy
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the study , including rel apse of primary  disease 
will be reported as SAEs. Study  drug shoul d be discontinued ,and subjects will cont inue to be 
followed as specified per the SOE ( Appendix A). 
8.7.5 Liver Injury 
For subjects with normal baseline ALT/AST, a subject noted to have ALT or AST elevated more 
than 3times the ULN for2 consecut ive weeks , the abnorm ality shoul d be recorded as an AE. In 
addition, an LFT Increases eCRF must be co mpleted providing addit ional informat ion on relevant 
recent history , risk factors, clinical signs and symptoms and results of any  addi tional diagnosti c 
tests performed.
For sub jects who had elevated ALT or AST at baseline, if elevat ions of ALT or AST are more than 
2times the baseline value orALT or AST is more than 5 times the ULN, the abnormalit y should be 
recorded as an AE and reported via the LFT Increases eCRF. 
For both o f these scenarios, study  drug will be held until further discussion wit h the m edical 
monitor. T he invest igator must contact the m edical monitor for discussi on of  the relevant subject 
details and possible alternat ive etio logies, such as acute viral hepat itis A, B,or E, reactivat ion of 
hepat itis B, or acute liver GvHD or other acute liver disease or medical history/concurrent medical 
condi tionsbefore subsequent dosing . Foll ow-up laborator y tests as described in Sect ion9.3.15.3
must al so be performed. 
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST mo re than 3times the ULN and total bilirubin more than 
2times the ULN for which an alternat ive et iology has not been ident ified, the event should be 
recorded as an SAE and reported as per Section 10.2.2 ; treatment with study drug should be 
immediately  held. The invest igator must contac t the medical monitorto discuss alternate 
etiologies.In addit ion, an LFT Increases eCRF must be completed. 
In addit ion, an event meet ing any o f the criteria listed for LFT Abnormalit ies (Sect ion7.4) should 
be reported as an SAE.

subjects shoul d be m onitored peri odically  (at the minimum  every  3months) by determinati on of
HBV serology and HBV DNA. All subjects who meet any  ofthe following criteria will  be 
immediately  discontinued from  study drug. All reactivat ion events should be reported as an S AE.
Detectable HBV DNA.
Reverse seroconversio n from HBsAgto HBsAg.
Jaundice.
8.7.7 Other Clinical Events
8.7.7.1 Serious Infections
Subjects who, in the opinion of the invest igator, have serious infections will be m onitored during 
the study. Subjects with seriousinfect ions, including viral, fungal, and bacterial infect ions, will be 
treated as clinically indicated. Interventions may include ant ibiotic treatment, if appropriate and/or 
discontinuat ion of conco mitant immuno modulators. Bl ood, sputum , urine, cerebrospinal fluid, 
and/or stool cultures should be obtained as appropriate for the detection and diagnosis of infect ion.
Study  drug shoul d be withheld, and the medical monitor should be contacted before resuming 
study  drug. Terminating study  drug administration may be considered as described in Sect ion7.5.
8.7.7.2 PML
All subjects will be screened for new neuro logical si gns and symptoms potentially consistent with 
PML using the PML subject ive checklist (see Section 9.3.11) before dosing with study  drug. Any 
subjects in who msigns or symptoms o f PML are reported will undergo object ive testing. If a 
subject demonstrates a neurologic deficit related to PML upon administration of the PML 
checklist, no further doses of study drug should be administered to that subject. The subject should 
be referred to the study  neuro logist for further testing and the sponsor must be notified of this 
action.
Subsequent doses of study  drug will be administered only if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively 
excluded, as described in the Risk Minimizat ion Action Pl an for PML ( RAMP )algori thm.
8.7.7.3 Donor Leukocyte Infusion

9.3.4 Medical History
During the screening period, a complete medical history  will be com piled for each subject . The 
history  will emphasize the background and progress of t he subject ’s malignancy and include a 
descript ion of prior therapies for it. In addit ion, conco mitant m edicat ions will be recorded as 
specified in Section 9.3.13 .
9.3.5 Physical Examination
A baseline physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment before the first dose of study  drug ) 
will consist of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) eyes; (2) ears, nose, throat; (3) cardiovascular 
system; (4) respiratory  system; (5) GIsystem; (6) dermatologic system; (7) extremities; 
(8)musculo skeletal  system; (9) nervous sys tem; (10) lymph nodes; and (11) other. All subsequent 
physical examinat ions should assess clinically significant changes from the assessment before the
first dose ofstudy  drug . 
Any physical examinat ion finding that is assessed by the investigator as a clinically significant 
change (worsening) compared to baseline value will be considered an AE and will be recorded and 
monitored as described in Section10.2.
9.3.6 Weight and Height
A subject should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and without 
shoes, socks, or hats. The Takeda standard for collecting weight is kilograms (kg) with 1 decimal 
place. 
Height shoul d be recorded to the nearest tenth of a cent imeter (if possible). Height may be 
measured using a wall- mounted stadi ometer using replicated measurements (average of 
3measurements). Height will be measured during screening (within 30 days before the first dose 
of study drug on Day  -1) and at EOS.
9.3.7 Vital Signs
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, heart rate, respirat ion rate, and body temperature 
to be determined at the times specified in the SOE (Appendix A). On dosing days, vital signs are

aged 12to<16 years will be assessed at the time points specified in the SOE (Appendix A). 
9.3.10 Assessment of GvHD
aGvHD will be staged according to the extent and severit y of each organ invo lvement (Stages 0-4) 
on the basis of object ive clinical criteria (Appendix F). These stages are then co mbined to generate 
an overall clinical grade, which are Grades 0 through IV in the modified Glucksberg system 
(Appendix F), MAGIC system , and Grades A through D in the International Bone Marrow 
Transplant Registry Database (IBMTR) system ( Appendix F). Glucksberg and IBMTR performed 
similarly  in explaining variabilit y in OS by  grade in aGvHD. aGvHD events will be recorded and 
staged according to aGvHD Clinical Stage criteria ( Appendix F) and graded per t he IBMTR 
system  in this study unless otherwise noted .
In subjects suspected of having intestinal aGvHD, endoscopy with rectal biopsy is reco mmended, 
and infectious etio logies (eg, C.difficile , CMV colit is) shoul d be evaluated .
9.3.11 PML Checklist
Clinic staff will administer the age-appropriate subject ive PML checklist during screening to 
exclude subjects with posi tive responses fro m enrolling into the study . The subject ive PML 
checklist will be administered (before dosing, if applicable) at the time po ints specified in the SOE 
(Appendix A)to probe for symptoms suggest ive of PML. The checklist must be administered by 
appropriate clinic staff as it is not designed to be com pleted by a subject , parent, or legally 
acceptable repre sentative . Ifa new and persistent change(s) is reported per the subject ive checklist , 
the corresponding objective test(s) must be com pleted ,and the subject may be referred to a 
neuro logist for a f ull evaluat ion as described in the RAMP algorithm. The PML checklist and the 
RAMP algorithm and tool s are included in the Study Manual . SeeSecti on10.7 for addi tional 
details regarding the RAMP program.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTEs
A PTE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has signed informed 
consent to participate in a study  but before administrati on of  any study  medicat ion; it does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study  participati on.
10.1.2 AEs
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject administered a drug; 
it does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship wit h this treatm ent.
An AE therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign ( eg, a clinically significant abnorm al 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is considered related to the m edicinal product. In 
addition, drug -device AEs related to qualit y or malfunct ion will be collected.
10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent

abnorm al value are not considered an intervent ion. In addi tion, repeated or addit ional 
noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluation or mo nitoring of an abnormalit y is not 
considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Preexist ing condit ions:
Preexist ing condi tions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. Baseline evaluat ions (eg, 
laboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related to study
procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study  medicat ion). Invest igators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a subject has a preexist ing episodic condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) any occurrence of an 
episode should only be captured as an AE if th e episodes beco me more frequent, serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion should only be captured as an AE if occurring to a greater extent to 
that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complicatio n of an AE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complication should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE, the event should be captured once wit h 
the maximum sever ity recorded.

Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (eg, as 
an emergency) due to a worsening of the preexist ing condition, the worsening of the condit ion 
shoul d be captured appropriately as an AE. Complications result ing fro m any planned surger y 
shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures perform ed where there i s no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing fro m an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical respo nse (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as an 
AE. The invest igator must make the dist inction between exacerbation of preexist ing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested si de effects are NOT considered 
AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any manifested side 
effects will be considered AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.

more severe).
3.Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see 
clarificati onin the paragraph in Sect ion10.2 on planned hospitalizat ions).
4.Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined as a

10.1.6 Severity of AEs
All AEs, including clinically  significant treat ment-emergent laboratory  abnorm alities, will be 
graded according to National Cancer Inst itute Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events , 
versio n 5.0. Grade descript ions are:
1.Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observat ions only ; intervent ion 
not indicated .
2. Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervent ion indicated; limit ing age- appropri ate 
instrum ental  activities of daily living.
3.Severe or m edically  significant but not immediately  life-threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongati on of hospitalizat ion indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living.
4.Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
5.Fatal  AE: an event that results in the death of the subject.
10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of ea ch AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categories:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including 
the course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot 
be ruled out, although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible .
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a drug 
and/o r that can reasonably be explained by other factors, such as underlying diseases, 
complications, concomitant drugs and concurrent treatments
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures s hould be determined for all AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject and/or 
physician.

10.1.10 Stop Date
The stop date of the AE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died . 
10.1.11 Frequency
Episodi c AEs (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecut ive days are 
intermittent. All other events are continuous . 
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Medication
Drug withdrawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stopping a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study medication was stopped for a reason oth er than the particular AE (eg, 
the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing wit h study  medicat ion was already
stopped before the onset of the AE).
Dose Interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the norm al range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/ symptoms or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not recovered/not
resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal  –AEs that are considered the cause of deat h. 
Unknown –the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospi tal change or residence 
change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study .

10.3 Follow -Up of SAEs
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs must be reported (see Section 10.4 for the period of observat ion) by 
theinvest igator to the Takeda Gl obal Pharmacovigilance depart mentor desi gnee wi thin 24 hours 
of becoming aware of the event. This will be done by  transmi tting an electronic data capture 
(EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, then a facsimile or email 
of the com pleted Takeda paper -based SAE form will be sent. A sample of the paper- based SAE 
form and processing directions are in the study  manual . Inform ation in the SAE report or form 
must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF.
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, then the 
investigator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based SAE form if an EDC 
SAE report is not feasible) or provide other docu mentation immediately within 24 hours of receipt. 
Copi es of any  relevant data from the hospi tal notes (eg, ECGs, l aboratory  tests, di scharge 
summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.
All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il resolution or perm anent outcome of the event. The timelines 
and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
10.4 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study as fo llows:
AEs will be collected from the first dose of study  drug through 18weeks after administration 
of the l ast dose of study  drug and recorded in the eCRFs. 
Only s erious PTEs will be collected and reported to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance 
departm ent or desi gnee fro m the time of signing of the ICF up to the first dose of study  drug 
and recorded in the eCRF.
Related and unrelated SAEs will be collected and reported to the Takeda Global

further provisio n to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reacti onswill be submitted to the regulatory authorit ies as expedited report swithin 7 days for fata l 
and life -threatening events and within 15 days for other serious events, unless otherwise required 
by national regulat ions. The sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for other s afety issues 
where these might materially  alter the current benefit- risk assessment of an investigational 
medicinal product or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the invest igational medicinal 
product ’s administration or in the overall conduct of the study . The invest igational site also will
forward a copy  of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accordance wit h nat ional 
regul ations. 
10.7 RAMP Program
Subjec ts who have undergone HSCT are immunocompromised because of underlying disease, 
prior therapies, HSCT condit ioning, and GvHD prophylaxis and treatment. The baseline risk of 
PML in the populat ion of subject s who have undergone allo -HSCT for the treatment of
malignancy can be est imated at 35.4 per 100,000 person- years (95% CI: 0.90, 197.29) compared 
with 0.2 per 100,000 subject s with autoimmune di seases who did not have HIV or malignancy
(including subject s with IBD) [46,47] . To minimize the risk of the development of PML in 
subject s treated with vedolizumab, the sponsor, with input fro m PML experts, has developed the 
RAMP. The complete descript ion of the RAMP program, including materials and instructions for 
its implementati on and m onitoring, i s included in the s tudy manual .
The RAMP is focused on early  clinical detecti on and management of that specific safet y risk, 
including the discont inuat ion of s tudy drug, if applicable. Subjec ts are assessed for si gns and 
symptoms of PML before the administration of each dose of study  drug using a n age -appropri ate
PML subj ective symptom checklist. Subjec ts with a posit ive PML subjec tive symptom checklist at 
any time after enro llment in a vedo lizumab clinical study will be evaluated according to a 
prespecified algorithm (the PML Case Evaluat ion Algori thm). The next dose of vedo lizumab will 
be held unt il the evaluation is complete and resul ts are available. Subsequent doses of vedo lizumab
will be administered only  if the possibilit y of PML is definit ively excluded, as described in the 
RAMP algorithm. An independent adjudicat ion committee (IAC) has been ident ified as part of the 
RAMP pro gram to review new neuro logical signs and symptoms potentially consistent with PML, 
and will provide input regarding subject evaluat ion and management as defined in the IAC charter.
To ensure success of the RAMP program, site personnel will be trained to recognize the features of 
PML, and subject s/parents/legally  acceptable representati ves will be trained to report specific 
neuro logical signs and symptoms without delay. Educational materials for teaching site personnel 
and subject s/parents/legally  acceptable representatives about PML and the RAMP procedures will 
be distributed to all sites and are included in the s tudy manual. Formal teaching and training will be

12.0 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING
The full details o f procedures for data handling w ill be docum ented in the data management plan. 
If selected for coding, AEs, m edical  history , and concur rent condit ions will be coded using the 
Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA). Drugs will be coded using the World 
Health Organizat ion Drug Dictionary .
12.1 eCRFs 
Com pleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an ICF/assent .
The sponsor or its designee will supply invest igative sites with access to eCRFs and will make 
arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRF .These forms are used to transmit
the informat ion collected in the performance of this study  to the sponsor , CRO partners, and 
regulatory  authori ties. Invest igative sites must complete eCRFs in Englis h.
After complet ion of the entry process, com puter l ogic checks will be run to ident ify items such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may  be issued by Takeda 
personnel (or designee) and will be answered by  the si te.
Any change of, modificat ion of,or addit ion to the data on the eCRFs shoul d be made by the 
investigator or appropriate site personnel . Corrections to eCRFs are recorded in an audit trail that 
captures the old informat ion, the new information, contact informat ionof the person m aking the 
correcti on, the date the correction was made, and the reason for the change.
The principal invest igator must review the eCRF sfor com pleteness and accuracy  and must si gn 
and date the appropriate eCRF s as indicated. Furthermore, the principal invest igator must retain 
full responsibilit y for the accuracy and authent icity of all data entered on the eCRF s.
eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptabilit y at the study  site during peri odic visi ts 
by study monitors. The sponsor (or designee )will be permitted to review the subject’s medical and 
hospi tal records pertinent to the study to ensure accuracy of the eCRF s. The co mpleted eCRF s are 
the sole property  of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmental healt h or regulatory authorities, 
without wri tten permissio n of the sponsor.
12.2 Reco rd Retention
The invest igator agrees to keep the records stipulated in Section 12.1 and those documents that 
include (but are not limited to) the study -specific documents, the ID log of all participat ing 
subjects, medical records, temporary  media such as thermal -sensit ive paper, source worksheets, all 
original  signed and dated ICFs /assen ts, subject authorizat ion forms regarding the use of personal 
healt h informat ion (if separate from the ICFs), electronic copies o f eCRFs including the audit trail, 
and detailed records of drug disposit ion to enable evaluat ions or audits fro m regulatory aut horities 
and the sponsor (or designees). Any source documentation printed on degradable thermal -sensit ive 
paper should be photocopied by  the si te and filed wi th the ori ginal  in the subject’s chart to ensure 
long-term legibilit y. Furthermore, ICH E6 Section 4.9.5 requires the invest igator to retain essent ial

13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before database lock. This 
docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all study  objectives.
The primary analysis for efficacy and safety data will be performed at the end of treatment (EOT), 
when all subjects have co mpleted Day +180, wi thdrawn from  the study , or ET , or when the 
planned number of primary endpo int events as determined by the sample size adaptation rule in the 
interim analysis are accrued. 
To protect the integrit y of the study  and ensure the unbiased study  conduct from  EOT to EOS, a 
selected group of Takeda personnel will be ident ified to conduct the unblinded primary analysis. 
Study  investigators, participating subjects, and sponsor personnel responsible for conduct of the 
remainder of the study  will remain blinded. Details of unblin ding for primary  analysis will be 
provi ded in the SAP and/or data access management plan (DAMP). The EOS analysis will be 
perform ed after the final database lock at EOS.
A targeted data review will be conducted before database lock. This review will assess the 
accuracy  and com pleteness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the 
planned statistical methods. Data may also be summarized descript ively by age group (aged 
≥18years and ≥12 years to <18 y ears) . 
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The popul ations used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Full analysis set (FAS): Following the intent- to-treat principle, t he FAS will include all 
subject s who are randomized ,receive at least 1 dose of the treatment , and undergo allo -HSCT . 
The analysis will be based on the treatment to which the subjects are randomized.
Per-protocol populat ion is defined to include all rando mized subject s who received any
amount of blinded study  drug and have no significant protocol deviat ions. All decisio ns to 
exclude subjec ts from the per -protocol populat ion dataset will be made before to the study  is 
un-blinded. Analyses using the per- protocol population may be provided as a sensit ivity 
analysis.
Safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Subjects 
in this set will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received.

13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Baseline and demographic informat ion will be listed and summarized by treatment group and for 
the overall FAS. For continuous variables, the summary  will consist of descri ptive stat istics 
(number of subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum). For categorical variables, the 
summary will consist of number and percentage of subjects in each category.
Medical history and concurrent medical condit ions will be summarized by system o rgan class and 
preferred term. Medicat ion history  and conco mitant medicat ions will be summarized by preferred 
term.
13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
All statistical testing will be performed at a 2- sided 0.05 level o f significance. To control the 
overall Type I error rat e for the comparison between vedolizumab and placebo groups for the 
primary  and secondary efficacy endpo ints, a gatekeeping procedure will be used. Specifically, the 
statist ical test ing of the first secondary efficacy endpoint will only be performed if the treatm ent 
difference for primary efficacy  endpoi nt is stati stically significant. T he next secondary efficacy 
endpo int will only  be tested if the treatment difference for the first secondary  efficacy endpo int is 
significant, and so on for each subsequent s econdary  efficacy endpo int.
The order of the statistical test ing for the key  secondary  endpoints is:
1. Intestinal aGvHD -freeandrelapse-free survival by Day +180.
2.Grade C -D aGvHD -free (any organ invo lvement) survival by Day +180.
3.NRM by Day +180.
4.OS by  Day +180.
5.Grade B -DaGvHD -free (any organ invo lvement) survival by Day +180.
All time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed using log -rank tests. Cox proportional hazard 
models, stratified by randomizat ion strata , will also be fit with hazard ratios reported. Al l 
dichotom ous efficacy endpoints will  be analyzed using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel tests for ri sk 
differences, stratified by rando mizat ion strata ; for dichotomous endpo ints, subjects with a missing 
outcom e will be included in the analysis based on nonresponde r imputati on, ie, treated as having 
the undesirable outcome .

13.1.6 Safety Analysis
Safety analysis will be perform edusing the safet y analysis set. No statist ical inference will be 
made for safet y analyses. 
The number and percentage of subjects with treatment- emergent AEs (defined as any AEs newly 
occurring or worsening fro m the first dose and 18 weeks after last dose of study  treatm ent, 
regardl ess of rel ationship to study  drug), AESIs (ie, serious infect ions, PML, malignancies, liver 
injury , infusi on react ions, inject ion site react ions), and SAEs thatoccur on or after the first dose 
date and through E OS will be summarized by MedDRA Sy stem  Organ Class, Hi gh Level Term, 
and Preferred Term overall, by  severi ty, and by relationship to study  drug for each treatment 
group. Separate summaries will also be generated for treatment- related AEs overall and by 
severity. Change from  baseline in clinical laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will  be summarized by
treatm ent group.
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for ET
One interim analysis for futilit y and sample size re -estimat ion is planned for this study, which will 
occur after approximately 30 of the targeted primary  endpoint events (ie, approximately 44 
events) have been accrued. The analysis will be performed by an independent statist ical center in a 
manner that maintains the blinding to the study  team , the invest igato rs, and the subjects. The 
interim analysis results will be presented to the DMC but will not be shared with the sponsor. 
Specific criteria for DMC recommendations will be provided in the DMC charter. The fut ility 
stopping is considered nonbinding.
If 148 p rimary  endpoint events are accrued before all subjects have completed Day  +180 or 
dropped out, the primary analysis for efficacy may be performed at that time.Details o f Type I error control fo llowing sample size re -estimat ion will be provided in the SAP.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
Assuming the event rate for the primary endpo int is 34.1% for the placebo group and 21.8% for the 
vedo lizumab group and the rate of loss -to-follow-up is 10% for both groups, a sample size of 279
subject s per group (558 subject s total ) is expected to generate 148 primary endpoint events and 
hence provi de 90% power at 2- sided 0.05 level of significance. Assuming the event rate for the 
first secondary  endpo int is 39.5% for the placebo group and 27.1% for the vedolizumab group, this 
sample size is expected to generate 177 events for the first secondary endpoint and hence provide 
approximately  86% power at 2 -sided 0.05 l evel of si gnificance .CCI

14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the s tudy site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and re cords. 
The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access to source documents by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (CRO) and by  the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or designee 
(as long as blindin g is not j eopardized) including, but not limited to, the invest igator’s binder, 
study  medicat ion, subject m edical records, informed consent/age- appropri ate assent
docum entati on, docum entation of  subject authori zation to use personal healt h informat ion (if 
separate from the ICFs/ age-appropri ateassents ), and review of eCRFs and associated source 
docum ents. It i s important that the invest igator and other study personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The investigator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio nor exclusio n criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or EC, as 
requi red). Si gnificant devi ations inc lude, but are not limited to, those that invo lve fraud or 
misconduct, i ncrease the healt h risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of the primary  study 
assessment.
The sponsor will assess any protocol deviat ion; if it is likely to affect to a significant degree the 
safet y and rights of  a subject or the reliabilit y and robustness o f the data generated, it will be 
reported to regulatory  authori ties as a seri ous breach of GCP and the protocol.
The invest igator should document all protocol deviations. 
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will  contact the si te in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies where laboratory samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibility that this study may be inspected by regulatory agencies, including 
those of foreign governments (eg, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the UK

15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This study will  be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual participants (ie, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or regional regulatory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance wi th the responsibilit ies of the invest igator that are listed in Appendix C.
The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state,federal , and/or local
requi rements of each participating regio n. The spons or or desi gnee will  require docum entati on 
noting all names and t itles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of 
the IRB or IEC has direct participat ion in this study, written notificat ion regarding his or her 
abstinence fro m voting must also be obtained. 
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB or IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the IB, a copy  of the ICF ,and where 
applicable, age -appropri ate assent(s) , and if applicable, subject recruit ment materials,
advertisements , and other documents required by all applicable laws and regulat ions must be 
submitted to a central or local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of the 
protocol  and subject informed consent /age-appropriate assent must be obtained and submitted to 
the sponsor or designee before commencement of the study , ie, before shipment of the 
sponsor- supplied drug or study -specific screening activit y. The IRB or IEC approval must refer to 
the study by its exact protocol title, number, and versio n date; ident ify versio ns of other documents 
(eg,ICF) reviewed; and state the approval date. If required by country or regional regulat ions or 
procedures, approval fro m the com petent regulatory  authori ty will be obtained before 
commencement of the study o r implementation of a substantial amendment. The sponsor will ship 
drug/notify site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy  of site regul atory  docum entati on 
and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio n from the competent authorit y to begin
the study . Until the site receives drug/notificat ion, no protocol activit ies, includ ing screening ,may 
occur.
Sites m ust adhere to all requirements stipulated by  their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may include 
notification to the IRB or IEC regarding protoc ol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruit ment
materi als intended for viewing by  subjects, l ocal safety reporting requirements, reports and 
updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals specified by the respect ive IRB or 
IEC, and submissio n of the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All IRB and IEC 
approval s and relevant docum entati on for these items must be provi ded to the sponsor (or 
designee).
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.

EudraCT Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent /age-appropriate assent documents will embody the elements of informed consent 
as described in the Declaration of Hel sinki and the ICH Gui delines for GCP and will be in 
accordance with all applicable laws and regulat ions. The ICF/age-appropri ate assent , subject 
authori zation form (if applicable), and subject info rmation sheet (if applicable) describe the 
planned and perm itted uses, transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h 
inform ation for purposes of conducting the study. The ICF/age-appropri ate assent and the subject 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of the study, its obj ectives, and 
potenti al risks and benefi ts, and the date informed consent is given. The ICF/age-appropriate 
assent will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw 
at any  time wi thout giving a reason an d without prej udice to his or her further medical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
ICF/age-appropri ate assent and, if applicable, the subject authorization form. The 
ICF/age-appropri ate assent, subject authorizat ion form  (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) must be approved by  both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor before use.
The ICF/age-appropri ate assent , subject authorization form (if applicable), and subject 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the 
prospective subject. It is the responsibilit y of the investigator to explain the detailed elements of 
the ICF/age-appropri ate assent , subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informatio n 
sheet (if applicable) to the subject. Informat ion shoul d be given in both oral and written form 
whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by  the IRB or IEC. If the subject is not 
capable of rendering adequa te wri tten inform ed consent /age-appropriate assent , then the subject’s 
legally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the subject in accordance wit h 
applicable laws and regulations.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable represent ative, must be given ample opportunit y to 
(1) inquire about details of the study  and (2) deci de whether to participate in the study . If the 
subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines that he or she will participate 
in the study, then the ICF/age-appropriate assent and subject authorization form (if applicable) 
must be signed and dated by the subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, at the 
time of consent and before the subject enters into the study . The subje ct or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative should be instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using a ballpo int pen wi th either blue or bl ack ink. The investigator must also sign and date the 
ICF/age-appropri ate assent and subj ect authori zation (if applicable) at the time of consent and 
before the subject enters into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f the 
investigator to sign to the extent permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the original ICF/age-approp riate assent , subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), 
and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent /age-appropriate assent
inthe subject’s m edical record. Copi es of the signed ICF/age-appropri ate assent , the signed

given to the subject.
All revised ICFs /age-appropri ate assents must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects or the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent/ age-appropriate assent was obtained should be recorded in 
the subjec t’s medical record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the revised 
ICF/age-appropri ate assent .
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Through out this study , a subject’s source data will be linked to the 
sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation only via a unique ID number. As permitted by 
all applicable laws and regulations, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth, and 
subject init ials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy  of the subject’s unique ID number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or desi gnee’s m onitor, representatives from  any
regulatory  authori ty (eg, US FDA, UK MHRA, Japan PMDA), the sponsor’s designated auditors, 
and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
docum ents) including, but not limited to, laboratory test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n and 
discharge summaries for hospital admissions occurring during a subject’s study participation, and 
autopsy  reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the speci fic authorizat ion 
of the subject as part of the informed consent /assent process (see Section 15.2).
Copi es of any  subject source documents that are pr ovided to the sponsor m ust have certain 
ident ifying personal informat ion rem oved, eg, subject nam e, address, and other ident ifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF.
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication 
The i nvestigator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived by 
the invest igator from the study . During and after the study , only the sponsor may make study

this secti on and the clinical study  site agreement. In the event of any discrepancy between the 
protocol  and the clinical study  site agreement, the clinical study  site agreement will prevail.
15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration
To ensure that information on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to com ply
with applicable laws, regulations, and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum, register intervent ional 
clinical trials it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or other publicly accessible 
websites on or before start of study , as defined by Takeda policy /standards. Takeda contact 
inform ation, along wi th invest igator’s cit y, state (for Americas investigators), country , and 
recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing. 
As needed, Takeda and invest igator/site contact information may be made public to support 
participant access to trials via registries. In certain situations/registries, Takeda may assist 
participants or potential part icipants in finding a clinical trial by helping them locate trial sites 
closest to thei r homes by providing the investigator name, address, and phone number via 
email/phone or other methods preferred by  callers requesting trial informat ion. Once subjects 
receive invest igator contact informat ion, they  may call the site requesting enrollment into the trial. 
The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the trial inquiries according to their established 
subject screening process. If the caller asks addit ional quest ions beyo nd the topic of trial 
enrollment, they should be referred to the sponsor.
Any investigator who objects to Takeda providing this informat ion to callers must provide Takeda 
with a wri tten noti ce request ing that their informat ion not be listed on the registry site. 
15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure
Takeda will post the results of clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, clinicaltrialsregister.eu for studi es conducted in the EU ,andother publicly accessible websites (including the Takeda 
corporate si te) and registries, as required by Takeda policy/ standards , applicable laws, and/or 
regul ations.
Data Sharing
The sponsor is committed to responsible sharing of clinical data with the goal of advancing 
medical science and improving subject care. Qualified independent researchers will be permitted 
to use data collected fro m subject s during the study to conduct addit ional scient ific research, which 
may be unrelated to the study  drug or the subjec t’s disease. The data provided to external 
researchers will not include informat ion that i dentifies subjects personally.
15.5 Insurance and Compensation for Injury
Each subject in the study  must be insured in accordance with the regulations applicable to the si te 
where the subject is participat ing. If a local underwriter is required, then the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee will obtain clinical study  insurance against the risk o f injury to clinical study subjects. 
Refer to the clinical study  site agreement regardi ng the sponsor’s policy on subject compensat ion

Appendix GAmendment 0 7Detailed Summary of Changes
The primary sect ionsof the protocol affected by the changes in Amendment 07 are indicated. The 
corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1:Clarificat ion ofthe descript ion of the disease to be treated in ado lescent subjects.
The primary  chang e occurs in Section 4.1.1 Disease to be Treated:
Added text: Allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplantation (allo -HSCT) i s an important and 
potenti ally curative therapy for many hematologic malignancies, but its use is limited 
by the m ajor com plicat ion of graft -versus -host di sease (GvHD) [1,2]. GvHD is a 
commo n complication o f allo-HSCT and a m ajor cause of m orbidi ty and m ortali ty. 
Acute GvHD results from the activation of alloreactive donor lymphocytes by 
histocompatibility antigens on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [3,4] . The 
risk of GvHD and its severit ydepends on several factors including recipient age, cell 
source, donor characteristics, degree of histocompatibilit y between the donor and 
recipient, the condi tioning regimen used, and the GvHD prophylaxis strategy  used 
[1,5-7]. Despite GvHD prophylaxis, approximately 40% to 70% of allallo-HSCT 
recipients (inclusive of pediatric and adult subjects) develop Grade 2 to 4 acute 
GvHD (aGvHD) [5,6,8 -11]. Approximately 45% to 56% of pediatric allo- HSCT 
(ranging from <1 to 20 years of age) from unrelated donors will develop Grade 2 
to 4 aGvHD , and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) appears to be greater in those 
pediatric patients with intestinal involvement [12-14] . Classical aGvHD occurs 
around the time of engraft ment (~10 -21 days fo llowing HSCT infusio n) up to Day
100[15] and late aGvHD occurs greater than 100 days from allo -HSCT [16,17] .
Rationale for Change :Clarified the presentati on of aGvHD thatoccurs commo nlyin both adul t 
and adolescent subjects.

Change 2:Addit ion of result s from nonclinical studi es related to inclusio n of ado lescent subjects .
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.1.2.1 Nonclinical :
Initial
wording:Several published key  nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the 
prevent ion of GvHD. Nonclinical pharmacology  studi es in m urine m odels of aGvHD 
suggest that the prevention of T cell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the 
α4β7/MAdCAM -1 interacti on, m ay prevent GvHD [30 -32]. In a mouse model of 
GvHD, whe n using donor cells sorted and purified based on the presence or absence o f 
α4β7, the absence o f α4β7+ cells great ly delayed and reduced the presence of GvHD 
[16]. Li ke these results, α4β7 expressio n on donor T cells has been shown to be 
important in the i nduct ion of GvHD [17]. By  blocking the infiltrat ion of cells into the 
intestines, vedo lizumab may act to reduce the severity and intensit y of intestinal 
GvHD. Extensive nonclinical evaluat ions of the cardiovascular, acute, local, 
subchronic, chronic, immun ologic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in 
pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbits and cyno molgus 
monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development. Nonclinical 
studi es also show that vedolizumab does not an tagoni ze 4β1 integrin [13]. 
Amended or new 
wording:Several published key  nonclinical studi es support the use of vedo lizumab for the 
prevent ion of GvHD. Nonclinical pharmacology  studi es in m urine m odels of aGvHD 
suggest that the prevention of T cell trafficking to GALT, via interruption of the 
α4β7/MAdCAM -1 interaction, may prevent GvHD [3032][33-35]. In a mouse mode l 
of GvHD, when using donor cells sorted and purified based on the presence or absence 
of α4β7, the absence of α4β7+ cells greatly delayed and reduced the presence of 
GvHD [16][19]. Like these results, α4β7 expressio n on donor T cells has been shown 
to be important in the induct ion of GvHD [17][20]. By blocking the infiltration of cells 
into the intestines, vedolizumab may act to reduce th e severit y and intensit y of 
intestinal GvHD. Extensive nonclinical evaluat ions of the cardiovascular, acute, local, 
subchronic, chronic, immuno logic, and reproductive toxicit y of vedo lizumab in 
pharmaco logically responsive species (New Zealand white rabbit s and cyno molgus 
monkeys) have been conducted and support its clinical development . Vedolizumab 
bound with similar affinity to rabbit, monkey, and human α4β7 integrin. 
Results from a 13- week toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys identified 
100 mg/kg (human equivalent dose 1920 mg in a 60-kg human) as the 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL). Inclusion of sexually immature 
monkeys in the 3 -and 6 month toxicit y studies support administration of 
vedolizumab in clinical studies with adolescent subjects (aged 12 years and 
greater ).
Nonclinical studies also show that vedolizumab does not antagonize 4β1 integrin
[13][3].

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 07
EudraCT Number: 2018 -002141 -1118 September 2019
Rationale for Change :Addit ion of results f rom nonclinical studies related to i nclusio n of 
adolescent subjects .
Change 3:Updated human experience as reported in the 9th development safety update report.
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.1.2.2 Human Experience:
Initial
wording:As of 19 Nov 2017, approximately 5224 subjects (healt hy or patients with UC or CD, 
aGvHD, pouchit is, or melano ma) have received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across 
all studies in the clinical development program. As reported in the development saf ety 
update report (dated 19 May 2017), cum ulative patient exposure to vedolizumab, in 
more than 5100 patients and including approximately 3 years of marketing
experience, was est imated at 114,071 patient -years. 
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable and cons istent safet y profile in clinical studies 
and in postmarket ing experience. Adverse react ions that have been reported fo llowing 
vedo lizumab administration include: nasopharyngitis, bronchit is, upper respiratory
tract infect ion, influenza, sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, 
rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremit ies, and pyrexia. Risks associated 
with vedolizumab treatment have been ident ified and categorized. Important 
ident ified risks are infusion -related reacti ons (IRRs ) and hypersensit ivity react ions, 
and upper respiratory infect ions, including bronchitis, influenza, nasopharyngit is, and 
sinusit is. Important potential risks are GI infections and systemic infect ions against 
which the gut constitutes a defensive barrier; serious infect ions, including 
opportunist ic infect ions such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); 
malignancy; and liver injury . 
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of 
the underlying UC or CD. Similar safet y pro files fo r vedo lizumab have been observed 
in subjects who received vedolizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects fo llowing 
long-term Q4W treatm ent for up to 8 y ears. 
In the phase 1b Study  Vedolizumab -1015, conducted in 24 subject s who underwent 
allo-HSCT, vedolizumab (at 75 or 300 mg on Days -1, +13, and +42) was added to 
standard GvHD prophylaxis (TAC and MTX) therapy. All subject s engrafted and no 
new safet y signals were reported.
Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated. Further detail on the safet y profile of 
vedo lizumab can be found in the current edit ion of the investigator’s brochure (IB).

Amended 
or new 
wording:As of 19 Nov May 2017 9, approximately 5224 6376 subjects (healthy or patients with 
UC or CD , aGvHD , pouchi tis, or melanoma , or undergoing allo- HSCT ) have 
received at least 1 dose of vedo lizumab across all studies in the clinical development 
program. As reported in the 9th development safety update report ( datedDSUR, for 
the period 20 May 2018 to 19 May 20172019), global cumulative postmarketing 
patient exposure to vedolizumab , in m ore than 5100 pati ents and including IV is 
estimated to be approximately 3 years of marketing experience, was estimated at 
114,071 336,400 patient-years. 
Vedolizumab has shown an acceptable and consistent safet y profile in clinical studies 
and in postmarket ing experience. Adverse react ions that have been reported fo llowing 
vedo lizumab admin istrati on include: nasopharyngitis, bronchit is, upper respiratory
tract infect ion, influenza, sinusit is, headache, oropharyngeal pain, cough, nausea, 
rash, pruritus, arthralgia, back pain, pain in extremit ies, and pyrexia , fatigue, and 
injection site react ions. Risks associated with vedolizumab treatment have been 
ident ified and categorized. Important ident ified risks are hypersensitivity reactions,
including infusion -related reacti ons (IRRs) and hypersensit ivity react ions, and upper 
respi ratory  infect ions, including bronchit is, influenza, nasopharyngit is, and sinusit is, 
bronchitis, and influenza. Most IRRs are mild/moderate in intensity and resolve 
with minimal or no intervention . Important potent ial risks are GIinfections, 
including gastrointestinal infect ions and systemic infections against which the gut 
constitutes a defensive barrier; serious infections, including opportunist ic infections 
such as progressive mult ifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML); malignancy; and liver 
injury . Reported serious infections include tuberculosis, sepsis, Salmonella sepsis, 
Listeria meningitis, and cytomegaloviral colitis. 
Most serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to exacerbat ions or complicat ions of 
the underlying UC or CD. Similar safet y pro files fo r vedo lizumab have been observed 
in subjects who received vedolizumab IV Q4W or Q8W and in subjects fo llowing 
long-term Q4W treatm ent for up to 8 y ears, and in subjects administered 
vedolizumab subcutaneously (SC). With the exception of injection s ite reactions, 
the safety profile for vedolizumab SC is consistent with that for vedolizumab IV . 
In the phase 1b Study  Vedolizumab -1015, conducted in 24 subject s who underwent 
allo-HSCT, vedolizumab (at 75 or 300 mg on Days -1, +13, and +42) was added to 
standard GvHD prophylaxis (TAC and MTX) therapy. All subject s engrafted and no 
new safet y signals were reported. Inclinical studies, n o safety concerns were 
identified in subjects with aGvHD or undergoing allo- HSCT ,and the events 
reported were consistent with known risks in these patient populations.
In addition, no new safety information that alters the benefit:risk balance of 
vedolizumab was identified in the IBD clinical development program, including 
ongoing studies in pediatric subjects with UC or CD (DSUR, for the period 
20 May 2018 to 19 May 2019).

Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies . Further detail on the 
safet y profile of vedo lizumab can be found in the current edit ion of the invest igator’s 
brochure ( IB). 
Rationale for Change :Updated human experience as reported in the 9th DSUR.
Secti on4.1.2 Vedolizumab IV also containsthis change. 
Change 4:Update tothe study  rationale to support the inclu sion of adolescent subjects .
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.2Rationale for the Proposed Study :
Added text: The migrat ion of naive donor T cells to the GALT where they are act ivated and 
migration o f activated donor T cells to the target tissues, especially the intest inal 
mucosa, are essential steps in aGvHD in both chil dren and adults [52]. Intestinal 
aGvHD in children and adults is often involved in Grade 3 to 4 aGvHD and is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality after allo- HSCT. Systemic 
immunosuppressio n for aGvHD prophylaxis increases the risk for infections and can 
affect the graft -versus -tumor effect. Therefore, using standard nonspecific systemic 
immunosuppressive therapies invo lves a fine balance of prevent ion of life -threatening 
aGvHD against life -threatening infection and recurrence of underlying malignant 
disease. Therapy  that targets the trafficking of cells to the GI tract and reduces GI 
inflammat ion without adding to systemic immunosuppressio n could have profound 
effects on the morbidit y and m ortali ty of intestinal GvHD.
Results from Vedolizumab-1015, isa phase 1b study  (that enrolled 24 subjects 
enrolled) that aged ≥18 years, demonstrated the safet y and tol erabilit y of adding 
vedo lizumab on Day -1 (before allo -HSCT) and then on Days +13 and +42 after 
allo-HSCT to a background aGvHD prophylaxis regimen (TAC MTX) in subjects 
undergo ing allo -HSCT .

Change 5:Update to the benefit:risk pro file to support the inclusion ofadolescent subjects.
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.3Benefit:Risk Profile :
Added text: The proposed phase 3 study  is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of
vedo lizumab co mpared to placebo when added to background aGvHD prophylaxis 
regimen as prophylaxis for intestinal aGvHD for subjects undergo ing allo -HSCT. 
The m echanism  of action of vedolizumab, results from nonclinical studies 
demonstrating the role of T cell  trafficking in GvHD, and results of the phase 1b 
Study  Vedolizumab-1015, all support further investigat ion of vedolizumab in this 
indicat ion. Vedolizumab specifically targets the α4β7 integrin expressed on the 
surface of T lymphocytes, thus prevent ing T cells from binding to MAdCAM -1 
expressed on the endothelium, subsequent ly prevent ing T cells fro m homing to the 
intestinal tract. Nonclinical pharmaco logy studi es in m urine m odel dem onstrate that 
inhibit ion of the α4β7/MAdCAM- 1 pathway via ne utralizing ant i-MAdCAM-1 
antibodies attenuated the development of the graft versus host reaction [30][33] and 
the absence of α4β7+ cells on donor cells great ly delayed and reduced the presence of 
GvHD [16][19]. Furthermore, in Study Vedo lizumab -1015, a l owincidence of 
intestinal aGvHD was observed in adults undergo ing allo -HSCT for a hem atologic 
malignancy or myeloproliferat ive disorder who received vedo lizumab 300 mg IV in 
combinat ion with standard GvHD prophylaxis. There remains an unmet medical 
need in patients undergoing allo- HSCT who, despite routine prophylaxis ,
remain at risk of developing intestinal aGvHD and its associated complications.
The available PK data, nonclinical toxicology data, and clinical data, are
supportive of the inclusion of adolescent subjects aged ≥12 years and weighing 
≥30 kg in this phase 3 study. In phase 3 studies in adults with UC or CD, body 
weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety data from these studies showed that 
there was no diffe rence in the incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) based on weight or age (18 -70 years). Furthermore, a similar safety 
profile has been observed in adults with UC or CD who received vedolizumab 
IV Q8W or Q4W. No additive risk of infection was identified among subjects 
who received a concomitant immunosuppressant. Results of population PK analyses in subjects with IBD indicate that a weight -
based dosing regimen is not 
required and that a tiered flat-dose is appropriate for different weight g roups. 
Age was not a clinically meaningful covariate. PK data from Study 
Vedolizumab -1015 indicates that the PK of vedolizumab in subjects undergoing 
an allo -HSCT who received 300 mg is similar to that of subjects with UC or CD. 
In addition, no new safety information that alters the benefit:risk balance of 
vedolizumab have been identified in the UC/CD clinical development program, 
including ongoing studies in pediatric subjects (aged 2- 17 years). Therefore, the 
benefit:risk profile is expected to be similar in adults and adolescent subjects 
aged ≥12years and weighing ≥30 kg.

The subject populat ion was chosen because it represents a high- risk, vulnerable 
popul ation for development of intestinal aGvHD, a driver for poor outcomes, 
mortalit y, and for who m a significant unm et medical  need exists. The risks of this 
subject populat ion include those that are associated with hematological 
transpl antati on. Specifically , allo-HSCT pati ents are at ri sk of infect ions 
(opportunistic, GI, and CNS infect ions); liver in jury; infusio n-related reactions (IRR) 
and hypersensit ivity react ions, and relapse or new primary  malignancy . The 
important identified risks specific for vedo lizumab include IRRs and upper 
respi ratory  tract infect ions, including bronchitis, influenza, naso pharyngitis, and 
sinusit is. The important potential risks for vedolizumab are: malignancies, liver 
injury; infections (GI infect ions and systemic infections [serious and nonserious]); 
and other serious infect ions, including opportunist ic infections such as PML. Several 
risk mit igation strategi es are incorporated in this phase 3 study including exclusion o f 
subjects wi th ongoing or active infect ions (Sect ion 7.2), criteria for discont inuat ion 
and wit hdrawal o f subjects (Section 7.4), and instructions for managing these risks 
(Secti on 8.7). The mit igation strategi es are adequate to monitor safet y of the subjects 
participat ing in the study. In co mbination wit h the results from the phase 1b Study
Vedolizumab-1015, and supported by the available nonclinical, clin ical, and PK 
data, the benefit:risk profile supports is expected to be similar in adults and 
adolescent subjects aged 12 years and greater and weighing ≥30kg, supporting
further invest igation of vedo lizumab in the subject populat ion with significant unmet
medical need.

Change 6:Addi tion of data supporting the dose regimen in adolescent subjects.
The primary change occurs in Sect ion6.2.2 Dose Sel ection:
Added text: The 300 m g dose of vedolizumab was well tolerated in subjects in Study
Vedolizumab- 1015 wi thout del ay of engraft ment (median 14 days for the 
vedo lizumab 300 mg cohort) or new safet y concerns. Repeated vedo lizumab dosing 
during the 6 months after the allo -HSCT is proposed, during which time subjects are 
at the highest risk of developing intest inal aGvHD. 
The same vedolizumab dose regimen to be administered to adults (aged 
≥18years) planned to undergo allo -HSCT for prophylaxis of intestinal aGvHD 
is considered appropriate for administration to adolescents aged 12 years and 
greater and weighing ≥30 kg. In phase 3 studies in adults with IBD, body 
weights ranged from 28.7 to 170 kg. Safety data from these studies showed no difference in the incidence of TEAEs and a similar safety profile in adults 
receiving vedolizumab IV Q8W or Q4W (S ection 4.3). A population PK model 
was developed using pooled phase 1, 2, and 3 study data from the vedolizumab IV clinical program in adults with UC or CD to characterize the PK o f 
vedolizumab and to assess the impact of patient demographic characteristics (eg, age and body weight) on PK. This model indicated that weight -
based dosing 
is not required and that age was not a clinically meaningful covariate (S ection 
4.3). In addition, results from Study Vedolizumab -1015 indicated that the PK of 
vedolizumab (300 mg) in adults with aGvHD was similar to that in adults with UC or CD.

Added text: Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of 
prem edicat ion (eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving 
vedo lizumab; hence, such premedicat ion is unlikely to be necessary or beneficial. At 
the discret ion of the invest igator, however, subjects may be administered 
prem edicat ion before any  study  drug administration. Use of topical anesthetic (eg, 
lidocaine, tetracaine , prilocaine ) is recommended for blood draws or IV 
insertions f or the comfort of subjects aged 12 to <18 years. This use will notbe 
recorded as a concomitant medication. Corticosteroi ds, if given as a 
prem edicat ion, should be limited to the day  of administrati on.

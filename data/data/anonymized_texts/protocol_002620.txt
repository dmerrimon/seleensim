Project Summary  
Contrast -rebalanced dichoptic movies (with fellow eye contrast reduced)  have been 
shown to be an effective binocular treatment for amblyopia in a laboratory setting. Yet, 
at-home therapy is a more practical approach. While c ontrast -rebalanced binocular 
tablet games  have been shown to be an effective at-home t reatment for amblyopia,  the 
games can be challenging for some of the youngest children  with amblyopia.  To 
address this need, we will compare  dichoptic movies, streamed at -home on a handheld 
3D-enabled game console, versus patching as amblyopia treatment for children aged 3 
to 7 years with amblyopia.  The primary outcome will be  change in best -corrected acuity 
at the 2 -week visit in children treated with streaming dichoptic movies  versus children 
treated with standard -of-care 2  hours/day patching. A secondary objective  is to 
determine whether amblyopic eye visual acuity improvement at the 2 -week visit is 
significant in each of the treatment groups.
 Fifty-six amblyopic children ( aged 3-7 years ) 
will be randomly assigned to patching (2 h ours/day, 7 days/week; 28 hours total ) or 
binocular treatment (3 dichoptic movies per week; 9 hours total ). In the context  of prior 
amblyopia treatment results with at -home contrast -rebalanced tablet g ames and with in -
lab contrast -rebalanced movies, we anticipate that dichoptic movies, streamed at -home 
on a handheld 3D -enabled game console  will be more effective than patching.  
 Rationale and background  
Contrast -rebalanced binocular tablet games (with fellow eye contrast reduced) have 
been shown to be an effective treatment for amblyopia.
1,2 However, the games can be 
challenging for some of the young est children and boring for some of the older children 
with amblyopia. To provide additional treatment options using the same contrast -
rebalancing approach, we have processed animated videos to allow dichoptic viewing, 
with full contrast for the amblyopic eye and reduced contrast for the fellow eye.  In 
prospective single -arm studies, contrast -rebalanced dichoptic movie s have been used 
as an effective treatment for children aged 4 to 12 years with amblyopia.3 With as little 
as 9 hours of vie wing time, mean improvement of visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes 
was 1.5 to 2.0 lines.4,5 There is evidence that younger ch ildren (<7 years) are more 
responsive to amblyopia treatments,6,7 including treatment wi th contrast -rebalanced 
dichoptic movie s, than older children.4 While in-lab studies of amblyopia treatment with 
contrast -rebalanced dichoptic movie s provided proof -of-principle data for the treatment 
approach, at -home treatment is a more practical alternative.  
 Study Goal  
To explore an at -home amblyopia treatment in younger children with contrast -
rebalanced dichoptic movie s. 
 Objective  
In a randomized clinical trial, we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of viewing cloud -
based contrast -rebalanced dichoptic movie s streamed on a handheld device in children 
aged 3 to 7 years compared with standard -of-care patching treatment.

Methodology  
Children aged 3 to 7 years who are diagnosed by pediatric eye specialists as having 
amblyopia due to strabismus, anisometropia, or both (combined mechanism) are 
eligible. Diagnoses, alignment, prior treatment, and visual acuity for visits prior to enrollment w ill be extracted from the referring doctor’s medical records.  
 Inclusion criteria  
-Amblyopic eye visual acuity of 0.2 to 0.8 logMAR  
-Fellow eye visual acuity of -0.1 to 0.2 logMAR  
-Interocular visual acuity difference of >0.2 logMAR  
-Anisometropia or corrected strabismus (<5pd) 
-Wearing glasses for at least 8 weeks with no change in visual acuity over two visits  
-Must be able to see the full movie screen (both amblyopic and fellow eye components) 
with fellow eye contrast set to 20%.  
 
Exclusion criteria  
-Prematurity of 8 w eeks or more  
-Coexisting ocular or systemic disease  
-Developmental delay  
-Significant ocular misalignment (>=5 pd).  
 Study Design  
This study is a randomized clinical trial (parallel group design). At the baseline visit, 
eligibility will be  ascertained and  vision assessments conducted. Children will be 
randomly assigned to watch contrast -rebalanced dichoptic animated movies 
(experimental treatment) or to patch the fellow eye 2 hours/day every day (standard -of-
care amblyopia treatment) for 2 weeks. Randomiza tion will performed through the 
website www.randomization.org  with a coded distribution of a 1:1 ratio, with blocks of 12 
allocations. Investigators will have access to the randomization assignment  (sealed in a 
numbered envelope)  only after the child is enrolled.  
 
At the 2 -week primary outcome visit, children in the patching group will cross over to the 
dichoptic animated movie group and all participants will be  asked to return for a 
secondary outcome visit visi on assessment at 4 weeks. After that, children in the 
dichoptic movie group will have  the option to continue an additional 2 weeks and 
children who were initially in the patching group will have  the option to continue with 
movies for an additional 4 weeks (up to 6 weeks of movies for both groups). Children 
who continue  will have follow -up visits with vision assessments every 2 weeks (14±3 
days).  
 
Dichoptic Movies  
Eighteen popular animated feature films were modified using custom MATLAB software to allow dichoptic presentation on a New Nintendo 3DS XL platform (Nintendo 
Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), which will be loaned to the child for the duration of the study  
so that movies can be watched at home. This Nintendo device allow s for dichoptic 
viewing without the need for anaglyphic, polarized, or shutter glasses or a VR headset.  
The movies ha ve the same design as in our recent prospective study of contrast -
rebalanced movies in which children came into the laboratory to watch movies on a 
passive 3D display.
4,5 Briefly, odd lines in the Nintendo 3D display are visible to one 
eye, and even lines are visible to the other eye. A patterned image mask composed of 
irregularly shaped blobs was multiplied  with the images seen by the amblyopic eye, and 
the inverse patterned mask was multiplied with the images seen by the fellow eye, so that different parts of the display are seen by each eye. Blobs of the movie seen by the 
amblyopic eye always ha ve high con trast (100%), whereas the complementary blobs 
seen by the fellow eye ha ve reduced contrast. Because the blobs had Gaussian edges, 
the edges of the blobs overlap and are seen by both eyes with differing contrasts, 
preventing any significant rivalry. The sha pe and location of the blobs are varied 
dynamically every 10 seconds. Fellow eye contrast start s at 20% for the first movie and 
increment s by 10% for each subsequent movie (i.e., 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 29%, …). 
Movies have been uploaded to our Amazon Web Services (AWS; Seattle, WA, USA) 
streaming service in two -week packets, each containing 6 movies that preserve the 
order of fellow eye contrasts from low to high.  
 
Study Protocol  
Children allocated  to the dichoptic movie arm will be  asked to watch 3 movies per  week 
(about 4.5 hours per week) during each 2 -week period. During their visit, we will provide 
a link on their loaned Nintendo for the set of 6 movies that should be watched during the next two weeks. Movie names are numbered on the Nintendo device, in or der by fellow 
eye contrast, and the family will be  instructed that the movies should be viewed in that 
order at home with the date recorded on a paper calendar. Fellow eye contrast of 
movies 1 -6 increment from 20% to 32% during the first 2 weeks, movies 7 -12 increment 
from 35% to 57% during weeks 3 and 4 and, finally, movies 13 -18 increment from 63% 
to 100% if children participate  in the optional weeks 5 and 6.  Children allocated  to the 
patching arm will be  supplied with patches and asked to patch two hours per day for two 
weeks. At the 2 -week visit, children in the patching group will be loaned a Nintendo and 
begin watching movies, starting with 20% fellow eye contrast for the next two weeks, 
and have the o ption of completing up to 6 weeks of movies.  
 
Vision Assessments  
Visual acuity.  Crowded monocular best -corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be tested at 
each visit using the Amblyopia Treatment Study HOTV protocol for 3 - to 6-year olds9-11 
and the E -ETDRS protocol for 7 -year olds.12,13   
 
Stereoacuity.  Stereoacuity will be  assessed with the Randot Preschool Stereoacuity 
Test and the Stereo Butterfly Test;  stereoacuity w ill be converted to log arcsec for 
analyses; nil stereoacuity w ill be arbitrarily assigned a value of 4.0.14 
 Suppression .  Extent of suppression will be  assessed using the Worth -4 dot test at 7 
distances (3m, 2m, 1m, 0.67m, 0.5m, 0.33 m, and 0.16m); the farthest distance at which the ch ild report s 4 dots will be  converted to the area of suppression scotoma in log 
degrees.  
15 Depth of suppression will be evaluated using a dichoptic eye chart that 
identifies the non -preferred eye/preferred eye contrast ratio (i.e., balance point) at which 
the child can overcome suppression and report letters presented to each eye with equal likelihood (Contrast Balance Index; CBI).

 Sample Size  
 Based on our recent prospective study of contrast re -balanced dichoptic movies as a 
treatment for amblyopia,
4,5  we anticipate a 0.15±0.10 logMAR (7.5 letters) improvement 
in visual acuity at the 2 -week primary outcome visit for children assigned to the 
dichoptic movie arm.  For children assigned to the patching group, we anticipate a 0.07±0.10 logMAR (3.5 letters) i mprovement at 2 weeks based on results from our prior 
study of patching versus a contrast -rebalanced dichoptic game as a treatment for 
amblyopia.
2 With these expected means, a sample size of 28 per group (56 total) w ill 
provide 85% power to declare that the two groups have significantly different means, using a two -sided p -value of less than 0.05. We will e nroll and randomize  62 children 
(31 per group) to account for potential 10% loss to follow -up. 
 
 
Expected Outcome s 
Results will be disseminated at the annual meetings of the Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology & Strabismus and the Association for Research in Vision & 
Ophthalmology and submitted for publication in a leading medical/scientific journal.  
 If this novel at -home binocular movie treatment is effective in improving  amblyopic eye 
visual acuity, it will provide  an additional treatment option for amblyopia  in young 
children .

Confidential 2Rationale for Amendment 6
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating 
Amendment 6. The primary reason for this amendment is to define the patient populat ion for 
enrollment in the Arm 6 expansio n cohort of TAK -580 given as mo notherapy  every other 
day in pat ients with non–small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and non -V600 BRAF mutations. 
This is a populat ion that does not respond to current ly available V600 BRAF inhibitors and 
so rem ains underserved.  
Specifically , with this amendment, all patients enrolled into the Arm 6 expansio n cohort will 
be required to have metastatic NSCLC harboring BRAF non-V600 m utations. 
It has been estimated that between 3% and 5% of pa tients wi th NSCLC harbor BRAF
mutati ons. Approximately  half of these mutati ons are in the V600 site, and the restare non -
V660E m utations [1-4]. Other data have estimated the incidence of BRAF mutati ons in 
NSCLC as being as high as 7%, with 70% non -V600 mutations [5]. Although this is a 
relatively small  popul ation, it is com parable to popul ations of pat ients with NSCLC that 
harbor ALK and ROS mutations, for which novel pharmaceut ical agents have been 
successfully developed. Most these patients have adenocarcino mas. Itshould be ment ioned 
that not every  non-V600 m utation may  be a driver mutati on, and so me may not be 
actionable.
Vem urafenib, a BRAF inhibitor, was tested in a cohort of 20 patients with BRAF mutations 
(90% of who m harbored V600 mutations) as part of a bask et clinical trial [6]. In 
19evaluable patients, 42% had a partial response, and 42% had stable disease, for a clinical 
benefit rate of 84%. The median progressi on-free survival was 7.3 months, and the 
12-month survival was 66%.
The combinat ion of dabrafenib and tram etinib was tested in 93 patients with V600 BRAF
mutati ons; 57 were previously  treated ,and 36 were treatment naïve. The objective response 
rate was 63% in the previously treated group and 61% in the treatm ent-naïve group. The 
median duration of response was 12.6 months in the previously  treated group and had not 
been reached in the treatm ent-naïve group. Responses last ing longer than 6 m onths were 
seen in 64% and 59% in the previously treated and treatm ent-naïve pat ients, respectively [7]. 
This combinat ion recent ly received regulatory approval for the treat ment of patients wi th 
NSCLC and V600 BRAF mutati ons.
Current ly available BRAF inhibitors , however, are ineffect ive against non -V600 m utations, 
and there is an interest ing scient ific explanat ion for this. The V600 m utation acts via a 
monomer of the abnormal kinase, and current BRAF inhibitors are capable of inhibit ing this 
enzyme. However, several of the non -V600 mutati ons act by  forming heterodimers with 
CRAF, and the currently available BRAF inhibitors are not capable o f inhibit ing thi s 
activat ion. However , as a pan -RAF inhibitor, MLN2480 has the abilit y to inhibit these 
heterodimers formed between the mutant BRAF and norm al CRAF dimer and could ,
therefore ,have activit y in non-V600 m utant BRAF tumors.
Minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administr ative changes not affect ing the 
conduct of the study  are included for clarificat ion and administrative purposes only.

!To determine the safety profile and RP2Ds of the combination treatments of MLN2480
+ paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan
Secondary
!To characterize plasma PK of MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + alisertib, MLN2480
+ paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan upon co-administration in
each combination setting
!To evaluate preliminary efficacy as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines (version 1.1)
Exploratory
!
Study Design Overview: This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study that incorporates a Dose 
Escalation (Escalation) phase and a Dose Expansion (Expansion) phase. The study will enroll adult patients with advanced, solid (nonhematologic) malignancies and who, in the opinion of the treating 
physician, have failed standard therapies and for whom a phase 1 trial is an appropriate option.
The Escalation phase will investigate 5 combination arms (ie, MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + 
alisertib, MLN2480 + paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan). This study is the first to administer these combinations to humans. Once the MTD for each combination treatment 
arm has been established, up to 3 combination treatment arms and one monotherapy arm will be evaluated in the Expansion phase based on tolerability and exposure data collected during the Escalation phase. The combination of MLN2480 + paclitaxel will be administered to patients with 
KRAS exon 2 or BRAF non-V600 mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are 
naïve to previous treatment with RAF or MEK inhibitors. The combinations of MLN2480 + cetuximab and MLN2480 + irinotecan will be administered to patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
The combination of MLN2480 + cetuximab will enroll patients with specifically BRAF V600 or 
non-canonical RAS mutation-positive disease. Non-canonical RAS mutations include KRAS or NRAS non-exon 2 (exon 3 or 4 mutations) or NRAS exon 2 mutated disease. MLN2480 monotherapy will be administered to patients with NSCLC and non-V600 BRAF mutations.CCI

Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-003340-12
Confidential 5The safety and tolerability of the combination treatment arms will be evaluated using physical 
examination findings, the incidence of treatment- emergent  adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse 
events (SAEs), assessment of clinical laboratory values, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, vital sign measurements, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and clinical 
laboratory parameters. 
Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of MLN2480 and the respective combination 
agents (not including the MLN2480 monotherapy arm) will be collected during Cycle 1 at 
prespecified time points.
Underlying disease status will be assessed by the investigator per RECIST (version 1.1) guidelines 
using radiological evaluations (computed axial tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI],
 
Study Population: The study will enroll adult patients who have radiographically or clinically 
evaluable tumors and who, in the opinion of the treating physician, have failed standard therapies and for whom a phase 1 trial is an appropriate option. ( For Expansion phase : Tumors must be 
measurable as defined by RECIST [version 1.1]) and of the protocol-specified genetic mutational 
status, where applicable). In addition to other requirements, all patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1, an expected survival of ≥3 months, a 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% or greater (as measured by echocardiogram [ECHO] 
or multiple gated acquisition [MUGA] scan), meet minimum clinical laboratory value requirements, 
be able to swallow and retain oral medications, and must agree to use effective birth control as appropriate. Patients who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible: history of uncontrolled 
brain metastasis, ongoing seizure disorder or a requirement for antiepileptic medications, recent 
(≤6 months) history of certain cardiac disorders, and gastrointestinal (GI) disease. Additional 
requirements and exclusions apply to specific combination treatment arms.
Duration of Study: Patient eligibility will be determined during screening ( ≤28 days before 
Cycle 1, Day 1). During the Treatment period, patients will take their assigned study drug 
combination in 28-day cycles until they experience disease progression, an unacceptable toxicity 
occurs, or discontinue for any other reason. Treatment in any patient will not exceed 12 cycles without sponsor approval. Patients who tolerate treatment and have evidence of clinical benefit after 12 cycles in the opinion of the investigator may continue treatment with continued monitoring upon 
prior review and approval by the project clinician.
Each patient will attend an End of Study visit 30 days (+ 10 days) after his/her last study drug dose, 
or as of the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, to permit the detection of 
any delayed treatment-related AEs. CCI

An End-of-Cohort safety data meeting scheduled by the sponsor will occur after the last patient in each cohort in the Dose Esca lation phase has completed the first 
treatment cycle/DLT observation period (ie, Day 1 to Day 28) to facilitate careful assessment of AEs before escalating to the n ext dose.
Tests and procedures should be performed on schedule, but occasional changes are allowable (± 2 days) with permission from the project clinician for holidays, 
vacations, and other administrative reasons. If extenuating circumstances prevent a patient from beginning treatment or completin g a scheduled procedure or 
assessment within this time, the patient may continue the study only with the written permission of the project clinician.
a The End of Study visit will occur 30 (+ 10) days after the last dose of study treatment or the start of subsequent antineoplasti c therapy, whichever occurs first. 
b AEs that occur during the Screening period (following informed consent, but prior to study drug administration) will be record ed as part of the patient’s medical

screening. If the archived sample is unavailable or inadequate (eg < 10 slides), a fresh biopsy may be required. The fresh biopsy specimens must be obtained 
at least 2 days after the last dose of any prior anticancer therapy and within 28 days before the first dose of study drug. See Section  7.4.19 and Section 
7.4.19.1.
r Contrast CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be obtained at screening. Specific disease sites that cannot be adequa tely imaged by CT may be 
documented by MRI. Disease response assessments (including CT or MRI scans of all sites of disease) by RECIST will be performed every 8 weeks 
(± 2 days) beginning on Cycle 2, Day 27 (± 2 days) and at the EOS visit. Assessments need not be repeated if performed within 4 we eks before the End of 
Study visit. See Section 7.4.20.  
s Patients will fast (with the exception of water) for at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after taking their MLN2480 do se. On dosing days when a clinic 
visit is not scheduled, patients will take their dose of MLN2480 at home. See Section  6.1.1 and Section 6.1.6 for dosing instructions for Arm 5.CCI

1.1 Scientific Background
1.1.1 Disease Under Study
This study  will invest igate MLN2480, administered in 5 separate combinat ionsand 1 
monotherapy  cohort, ie ,MLN2480 + MLN0128 (Arm  1), MLN2480+ alisert ib [MLN8237]
(Arm  2), or MLN2480 + paclitaxel (Arm  3) in pat ients with advanced so lid 
(nonhematol ogic) tum ors,with an E xpansio n phase in patients with non -small cell lung 
cancer to include ML N2480 monotherapy  Q2D (Arm  6),or MLN2480 + cetuximab (Arm  4) 
or MLN2480 + irinotecan (Arm  5) in patients wi th advanced so lid (nonhematologic) tumors, 
with an Expansio n phase in patients with colorectal  cancer. 
1.1.2 Study Drugs
Unless otherwise noted, “study  drug” refers to combinat ion dosing of MLN2480 plus the 
respective combinat ion agent ( ie, MLN2480 + MLN0128, MLN2480 + alisertib, 
MLN248 0 +paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan). Properti es of 
each of the individual agents are briefly described in the fo llowing secti ons.
1.1.2.1 MLN2480
MLN2480 is a potent, small mo lecule pan -RAF kinase inhibitor being developed for the 
treatm ent of so lid tumors, both as a single agent and in co mbinat ion with other agents. As a 
combinat ion therapy , MLN2480 has the potenti al to support the inhibit ion of tumor cell 
signaling at multiple nodes. The RAF kinases (A -, B-, and C -RAF) are key  com ponents of 
the mitogen -activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway  that control s cell  proliferati on and 
survival signaling. The MA PK pathway , which is com posed of RAS, RAF, MAPK kinase 
(MEK), and extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK), integrates signals from receptors 
on the cell surface including cancer -related receptor ty rosine kinases such as the epidermal 
growth factor rece ptor ( EGFR ), mesenchymal epit helial transit ion factor (MET), and the 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ).The MAPK pathway is frequently 
activated in human cancer by  mutation of  BRAF , NRAS , KRAS , or other pathway  
components. Recent approval s of BRAF and MEK sm all molecule inhibi tors in melanom a 
have confirmed the importance of this pathway in cancer patients.
The abilit y of MLN2480 to i nhibit both RAF mo nomer and dimer- mediated si gnaling is a 
key feature that dist inguishes it from recent ly approved BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and 
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 61dabrafenib ).MLN2480 is a potential first -in-class mo lecule wit h clinical attributes of both a 
RAF and MEK inhibitor. On the basis of nonclinical and preliminary clinical data to date, 
MLN2480 has an acceptable safe ty profile enabling a variet y of combinat ion approaches.
Addit ional information regarding MLN2480 is provided in the MLN2480 Invest igator’s 
Brochure (IB).
1.1.2.2 MLN0128
MLN0128 is a novel, highly select ive, orally bioavailable adenosine 5’ triphosphate 
(ATP) -competit ive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanist ic 
target of rapamycin (mTOR). MLN0128 (formerly INK128) targets 2 distinct mult iprotein 
complexes, m TORC1 and m TORC2.
MLN0128 is being developed both for oncology  and non -onco logy indicat ions.For 
oncol ogy patients, MLN0128 is being investigated as a treatment for advanced so lid tumors 
and hematol ogic malignancies, ei ther as m onotherapy  or in combinat ion with chem otherapy, 
other m olecularly  targeted therapi es, or anti horm onal ag ents. Non-oncol ogy indicat ions 
being invest igated include fibrotic and inflammatory  diseases in the lung or bronchio les 
such as idiopathic pulmo nary fibrosis and bronchiolit is obliterans syndrome .MLN0128 is 
also being developed in co mbinat ion with MLN1117 (an oral  phospho inosit ide-3-kinase 
alpha iso form inhibitor) as a treatment for advanced nonhematologic malignancies.
Addit ional information regarding MLN0128 is provided in the MLN0128 IB.
1.1.2.3 Alisertib
Alisertib is a select ive small mo lecule inhibitor of Au rora A kinase that is being developed 
as an oral  treatm ent for advanced solid tumor malignancies and advanced hematological 
malignancies in single -agent and combinat ion studies. Aurora A kinase is expressed in all 
actively dividing cells; it is localized t o centrosomes and the proximal mitotic spindle during 
mitosis where i t functi ons in a diverse set of mitotic processes. Given the essent ial role of 
mitosi s in tum or proliferat ion, alisertib has the potent ial to be applied across a broad range 
of human tum ors.It has demonstrated activit y against a broad range of nonclinical tumor 
models and is expected to be toxic to proliferating normal t issues, such as the bone marrow 
and gastrointestinal epit helium. Addit ional information regarding alisert ib is provided in the 
Alisertib IB.

Confidential 621.1.2.4 Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel (a taxane) is an ant imicrotubule agent approved by the United States (US) Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the 
treatm ent of breast, ovarian, and non -small cell lung c ancer. Paclitaxel promotes the 
assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers, and stabilizes microtubules by prevent ing 
depolymerizat ion.This stabilit y results in the inhibit ion of the normal dynamic 
reorganizat ion of the microtubule network that is essent ial for vital interphase and mitoti c 
cellular funct ions.In addit ion, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of 
microtubules throughout the cell cycle and mult iple asters of microtubules during mitosis. [8]
For m ore inform ation, please see the US package insert (USPI) [9]or Summary  of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) [10] for paclitaxel. 
1.1.2.5 Cetuximab
Cetuximab is an EGFR inhibitor indicated for the treatment of metastatic co lorectal  cancer 
(mCRC), m etastati c non -small cell lung cancer, and squamous cell carcino ma of t he head 
and neck. Specifically , cetuximab is approved for the treatment of patients with EGFR -
expressing mCRC, in co mbinat ion with chem otherapy , and as a single agent in pat ients who 
have failed oxaliplat in-and irinotecan -based therapy  and who are intoler ant to i rinotecan. 
The posi tive opinio n from the European regulatory agency, the Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (CHMP), was received for mCRC first -line use in May 2008. For 
more inform ation, please see the Sm PC for cetuximab [11].
1.1.2.6 Irinotecan
Irinotecan is an ant ineoplast ic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class, approved in many 
countri es for use a s first -line therapy in co mbinat ion with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for 
patients wi th metastati c carcino ma of the colon or rectum, and in pat ients with metastati c 
carcino ma of the colon or rectum whose disease has recurred or progressed fo llowing init ial 
fluorouracil -based therapy. The init ial New Drug Applicat ion (NDA) for irinotecan was 
approved in 1996. For more informat ion, please see the Sm PC for irinotecan [12].
1.2 Nonclinical Experience
1.2.1 MLN2480 
In biochemical kinase inhibit ion assays, MLN2480 demonstrates potent inhibit ion of the 
oncogenic BRAFV600Emutant and the wild -type BRAF and C RAF kinases and inhibits a 
small subset of kinases in addit ion to RAF in a similar potency  range. MLN2480 has shown 
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 63a high degree of select ivity in a large nonkinase screening panel o f 169 receptors, 
transporters, and channels.
In vitro, MLN2480 inhibited phosphorylated ERK (pERK) signaling and/or cell 
proliferat ion in the majorit y ofmutant and wild -type BRAF cell lines evaluated. In cell 
growth inhibit ion assays, MLN2480 inhibited MAPK pathway signaling in cells with mutant 
BRAF , which signals as a mono mer, and som e cells wi th RAS m utation, where RAF signals 
as a dimer. In vivo, a single oral dose of MLN2480 demonstrated strong and sustained 
suppressio n of pERK in mutant and wild -type BRAF mouse xenograft models. Significant 
antitumor activit y was observed in multiple tum or xenograft m odels that had BRAFV600E/D
mutati ons or were wild t ype for BRAF , including models o f melanoma and co lon, lung, and 
pancreat ic cancer. MLN2480 exhibits the greatest overall ant itumor activit y in melano ma, 
colon, and lung cancer models.Collectively, the data provide strong rationale for conducting 
MLN2480 clinical trials in a variet y of solid tum ors.
Safety pharmaco logy studi es in rats and m onkeys di d not i dentify any notable 
cardi ovascular, central nervous system (CNS), or res piratory  liabilit ies for MLN2480. The 
human protein binding is 97.5%, giving a free concentration of 0.19 M at C max. The 
potenti al for human ether -à-go- go related gene (hERG) inhibit ion is considered to be low.
Addit ionally , there were no electrocardiogra m (ECG) findings in 4 -week repeat -dose studies 
in monkeys dosed every otherday (QOD), up to and including 30 -mg/kg MLN2480. In 
accordance with Internat ional Conference on Harmo nisat ion (ICH) S9 guidelines and 
consistent with a drug at this stage in develo pment for oncology  indicat ions, reproductive 
toxicity studies have not been conducted.
For m ore inform ation, please see the MLN2480 IB.
1.2.2 MLN0128 
In nonclinical onco logy invest igations, MLN0128 select ively and potently inhibits mTOR 
kinase (the IC 50[concentrati on inhibit ing 50% of enzyme act ivity]is 1.1 nM), inhibit s 
mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation. MLN0128 inhibited 
phosphorylat ion of downstream modulators of mTORC1and mTORC2 in human U87 
glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in mi ce and showed strong tumor growth inhibit ion at 
tolerable oral  doses in all  8 tested xenograft m odels.
MLN0128 has a low potential to affect the hERG potassium io n channel and did not affect 
cardi ovascular param eters in vivo in telemeterized mo nkeys. The toxicologic profiles

Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 64obtained in Good Laboratory  Practi ce (GLP)- compliant and non -GLP -compliant studi es in 
rats and monkeys were generally consistent with pharmaco logic inhibit ion of mTORC1/2 
activit y.There were no apparent sex differences in observed tox icities.Preliminary findings 
in ongo ing rat and rabbit embryo fetal studi es indicated teratogenic, fetotoxic, and abortive 
effects wi th MLN0128. Embryofetal lethalit y and/or teratogenic effects have been reported 
with the TORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and the rapalogs.
Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are known toxicit ies associated with inhibit ion of 
mTOR and related pathway s based on nonclinical studies. A rise in fast ing plasma glucose 
has been observed as early as 1 to 2days fo llowing oral  administrati on of  MLN0128. 
For m ore inform ation, please see the MLN0128 IB.
1.2.3 Alisertib
In nonclinical invest igations, alisertib inhibited proliferat ion of a wide variet y of tumor cell  
lines grown in culture and induced phenoty pes consistent wi th Aurora A kinase inhib ition, 
including mitotic spindle defects, mitotic delay, and apoptosis. In co mbination wit h 
standard –of–care agents administered in mult iple tumor models, alisertib results in 
synergistic or addit ive ant itumor effects.
Safety pharmaco logy studi es wi th alisertib did not ident ify significant adverse effects in the 
CNS and cardiovascular systems at tolerated doses. Alisertib exhibited minimal act ivity 
against hERG current (IC 50and inhibit ion constant [K i]100 M), but did exhibit in vitro 
activit y against the gamma amino butyric acid A alpha -1 benzodi azepine binding site 
(Ki290nM), and related effects were observed at nontolerated doses and/or exposures.
Alisertib was negat ive for mutagenicit y in the Ames assay and equivocal for clastogenicit y 
in a rat b one m arrow micronucleus assay.

1.3 Clinical Experience
1.3.1 MLN2480 
MLN2480 is current ly being evaluated as a single agent in one phase 1 study  in pat ients 
with advanced so lid tumors (excluding lympho ma). Preliminary data areavailable for a total 
of 181patients. The emerging safet y profile indicates that MLN2480 is generally well 
tolerated, wi th manageable adverse events (AEs) that are commo n with the RAF kinase 
inhibitor class of drugs. The AE of rash has been ident ified as an adverse drug reaction due 
to the observed incidence and known class effect of RAF -kinase inhibitors. Further details 
are provided in the MLN2480 IB.
1.3.2 MLN0128 
As of a clinical data cutoff o f 09 December 2013, MLN0128 was being invest igated in 
2phase 1 studi es in pat ients with advanced so lid malignancies. A thi rd phase 1 study  had 
been co mpleted in pat ients with hematol ogic malignancies. Across these open -label studi es, 
a total  of 274 patients had been enro lled and 248 had received at least 1 MLN0128 do se as 
of the cutoff date. In general, observed toxicit ies have been assessed primarily  as severi ty 
Grade 1 or 2 and have been manageable with supportive care and/or dose interruption or 
reducti on.A total of 15 deaths reported to the clinical database as o f data cutoff had 
occurred within 30 days of the last study  drug dose; of these 15 events, 1 (cardiac arrest) 
was considered related to MLN0128. Further details are provided in the MLN0128 IB.
1.3.3 Alisertib
As of 29 March 2014, alisert ib was in phase 3 devel opment and had been administered to a

1.4 Study Rationale
Each combinat ion agent administered with MLN2480 in this study  has been part of single -
agent and co mbination clinical development programs. Support for investigating each 
combinat ion treatment arm is provided in the subsections that follow. Addit ive co mbination 
activit y has been observed in preclinical studies of MLN2480 administered in co mbinat ion 
with MLN0128, alisertib, and taxanes.
1.4.1 MLN2480 + MLN0128 (Arm 1)
MLN0128 has dual  activi ty against m TORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR is a key  effector of the 
MAPK pathway in MAPK -dominant tum ors.[13] The MAPK and PI3K signal transduct ion 
pathways are of ten co -activated in malignant cells. [14] Acquired resistance to inhibitors of 
1of these cell signaling pathways may  be the result of act ivation of the other 
pathway .[15,16]Agents targeting the RAF and/or MEK pathways have shown synergy in 
combinat ion with MLN0128 in diverse cell lines wit h broad mutation status and cancer 
indicat ions.Please see the MLN0128 IB and the MLN2480 IB for more informat ion.
1.4.2 MLN2480 +Alisertib (Arm 2)
Inhibit ion of the MAPK pathway  leads to cell cycle arrest and, in some cases, apoptosis.
Importantly, the MAPK pathway  is also requi red for the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) 
replication or damage checkpo int responses. [17,18] Alisertib is an oral Aurora A kinase 
inhibitor. Aurora A k inase inhibit ion results in mit otic arrest l eading di rectly to apoptosi s or 
to abnormal mitotic divisio ns that in turn lead to cell death or arrest. However, a portion of 
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 67cells can recover fro m these outcomes and re -enter the cell cycle. This observat ion raises the 
possibilit y that MAPK pathway  inhibi tion coul d affect cell survival subsequent to DNA 
damage caused by Aurora A kinase inhibit ion.Therefore, combining a MAPK pathway  
inhibitor with an Aurora A kinase inhibitor such as alisert ib could lead to the rapeuti c 
activit y that exceeds that of either agent administered alone. Interrupti on of  MEK/ERK 
signaling is therefore predicted to amplify  terminal outcom es fro m deleteri ous aneuplo idy 
caused by  Aurora A kinase inhibit ion.This theory  was tested using tra metinib (a MEK 
inhibitor and therefore MAPK pathway  inhibi tor, in lieu of MLN2480) plus alisertib. A 
synergistic effect was observed in assays co mbining tramet inib with alisert ib in melano ma 
and ovarian cancer cell models. MAPK pathway inhibit ion result ingfrom trametinib 
administration prevents the format ion of cells with > 4N DNA content induced by alisert ib, 
which leads to inhibit ion of cell -cycle progressi on and increases in cell death subsequent to 
abnorm al mitosis. Enhanced antitumor activit y with trametinib in co mbinat ion with alisert ib 
was also demonstrated in co lon and ovarian cancer xenograft models. Please see the alisertib 
IB and the MLN2480 IB for more informat ion.
1.4.3 MLN2480 + Paclitaxel (Arm 3)
MAPK signaling cascades are activated by  several  stimuli. Once act ivated, downstream 
activators of this pathway init iate transcript ional programs, thereby driving cell 
proliferat ion[19].Inhibit ion of this pathwa y inhibits cell pro liferation and in certain 
instances drives pro -apoptotic signaling or reduces the thresho ld for apoptosi s induct ion by 
other agents. Commo nly used chem otherapeut ics—including DNA -damaging and 
microtubule -stabilizing agents— ultimately dri ve cell death but require cells to be in cycle 
for this to occur. Further, these agents have been shown to promote activat ion of several 
cell-survival  pathways, including MAPK [20].In preclinical studies, MEK inhibitors (used 
as surrogates for MLN2480) in co mbination wit h taxane agents have been shown to 
synergistically  increase apoptosi s of RAS -or RAF -mutant cell lines. [21] Clinical evidence 
suggests potential efficacy in co mbining MAPK pathway inhibitors such as selumet inib (a 
MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, downstream of KRAS ) with convent ional chemotherapeut ics such 
as docetaxel (a taxane). Proof -of-concept for administering a MAPK pathway  inhibi tor in 
combinat ion with docetaxel  was dem onstrated in a prospective, rando mize d, phase 2 tri al 
that assessed selumet inib plus docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced KRAS -
mutant non -small cell lung cancer [22].These results support invest igation o f the 
combinat ion of MLN2480 + paclitaxel (also a taxane) to possibly augment the efficacy of 
single- agent paclitaxel in pat ients with KRAS -mutant tumors or BRAF non-V600 m utation-

1.4.4 MLN2480 + Cetuximab (Arm 4)
Anti-epidermal  growth factor receptor (anti -EGFR ) monocl onal ant ibodies are an effective 
therapy  for a minori ty of patients with mCRC. An intrinsic m echanism of resistance to anti -
EGFR therapy  is dysregulat ion of the MAPK pathway  which is commo n in mCRC. Up to 
55% of colon cancers harbor a mutation in K -RAS or N -RAS with another 8% to 10% with 
B-RAF mutati ons [23-25] .Further, the clinical efficacy o f EGFR targeted antibodies is 
limited by the development of acquired (secondary) resistance, which is often associated 
with activation (via new act ivating mutations or amplificati ons) of  the MAPK pa thway.
Agents that m olecularly target the MAPK pathway could potentially  provide new treatm ent 
options for mCRC pat ients with intrinsic or acquired resistance to anti -EGFR therapy .
However, in contrast to the pronounced single agent -activit y in melano ma, the single -agent 
activit y of select ive inhibitors of BRAF or MEK in mCRC has been limit ed [26].Prahallad 
et al [27] invest igated the limited single -agent activit y of vem urafenib, an oral  select ive 
inhibitor of BRAF and found that BRAF inhibit ion leads to rapid upstream activat ion of 
EGFR with subsequent by pass signaling via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The addit ion of 
an EGFR inhibitor to BRAF inhibit ion in the setting of BRAF mutant mCRC would 
therefore diminish this bypass effect and indeed, preclinical models of BRAF mutant CRC 
have demo nstrated the anti -proliferat ive effects of an ant i-EGFR with an ant i-BRAF
combinat ion.
Clinical studies are now ongoing to evaluate the combinat ion of MAPK pathway inhibit ion 
with EGF Rinhibit ion in not only BRAF mutant disease but in mCRC harboring mutations 
or activat ion in KRAS ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , “Afatinib and Selumetinib in Advanced KRAS
Mutant and PIK3CA Wildt ype Co lorectal , Non -small Cell Lung and Pancreat ic Cancer 
[M14AFS],” accessed 05 August 2015; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , “BRAF /MEK/ EGFR Inhibitor 
Combinat ion Study  in Co lorectal  Cancer [CRC],” accessed 05 August 2015). While the 
preliminary results are promising with partial responses observed in pat ients with KRAS
mutant CRC [28], the limitat ions of MEK inhibitors generally, ie, the pharm acokinet ics and 
safet y profil e and/or drug -mediated CRAF re -activation of the MAPK pathway, may reduce 
the therapeutic benefit of an ant i-EGFR + MEKi combinat ion.
As a pan -RAF inhibitor with a long half-life, MLN2480 coul d overcom e the potenti al 
biological  and pharmaco logical limitat ions of  the MEK inhibit ion in mCRC. MLN2480

with better tol erabilit y and without the potential fo r drug -induced CRAF re -activat ion of the 
MAPK pathway.
Arm 4 will test the h ypothesis that MLN2480 in combinat ion with the ant i-EGFR
monoclonal antibody  cetuximab will demo nstrate clinical benefit in patients with mCRC in 
the presence o f MAPK pathway  dysregulat ion (where anti -EGFR therapy  may prevent 
bypass signaling via the PI3K/ Akt/m TOR pathway) ,specifically those with BRAF V600 or 
non-canonical RAS mutation -positive disease. 
1.4.5 MLN2480 + Irinotecan (Arm 5)
Cellular mechanisms causing irinotecan resistance have been reported for each step of the 
CPT-11 pathway  [29]. The MAPK pathway  has been implicated in the regulat ion of 
apoptosis as well as in the response to chemotherapeutic drugs [30].
Activation of MAPK by  SN38, the active m etabolite of i rinotecan, has been observed in 
MCF -7 breast cancer cells [31]or in response to other chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-
FU [32] or oxaliplat in [33]. Preclinical data suggest that the phosphorylat ion status of the 
MAPK p38α and β isoforms may  be a marker of resistance to irinotecan -based 
chemotherapies in CRC [34]. These studies suggest the use of MAPK inhibitors as an 
adjuvant therapy  may potentiate the efficacy  of irinotecan -based chemotherapies in non-
responder C RC pati ents.
Clinical studies to evaluate the combinat ion of MEK inhibit ion with irinotecan in 
relapsed/refractory  mCRC wi th MAPK pathway dysregulat ion (KRAS or BRAF mutation) 
are ongoi ng.While the preliminary results are promising with clinical benefit o bserved (PRs 
and prolonged SD) in patients with KRAS mutant CRC [35], the limitat ions of MEK 
inhibitors, as iden tified above could also adversely affect the potential benefit of an MEKi + 
irinotecan combinat ion.
Arm 5 will test the hy pothesis that MLN2480 in combinat ion with irinotecan will 
demonstrate clinical benefit in pat ients with mCRC in the presence or absenc e of MAPK 
pathway  dysregulat ion where MLN2480 may  potent iate the clinical act ivity of irinotecan 
therapy .

Confidential 701.4.6 MLN2480 Monotherapy Every Other Day (Arm 6)
MLN2480, administered orally Q OD in cycles of 22 and 28 day s, was evaluated in a 
phase 1, dose escalation trial in pat ients with advanced cancers and in expansio n cohorts of 
patientswith Stage 3 or 4 m elano mas, divided according to tumor genoty pe and treatm ent 
history , as well as in a PK -expansio n cohort of patients with advanced cancers. Doses in the 
dose e scalat ion porti on of  the tri al ranged from  20 to280 m g.  DLTs were observed in 
2patients at 280 m g given in a 22 -day cycle (1 DLT of Grade 3 periorbital edema and 
1DLT of Grade 3 rash).  A total of 80 patients were treated at the MTD of 200 mg given in 
a 28-day cycle, 20 in the PK and 60 in the melanoma expansio n cohorts.  The most 
frequently observed adverse events of all grades were rash (36%); fat igue (30%); anemia 
(26%); elevated CPK (25%); nausea (20%); myalgia, periorbital edema ,and pruri tus (18%) ; 
constipation (16%); and elevated AST (13%).  The most frequent ly observed Grade 3 or 
higher events were rash (9%), anemia (8%), and increased fat igue, elevated CPK and 
elevated AST (3%).  Overall, 50% of the 16 BRAF -mutated melano ma pat ients achieved a 
PR, wi th a median PFS of 4.6 m onths (range ,1.0-40.8) [36].
BRAF codes fo r a kinase in the MAP kinase pathway , and BRAF mutati ons can le ad to 
activat ion of the MAPK pathway , although there are also rare mutations that are 
inact ivating.  BRAF mutations occur in between 3% and 5% of patients with NSCLC, 
mostly in pat ients with adenocarcino mas [1,2,4] .  In various series, these mut ations have 
been shown to exist independently, and tumors characterized by  BRAF mutations generally  
do not demonstrate concomitant mutations in EGFR , ALK ,or ROS [5].  Of these BRAF
mutati ons, approximately  half are V600 m utations, andthe remainder arenon-V600 
mutati ons occurring primarily  in exons 11 and 15 [1].  Although there are several agents that 
can inhibit the BRAF V600 –derived kinase, these same agents are generally  inactive against 
the non -V600 m utated kinases [1].  Data on outcomes for the V600 and the non -V600 
BRAF mutations in NSCLC vary  across different seri es, wi th som e studi es showing better 
survivals for the patients with V600 m utation and others dem onstra ting better survival in 
patients wi th the non -V600 m utations [1,2,4] ; because all of these series include relat ively 
small numbers of pat ients, any  outcom e data m ust be viewed highly crit ically. 
MLN2480 was evaluated in vitro in NCI -H1666 cells harboring the G466V mutation and in 
NCI-H1755 cells harboring the G469A mutation.  In these experiments, MLN2480 was 
associ ated wi th a paradoxi cal increase in phosphor -ERK within a narrow range of 
concentrations; there was no effect on the growth of the cells.  Because o f this, pati ents wi th 
these 2mutations will b e excluded from the study .

Confidential 711.4.7 Rationale for Dosing Schedules and Starting Doses (Escalation Phase)
1.4.7.1 MLN2480
For all arms, study  drug treatm ents will be administered in 28- day cycles. There are no 
readily  apparent risks for clinically  meaningful  mutual  pharm acokinetic (PK) drug- drug 
interact ions (DDIs) between MLN2480 and the 5 agents selected to be combined with 
MLN2480, based on in vitro metabo lism data and physio logically relevant exposures 
achieved at clinical single -agent doses. Therefore dose escalat ion up to the MLN2480 
single- agent m aximum  tolerated dose (MTD) of 200 mg QOD or 600 mg once -weekly 
(QW) will occur as tolerated. Modificat ions to MLN2480 single agent MTD dosing 
schedule for each treatment arm is as fo llows:
Treatment Arms 1 to 3
During the E scalat ion phase, MLN2480 will be administered init ially to all patients in Arms 
1 to 3 according to a m odified QOD schedule on Days 1, 3, and 5 of each week ( ie, Day  1, 3, 
5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26), referred to throughout the protocol as “Q OD 
schedule.” The starting dose of 100 mg for MLN2480 is 50% below the unit dose of 
MLN2480 single -agent MTD (200 mg QOD in 28 -day cycles) determined in clinical Study  
C28001 and is considered a safe starting dose in Arms 1 to 3. Should the dosing schedul e of 
≥ 160 m g QOD prove tol erable in Arm 3, the QW MLN2480 schedule may  then be expl ored. 
MLN2480 (400 mg or 600 mg) QW will init ially be administered according to the same 
schedule to all pat ients in Arm  3:every  week of each cycle on Days 2, 9, 16 and 2 3. The 
starting dose (400 mg or 600 mg) will depend on the MTD of MLN2480 ident ified by the 
QOD dosing schedule ( ie, 600 m g QW approximates the exposure of 200 mg QOD).
MLN2480 administration may be changed to less frequent dosing should the aforement ioned
schedule not be tolerated. 
Treatment Arms 4 and 5 
During the Escalat ion phase, MLN2480 will be initially  administered to all pat ients in 
Arms4 and 5, according to the QW schedule ( ie, Days 2, 9, 16, and 23). The starting dose 
for MLN2480 will be 400 mg QW, which is 33% below the unit dose of MLN2480 single -
agent MTD (600 mg QW in 28 -day cycles) determined in clinical Study  C28001. MLN2480 
administration may be changed to a lower starting dose ( ie, 300 m g QW) or a l ess frequent 
schedule (Days 2, 9, and 1 6) if a ≥ 400 m g QW MLN2480 dose (administered on Days 2, 9, 
16, and 23 of each cycle) is not found to be tolerable in Arm 3 (MLN2480 + paclitaxel).

Confidential 721.4.7.2 MLN0128
The combinat ion dosing regimen for MLN0128 was selected for this study  based on the 
observed safet y and tol erabili ty profile of MLN0128 in the single -agent clinical Study  
INK128 -001. In Study  INK128 -001, no dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) were observed with 
a schedule of 9 -mg MLN0128 administered QD for 3 days followed by  4 days off each 
week (QD 3d QW); thus 9 mg is considered the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for 
single- agent MLN0128 under this schedule. The init ial starting dose of 2 mg of MLN0128 
(QD3d QW) represents 22% of the single -agent MLN0128 RP2D for this schedule.
1.4.7.3 Alisertib
The combinat ion dosing regimen for alisert ib was selected based on the observed safet y and 
tolerabilit y profile of alisertib when administered across many studies as a single agent and 
in combinat ion.On the basis o f these data, the alisertib 3 -days on/4 -days off for 3weeks 
schedule was chosen for this study .The proposed init ial starting dose of 30 mg of alisertib 
twice daily  (BID) on this schedule is 1 dose level below (25% less than) the MTD of 
alisertib when given in co mbinat ion with paclitaxel, which is a cy totoxic agent.
1.4.7.4 Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel will init ially be given at the recommended dose [37-39 ]of 80 m g/m2QW on 
Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. If exposures of MLN2480 are not achieved at MTD 
in combinat ion with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2, the paclitaxel  dose m ay be de -escalated per 
institutional standard. Dose -dense weekly administration of paclitaxel is a proven strategy to 
further enhance ant itumor activit y, especia lly in the re -treatm ent setting. Preclinical and 
clinical studies have demo nstrated that duration of paclitaxel exposure is an important 
determinant of its cy totoxi c effect. Thus, cy totoxi city can be enhanced at fairly  low 
concentrations of paclitaxel prov ided that the exposure is extended, eg, through weekly  
administration. [40-42]
1.4.7.5 Cetuximab
Treatment with cetuximab will co mmence at the recommended dose with a 400 m g/m2
loading dose (Cy cle 1 Day  1), then cont inue at 250 mg/m2QW (Day s 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 
1; Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of all cycles thereafter). If exposures of MLN2480 are not achieved 
at MTD in co mbination wit h cetuximab at 250 mg/m2, the cetuximab dose m ay be 
de-escalated per inst itutional standard.

Irinotecan will be administered at the recommended dose of a 180 mg/m2intravenous 
infusion over 30 to 90 minutes Q2W (Day s 1 and 15). If exposures of MLN2480 are not 
achieved at MTD in combination with irinotecan at 180 mg/m2, the irinotecan dose may be 
de-escalated per institutional standard.
1.4.8 Rationale for Phar macokinetic Assessments
Clinical PK assessments conducted during the Escalation phase of the study will 
characterize the systemic exposures of the respective agents in a combination setting to 
verify the lack of clinically meaningful mutual DDIs, assess achievement of exposures, and 
contribute to exposure/toxicity relationship analyses of these combination treatment arms to support selection of the RP2Ds of the combinations. After analysis of preliminary Escalation data, up to 3 combination treatment arms and regimens will be selected for investigation in 
the Expansion phase.
In the Expansion phase, the effect of MLN2480 on the PK of the combination partner(s) will 
be evaluated in approximately 12 patients at the RP2D of each selected combination.
1.4.9 Rationale for Tumor Characterization
Archival tumor material (or fresh biopsy material, if archival material is unavailable) will be 
requested from all patients before their firs t dose of study drug, with the goal of broadly 
characterizing the factors underlying each patient’s sensitivity/resistance to the respective 
treatment combination. In addition, an optional biopsy from patients who initially respond to 
study treatment a nd then relapse will be requested to identify the genetic underpinnings of 
resistance development.
While candidate biomarkers of sensitivity for MLN2480 (such as BRAF and NRAS
mutations) have been identified, it is unclear from preclinical data obtained to date as to 
whether these mutations also predispose sensitivity to each of the combination agents (ie, with MLN0128, alisertib, paclitaxel, cetuximab, or irinotecan). Moreover, although mutations in phosphoinositide-3-ki nase alpha isoform, phosphatase and tensin homolog, and 
the tumor suppressor complex-1/2 have been hypothesized to be sensitizing to mTOR 
inhibitors, no clear patient selection markers have been identified thus far for single-agent MLN0128, alisertib, paclitaxel, cetuximab, or irinotecan. The exploratory objective proposed for this st udy will attempt

1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits
With the exception of MLN2480, each of the agents administered in this study have been 
administered to patients as a single agent and in combination with other treatments.
MLN2480 has been administered to date as a single agent (see Section  1.3). This is the first 
study in which each of the specific combination treatment arms has been administered in humans. The emerging safety profile of each of the agents, including data from nonclinical 
and clinical studies, has been reviewed to d etermine potential overlapping toxicities that 
may be associated with each agent in the 5 Escalation combination treatment arms. A summary of the overlapping toxicities are discussed in the subsections that follow. Please see Section  1.4for a discussion of the nonclinical evidence suggesting potential benefits 
associated with each of the combination treatment arms.
General risk mitigation strategies for potential AEs in this study include, but are not limited 
to, strict application of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, frequent clinical and laboratory results monitoring, guidelines for management of potential toxicities, criteria for 
dose modification, criteria for determining DLTs, and regular monitoring of AEs and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) by the sponsor. Please see Section  6.8for information on the 
management of a few of the clinical events that may occur in this study. CCI

Based on review of preliminary single -agent clinical data, no major safet y concerns were 
ident ified for the combinat ion of MLN2480 + MLN0128. Potential overlapping toxicit ies of 
the combination include fat igue, rash, nausea, vo miting, di arrhea, and pruritus. These 
toxicities are expected to be manageable with adequate monitoring and standard care.
Based on rat and monkey toxicology  studi es (Study  P024 -09-03, Study  P024 -09-05, Study  
TX-003- 2009, and TX -004-2009), nonclinical overlapping toxicit ies ident ified for the 
combinat ion of MLN2480 + MLN0128 include effects on bone marrow, lymphoid, and GI 
tissue. Monkeys dosed with MLN0128 in 28 -day GLP toxi cology studies demo nstrated skin 
effects. The pot ential for a substant ial increase in toxicit y was assessed by mo nitoring 
limited toxico logy endpoints in nonclinical pharmacology  studi es of MLN2480 + MLN0128 
combinat ion therapy  in mouse xenograft m odels.
In general, administration of MLN0128 + MLN2480 a t doses associated with significant 
antitumor activit y was tolerated, with marked transient decreases in body  weight (< 15%) 
that recovered during the treatment period and end of study  (body  weight l oss of < 7%).
However, 1 mouse out of 6 treated with MLN2480 (50 mg/kg twice weekly) + MLN0128 
(3mg/kg QW) was found dead on Day  9.This mouse had 21.7% body  weight l oss, and the 
cause of death may be related to the combinat ion treatment. The other 5 mice in the 
MLN2480 (50 mg/kg twice weekly) + MLN0128 (3 mg/k g QW) dose group survived to the 
scheduled necropsy  with acceptable decreases in body  weight. There are no major safet y 
concerns based on these nonclinical assessments, and toxicit ies are expected to be 
manageable and will be mo nitored in the clinic.
In vitro, MLN2480 and MLN0128 are metabolized by  multiple cy tochrom e P450s (CYPs).
MLN0128 is metabolized by CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9. In addit ion, MLN2480 is 
metabo lized by aldehyde oxidase. MLN2480 and MLN0128 are not expected to produce 
clinically meaning ful inhibit ion or induct ion of major CYP enzymes at clinical doses based 
on in vitro and clinical PK data. Based on these data, there are no readily apparent risks for 
clinically meaningful mutual PK DDIs between MLN2480 and MLN0128 when 
administered in co mbinat ion.

toxicities are expected to be manageable with adequate monitoring and standard care.
Based on rat, dog, and monkey  toxicology studi es, no nclinical overlapping toxicit ies 
ident ified for the combinat ion of MLN2480 + alisertib include effects on bone marrow and 
lympho id tissue. The potential for a substant ial increase in toxicit y was assessed by  
monitoring limited toxico logy endpo ints in the n onclinical pharmacol ogy studi es of  the 
MLN2480 + MLN8237 co mbinat ion in mouse xenograft m odels.In general, administration 
of MLN2480 + MLN8237 at doses associated with significant antitumor activit y was 
tolerated, wi th marked transient decreases in body  weight (< 9%) that recovered during the 
treatm ent peri od (Study MLP -132). There are no major safety concerns based on this 
nonclinical assessment and toxicities are expected to be manageable and will be mo nitored 
in the clinic.
In vitro, MLN2480 is metabo lized by  aldehyde oxidase and m ultiple CYPs. Alisert ib is 
metabo lized by CYP3A (major) and glucuronidation, based on preliminary results fro m 
human ADME (absorption, distribution, metabo lism, excret ion) and fo llow-up in vi tro 
investigat ions.The systemic exposure of alisert ib may be altered by moderate and strong 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 and clinically significant enzyme inducers. Based on in vitro and 
clinical PK data, MLN2480 and alisert ib are not expected to produce clinically meaningful 
inhibit ion or induct ion of major CYP enzymes at clinical doses. Although alisert ib is a weak 
inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MLN2480 is not a P -gp substrate and therefore DDI via 
P-gp inhibit ion is not anticipated. These data suggest that there are no readily apparent risks
for clinically  meaningful  mutual  PK DDIs between MLN2480 and alisert ib when 
administered in combinat ion.

intoxicity was assessed by  monitoring limi ted toxicol ogy endpoints in the nonclinical 
pharmaco logy studi es of therapy  with MLN2480 + docetaxel in mouse xenograft models.
(Docetaxel was used as a surrogate for paclitaxel.) In general, administration of MLN24 80 
+docetaxel at doses associated with significant antitumor activit y was tol erated, wi th 
marked decreases in body  weight (< 17%; Study MLP -132). There are no major safet y 
concerns based on these nonclinical assessments, and toxicit ies are expected to be 
manageable and will be mo nitored in the clinic.
In vitro, MLN2480 is metabo lized by aldehyde oxidas e and m ultipleCYPs. Paclitaxel is 
metabo lized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A, and is a substrate of P -gp.Based on in vit roand 
clinical PK data, MLN2480 is not expect ed to produce clinically meaningful inhibit ion or 
induct ion of major CYP enzymes at clinical doses. Paclitaxel is not reported to be a 
clinically meaningful perpetrator of metabo lic/transporter -based DDIs. Taken together, there 
are no readily  apparent ri sks for clinically  meaningful  mutual  PK DDIs between MLN2480

As m entioned in Sect ion 1.5.1.4 , MLN2480 is not ex pected to produce clinically meaningful 
inhibit ion or induct ion of major CYP enzymes at clinical doses. Irinotecan is metabo lized by 
CYP3A4/5 [44]. In addit ion, irinotecan is activated by  hydrolysis to SN -38, an inhibitor of 
topoi somerase I. Uri dine di phosphate gl ucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) converts SN -
38 to inact ive SN -38 gl ucuroni de. The metabolic conversio n of irinotecan to the active 
metabo lite SN -38 is mediated by carboxylesterase enzymes. Taken together, there are no 
readily  apparent risks for clinically  meaningful  mutual  PK DDIs between MLN2480 and 
irinotecan when administered in combinat ion.

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overview of Study DesignThis is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1b study that incorporates a Dose Escalation 
(Escalation) phase and a Dose Expansion (E xpansion) phase. The study will enroll adult 
patients with advanced, solid (nonhematologic)  malignancies and who, in the opinion of the 
treating physician, have failed standard therapies and for whom a phase 1 trial is an appropriate option.
The Escalation phase will investigate 5 combination arms (ie, MLN2480 + MLN0128, 
MLN2480 + alisertib, MLN2480 + paclitaxel, MLN2480 + cetuximab, and MLN2480 + irinotecan). This study is the first to administer these combinations to humans.
Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each combination treatment arm has been 
established in the Escalation phase, up to 3 combination treatment arms and regimens will 
be evaluated in the Expansion phase based on tolerability and exposure data collected during Escalation. The combination of MLN2480 + paclit axel will be administered to patients with 
KRAS exon 2 or BRAF non-V600 mutation-positive NSCLC who are naïve to previous 
treatment with RAF or MEK inhibitors. The  combination of MLN2480 + cetuximab will be 
administered to patients with BRAF V600 or non-canonical RAS mutation-positive mCRC.CCI

Confidential 81Finally, the combination of MLN2480 + irinotecan will be administered to patients with 
previously treated mCRC who are naïve to previous treatment with RAF or MEK inhibitors.
Finally, MLN2480 will be administered QOD to patients with NSCLC with non-V600 
BRAF mutations.
Throughout the study, AEs, SAEs, laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination 
findings, ECOG performance status, and ECGs will be obtained to evaluate the combination 
treatment arms. Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010. [45] Dose-limiti ng toxicities (DLTs) are defined in Section  6.2. Study drug 
may be discontinued if a patient experiences study treatment-r elated toxicity.
Serial blood samples to measur e plasma concentrations of MLN 2480 and the respective 
combination agents will be collected during Cycle 1 at prespecified time points as indicated in the respective  Schedules of Events table and described in Section 7.4.18. Underlying 
disease status will be assessed by the investigator per RECIST (version 1.1) using 
radiological evaluations (computed axial tomography [CT] scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI], as clinically indicated). In both study phases,  
 
Doing so will enable understanding of the mechanisms associated with 
sensitivity and resistance to the drug combinations.
Patients may choose to discontinue therapy at any time. Patients will attend an End of Study 
visit 30 (+ 10) days after receiving their last dose of study drug.
4.2 Number of Patients
Approximately 125 patients we re originally planned for this study.  As of this Amendment 6, 
81 patients have been enrolled (several treatment arms were not completely enrolled).  Evaluable patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 10 to 15 study centers 
in the US and Europe. Of these patients, approximately 49 will be enrolled in the Escalation 
phase (ie, approximately 4 for Arm 1; approximately 15 for Arm 2; approximately 18 for Arm 3; approximately 6 for Arm 4; approximately 6 for Arm 5). Approximately 76 to 88patients will be enrolled in the Expansion phase (approximately 16 for Arm 3,
approximately 30 for Arm 4, approximately 30 for Arm 5, and approximately 12 for Arm 6).
Because a 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be used, the actual sample size will depend upon the number of dose escalation steps and number of patients required per cohort. Patients enrolled into the Escalation phase are not eligible to participate in the Expansion phase. Up CCI

4.3 Duration of Study
Patients will  parti cipate in the Screening and Treatment periods. During screening, patient 
eligibilit y for the study  will be determined wi thin 28 day s before Cy cle1, Day 1.During the 
Treatment period, patients will take their assigned study drug combinat ion in 28 -day 
treatm ent cycles until they  experience disease progres sion, an unacceptable toxicit y occurs, 
or the pati ent discont inues for any  other reason. Treatment in any pat ient will not exceed 
12cycles wit hout pri or consul tation wi th the sponsor. Patients who tol erate treatm ent and 
have evidence of clinical benefit a fter 12 cycles in the opinio n of the invest igator may 
continue treatment with continued mo nitoring upon pri or revi ew and approval by  the project 
clinician.
Each patient will attend an End of Study  visit 30 days (+ 10days) after his/her last study  
drug dos e, or the start of subsequent ant icancer therapy , whichever occurs first, to permit the 
detection of any delayed treatment -related AEs.

6.1 Study Drug Administration 
All protocol -specific cri teria for administrati on of  study  drug m ust be m et and docum ented 
prior to drug administration.  Study  drug will  be administered only to eligible pat ients under 
the supervisio n of the invest igator or ident ified subinvestigator(s).
Millennium -spon sored drug product will be provided to the study  sites.  Commercially  
available paclitaxel, cetuximab, and irinotecan will be procured or distributed according to 
the Pharmacy Manual.  
Study  drugs will be administered in 28 -day cycles (all  arms and both t he Escalat ion and the 
Expansio n phases).  During the Escalat ion phase, MLN2480 will init ially be administered 
according to the schedules outlined in the protocol, but may be changed to less frequent 
dosing should the init ial schedule not be tolerated.
Eligible pat ients will report to the study  site to receive thei r respect ive study  treatment on 
days specified in the corresponding Schedules of Events .  On dosing days when the patient 
does not have a clinic visit, patients will take their assigned oral study  drug dose (ie, 
MLN2480, MLN0128, and alisert ib, as applicable) at home. Patients shoul d be encouraged 
to take their doses at approximately the same time on each scheduled dosing day and not to 
take m ore than th e prescribed dose at any  time.  Pati ents will  be instructed to record in their 
dosing diary  each dose they  take.  Patients shoul d also record the occurrence of emesis and 
any missed doses in their dosing diaries and resume dosing at the next scheduled time with 
the prescribed dose.  All missed doses or doses administered within approximately  1 hour 
before a vo miting episode should be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).

dosing only) or otherwise should be skipped, and the next dose should be taken as scheduled.  
A missed dose of MLN0128 or alisertib should be taken within 6 hours or should otherwise 
be skipped, and the next dose should be taken as scheduled.  A ny skipped dose should be 
considered a missed dose.  Doses should not be doubled -up or repeated to m ake up for 
missed doses; instead, patients should resume dosing at the next scheduled time wit h the 
prescribed dose.  If severe emesis or mucosit is prevents the pati ent from taking a scheduled 
dose, the dose will not be re -administered and will be skipped.

Toxicit y will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE, versio n4.03, effective 
14June 2010 .[45]  These criteria are provided in the Study  Manual . 
A DLT will be defined as any o f the following events that are considered by  the invest igator 
to be at l east possibly related to therapy  with MLN2480, MLN0128, alisertib, paclitaxel , 
cetuximab, or irinotecan : 
Any AE Grade 3 or higher that i s assessed as at least possibly  related to study  drug 
with the excepti ons noted bel ow.
Delay in the ini tiation of  Cycle 2 due to a l ack of adequate recovery  from treatm ent-
related toxi city (recovery  to ≤Grade 1 or to the patient’s baseline, or to a level 
considered acceptable by the invest igator after discussio n with the proj ect clinician) 
of ≥2 weeks due to hematologic toxicit y belie ved to be unrelated to tumor 
infiltrat ion; bone marrow evaluat ion may be required.
Except ions:
Hem atologic toxici ties, including:
Grade 4 neutropenia last ing < 7 day s in durat ion in the absence of fever > 38.5 C 
sustained for > 1 hour
Grade 3 neutropenia i n the absence of fever > 38.5°C sustained for > 1 hour
Nonhematologic toxicit ies:
Nausea, vo miting, and diarrhea will be considered DLTs only if they  persist at 
≥Grade 3 for > 3 days despite adequate supportive care measures.  At the 
investigator’s discret ion, pati ents who experience nausea, vo miting, or diarrhea after 
taking study  drug may receive ant iemetic or antidiarrheal medication before 
subsequent doses of study  drug.  Exception for patients receiving MLN0128:  
antiemetic drugs that are associated with a risk for QT prolongat ion (including 
ondansetron) will not be administered.  The use of palonosetron is acceptable.
Isolated ≥Grade 3 laboratory  abnormalit ies that resolve to ≤Grade 1 in ≤ 7days 
without clinical sequelae or need for therapeutic intervent ion will not be considered a 
DLT.

Asymptomat ic elevat ion of creat ine phosphokinase will not be considered a DLT.
Asymptomat ic hypophosphatemia (< Grade 4) will not be considered a DLT.
Although DLTs may  occur at any  point during treatm ent, only  those DLTs occurring during 
Cycle 1 will influe nce decisio ns regarding dose escalat ion, expansio n of a dose level, or 
evaluat ion of intermediate dose levels.  Patients will be mo nitored throughout all cycles of

6.3 Dose Escalation Rules 
In the Dose Escalat ion pha se, MLN2480 will init ially be administered, according to the 
schedules indicated, to patients in each co mbinat ion arm .  One cycle will consist of 28 days 
in each arm .  The fi rst 3 patients in Arm 1 (MLN2480 + MLN0128) will receive the 
MLN0128 starting dose of 2mg on the days indicated in Table 6.1.  The first 3 patients in 
Arm2 (MLN2480 + alisert ib) will receive the alisertib starting dose of 30 mg BID on the 
days indicated in Table 6.2.  The first 3 patients in Arm 3 (MLN2480 + paclitaxel) will 
receive paclitaxel (80 mg/m2QW) on the days indicated in Table 6.3. The first 3 patients in 
Arm 4 (MLN2480 + cetuximab) will receive cetux imab (400/250 mg/m2QW) on the day s 
indicated in Table 6.4.  The first 3 patients in Arm 5 (MLN2480 + irinotecan) will receive 
irinotecan (180 mg/m2every  2 weeks [Q2W]) on the days indicated in Table 6.5.
A modified 3 + 3 dose escalation design will be used concurrently across the 5 combinat ion 
arms.  An End -of-Cohort m eeting scheduled by the sponsor will occur after the last patient 
in each cohort in the Dose Escalat ion phase has completed the first treatment cy cle/DLT 
observat ion peri od (ie, Day  1 to Day  28) for careful assessment of AEs, before escalat ing to 
the next dose.  Pending the documented outcome of this meet ing, doses will be escalated 
according to the fo llowing rules.
Starti ng wit h the treatment of 3 patients at the planned dose levels described previously, the 
dose intervals for each treatment arm will fo llow the 3 +3 tradi tional escalat ion rules:
1.If 0 of 3 patients experiences DLT, dose escalat ion will proceed to the next higher 
dose l evel at which 3 pati ents will be enrolled.
2.If 1 of 3 patients experiences DLT, 3 more patients will be enrolled at that same dose 
level.

Confidential 1096.4 Dose Modification Guidelines
6.4.1 Intrapatient Dose Escalation
To provi de pati ents the opportunit y to derive m aximum  clinical benefi t from study  drug, 
patients in the dose escalat ion cohorts that are receiving treatment below the MTD/RP2D 
may be allowed to dose escalate provided that, during the most recent cycle, there have been 
no nonhematologic AEs ≥ Grade 2 related to the study  drug combinat ion, no dose 
interrupti ons related to study  drug toxi cities, and no del ays of > 1 week in starting a cycle 
due to study  drug toxi cities.  For a pati ent to escalate to the next dose level, the level above 
the proposed escalated dose must first be deem ed safe; for hematologic and chemistry  resul t 
requi rements, see Section 7.4.16.1 .
The sponsor, in collaboration with the invest igators, will determine on a case -by
-case basis 
whether intrapatient dose escala tion is appropriate.  Patients who have had any dose 
reducti ons will  not be permi tted to dose re -escalate .
6.4.2 Dose- Modification Guidelines (Dose Delays, Reductions, and Interruptions)
6.4.2.1 Dose Escalation 
Any pat ient in the Dose Escalat ion phase whose toxicit y meets a cri terion of  a DLT will 
discontinue study  treatm ent.  In som e cases, the dose of study  treatm ent m ay be reduced, 
following discussio n between the invest igator and the sponsor.
If the patient experiences Grade 3 or 4 fat igue, the patient will stop t aking study  drug.  
The patient may  resume taking the ori ginal  dose of study  drug if the fat igue reso lves 
to ≤Grade 1 within 7 days.  Patients in the Dose Escalat ion phase will discont inue 
study  treatm ent if they experience fatigue that resolves to ≤Grade 1 in > 7 days. 
If the patient experiences an asymptomat ic laboratory  abnorm ality as outlined in 
Secti on6.2, the pati ent will stop taking study  drug.  The pati ent m ay resume taking 
the original dose of study  drug if the laboratory  abnorm ality reso lves to ≤Grade 1 
within 7 days.  Pati ents in the Dose Escalat ion phase will discont inue study  treatm ent 
if they experience an asymptomat ic laboratory  abnorm ality that resolves to 
≤Grade 1 in > 7 day s.  
If the patien t experi ences a ≥Grade 3 AE, the patient will stop taking study drug.  If 
the AE resolves to ≤Grade 2 in ≤14 days, the pati ent can resume taking study  drug.

Confidential 110If the AE does not resolve to ≤Grade 2 after 14 days, the patient must discont inue 
study  treat ment.
6.4.2.2 Dose Expansion
In the case of an individual pat ient experiencing an event meeting the definit ion of a DLT 
during any cycle, treatment will be delayed unt il toxicit y is reduced to ≤Grade 1 or the 
patient’s baseline.  For hematologic events, see Sect ion 7.4.16.1 .  
When a dose modificat ion is warranted for safet y and the toxi city is thought to be 
attributable to MLN2480, the investigator should first consider reductions for the MLN2480 
dose, if appropriate.   
Depending on the nature and severit y of the AE, and under discretion 
of the invest igator with agreement from the sponsor, the fo llowing dose m odificat ions are 
recommended:
Patients in the combinat ion arm s who experience a Grade 2 related AE may have 
their MLN2480 dose decreased by 1 dose level.   Pati ents in the m onotherapy  arm 
may have their MLN2480 dose decreased to 160 mg.
Patients in the combinat ion arm s who experience a Grade 3 related AE may have 
their MLN2480 dose decreased by 1 dose level.   Pati ents in the m onotherapy  arm 
may have their MLN2480 dose decreased to 160 mg.
Patients who experience an AE Grade 3 (regardless of relatedness to MLN2480) 
may stop taking MLN2480.  If MLN2480 is held and the AE subsequent ly reso lves 
to ≤Grade 2 in ≤14 days, the pati ent can resume taking MLN2480 either at the 
original  dose or a reduced dose, per invest igator a nd sponsor discret ion.  If the AE 
does not resolve to ≤Grade 2 after 14 days, the patient must discontinue study  
treatm ent.
The sponsor must be notified of any MLN2480 dose modificat ions.
Dose m odificat ion of MLN0128, alisertib, paclitaxel, cetuximab, or irinotecan may  also be 
considered for events judged by  the invest igator to be direct ly related to these agents; see 
Secti on 6.8for informat ion on the m anagement of parti cular clinical events.  If there is no 
apparent cl arity then both agents should be reduced.  Doses will be reduced to the prior dose 
level as indicated in the appropriate table in Sect ion 6.3(for paclitaxel, cetuximab, or 
irinotecan, reduce per inst itutional standard).  Pati ents can have a maximum o f 2 dose 
modificati ons (if applicable) of MLN2480, MLN0128, or alisertib, as appropriate.

6.8.2.1 Management of Hyperglycemia
Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are known toxicit ies associated with inhibit ion of 
mTOR and related pathway s based on nonclinical stu dies. A rise in fast ing plasma glucose 
has been observed as early as 1 to 2days fo llowing oral  administrati on of  MLN0128.
In addit ion to obtaining fast ing blood glucose levels at the clinic visits outlined in the 
Schedules of Events for Arm 1, all pat ients receiving MLN0128 will be provided with a 
glucometer and trained in its use to monitor their daily predose fasting blood glucose (FBG) 
levels at ho me during Cycles 1 and 2; see Sect ion 7.4.16.2 .Guidelines for management of 
hyperglycemia in pat ients receiving MLN0128 are presented in Table 6.17.

> 1 but ≤ 2 weeks: reduce by 20%
2 weeks: stop MLN0128 and 
discontinue patient from the study
Prevention/Prophylaxis
Follow fasting glucose levels during clinic visits.
Monitor home glucometer test results.
Check HbA1c levels ever y 3 mo nths during therapy.
Recommend lifestyle modifications, as appropriate (ba lanced diet including limited consumption of 
carbohydrates and alcohol, increased physical activity). Most episodes of Grade 1 and 2 hyperglycemia 
respond quickly to oral metformin. Early  initiatio n of therapy is recommended to prevent higher grade 
hypergl ycemia.
FBG levels ≥ 150 mg/dL by glucometer should be followed by closer monitoring of serum glucose and 
possible intervention.

Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 123Based on the clinical experience in MLN0128 trials, most episodes of hyperglycemia 
observed have been Grade 1 or Grade 2 and have responded quickly to oral met formin.
Hyperglycemia has not been dose limit ing in these trials since the inst itution of  a standard 
regimen for the early  treatm ent of hyperglycemia. Glucose l evels in pat ients who develop 
hyperglycemia during this study  shoul d be cl osely m onitored. The invest igator may choose 
either to continue close monitoring of patients who develop Grade 1 hy perglycemia (fasting 
glucose > ULN ≤160 m g/dL) or consider init iating treatment with an oral hypoglycemic 
agent such as met formin. All patients with ≥ Grade 2 hy perglycemia (fast ing glucose 
> 160 mg/dL) must be treated aggressively wit h oral  hypoglycemic agents and/o r insulin as 
clinically indicated while cont inuing on MLN0128 treatment. The invest igator should 
consult an endocrino logist if needed to aid in optimizing the hyperglycemia treatment plan 
of the pati ent.
It is recommended that patients be treated init ially with a fast-acting insulin sensit izer, such 
as oral  metformin (500 mg QD), and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg orally BID as 
needed. Concurrent addit ion to m etformin of dipepti dyl pept idase -4 inhibitors 
(eg,sitaglipt in or vildaglipt in) and/or insulin should al so be considered. Oral sulfo nylureas 
(eg,glipizide or glyburide) should be used wit h cauti on due to the higher risk of inducing 
hypoglycemia in pat ients.The dose of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in 
patients wi th renal insufficiency .

6.8.3 Alisertib 
6.8.3.1 Management of Nausea and Vomiting
Prophylactic ant iemetic therapy  may be used in patients receiving alisertib per standard of 
care. Because of the potential for benzodiazepines to cause sedat ion, the use of 
benzodiazepines for ant iemetic prophylaxis should be reserved for patients who cannot be 
satisfactorily m anaged otherwise.
6.8.3.2 Management of Diarrhea
Antidiarrheal medicat ions will not be used prophylactically; however, patients should be 
instructed to take loperamide or comparable antidiarrheal medicat ion per standard guidelines.
Fluid intake should be maintain ed to avoi d dehydrati on.
6.8.3.3 Management of Central Nervous System Effects
If a patient experiences excessive sedat ion believed to be related to alisertib, treatment with 
alisertib should be interrupted. Patients whose sedation is not considered immediately li fe-
threatening should be carefully  monitored and given appropri ate supporti ve care; the 
alisertib dose should be reduced whenever indicated.

8.1.3 Populations for Analysis
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety popul ation:patients who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug on Cy cle 1, 
Day 1 will be used for all safet y and PFS analyses.
PK-evaluable population: patients with sufficient dosing data and concentration -time 
data of MLN2480 and the respective co mbinat ion agent to permit calculation o f PK 
param eters.
Response -evaluable populat ion:patients who receive at least 1 dose of study  drug, 
have measurable disease at baseline, and 1 postbaseline response assessment will be 
used for response -related efficacy  analyses (ORR, DOR, time to response, and PFS). 
DLT -evaluable populat ion:  pati ents who ei ther experi ence DLT during Cyc le 1, or 
receive ≥ 75% of scheduled doses and co mplete all study  procedures in Cycle 1 
without DLT.  
8.1.4 Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
All available efficacy and safet y data will be included in data listings and tabulations.  No 
imputati on of  values f or missing data will be performed with the except ion of AUC 
calculat ion in PK analyses where the predose concentration in an individual fo llowing 
multiple-dose administration may  be used in place of the concentration at the end of the 
dosing interval (or vi ce versa) if 1 of these data points is not available and scient ific 
considerations based on PK characterist ics of MLN2480 and the respective co mbinat ion 
agent support conclusio n of achievement of steady -state on the day  of PK sampling.

arms will be based on the best overall response.  Investigators will assess response per 
RECIST gui delines (versio n1.1)[46] at each scheduled time po int.  The best overall 
response for each patient will be programmat ically derived fro m among the reported 
responses.   
Efficacy parameters include ORR (complete response +partial response), time to response, 
DOR, and PFS.  The response rates, time to response, and DOR will be analyzed based on 
the response -evaluable popul ation.  PFS will be analyzed based on safet y population.
Time to response is defined as the time from the patient’s date of enrollment to the 
date of the first documentation of a confirmed response.
Durati on of  response is defined as the time from the date of first documentation of a 
confirmed response to the date of first documented progression of disease.
PFS i s defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first documented 
progression of disease or death.
Durati on of  response and PFS will be analyzed using standard survival analysis t echniques 
based on Kaplan -Meier est imates.  If appropriate, the associat ion between responses and 
PFS am ong patients with or without responses may  be examined. 
Response categories, DOR, time to response, and PFS will be presented in list ings and

8.1.8 Safety Analysis
The incidence of DLT will be tabulated for each combination arm and in each phase of the 
study.  The DLT-evaluable population will be used for the analysis of DLT.  In addition, to 
assess the relationship between toxicities and the tested dose regimens of the combination arms, the preferred term of individual toxiciti es will be summarized by their frequency and 
intensity for each dose group and treatment arm.  
Safety will be evaluated by the incidence of AEs, severity and type of AEs, and by changes 
from baseline in the patient’s vital signs, we ight, and clinical laboratory results using the 
safety population.  Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated.
Treatment-emergent AEs that occur after administration of the first dose of study drug and

9. ADVERSE EVENTS
9.1 Definitions
9.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject who has 
signed inform ed consent to parti cipate in a study  but before administration of any study  
medicat ion; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relat ionship with study  
participat ion.
9.1.2 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse event (AE) means any  untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any  
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 149unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom, or 
disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal (investigational) product whether 
or not i t is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a 
previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of 
study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by the investiga tor to be a clinically significant change from baseline.  
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious AE (SAE) m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization
(see clarificati onin the paragraph below on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity .  (Di sabili ty is defined 
as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately  life threatening, or require hospitalizat ion, but may be considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the pati ent, 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring in tensive 
treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at hom e, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the develo pment of drug dependency or 
drug abuse; any  organism, virus, or infect ious parti cle (eg, prion protein transmit ting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 150In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 Ju ne 2010. [45]  Clarificat ion shoul d be 
made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 
or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe
is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT 
the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described 
above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to 
funct ion.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  
For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 
(severe) b ut may not be consi dered seri ous.  Seri ousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory  reporti ng obligat ions.
9.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m 
study  personnel or revealed by  observati on, physical  examinat ion, or other diagnostic 
procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Sect ion 9.3for the 
period of  observat ion).  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory  assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a 
commo n underlying pathology  shoul d be noted as 1 com prehensive e vent.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Sect ion 9.1) 
must be reported (see Section
 9.3for the period of observat ion) by th e invest igator to the 
Millennium Department of Pharmacovigilance or designee (contact informat ion provi ded 
below).  This should be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after beco ming aware 
of the event.  The SAE Form, created specifically by  Millenn ium, will be provided to each 
clinical study  site.  A sam ple of  the SAE Form  may be found in the Study  Manual.  Follow -
up informat ion on the SAE or serious pretreatment event may be requested by Millennium.  
SAE report informat ion must be consistent with t he data provided on the eCRF.

Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Amendment 6, EudraCT: 2014-003340-12
Confidential 151SAE Reporting Contact Information
The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, investigators, and ethics committees as applicable, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted. Specifically in  the EU, the sponsor will ensure that all 
relevant information from SUSARs that are fatal or life-threatening is recorded and reported 
as soon as possible to the regulatory authorities  in all the Member States concerned, and to 
the Ethics Committee, and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the sponsor of such a case, and relevant follow-up information is subsequently communicated within an 
additional 8 days. All other SUSARs shall be reported to the regulatory authorities 
concerned and to the Ethics Committee concerned as soon as possible within a maximum of 15 days of first knowledge by the spons or. The sponsor will also inform all the 
investigators in the clinical trial.
Once a year throughout the conduct of the clinical trial, the sponsor will provide the 
regulatory authorities in whose territory th e clinical trial is being conducted and the Ethics 
Committees with a listing of all SUSARs that have occurred over the past year and a report of the subjects’ safety.
Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed 
before study drug was administered on Cycle 1, Day 1 are not to be considered AEs unless 
the condition deteriorated in an unexpected  manner during the trial (eg, surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of 
the event and the relationship of the even t to study drug administration.  For serious 
pretreatment events, the investigator must deter mine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study procedures.CCI
MLN2480
Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 152Intensit y for each AE, including any lab abnormality , will  be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 .[45]  The cri teria are provided in 
the Study  Manual .
Relationship to study  drug administration will be determined by the invest igator responding 
yes or no to this question:  Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the AE is associated with the 
study drug?
9.3 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as fo llows:  
AEs will be reported from the first dose of study  drug through 30 days after 
administration of the last dose of study  drug or the start of subsequent antineoplast ic 
therapy  (whichever occurs first), and recorded in the eCRFs.  That is, if a patient 
begins a new antineoplast ic therapy, the AE reporting period for nonserious AEs 
ends at the time the new treat ment is started.
Serious pretreatm ent events will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee and recorded in the Safet y database from the time o f 
the signing of the ICF up to first dose of study  drug, but will not be recorded in the 
eCRF. Pretreatment AEs (nonserious) will be recorded in the eCRF as part of the 
patient’s medical history . If a pretreatment event worsens following init iation of 
study  drug, the corresponding TEAE is documented in the clinical database.
Related an d unrelated SAEs will be reported to the Millennium Department of 
Pharmacovigilance or designee from the signing of the informed consent form 
through 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug and recorded in 
the eCRF.  After this period, only related SAEs must be reported to the Millennium 
Departm ent of Pharm acovi gilance or desi gnee.  SAEs shoul d be m onitored until  they 
are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
condi tion or intercurrent illness(es). 
9.4 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this 
study , she must inform  the invest igator immediately and permanently discontinue study  drug.   
The sponsor must also be contacted immediately  by faxing a com pleted Pregnancy Form  to

pregnancy must be fo llowed for the fina l pregnancy  outcom e.
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male pat ient’s 
participat ion in this study , the sponsor must also be contacted immediately  by faxing a 
completed Pregnancy  Form to the Millennium Department of Pharmacov
igilance or 
designee (see Section 9.2).  Every  effort shoul d be made to follow the pregnancy  for the 
final pregnancy outcome.
9.5 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
The spon sor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reacti ons (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, including the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) ,investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in 
accordance with nat ional regulat ions in the countries where the study  is conducted. Relat ive 
to the first awareness o f the event by /or further provisio n to the sponsor or sponsor’s 
designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory  authori ties as an expedite d report 
within 7 calendar days for fatal and life- threatening events and 15 calendar day s for other 
serious events, unless otherwise required by nat ional regul ations. The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where these mi ght m aterially alter the 
current benefit -risk assessment of an invest igational medicinal product or that would be 
sufficient to consider changes in the investigat ional medicinal product’s administration or in 
the overall conduct of the trial. The investiga tional si te also will forward a copy  of all 
expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accordance with national regulat ions.
10. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUI REMENTS

aThe e ffect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent.  Studies have shown that it can be classified as a strong CYP3A inhibitor when a certain 
preparation was used (eg, high dose, double strength) or as a moderate CYP3A inhibitor when another 
preparation was used (eg, low dose, single strength).

Confidential 16614.5 Detailed Description of Amendments to Text
The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affe cted by the changes in Amendment 6 are 
indicated. The corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol. 
Change 1:Add a cohort of patients with NSCLC and non -V600 BRAF mutati ons.
The primary  change occurs in Section 4.1Overview of Study  Design :
Added
text:Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each combination treatm ent arm  
has been established in the Escalat ion phase, up to 3 combination treatment arms 
and one monotherapy  will be evaluated in the Expansio n phase based on 
tolerabilit y and exposure data collected during Escalat ion. The combinat ion of 
MLN2480 + paclitax el will be administered to patients with KRAS exon 2 or 
BRAF non -V600 m utation-positive NSCLC who are naïve to previous treatment 
with RAF or MEK inhibitors. The combinat ion of MLN2480 + cetuximab will 
be administered to patients with BRAF V600 or non- cano nical RAS mutation -
positive mCRC. The combinat ion of MLN2480 + irinotecan will be administered 
to patients with previously  treated m CRC who are naïve to previous treatment 
with RAF or MEK inhibitors. Finally, MLN2480 will be administered QO D to 
patients wi th NSCLC with non -V600 BRAF mutations.
Rationale for Change:
To define the patient population for enrollment in the Arm 6 expansio n cohort of MLN2480 
given as mo notherapy  QOD in pat ients with NSCLC and non -V600 BRAF mutations. This 
is a population that d oes not respond to currently available V600 BRAF inhibitors and so 
remains underserved.
The fo llowing sect ions also contain this change:

Clinical Study Protocol C28002 Am endment 6 , EudraCT: 2014 -003340 -12
Confidential 167Change 2:Add inclusion criterion 19 , which define sthe popul ation eligible for enrollment 
into the Arm  6 expansi on cohort aspatients with BRAF non-V600 m utation-positive 
NSCLC.
The primary  change occurs in Section 5.1Inclusio n Cri teria:
Added 
text:19. Additional inclusion criteria for Arm 6 Expansion Only (MLN2480)
a.Patients with NSCLC who are EGFR, ALK, and ROS negative and 
have received a minimum of 2 regimens, including a platinum -based 
regimen an d a PD -1/PD- L1 directed agent, unless otherwise 
contraindicated, and whose tumors harbor non -V600 BRAF 
mutations, except for the G466V and G469A mutations.
Rationale for Change:
To specify the ty pe of  NSCLC and pri or treatm ent requi rements for patients to be included 
in the MLN2480 monotherapy  arm (Arm 6). 
Change 3: Revise exclu sion criterion 15 to include the new Arm 6 expansio ncohort .
The primary  change occurs in S ection 5.2Exclusio n Cri teria:
Initial 
wording:15. Addit ional exclusio n criteria for Arm s 3 and 5 Expansio n Only 
(MLN2480 + paclitaxel; MLN2480 + irinotecan):
Amended
or new 
wording:15. Addit ional exclusio n criteria for Arm s 3,and 5, and 6 Expansio n Only 
(MLN2480 + paclitaxel; MLN2480 + irinotecan ; MLN2480 
monotherapy ):
Rationale for Change:
To specify the ty pe of prior treatm ent requi rements for patients to be excluded from the 
MLN2480 monotherapy  arm (Arm 6).

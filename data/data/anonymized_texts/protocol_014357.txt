The purpose of this pivotal investigation is to  evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational 
Cutera® 1726 nm laser system (  for the treatment of mild to severe acne vulgaris. 
Data from this investigation is intended to support a  future  510(k) submission to obtain marketing 
clearance for the intended use listed above . 
2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
2.1 Acne Vulgaris  
Acne Vulgaris is one of the most common dermato logical conditions and affects a significant number of 
adolescents and  adults.1, 2, 3   It develops in  the pilo sebaceous units of the skin from the following four 
factors —excess sebum production, the presence of the Propionibacterium  acnes  (P. acnes ) bacteria, 
follicular epidermal hyper proliferation that plugs the follicle , and inflammation. It can have severe 
psychological effects and can leave the patient with severe skin scarring.3, 4, 5, 6  
 
Currently,  standard acne treatment includes the use of topical and systemic medications, with the choice 
of treatment often determined by disease severity, but also by patient prefe rences and cost 
considerations.5 
Topical treatments work to reduce the level of follicle obstruction and reduce the bacterial load and 
inflammation. Of the topical medications, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, salicylic acid, and 
antibiotic solutions are used regularly, eith er alone or in combination with other treatments.  
Combinations have been reported to increase effectiveness, especially with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids and topical antibiotics such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or tetracycline.
  Topical retinoids are indicated 
as a first -line treatment in patients with non- inflammatory lesions.6  Because the use of topical antibiotics 
may lead to resistance in the P. acnes  bacteria, the  use of benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and other non -
antibiotic medications are an important adjunct to antibiotic therapy. 3, 6 
Systemic medications include oral antibiotics, anti- androgens, and isotretinoin.  Oral antibiotics, among 
other potential mechanisms of action, target bacteria and directly reduce inflammation .  Oral anti -
androgens such as low estrogen oral contraceptives, are indicated after failure of standard antibiotic regimens, and act to reduce the sebum driving effects of testosterone.
 5  Oral isotretinoin has remained 
the most effective systemic medication for moderate to severe acne as well as for refractory cases.  It acts 
to affect cell progression, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis, as well as reduces sebum production, comedogenesis, P. acnes  load, and inflammation.
5, 6, 7       
Each of these treatments has its limitations. For example, oral isotretinoin has serious side effects of teratogenicity and possibly psychiatric effects, which can limit the safety and utility of the drug for many patients.
7 Although topical and oral antibiotics have been used successfully in the treatment of acne for 
decades, the concern over antibiotic resistance continues to grow.3 As such, alternative, yet effective new 
treatments are still needed. While topical and systemic medications remain the gold standard for treatment of acne vulgaris, laser therapy which has emerged in recent decades as an effective treatment of acne vulgaris  may be an additional option for some patients, especially for those who cannot tolerate 
standard treatments or for refractory cases.
6 
There are two main mechanisms of action for treatment of acne with light therapy. First, blue or red light sources, green or yellow light lasers, and intense pulsed light (IPL) devices kill P. acnes  directly . Second,

All AEs/ SAEs and  ADEs/SADEs will be: (1) evaluated, monitored and tracked from the time of the first study 
treatment  and (2) must be recorded in AE section of the protocol specific  case report forms (CRFs) . 
Medical occurrences that begin after enrolling into the study  and before administration of study 
treatment will be recorded on the Medical History section of the CRF, not the AE section.  
 
At each contact with the subject, the I nvestigator must seek information on AEs/ADEs and SAEs /SADEs by 
specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. AEs/ ADEs  and SAEs /SADEs may be observed by 
the Investigator and/or clinical research staff, elicited from the subject and/or family member or 
volunteered by the subject. All observed and volunteered adverse signs and symptom s, anticipated or 
unanticipated, regardless of severity or frequency, will be recorded in the CRFs. Included in the description 
should be the nature of the sign or symptom  (including location of the AE/ADE as applicable) , the date of 
onset, date of resolution (duration), the severity, anticipated or unanticipated, the relationship to study treatment or other therapy, the action taken (if any), and the outcome.  
 All SAEs/ SADEs, anticipated or unanticipated, must be reported  to the Sponsor  as soon as possible  (no 
later than 24 hours after occurrence ).  The SA E/SADE  must be recorded in: (1) the protocol -specific CRF 
and (2) a written report must be submitted to the Sponsor no later than  ten (10) working days after the 
Investigator first lear ns of the event. The written report shall include a full description of the event and 
sequelae, in the format detailed by the Sponsor’s  SAE/SADE  Form.   Investigator may be required to submit 
additional reports to the IRB and to the Sponsor  related to SAEs/SADEs . 
 
The Sponsor  will immediately conduct an evaluation of any S AE/SADE s per 21 CFR part 812.46(b)(1).  If 
the SA E/SA DE is determined to be a USADE, the Sponsor  will report results of such evaluation to IRB, FDA 
and participating I nvestigators pursuant to  21 CFR part 812.150(b)(1).  If the Sponsor  determines the 
USADE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the Sponsor  will termi nate the study or parts of the 
study presenting that risk pursuant to  21 CFR part 812. 46(b)(2).  
7.5 Follow -up of Subjects after AEs/ADEs 
All reported AEs/ADEs should be followed until resolution.  In the unusual circumstance that an AE/ADE 
has not resolved by the time of the subject’s completion of the study, an explanation will be entered on the appropriate C RF and the subject will be referred to his or her  primary care provider (unless specified 
otherwise by the sponsor). Resolutions of events and all events that result in permanent discontinuation from this clinical trial are to be documented on the appropriate CRFs.  
7.6 Pregnancy Reporting  
Any pregnancy which  comes to the attention of the I nvestigator during the study must be reported to the 
Sponsor  and the IRB as soon as the Investigator or study staff becomes aware of the pregnancy. Subjects 
who become pregnant during the study will be required to discontinue treatment immediately and be discontinued from the study    Subject will be followed until completion of pregnancy. 
Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE/ADE.  A congenital anomaly or birth defect will be reported as an SAE.

 A randomized trial evaluating single fraction stereotactic versus standard multi -fraction  
radiotherapy for patients diagnosed with bone metastases for effective palliation of 
symptoms.  
 
 
1. OBJECTIVES:   
a. Primary objective  (phase II) :  evaluate single fraction stereotactic  regimen for 
pain response in terms of time to failure, defined as the first occurrence of any 
of the following events:  
i. worsening in pain score by at least 2 categories by MDASI survey ,  
b. Primary objective (phase III) : to evaluate the pain response at 3 months  in terms 
of pain response by a decrease in 2 categories by MDASI survey  and narcotics 
use as defined by international pain consensus criteria.  
c. Secondary objective:  report outcomes  
i. Compare narcotics/ opioid  use compared to baseline, ≥ 50% increase in 
dose of opioid/narcotic medication,  
ii. re-irradiation,  
iii. radiographic disease progression or development of pathologic fracture 
from disease progression  
iv. Prospectively report pain, quality of life, and symptoms using MDASI 
assessment tool  to measure pain response  
v. Report acute (skin, fatigue, flare reaction) and long term (sclerosis, 
bone ossification, bone fracture rate) toxicity associated with 
treatment.  
vi. Report local control  and overall survival 
vii. Report rate of salvage surgery  
 
2. BACKGROUND:  
a. Radiation therapy is commonly utilized to effectively palliate symptomatic bone metastases, 50% -80% of patients experience improvement in the pain and 20%-
50% report complete pain relief (1, 2).  However, the optimal fractionation scheme to produce durable pain relief is still being studied.  Historically, clinical trials have compare d efficacy of varying dose -fractionation in alleviating 
symptoms.  Ratanatharathorn et al. concluded in their analysis that higher dose 
fractionated treatments produced better pain outcomes compared to lower -
dose regimens (3, Ratanatharathorn).  Contrary t o this, McQuay et al. in their 
summary determined no difference in efficacy between different fractionation or 
dose response in the total dose delivered for painful bone metastases (4, McQuay).  In the meta -analysis performed by Wu et al (5, Wu) the author s 
compared pain relief among various dose -fractionation schedules of localized 
radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of painful bone metastases.  They concluded 
among the randomized trials, there was no significant difference in overall pain

 relief or dose re sponse relationship between single and multi -fraction palliative 
RT for bone metastases.   
 In the last two decades, multiple randomized trials have compared the  
efficacy of various dose -fractionation in achieving durable pain relief in patients 
diagnosed  with bone metastases.  A randomized trial, RTOG 9714 investigated 
whether 8 Gy delivered in a single fraction provided pain and narcotic relief equivalent to the standard 30 Gy in 10 fractions.  The study demonstrated both regimens were equivalent in terms of pain and narcotic relief, and well tolerated with few adverse effects.  The shorter 8 Gy arm had a higher re -treatment rate 
but with less acute toxicity than the longer 30 Gy arm (6, Hartsell).  However, the Trans -Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG  96.05) was a randomized trial 
which demonstrated 8 Gy in a single fraction was not as effective as 20 Gy in 5 
fractions; the overall response rate and time to treatment failure were inferior 
(7, Roos).  The re -treatment rate has been reported to be higher  in patients 
treated by single fraction radiotherapy; this could be due to the decrease in durability of pain response related to the lower dose equivalent (8, Sze).  
 
A single delivery of higher dose of radiation treatment can be advantageous in regards to  patient convenience and cost effectiveness as long as it can provide 
durable pain control.  The  optimal single fraction dose required to achieve pain 
control is still unknown and not determine d from current clinical trials.  Gaze et 
al demonstrated and ov erall pain response rate of 84% and complete pain 
response rate  of 34% with deliver y of a single fraction of 10 Gy  (9, Gaze)  for 
patients with osseous metastases .   Higher doses of 12 Gy and 15 Gy have 
demonstrate d a dose response of increased overall pain response of 86% and 
complete pain response in 57% of patients ( 10, Kagei).  Radiosurgery doses of 
>16 Gy has been shown to increase the probability of pain relief for patients with 
spine metastases by multiple ins titutions such as Henry Ford and University of 
Pittsburg h (11, 12, Ryu, Gerzten ).  Researchers at M.D. Anderson have 
demonstrated the use of single fraction SBRT with doses of 16 -24 Gy for spinal 
metastases was safe and allowed patients to achieve durable local control (88% at 18 months) with few toxicities  (13, Garg).   
 
Multiple prospective randomized trials have investigated the efficacy of shorter versus longer fractionated radiation therapy courses for the treatment of painful bone metastases with conflicting results.  Few studies prospectively address the relief of neuropathic pain, re -irradiation rates, fracture rates and prospective 
quality of life endpoints.   In this study, we propose to deliver a dose escalated single fraction (12 Gy or 16 Gy) reg imen compared to the standard 20 Gy in 5 
fractions to report the safest o ptimal hypofractionated regimen in providing 
durable symptomatic relief.

 3. SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:  
a. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the optimal radiation therapy dose to 
prov ide durable pain relief, assess patients’ quality of life, narcotics use after 
radiation therapy, outcome, and toxicity.   The goal of this prospective randomized trial is to radiate patients with mechanically stable, painful bone 
metastases effectively to  provide quick palliation of pain.  The hypothesis is rapid 
delivery of dose escalated hypofractionated radiotherapy for bone metastases 
effectively improves pain and results in durable pain control.

f. More than 1 osseous site may be included into one radiation treatment field.  
 
7. EVALUATION DURING STUDY:  
a. All patients will be evaluated by the radiation oncologist during radiation 
treatment  
b. If surgical intervention is necessary, the patients will be evaluated by the treating surgeon  
c. After start of treatment, all patients will be followed by phone call s within 7-14 
days , and at + 1 month (+/ - 1 week) and then with clinic visits at months 3, 6, 9, 
12 (+/- 4 weeks for each visit)  and every 3 to 6 month intervals thereafter  (until 
death)  by either the radiation oncology or orthopedic team to evaluate toxicity.   
The validated surveys (MDASI) will be completed at baseline prior to radiation 
and at each follow up interval/appointments.  The patient medical record number will be placed on the survey before it is given to the patient for 
completion.  The surveys may be filled out in person or by mail.  
d. Patients will report their symptom measures with validated quality of life 
instrument MDASI index.  The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) is a multi -symptom patient reported outcome measure evaluating 13 core symptom 
items interfering with patients’ daily life (Appendix B ). 
e. We will also prospectively report the narcotics /NSAIDs  utilization and outcome 
at each follow- up interval after radiation therapy.  
  
8. EVALUATION OF TOXICITY:  
a. During radiotherapy, the patient will be examined weekly and acute reactions recorded.   
b. Toxicity occurring after 3 months of radiation t herapy; these will be evaluated 
and documented using NCI CTCAE version 4 .03 (Appendix A ). 
 
9. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE: 
a. The response to treatment will be determined by both radiographic scans and symptoms reported.   
b. Complete pain relief is defined as average pain score of 0 for two consecutive analysis periods.  
c. The time to maximal relief of pain is defined from the first day of irradiation until 
the lowest pain score after radiation therapy.

 d. Treatment failure is defined as worsening of pain by at least two categories , 
>50% increase in dose of opioid/narcotic medications, re -irradiation for pain or 
disease progression, progression or development of pathologic fracture from 
disease progression.   
e. Any patient with progressiv e pain in the radiated area will have work up which 
include radiographic scans to evaluate for bone stability and pathologic fracture  
per standard of care . 
  
10.   RE- TREATMENT:  
a. Response and pain relief from radiation therapy may take several weeks; therefore patients should not be re -irradiated for at least 4 weeks after 
completion of radiation.  Dose and fractionation are left to the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  
b. Surgical intervention for treatment failures, bone instability, or fractures w ill be 
reported.  
 
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
This is a phase II/III non -inferiority trial following the design suggestions of Korn et al. 
(14, Korn). The primary outcome for phase II part is treatment failure at 1 month, where 
treatment failure is as defined in section 1.0. We assume that time to tre atment failure 
follows an exponential distribution for each treatment arm (standard radiation, hypofractionated radiation). We also assume that the standard radiation arm will have 25% of patients with treatment failure at 3 months, based on the study by the Bone Pain 
Trial Working Party ( 15, BPTWP).  A hazard ratio of 1. 5 implies that the hypofractionated 
radiation arm will have 3 5% of patients with treatment failure at 3 months. The primary 
outcome for phase I II part is pain response rate at 3 months post randomization.  We 
expect to enroll 10 patients per month.   
 Randomization  
 Patients will be randomized to standard or single fraction stereotactic radiation therapy 
using CORe. Randomization will be stratified by tumor size (≤ 4 cm vs. > 4 cm) , site of 
bony mets (extremities, pelvis, abdomen, head/neck, chest) , and 1 vs >1 site irradiated . 
We expect approximately 40% of patients will have bony mets in the extremities and approximately 35% will have bony mets in the pelvis.  We expect the distribution of 
patients enrolling will approximately be 40% lung malignancy, 25% genitourinary malignancy, 15% breast malignancy, 10% multiple myeloma and 10% other malignancy.  We will have a total of 14 stratification levels.  
 Phase II  
 
 We will test the following hypothesis:  
  2013- 0640  
  Version 17 
  August 19, 2019  
 
6 
  
H0: ρ = 1. 5  vs.  H1: ρ = 1.0,  
 
where ρ is the hazard ratio (hypofractionated/standard) for time to treatment failure, as 
defined in section 1.0.   A sample size of 1 50 patients ( 75 randomized to each treatment 
arm) will yield 90% power with a 1 -sided significance level of 0.20 to reject the null 
hypothesis (H 0) and conclude that hypofractionated treatment is not inferior to 
standard treatment in terms of time to treatment failure. We use a 1 -sided significance 
level of 0.20 as recommended by Rubins tein et al. (1 6, Rubinstein) for phase II screening 
trials. This sample size will yield 1 10 events (i.e., treatment failures). It will take 1 5 
months to enroll all the patients, and the maximum study duration is expected to be 22 
months to observe the 1 10 events.  The final analysis for phase II will be performed once 
we’ve observed 1 10 events, and we will suspend accrual while we wait for these events 
to occur. We will continue to phase III only if we reject H 0 at the 0.20 significance level.  
 Phase III  
 The patients enrolled in the phase II I part of the study will be included in the phase III 
part of the study.  In the Phase II trial, we have already enrolled and randomized 160 
patients, therefore we are requesting to enroll another additional 50 patients  to reach a 
total of 210 patients.  We will enroll another 50 patients in total of 210 patients (105 
randomized to each treatment arm), after the rejection of the H
0 in the phase II part of 
the trial .  The primary objective is to evaluate the pain response at 3 months  by 
international pain consensus criteria  after  the additional 5 0 patients have been accrued, 
we will follow all patients for at least 3 months to  assess the pain response . Assuming a 
20% of the 3 -month pain response rate for patients on MFRT ar m, the 210 patients will 
ensure an 80% power to detect a 16% improvement in response rate (36%) with SBRT 
using a 1 -sided 5% level test.   
 
Pain response at 3 months is defined as reduction in pain score reported by MDASI  at 2 
points below baseline also tak ing into account narcotics use, as defined by International 
Pain Response Criteria.  
 
This sample size calculation was performed using East 6  (Copyright © 2010, Cytel Inc., 
Cambridge, MA).  
 Toxicity Monitoring (phase II and phase III)  
 
We will monitor the rate of radiation induced toxicity ( skin dermatitis  grade ≥ 4, 
gastrointestinal (GI) grade ≥ 3, genitourinary (GU) grade ≥ 3) by 12 months after the 
start of radiation therapy for the hypofractionated radiatio n therapy arm. We will enroll 
at least 25 patients and at most 105 patients on this treatment arm, and we will use the 
methods of Thall et al. (1 7, Thall et al.) to monitor the radiation induced toxicity rate.

  Version 17

 We will stop enrolling patients on the hypofractionated radiation therapy arm if we 
have reason to believe that the rate of radiation induced toxicity for this arm is more than 10%.  
 We will actually monitor the time to radiation induced toxicity, because these toxicities 
may occur at any time from the start of radiation therapy. We will use the Clinical Trial 
Conduct website ( https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct
) to monitor 
the toxicity stopping rule.  This website is built and maintained by the Department of 
Biostatistics. The research staff will be trained by the study statistician in the use of the website to monitor the stopping rules, with an emphasis on the importance of updating toxicity outcomes  and follow- up dates.  
 To obtain the operating characteristics for the stopping rule we simulated the trial 1000 
times for various scenarios described in the table below. We assumed that patients are 
enrolled at the rate of 5 per month on the hypofractiona ted radiation therapy arm, that 
we would follow patients for 12 months, and that we will evaluate the stopping rule continually. The table below summarizes the operating characteristics of this stopping rule.

30 0.24    0.949    60   73 85 26.9 
 At any point in the trial time to radiation induced toxicity can be calculated for each patient, with the time interval regarded as censored at the date of last follow- up if 
toxicity has not been observed for a patient.  We will apply a Bayesian method for 
updating prior information with time to toxicity data observed to that time.  We assume that the time to toxicity for each patient is exponentially distributed with a median of λ
S 
months for  the standard treatment and a median of λ E for the experimental treatment.  
Given the historical data we assume λ S follows an inverse gamma distribution with mean 
78.95 months and a standard deviation of 0.15 months.  The middle 95% of this distribution is  between 78.66 and 79.24 months. These parameters correspond to a 12 -
month toxicity rate between 9.064% and 10.035%.  We assume λ
E follows an inverse 
gamma distribution with a mean of 78.95 months and a standard deviation of 15.0 
months.  The middle 95% of  this distribution is between 54.87 and 113.32 months. 
These parameters correspond to a 12 -month toxicity rate between 7.077% and 
14.066%.

Since the goal of the study is to achieve a toxicity rate of less than 10% at 12 months, the trial will be stopped early if, based on the available data,  Pr( λ
E  <  λ S | data from the trial ) >0.90.  This rule was chosen to achieve an 
approximately 0.10 e arly stopping probability if the true toxicity rate is 10%.  
  Final Analysis  We will use descriptive statistics to summarize the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients by treatment arm.  
 We will use the methods of Gooley et al. (1 8, Gooley) to estimate the cumulative 
incidence of treatment failure for each treatment arm with death as a competing event, and we will estimate the percent of patients without treatment failure at 3, 6, and 12 
months for each treatment arm  with a 90 % confidence interval.  
 We will use the methods of Fine and Gray (1 9, Fine and Gray) to model time to 
treatment failure with death as a competing event and test the hypotheses stated 
above for phase II and for phase III . We will also estimate the haza rd rati o for treatment 
with a 90 % confidence interval.  
 For the 3 month pain response rate, the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by 
stratification factors at randomization will used to test the difference between 2 treatment arms.  Chi -square d test without adjusting for the stratification factors will 
also be performed  as a secondary analysis .   
 
We will use descriptive statistics and boxplots to summarize the score from the MDASI 
instrument at each assessment time. We will similarly summarize changes in sc ores for 
these instruments over time. We will use mixed effects regression methods with repeated measures and patient as a random effect to model instrument scores over time to test for treatment differences.  
 We will use the product limit estimator of Kap lan and Meier ( 20, Kaplan and Meier) to 
estimate overall survival and disease -free survival stratified by treatment arm. We will 
use Cox proportional hazards regression to model OS and DFS as a function of treatment arm, and we will estimate the hazard rat io for treatment with a 9 0 % confidence interval 
(21, Cox).  
 We will use descriptive statistics to summarize narcotics use and acute and long -term 
adverse events  for each treatment arm .

 We will use Fisher’s exact test to compare treatment arms with respe ct to the rates of 
re-irradiation and salvage surgery.

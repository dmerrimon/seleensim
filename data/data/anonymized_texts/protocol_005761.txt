i. Objective  
Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) metabolizes  3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate  
(cAMP) , thereby terminating this second messenger . PDE4 is selective to cAMP over cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate . PDE4 has four isozymes —A, B, C, and D —and basic studies sugge st 
that type D (PDE4D) may play a key role in cognitive function  and depression . That is, PDE4D  
inhibitors are expected to improve cognitive function  and depressi ve symptoms . 
In collaboration with Tetra Discovery Partners , we have  developed a PET ligand, 11C-T-
1650 , to selectively image PDE4D . This type D selective ligand was developed based on 3D 
structural differences between PDE4D and PDE4 type B (PDE4B) Our PET studies using 11C-T-
1650 in nonhuman primate have  shown promising results , and we now seek to  evaluate it in in 
healthy subjects . 
This study has three  primary objectives. First, we will determine whether the uptake of 
11C-T-1650 in the brain reflects the distribution of PDE4D , as demonstrated by blocking with a 
PDE4D selective compound  BPN14770 , being developed by Tetra Discovery Partners  for 
treating cognitive disorders including depression . Second, we will measure binding si te 
occupancy of BPN14770  administered at doses that may be used in clinical trials . Third , we will 
measure the test/retest reproducibility of brain uptake quantified by kinetic  modeling and using 
arterial blood samples . 
 
ii. Study Population  
Healthy adult female and male volunteers (age ≥ 18 ) will have either brain (n = 30 ) or whole   
body imaging (n = 10 ). 
 
iii. Design  
 
a) Phase 1: We will begin with whole body scanning in a single human subject using up to 
10 mCi  11C-T-1650  The aim of this first scan will be to detect a tracer that 
disproportionately accumulates in a single radiosensitive organ, such as the gonads. If we 
confirm that radioactivity is fairly widely distributed in the body, higher activities may be 
injected.  
 
b) Phase 2: Fifteen healthy subjects will have three brain PET scans using 20 mCi of 11C-T-
1650. Scan 1 will serve as the baseline scan for compariso n to e nzyme occupancy studies 
(Scan 2 and 3). Scan s 2 and 3 will be enzyme occupancy studies using the PDE4D 
selective medication BPN14770. Scans  2 and Scan 3 will be performed approximately 90-
180 min after the first dose of BPN14770  and after three -day administration, respectively. 
Scan 3 will be performed approximately 90 -180 min after the last dose of the three -day 
administration of BPN14770. The dose of BPN14770 is 50 mg BID  for three days, and a 
single dose on the fourth day . Comparison between Scan  1 and 2 provides accurate 
measurement of nonspecific binding of 11C-T-1650 . Comparison between Scan 1 and 3 
provides enzyme occupancy at a stable plasma concentration of BPN14770 based on 
Phase 1/2 clinical trials performed by Tetra Discovery Partners .  Blood samples will be 
measured for BPN14770 levels.  
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 4 of 41 c) Phase 3: To obtain dosimetry information , we will perform a whole body PET scan using 
11C-T-1650 (20 mCi) in up to nine healthy subjects.  
 
d) Phase 4: Fifteen healthy subjects will have two brain PET scans u sing 20 mCi of 11C-T-
1650  to study test/retest reproducibility of the PET measurement. BPN14770 will not be 
administered  in Phase s 1, 3 or 4. 
 
 
iv. Outcome Measures  
For whole body imaging, organ uptake will be quantified as a Standardized Uptake Value 
(SUV), which normalizes for injected activity and body weight. For Scan 1 and 2 of Phase 2 and 
all scans of Phase 4 , uptake will be quantified as total distribution volu me (VT) calculated with 
kinetic  modeling and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma.  For Scan 3 of 
Phase 3, brain uptake (SUV) normalized to plasma concentrations of 11C-T-1650  will be used to 
measure radioligand binding because the  interval between Scan 2 and 3 is too short to repeat 
placing arterial line. From VT or normalized SUV , occupancy of BPN14770 and nonspecific 
binding of 11C-T-1650 will be measured.   Occupancy of PDE4D will be compared to blood 
levels of BPN14770.

Page 7 of 41 1. Introduction  and Background  
 
PDE4D  inhibitors produce  cognitive improvement  and may show antidepressant effects  
 PDE4 terminates signal transduction of G -protein -coupled receptors by metabolizing the 
second messenger cAMP. Because of the prevalence of G-protein -coupled receptors, PDE4  plays 
critical roles in a number of brain disorders  including Alzheimer’s disease and major depressive 
disorder . 
 A large number of pre -clinical and clinical trials have been performed using PDE4 
inhibitors. Uncontrolled clinical studies conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s with 
rolipram, an isozyme nonselective PDE4 inhibitor, found that this agent had antidep ressant 
effects; however, the ratio of efficacy to adverse reactions limited its clinical use [1]. Two 
possible cause s have been hyp othesized for the low ratio of efficacy to adverse reaction : little 
selectivity of rolipram among the four PDE4 isozymes [2] and h igh inhibition of PDE4 activity  
because rolipram is a competitive inhibitor [3]. Building on these hypotheses , PDE4D  selective 
negative allosteric modulators have been develop ed which induced cognitive impro vement 
without causing emesis  [3]. Inhibition of PDE4D is also expected to show antidepressant effects 
because PDE4D KO mouse showed antidepressant -like effect on behavior [4] 
 As described in the following sub section s in detail , we ha ve performed extensive studies 
using 11C-(R)-rolipram, which binds to all four PDE4 isozymes. To further investigate the role of 
PDE4 in brain disorders, a PET ligand that binds selectively to one of the four PDE4 isozymes is 
needed. Tetra Discovery Partne rs has developed a new PDE4D selective ligand, 11C-T-1650. We 
tested 11C-T-1650 in monkey PET studies and confirmed that specific binding of 11C-T-1650 is 
greater than  that of 11C-(R)-rolipram , although T -1650 binds to only one subtype of PDE4 while 
rolipram binds to all subtypes . This specific binding suggests that 11C-T-1650 has much higher in 
vivo affinity than 11C-(R)-rolipram for PDE4 . 
We will also measure the enzyme occupancy by doses of B PN14770 that might be used 
in clinical studies  and relate this to plasma levels of the drug . If all studies proceed well, the 
results will be used to guide a therapeutic trial in major depressive disorder (MDD) to improve 
cognitive function and depressive symptoms.  
 
Previous PET studies using 11C-(R)-rolipram , a PDE4 isozyme nonselective inhibitor  
PET imaging of  the cAMP cascade  
PET imaging of PDE4 with 11C-(R)-rolipram has been successfully used to study cAMP 
cascade activity in vivo . PDEs hydrolyze the se cond messengers cAMP and cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) to terminate signal transduction. Eleven PDEs exist in the human body. 
PDE4 is selective to cAMP and is present in both brain and peripheral organs such as heart, 
lungs, kidney [5], immune cells [6], osteoclasts [7], and osteoblasts [8]. Rolipram is a selective 
PDE4 inhibitor; PDE4 has four isozymes, and rolipram is not selective among these isozymes.  
Our studies —described below —demonstrated that 11C-(R)-rolipram PET is a valuable 
method for detecting cAMP cascade activity in living human and animal subjects. Because PDE4 
is present in almost all brain regions and no regions without PDE4 are available to use as a 
reference to measure rolipram binding, w e used 11C-(R)-rolipram concentrations in arterial 
plasma (i.e., metabolite -corrected arterial input function) to measure rolipram binding in the 
brain [9, 10] . We also showed that rolipram binding can be accurately measured using only four 
arterial samples [9].

Page 8 of 41 Broadly, the cAMP theory of depressio n posits that depression is caused by low cAMP 
signaling. The corresponding theory regarding the relevant mechanism of treatment is that 
chronic, but not acute, administration of antidepressants upregulates cAMP signaling. Although 
the cAMP theory of depre ssion has limited supporting data, evidence for the mechanism of 
antidepressants has repeatedly been confirmed in animal studies. Chronic, but not acute, 
administration of all classes of antidepressants , as well as electroconvulsive therapy, upregulates 
several components of the cAMP pathway, including PDE4.  
PDE4 , an important component of the cAMP cascade, selectively  metabolizes cAMP  in 
the brain to the inactive monophosphate.  Rolipram is a reversible inhibitor of PDE4, and binding 
of 11C-(R)-rolipram provides a measure of the activity of this enzyme in the brain.  Due to a 
feedback mechanism, in vivo  binding of 11C-(R)-rolipram reflects the activity of the cAMP 
cascade; essentia lly, increased cAMP stimulates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates 
PDE4  that, in turn, increases 
rolipram binding.  
We confirmed in animals 
that increased 11C-(R)-rolipram  
binding reflects the 
phosphorylated / active state of 
PDE4. Using this radioligand, 
we found that PDE4 binding is 
decreased in unmedicated 
patients with MDD, consistent 
with the cAMP theory of 
depression. Finally, we found 
that two months of treatment 
with an SSRI increased 
(normalized) PDE4 binding, 
consistent with the cAMP theory 
of the mechanism of 
antidepressants.  
In Vivo Density and 
Affinity.  Our initial experiments 
sought to measure in vivo  both 
binding site density and 
radioligand affinity of 11C-(R)-
rolipram in the rat brain [11]. We 
also studied two critical factors 
in small -animal PET scans: the 
influence of anesthesia and the 
difference in binding under in 
vivo and in vitro  conditions. Binding site density and radioligand affinity of conscious rats were 
significantly greater than those of anesthetized rats, by 29% and 59%, r espectively. In addition, 
in vitro  affinity was five -fold greater than in vivo  affinity, although density was similar in both 
conditions (Fig 1 ). The findings were consistent with rapid dephosphorylation of PDE4 and  
established that 11C-(R)-rolipram binding in vivo  reflects cAMP cascade  activity in rats.   
Fig 1. In vivo  Scatchard plot of PDE4 binding using 11C-(R)-rolipram  
in awake rats. PET scans were performed with increasing 
concentrations of radioligand in order to sa turate binding to PDE4 
(bottom left), and analyzed as an in vivo  Scatchard plot (bottom right) . 
The brains were subsequently harvested for in vitro  Scatchard analysis. 
Binding density (Bmax) was unchanged, but binding affinity was 
decreased five- to six -fold after death compared to the awake 
condition. The decreased affinity after death is consistent with the 
rapid dephosphorylation (within minutes) of PDE4. The 
phosphorylation state of PDE4 would not be possible in human 
postmortem tissue; PET imaging is t he only technique currently 
available to measure the phosphorylated and active state of this 
enzyme.

Page 9 of 41 In Vivo Phosphorylation 
Status. We further  examined the 
effects of  PKA modulators in 
conscious rats on 11C-(R)-rolipram 
binding compared  to the much 
less active enantiomer 11C-(S)-
rolipram (Fig 2) [12]. Two drugs 
were studied . db-cAMP, which is 
a cAMP analogue, was used to 
activate PDE4, thus increasing 
activity of the cAMP -dependent 
PKA. PKA then phosphorylated 
the PDE4 enzyme and increased 
PDE4 activity. We also studied 
Rp-cAMP, a PKA inhibitor  that 
directly inhibit s PKA function, 
thereby decreasing PDE4 activity. 
Unilateral injection of the PKA 
activator (db -cAMP) and the PKA 
inhibitor (Rp -cAMP) into the 
striatum significantly increased 
and decreased  11C-(R)-rolipram 
binding, respectively. These 
effects were not caused by 
changes in blood flow or delivery 
of radioligand to the brain, 
because these agents did not affect 
11C-(S)-rolipram binding. These results supported the importance of measuring in vivo  11C-(R)-
rolipram binding in the brain to assess response to physiological or pharmacological challenges 
to the cAMP second messenger system.  
  
Fig 2. 11C-(R)-rolipram binding in rat brain depends on the 
phosphorylation state of PDE4. Rats were unilaterally injected in 
striatum with either a PKA activator (db -cAMP, upper panels) or a 
PKA inhibitor (Rp -cAMPS, lower panels). PKA -mediated 
phosphorylation of PDE4 increased both enzyme activity and the 
affinity of 11C-(R)-rolipram binding about 10 -fold. Both the PKA 
activator and inhibitor had the expected effect on radioligand uptake 
in striatum injected with drug compared to the side injected with 
saline. These ef fects were not merely caused by altered blood flow, 
given that they were not found using the inactive enantiomer 11C-(S)-
rolipram (right panels).

Page 10 of 41 PDE4 Binding in MDD. Based on these preclinical findings, we hypothesized that 11C-(R)-
rolipram PET in humans would provide a unique  in vivo  measure of PDE4 density and affinity 
not possible in postmortem tissue. Expanding 
our work, we sought to q uantify the binding 
of 11C-(R)-rolipram as an indirect measure of 
this enzyme’s activity in the brain of 
individuals with MDD compared with 
healthy controls [13]. This is particularly 
important because a nimal studies had 
suggested that upregulation of the cAMP 
cascade, including PDE4, was a mechanism 
of action common to several antidepressant 
treatments.  To avoid the misleading results 
that can be obtained from small sample sizes, 
we have now  scanned a total of 44  
unmedica ted, moderately d epressed patients 
with MDD and 3 5 age - and gender -matched 
healthy controls, which is about twice the 
size of most PET studies in psychiatry. 
Notably, about half the patients were 
treatment -naïve. 11C-(R)-rolipram binding in 
the brain was m easured using arterial 11C-
(R)-rolipram levels to correct for the 
influence of cerebral blood flow. MDD 
subjects showe d a widespread, 18 % reduction in 11C-(R)-rolipram binding ( p=0.001) that was not 
caused by different gray matter volumes (Fig 3 ). Decreased rolipram binding of similar 
magnitude was observed in most  brain areas. Rolipram binding did not correlate with the 
severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms. These results were the first to demonstrate that brain 
levels of PDE4, a critical enzy me that regulates cAMP,  are decreased in unmedicated individuals 
with MDD in vivo . Furthermore, the results are in line with human postmortem and rodent 
studies demonstrating downregulation of the cAMP cascade in MDD, and support the hypothesis 
that PDE4 i nhibitors —which increase cAMP cascade activity —may have antidepressant effects.  
The Effect of Chronic Antidepressant s on PDE4 Binding  Building on this work, we 
sought to determine if antidepressant treatment upregulates PDE4 in humans as it does in 
animal s. In addition to the rolipram PET scans with out medication reported above, 23 of the 44  
unmedicated MDD patients had a follow up rolipram scan after starting treatment with SSRIs . 
Preliminary analyses show that t hese patients had a  12 ± 36% increase in rolipram binding after 
SSRI treatment across all brain regions (p  < 0.001 when age was used as a covariate). The 
change in rolipram binding after SSRI varied markedly among patients , as indicated by the large 
standard deviation of 36%. In contrast, 13  healthy controls who had a repeat scan without SSRI 
showed similar binding on repe at scans with changes of only -1 ± 13%. Age affected the 
magnitude of SSRI -induced increase in rolipram binding; o lder patients showed greater increases 
after SSRI (p ≤ 0.001). However, no correlation was observed between rolipram binding and 
symptom severity, neither for the unmedicated baseline scan nor in response to SSRI treatment, 
possibly because of the heterogeneity of the disorder or the heterogeneity of PDE4, which has 
four distinct subtypes.  Fig 3.  11C-(R)-rolipram binding was globally decreased 
by 18% in brains of unmedicated MDD patients during 
a major depressive episode (n = 44 ) compared to 
matched controls (n = 35; p =  0.001). These mean 
parametric images of the two groups represent the 
“absolute” quantitation of radioligand binding 
calculated on an individual voxel level and using the 
concentration of radioligand in serial arterial blood 
samples.  
 

  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 11 of 41 Taken together, these results elucidate two important and related points. First, the cAMP 
cascade, as indirectly measured with PDE4 binding, was downregulated in unmedicated patients 
with MDD. Second, antidepressant treatment normaliz ed this  downregulation. These studies 
suggest that PDE4 inhibition, perhaps via subtype selective agents, might again be assessed for 
efficacy in MDD; the results also broadly support the cAMP theory of depression and of 
antidepressant action.  Additionally, cognitive benefits may be elicited over a broad range of 
disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and Parkinson’s disease.  
 
Development of a novel PET l igand to selectively image PDE4D  
 MIB/NIMH and Tetra Discovery Partners  developed  several PDE4D selective PET 
ligands and tested the m in monkey  PET scans . Among these candidates,  11C-T-1650 showed the 
best results. Because PDE4 type B and type D have similar structures , type D selective ligands 
were developed based on 3D structur al differences between type D and B [3]. Based on in vitro 
experiments using recombinant DNAs of human PDE4B and D, T -1650 has 300 times greater 
affinity to PDE4D than to PDE4B. Monkey PET scans showed moderate brain uptake peaking at 
3 SUV and was washed out to 1/3 of the peak in two hours, which allowed precise quantification 
of ligand binding , including both association to and dissociation from PDE4D  (Figs. 4 and 5 ). 
Both  VT (total uptake) and BPND (ratio of specific to nonspecific uptake) of 11C-T-1650 were 
greater than th at of 11C-(R)-rolipram , even though  T-1650  binds to only PDE4D , while rolipram 
binds to all PDE4 subtypes  (Table 1) . As described above, 11C-(R)-rolipram  has been 
successfully used in rodent, healthy humans, and patients.  Therefore, 11C-T-1650 is expected to 
be useful to study PDE4D in human.

 As background, we previously studied a radioligand for another subtype of PDE4 (i.e., 
PDE4B) in protocol 17-M-0041 , which was  terminated.  The p rimary outcome measures were

Institutet. Specifically, time stability of VT was consistent with radio metabolites accumulating in 
the brain. In addition, Pfizer will not allow us to use their therapeutic candidate, which also has 
major limitations (low bioavailability and short half -life). For these two reasons, we terminate d 
the protocol using the PDE4B r adioligand.

BPN14770 is a first -in-class, subtype selective, phosphodiesterase type -4D-negative 
allosteric modulator (PDE4D -NAM) [14]. The unique mechanism of action and subtype 
selectivity distinguishes BPN14770 from the two approved PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast 
(Daliresp™) and apremilast (Otezla™). Roflumilast and apremilast are competitive inhibitors 
that inhibit the PDE4 enzymes by binding in the active site competitively with cAMP . As the 
amino acid sequence of the PDE4 active site is conserved between the four subtypes, roflumilast 
and apremilast inhibit all subtypes of PDE4 equally strongly. Both compounds cause emesis in 
humans and other species, and as a class, PDE4 competitive  inhibitors have been found to cause 
mesenteric vasculopathy in rats, dogs and primates, although this toxicity has not been observed 
in humans. In contrast, BPN14770 does not cause emesis in ferrets, cynomolgous monkeys or 
marmosets and does not  cause mes enteric vasculopathy in rats or dogs in toxicological studies of 
28 days duration. Thus, BPN14770 presents a unique procognitive and preclinical safety profile.  
Clearance of BPN14770 by hepatocytes from human, rat, dog and monkey, expressed as 
hepatic extr action ratio (EH), was 16%, 8.2%, 17%, and 12%, respectively. Qualitative 
metabolite profiling in human, rat, dog, and monkey hepatocytes showed a single metabolite in 
human (<1% parent). BPN14770 was highly bound to plasma proteins in all species tested. The 
fraction unbound (free) was 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.5%, for mouse, rat, dog, and human, respectively.  
BPN14770 is highly bioavailable in rats, mice and dogs (F% = 100), distributes to the 
brain (B/P = 0.32 -0.48), and has a plasma t ½ of 4.8 hours in rats,  10.9 hours in mice, and 11 
hours in dogs. The multi -species pharmacokinetic data suggest that BPN14770 will have 
adequate half -life for once daily oral administration in humans. In bile duct cannulated rats, 
BPN14770 was found to be eliminated as a conjug ate through the bile. Only the unchanged drug 
was detected in plasma, and no BPN14770 was detected in urine.  
BPN14770 has cognitive benefit in the mouse Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test at 
0.3 mg/kg PO and above as shown by an increase in the Discrimina tion Index. BPN14770 C max 
at the minimum effective dose (MED) was 160 ng/mL in plasma and 40 ng/g in  the brain. 
Cognitive benefit is maintained after chronic dosing for 7 days. BPN14770 also has benefit in a 
mouse model of cholinergic impairment, the scopo lamine -impaired Y -maze (male C57Bl6 mice 
MED = 1 mg/kg).  
BPN14770 did not affect cardiovascular function in beagle dogs at doses up to 100 
mg/kg, nor did the compound affect respiratory function or exert neuropharmacologic effects in 
rats at doses up to 60  mg/kg. In the in vitro hERG assay, an increase in current of 12% and 33% 
was seen at concentrations of 10 and 30 μM, respectively. No IC 50 could be calculated due to this 
increase in current.  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 14 of 41 In a rat 28 day toxicology study BPN14770 was well tolerated up  to 60 mg/kg with no 
deaths on study, and no hematology, clinical chemistry, liver weight or gross necropsy findings. 
There were no microscopic findings. Unlike competitive PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast  
(Daxas™) and apremilast (Otezla™), BPN14770 did  not cause mesenteric vasculopathy at the  
doses studied.  
In a dog 28 day toxicology study , the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for 
BPN14770 was 30 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg BPN14770 caused inappetence  and weight loss and in 
female dogs an approximately 30 msec increase in QTc with a concomitant increase in heart rate 
of 10 bpm. Based on the lack of inhibition of hERG and the associated gastrointestinal 
disturbance, this change likely reflects an indirect effect on QTc. There were no changes in 
hematology  and ophthalmology. Macroscopic observations included pale livers in two of eight 
animals at 100 mg/kg which correlated with mild alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation only in 
those two animals. Microscopic changes of peri -portal hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation 
were observed in the livers of one male and two female dogs at 100 mg/kg. No liver changes 
were observed in recovery dogs suggesting that these changes, if present, were reversible.  
 
Clinical trials of BPN14770 in healthy subjects  
 Tetra Discov ery has completed the following two trials of BPN14770 in healthy subjects.  
 
BPN14770 -CNS -101: a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled, ascending single dose study 
to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of BPN14770.  in healthy subjects (18 
– 55 years old).  
 
BPN14770 -CNS -102: a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile of BPN14770 in healthy young 
(25 – 44 years old) and elderly (60 – 78 years old) male and female subjects, and to provide a 
preliminary assessment of the cognitive effects of BPN14770 in healthy elderly subjects.  Each 
subject was randomized to receive a fixed daily dose of either BPN14770 or placebo twice daily 
(every 12 hours, or BID) or once daily (every 24 hours, or QD) for 8 consecutive days  
 
The following is the s ummaries of the results of these studies reported in the Investigator’s 
Brochure . 
 
BPN14770 -CNS -101: 
 Twenty -four subjects received BPN14770 (six at each dose level: 5mg/15mg/50mg/100mg) 
and eight subjects received placebo.  Detectable plasma BPN14770 concentrations were measured 
after dosing starting between 0.5 hour and 1 hour after dosing, continuing through 48 hours after 
dosing for all four  dose levels. Drug absorption was variable but moderately rapid with median T max 
values ranging from 1.5 to 3 hours. The plasma pharmacokinetics of BPN14770 after oral 
administration appeared to be linear for single doses ranging from 5 to 100mg, although a slight trend 
for a greater than proportional increase in exposure was observed in the 100mg group as compared to 
the lower dose groups. The apparent terminal elimination half -life of BPN14770 was consistent 
among dose groups and averaged between 11 and 1 3 hours.  
 The following adverse events were reported.  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 15 of 41 Table 2. Adverse events after one oral dose of BPN14770  
AEs that occurred in more than one subject that were considered related to treatment consisted of 
nausea (reported by 4 of 6 subjects in the 100m g dose group), vomiting (reported by 2 of 6 subjects 
in the 100mg dose group, both of which also reported nausea) and diarrhea (reported by 2 of 8 
subjects in the placebo group and 1 subject each in the 5mg and 50mg BPN14770 dose groups). All 
but one treat ment -emergent AE were mild or moderate in severity. One severe AE was reported for 
one subject in the 15mg dose group, who reported intermittent severe renal colic starting 
approximately 24 hours after dosing.

Table 3. Overview of study cohorts  for 8 -day oral administration of BPN14770  
 
 The following results were obtained:  
1. Multiple doses of BPN14770, were administered twice daily (15 mg, 30 mg, or 50 mg) or once 
daily (75 mg) to healthy young subjects and twice daily (10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) to healthy elderly 
subjects.  
2. There was evidence of greater than proportional increases in BPN14770 exposure after a single 
dose or repeated dosing. Drug accumulation was approximately 2 -fold after QD dosing. After BID 
dosing, moderate drug accumulation (approximately 3 - to 5-fold) was observed. Steady state 
appeared to be reached w ithin 2 to 4 days of BID or QD dosing. When adjusted for differences in 
dose, mean BPN14770 exposure appeared to be similar between healthy young and healthy elderly 
subjects.  
 The following adverse events were reported:  

  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 17 of 41 Table 4. Adverse events in 8 -day oral administration of BPN14770  
No deaths or other serious adverse events were reported across the young and elderly cohorts, 
and no subject withdrew from the study due to adverse events. The majority of AEs were of mild 
severity. Two moderate AEs (nausea and vomiting) were reported by 1 subject in the 75 -mg QD dose 
group; no other AEs of moderate severity were reported across the young cohorts.  
Of the 27 adverse events reported by young subjects who received active drug, a total of 20 
AEs observed in 9 su bjects were considered by the Investigator as related to study treatment.  
No clinically significant effects of multiple oral doses of BPN14770 administered twice daily (15 
mg, 30 mg, or 50 mg) or once daily (75 mg) to healthy young subjects and twice dail y (10 mg, 20 
mg, or 40 mg) to healthy elderly subjects were observed on biochemistry, hematology, or urinalysis; 
vital signs; or ECGs.  
Overall, no deaths or serious adverse events were reported during the study. No subjects 
withdrew from the study due to adverse events, and all treatment -emergent adverse events resolved 
without sequelae by the follow -up visit. One subject withdrew consent for treatment, which the 
Investigator determined was not a withdrawal for an AE, although she had a headache which had not 
fully resolved.  
Adverse events that occurred in more than 1 subject within a dose group or placebo group 
that were considered related to study drug were limited to the 40 -mg BID dose group. Headache was 
reported in 4 of 10 subjects; diarrhea, increase d alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase, and hot flush were each reported in 2 of 10 subjects.  
The majority of AEs were of mild severity. A total of 3 moderate AEs were reported across 
the elderly cohorts; 2 moderate AEs (hypotension, di zziness) were reported by 1 subject in the 10 -mg 
BID dose group, and 1 moderate AE (headache) was reported by 1 subject in the 40 -mg BID dose 
group.

Page 18 of 41 The rationale for selecting the dose of BPN14770 in this PET protocol  
 We will administe r 50 mg BID of BPN 14770 for the following reasons. In a multiple dose 
study in healthy volunteers, a dose of 50 mg bid for 8 days was very well tolerated in young   
individuals  (25 to 44 years old) .  Only 2 of 6 reported any AE: one mild diarrhea and one mild 
nausea.  Both AEs were transient and neither led to discontinuation.  In elderly  individuals (age 
>60) BPN14770 40 mg was also well tolerated over 8 days, with no discontinuations for adverse 
events.  The most common AE was transient headache in 4 of 10 individuals; 2 o f 10 reported 
diarrhea compared to 1 on placebo.   
 
2. Study Objectives  
a. Primary objectives  
 This study has three  primary objectives. First, we will determine whether the uptake of 
11C-T-1650 in the brain reflects the distribution of PDE4D , as demonstrated by blocking with a 
PDE4D selective medication BPN14770 . Second, we will measure binding site o ccupancy of 
BPN14770  and compare these data to plasma levels of the drug . Third , we will measure the 
test/retest reproducibility of brain uptake  quantified by kinetic  modeling and using arterial blood 
samples . 
b. Secondary objectives  
The secondary objective is to estimate dosimetry  (i.e., radiation -absorbed doses ) of 11C-T-1650 . 
 
3. Subjects  
a.  Description of study  populations   
We propose to study four groups of participants:  
Phase 1: One subject will have a whole body PET scan with 10 mCi  of 11C-T-1650  to 
confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of 11C-T-1650 . 
 
Phase 2: 15 healthy subjects will have  three  brain PET scans , baseline , about 90-180 min 
after the first dose of BPN14770 (Scan #2), and after three  and a half -day administration 
of BPN14770 (Scan #3) to  measure specific binding and BPND of 11C-T-1650 and binding 
site occupancy of BPN14770 . The dose of BPN14770 is 50 mg BID  (except for the last 
day in which subjects will take a single dose) .  BPN14770 levels will be measured in 
plasma samples.  
 
Phase 3: Nine healthy subjects will have a whole body scan using 20 mCi 11C-T-1650 to 
estimate radiation -absorbed doses.  
 
Phase 4: 15 healthy subjects  will have  two brain PET scans; test-retest kinetic brain 
imagi ng with arterial blood sampling.

4. Study Design and Methods  
a. Study overview  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 21 of 41 This is a single center study in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be screened 
under protocol 01 -M-0254  or 17 -M-0181 . As noted above, participants must meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and sig n an informed consent document. T he four phases of this study will be:  
 
1) initial  first-in-human  whole -body imaging of one subject with a low injection activity  
of 10 mCi ;  
 
2) brain  imaging at baseline  (Scan #1) , about 90-180 min after the first dose of  
BPN14770 (Scan #2), and after three  and a half -day administration of BPN14770 (Scan #3) to 
measure specific binding and BPND of 11C-T-1650 and binding site occupancy of BPN14770 .  
Binding site occupancy in  the brain will be compared to plasma levels of BPN14770.  The 
measurement of BPND by Lassen occupancy plot [15] assumes no change in PDE4D density after 
administering BPN14770. Comparison between Scan #1 (baseline) and Scan #2 ( 90-180 min 
after the first dose of BPN14770) allow s the measurement of BPND with little changes in PDE4D 
density. Comparison between Scan #1 and Scan #3 allows measurement of binding site 
occupancy by BPN14770 at a steady state level.  
 
3) whole body imaging to estimate radiation -absorbed doses  of 11C-T-1650 , and  
 
4) test-retest  kinetic brain imaging with arterial blood sampling .  
 
In the past, the NIH Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) required that whole body 
imaging be performed first in several subjects for any new radioligand to estimate radiation 
exposure to the body. However , if the radioligand subsequently proved ineffective for brain 
imaging, then the se subjects who underwent whole body imaging would have been unnecessarily 
exposed to radiation. For this reason, the RSC allowed brain imaging using new 11C- and 11F-
labeled radioligands to be performed after doing whole body imaging in one subject  in order  to 
determine whether the radioligand was worth pursuing  as a brain imaging agent . That is, ‘go / 
no-go’ decisions are made on a small number of subjects based on brain imagi ng. The request to 
do so in  this protocol follo ws the identical steps approved  for another protocol (14-M-0068 , 
“Evaluation of a Novel Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Radiotracer for TARP γ -8”). 
 
We propose to study  up to 40 healthy volunteers: one in Phase 1 (whole body imaging 
with a low injection activity), 15 in Phase 2  (baseline and blocked brain scans ), 9 (whole body 
imaging to estimate radiation -absorbed doses, and 15 in Phase 4  (test-retest kinetic brain imaging 
with arterial blood sampling ).  
To estimate the radiation exposure from this new radioligand, we will follow the prior 
suggestion s from our laboratory [16], which have been  approved by  the NIH RSC . Specifically, 
we found that the average exposure of all published human studies with 11C-radioligands more 
accurately reflected the exposure to human s than estimation based on imaging in monkeys with 
that particular radioligand.  
 
Phase 1: One subject will have a  first-in-human  whole body PET scan with 10 mCi 11C-
T-1650 to confirm that no organ has prominently high uptake of 11C-T-1650 . 
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 22 of 41 Phase 2: 15 heal thy subjects will have  three  brain PET scans, baseline  (Scan #1) , about 
90-180 min after the first dose of BPN14770 (Scan #2), and after three  and a half -day 
administration of BPN14770 (Scan #3) . In each scan, 20 mCi  of 11C-T-1650 will be 
injected . In Scan #1 and #2, the binding will be measured by kinetic brain imagi ng with 
arterial blood sampling . In addition, in all of Scan #1, 2, and 3, by using venous samples, 
radioligand binding will be measured as brain uptake (SUV) normalized to venous 
concen trations of 11C-T-1650 because an arterial line will not be placed in Scan #3 due to 
three -day interval between Scan #2 and 3.  Venous samples  will be analyzed for 
BPN14770 levels.  The dose of BPN14770 will be  50 mg BID  (except for the last day in 
which subjects will take a single dose) . 
 
Phase 3: Nine healthy subjects will have a whole -body scan using 20 mCi  of 11C-T-1650 
to estimate radiation -absorbed doses.  
 
Phase 4: 15 healthy subjects will have  two brain PET scans; test-retest kinetic brain 
imagi ng with arterial blood sampling.  
 
 If Phase 2 shows substantial specific (i.e., displaceable ) binding , we will be confident that 
the radioligand itself can be used to measure the density  of PDE4D in human subjects, including 
patients with MDD. For such potential studies, we will need to determine dosimetry and test / 
retest variability of the PET scans, independent of the results from three -day administration of 
BPN14770. Thus, if Phase 2 shows substantial (>40%) specific bind ing in three subjects, we will 
simultaneously proceed with Phases 2, 3, and 4.  
Brain MRI and PET scan s are part of the protocol. There will be no brain MRI in the 
whole body dosimetry studies  in Phase s 1 and 3.  The MRI will be obtained within 12 months of 
the PET scans  (i.e., up to 12 months before or after the PET scan ) and can be performed on the 
same day. Brain  PET scans will be performed with vital sign monitoring. In Phase 2 and 4 , 11C-
T-1650 brain PET scan s will be associated with arterial sampling for the input function  
measurement  except Scan #3 in Phase 2 . No arterial input function will be taken for the Phase s 1 
or 3 studies , however, several venous samples may be obtained in these studies to guide the 
analysis of arterial samples obtained in the brain scans .  
 
Number of visits and time commitment of participants . 
The visits are described below and summarized in Table 5.  
Phase 1 : whole body imaging  with 10 mCi injection  
1st outpatient visit: pregnancy test; whole body PET (4 hours)  
 
Phase 2 : brain  imaging  (20 mCi)  at baseline  and after BPN14770  
1st outpatient visit: pregnancy test; MRI (2 hours)  
2nd outpatient visit: pregnancy test; baseline brain  PET imaging  (4 hours)  
3rd outpatient visit: pregnancy test, brain  PET imaging  starting  approximately 90-180 min after 
the first dose of PDE4D selective inhibitor  BPN14770  (6 hours) . BPN14770 (50 mg BID) 
administration will be continued for three  and a half  days (the last day subjects will take a 
single dose) . 
4th outpatient visit: On the last day of BPN administration. The third PET scan will be started 
about 90-180 min after the last dose of BPB14770 (4 hours)  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 23 of 41 5th outpatient visit: 3 -7 days after the last dose  of BPN14770  
 
The first two brain  PET scans may be performed on a single  or two different days , based 
on the availability of the subject and the PET camera . The order of the visits for MRI and PET 
scans may be changed based on the availability of the scanners. The baseline PET scan and the 
first PET scan  after BPN14770  administration may occur  on the same day  and, if so,  be 
separated by at least 2 .5 hours  to allow for decay of the first injection (T 1/2 = 20 min).  
 
Phase 3 : whole body imaging with 10 mCi injection  
1st outpatient visit: pregnancy test; whole body PET (4 hours)  
 
Phase 4 : test retest kinetic brain imaging  (20 mCi)  
1st outpatient visit: pregnancy test; MRI (2 hours)  
2nd outpatient visit: pregnancy test;  brain PET ( 4 hours)  
3rd outpatient visit: pregnancy test; retest brain PET ( 4 hours)  
The PET scans may be performed on one day or on two different days. The order of the 
visits for MRI and PET scans  may be changed based on the availability of the scanners.  Both 
PET scans may occur on the same day and, if so, be separated by at least 2.5 hours to allow for 
decay of the first injection (T 1/2 = 20 min).

b. Recruitment  
Healthy volunteers will be recruited under 01 -M-0254  or 17 -M-0181 and not under the 
current protocol.  NIH Employees /staff  will not be directly recruited by or through their 
supervisors  or co -workers  to participate in this study.  
 
c. Screen ing 
 Healthy volunteers will be screened under protocol 01 -M-0254 , “The Evaluation of 
Participants with Mood and Anxiety Disorders and Healthy Volunteers” (PI: Dr. Carlos Zarate)  
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 24 of 41 or 17-M-0181 “Recruitment and Characterization of Healthy Research Volunteers for NIMH 
Intramural Studies ” (PI: Dr. Joyce Chung) . Basic screening will include physical exam, medical 
and psychiatric history, and laboratory test s: CBC; acute care panel; hepatic panel; min eral 
panel; urinalysis; urine drug screen; urine pregnancy test (females); and lipid panel; hepatitis 
panel (A, B, C); syphilis screening test; total protein; uric acid; creatine kinase; cholesterol; 
thyroid panel; prothrombin and partial prothrombin tests ; and EKG . The radial artery pulse is 
checked for the presence of adequate ulnar collateral flow and the absence of any metals or 
foreign objects in bilateral wrists. Screening results will be reviewed by a clinically credentialed 
investigator before the s ubject undergoes any specific study procedures . 
 
d. Study procedures  
Consent will be obtained before any study procedures  are done.  Subjects participating in 
Phase  2 and 4  will receive three (Phase 2) or two (Phase 4)  11C-T-1650 brain PET scan s and a 
brain MRI scan. During the PET scan, arterial blood samples will be drawn. The MRI scan may 
be obtained before, after, or between the two PET scans . The MRI will be performed with a 3 
Tesla magnet  at the NIH . 
Subjects participating in Phases 1  and 3 will receive one 11C-T-1650 whole body PET 
scan. No MRI will take place in these dosimetry /enzyme occupancy studies. All procedures are 
solely for research purposes.  
 
MRI 
 For participants to Phase 2 and 4, A brain MRI will be obtained for anatomic localization 
and will be performed  on a 3 Tesla scanner located at the NIH Clinical Center  and will take 
about one hour. Participants who have had an adequate brain MRI performed at the NIH within 
12 months of the dedicated brain PET scan will be exempt fr om this part of the protocol and their 
earlier MRI will be used for anatomical localization.  Pregnancy tests: For women able to become 
pregnant, urine pregnancy testing will be done within the 24 hours prior to any MRI or PET 
scan.  PET and MRI will not be  done if the pregnancy test is positive.  
 
 
PET Procedures  
1) Radioligand  
11C-T-1650 will be prepared according to the IND and administered via an indwelling 
intravenous catheter over approximately one minute.  
 
2) PET Brain Imaging  
After midnight on the day before, participants are not allowed to take caffeine containing 
drink because caffeine is a nonselective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases. Dedicated  brain imaging 
will be performed using a PET or PET/CT scanner for two to three  hours. Participants will be 
placed on the scanner bed with their head held firmly in place with a thermoplastic mask fixed to 
the bed. A 68Ge, 137Cs, or CT transmission scan will be performed to measure and correct for 
attenuation. Tracer infusions will be performed when the subject is already on the scanner bed. 
After an intravenous bolus of up to 20  mCi, arterial blood samples will be drawn from the 
arterial catheter during the PET scan. We will collect about 10-20 arterial samples. The sampling 
will be performed either at discrete time points and/or continuously. In Phase 2, before and after  
administration of BPN14770, a few samples (< 7) will be obt ained to measure concentration of 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 25 of 41 BPN14770  during each of second and third PET scans . In addition, d uring each scan of Phase  2, 
a few venous samples (< 7) will also be obtained to compare venous  data of Scan 3 with those in 
Scan 1 and 2 because it is diffi cult to place an arterial line with an interval of three days  between  
Scan 2 and 3.  Brain uptake (SUV) normalized to venous blood data will be used to compare scan 
1 and 3.  
The total amount of sampling volume will be about 150 mL in each brain scan. PET 
images will be acquired in three -dimensional mode with increased length of frame for a total of 
approximately two to three hours. If the scan lasts more than two hours, the subject will be 
offered a break out of the camera for approximately 15 minutes . Vital signs  (blood pressure, 
pulse, and respiratory rate) and EKG (either 3 - or 12 -lead)  will be recorded within three hours 
before  tracer injection, and again about 15 , 30, and 120  minutes after tracer injection. After the 
scan, the arterial and venous l ines will be removed and the subject will be instructed to void 
frequently to minimize radiation exposure.  
 
3) PET Whole Body I maging  
 After midnight on the day before, participants are not allowed to take caffeine containing 
drink because caffeine is a no nselective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases. Whole body scans will 
be performed with a PET/CT scanner  for about two hours.  No arterial sampling will be done for 
dosimetry studies but a few venous sample s (< 7) will be  obtained to measure the concentration 
of the radioligand.  Both a pre -injection transmission scan and a series of dynamic emission scans 
will be acquired. Each subject will be imaged in contiguous segments from the top of the head to 
a point below the gonads. To minimize extraneous motion, subj ects will wear a head -holding 
mask and will have their arms and abdomen wrapped with body -restraining sheets. Almost all  
subjects find this restraint comforting (i.e., they are not afraid of  falling off the table), and none 
have found it  intolerable . Vital  signs (blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate) and EKG 
(either 3 - or 12 -lead) will be recorded within three hours of tracer injection, and again about 15,  
30, and 120 min utes after tracer injection.  
 
Pregnancy tests:  For women able to become pregnan t, urine pregnancy testing will be done 
within the 24 hours prior to any MRI or PET scan.  PET and MRI will not be done if the 
pregnancy test is positive.  
 
4) Arterial Line Placement  
After the presence of adequate ulnar collateral flow has b een confirm ed, a radial artery 
catheter will be ins erted by the  Anesthesiology Department  or the Vascular Access Department . 
Before catheter insertion, the skin at the puncture site will be locally anesthetized.  
An arterial line will be placed in all brain scans except Scan 3 in Phase 2 . Scan 3 in Phase 
2 will be performed without arterial line. Only venous samples will be obtained in Scan 3, and 
they will be used to compare Scan 3 with Scan 1 and 2.   
 
5) Preparation  and administration of BPN14770  (Phase 2)   
BPN14770 will be provided by Tetra Discovery to NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy as 
capsules. Tetra Discovery will provide Quality Assurance to NIH Clinical Center Pharmacy.  
Participants will be encouraged to have a light meal prior to enzyme occupancy PET 
studies with blockade by BPN14770 . Participants will be monitored by study clinicians after 
drug administration and during the PET scans to assess drug associated adverse events. On each 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 26 of 41 day while subjects take BPN14770 as an outpatient, a phone call will be made to participants 
who take part in Phase 2 to monitor any possible drug -associated adverse events . Contact 
information of a study clinician will be provided to participants in case they experience adverse 
reactions.  
If a technical problem causes a scan cancellation (e.g., radiochemistry production failure , 
PET camera malfunction , weather conditions, or unforeseen event in subject’s schedule ) after the 
subject takes BPN14770  for three  and a half  days, subjects may continue  to take BPN14770 for 
three  more days (i.e., BPN14770 administration for six and a half  consecutive days) and have 
Scan #3 , if willing.  
 
6) Dietary Guidelines  (Phase 2)  
• Subjects must not consume beverages or foods containin g alcohol or grapefruit from 48 hours 
prior to the first dose of  BPN14770  and within 48 hours after the last dose . 
• Morning doses will be taken after completing an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Evening  
doses will be administered 12 hours after the morning  dose and at least 1 hour after completing 
the evening mea l. During the fasting periods, water will be allowed ad libitum.  
 
7) Lifestyle Guidelines  (Phase 2)  
• Subjects are to refrain from physical activity greater than thei r normal level of activity from 48 
hours prior to the first dose of BPN14770  until the follow up visit 3 – 7 days after the last dose . 
 
8) Laboratory tests after BPN14770 administration (Phase 2)  
• On the day of the first dose of BPN14770, before the dose as well as after the PET scan, the 
following lab tests will be conducted: CBC; acute ca re panel; hepatic panel; mineral panel; 
urinalysis; lipid panel; total protein; uric acid; creatine kinase; cholesterol; thyroid panel.  
 
 
9) Follow up visit after BPN14770 (Phase 2)   
 Adverse events (AEs), physical exams, vital signs, ECG readings, and clinical laboratory 
values will be assessed  through the follow -up visit 3 -7 days  after the last dose of BPN14770 . 
Clinically significant AEs that occur during the study will be followed until  resolution.  
 
e. End of participation  
Participants remain under the care of their own physicians during and after participation 
in this protocol. We will notify participants and, with their written permission, their doctors , of 
any clinically significant results from any procedure done under this protocol.  
 
5. Management of Data and Samples  
a. Storage  
We will follow NIH guidelines to prevent identification of study participants and other 
violations of subject confidentiality. Information will be stored using a confidential case number, 
and no identifiers (name, address, phone number, etc .) will be used that could allow direct 
linking of database information to individual subjects. Secure e -mail will be used for all 
electronic communications of subject information between investigators. Blood samples to 
measure 11C-T-1650 concentrations will be discarded at the end of the study. Blood samples to 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 27 of 41 measure BPN14770  will be kept in a locked freezer in MIB/NIMH  in the NIH Bethesda campus . 
Demographic and clinical data will be archived on a password -protected server.  
All data will be stored on the NIMH server under password -protected accounts accessible 
only to the principal investigator and directly involved study personnel to preserve subject 
privacy. All data are regularly backed up, either by the NIMH system administrator o r by NIMH 
CIT personnel.  
 
b.  Data  and sample sharing plan  
No samples will be saved after completion of the study, and no samples will be shared.  
De-identified d ata will be shared with Tetra Discovery Partners , but the de-identified data will 
not be publicly available until publication of the results . However , de-identified  data may be 
shared with collaborating laboratories at the NIH (e.g., Carlos Zarate)  as part of planning for a 
potential clinical trial. When the data are made publicly available, they may be stored outside of 
the NIH and/or submitted to NIH -designated repositories and databases . Repositories receiving 
data from this protocol may be open -access or restricted access.  
Genomic data will not be obtained under this protocol.  
When data are shared, they  will be stripped of identifiers and may be coded (“de -
identified”) or unlinked from an identifying code (“anonymized”). When coded data are share d, 
the key to the code will not be provided to collaborators, but will remain at the NIH. Data may 
be shared with investigators and institutions with an FWA or operating under the Declaration of 
Helsinki (DoH) and reported at the time of continuing review.  Sharing with investigators without 
an FWA or not operating under the DoH will be submitted for prospective IRB approval. 
Submission to NIH -sponsored or supported databases and repositories will be reported at the 
time of the Continuing Review.  Submission  to non -NIH sponsored or supported databases and 
repositories will be submitted for prospective IRB approval.  
Required approvals from the collaborating institution will be obtained and materials will 
be shipped in accordance with NIH and federal regulation s.    
 
6. Additional Considerations  
a. Research with investigational drugs or devices  
This study involves two INDs, one for  11C-T-1650 and another for BPN14770 . The IND for 
11C-T-1650 has not yet been submitted to the FDA.  The IND for BPN14770, #127 ,905, is 
sponsored by Tetra Discovery Partners, Grand Rapids, MI . The drug will be stored according 
to the Investigator Brochure, which has been uploaded into PTMS.  
  
b. Gene therapy  
Not applicable . 
 
7. Risks and Discomforts  
a. Medical examination and laboratory testing  
 Medical examinations, including phlebotomy for blood analysis, are associated with only 
minimal risk. There is usually some discomfort when the needle is inserted for phlebotomy.  
There is minimal medical  risk associated with having an E KG. The pat ient may feel 
uncomfortable while the electrodes are attached to the chest. The conductive gel sometimes 
causes some mild irritation.  
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 28 of 41 b. Radiation exposure risks  
 Radiation exposure in this protocol will be from 11C-T-1650 and the associated 
transmission scans. To estimate the radiation exposure from this new radioligand, we will follow 
the suggestion from our laboratory [17] and approved by the NIH RSC  and the FDA . 
Specifically, we found that the average exposure of all published human s tudies with 11C-
radioligands more accurately reflected  radiation exposure  than estimation based on imaging in 
monkeys with that particular radioligand.  
The average effective dose from  21 radioligands  labeled with 11C was 0. 019 rem/mCi  
[16]. Thus, the  radiation expos ure from a single injection of 20  mCi yield s an effective dose of 
0.38 rem, not including the transmission scan (described below), which is well below the NIH 
limit of 5 rem.  
With regard to expos ure from the transmission scan, the PET Department recently 
implemented Dr. Innis’s suggestion to decrease the current (amperage) and, thereby, the 
radiation from the CT. We do not need a high resolution (high current) image for attenuation 
correction; a l ow resolution, like that from a line source, is perfectly adequate to correct 
attenuation in the PET emission scan. With the lowered current, the exposure to the lens of the 
eye is now 0.26 rem, about 1/3 of the previous value . 
We wish to maintain flexibility in the choice of PET cameras. Among the various PET 
cameras, PET/CT has the highest exposure. The effective doses for one head and one whole 
body transmission scan from a PET/CT are 0. 02 and 0. 66 rem, respectively.  In additi on, we 
allow for up to two transmission scans in case the subject temporarily leaves the camera (e.g., to 
urinate) or moves significantly.  
 
The radiation exposure from the four phases of this protocol is as follows:  
Phase 1: Whole  Body Scan . The effective dose comes from 1 0 mCi radioligand ( = 0.38 / 
2 rem) plus two whole body transmission scans (2 * 0. 56 rem) for a total of 1.31 rem. This dose 
is described in the consent for m as “about 2 rem.”  
Phase 2: Three  brain scans . The effective dose comes from three injections of 20 mCi 
radioligand (3  * 0.38 rem) plus up to six head  transmission scans ( 6 * 0.02 rem) for a total of 
1.26 rem. This dose is described in the consent for as “about 1 rem.”  
Phase 3: One Whole Body Scan . The effective dose  comes from one injec tion of 20 mCi 
radioligand ( 0.38 rem) plus up to two transmission scans (2  * 0.56 rem) for a total of 1.5  rem. 
This dose is also described in the consent form as “about 2 rem.”  
Phase 4 : Two brain scans . The effective dose comes from two injections of 20 mCi 
radioligand (2  * 0.38 rem) plus up to four head  transmission scans ( 4 * 0.02 rem) for a total of 
0.84 rem. This dose is described in the consent for as “about 1 rem.”  
 
Each subject will not participate in more than one phase of this study.  
 
 
c. PET scanning  
 PET scans, which detect injected radioactivity within the body, are not associated with 
any known physical hazards to the subject lying on the table. We routinely use a series of 
procedures to minimize the risk of discomfort during scanning sessions. Namely, the procedures 
are conducted in the presence of trained health professionals to whom participants will have 
ready access should they experience any problems. Participants can communicate with the 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 29 of 41 trained health professionals while in the scanner and can be removed from the scanner and 
withdraw from the study at any time if they wish to do so. Participants can also request that the 
operator stop the scan.  
 
d. Arterial line placement  
Placement of a radial arterial catheter may cause bruising  or infection. There is also a risk 
of occlusion and microemboli. Over 3,000 arterial catheters have been placed to date at NIH 
Clinical Center for PET scans . Of these, only two complications requiring physician’s care arose. 
In the first case, a small radial artery aneurysm developed several months later, which was 
successfully repaired surgically. In the second case, a radial artery thrombosis developed 28 d ays 
later, which was also successfully repaired surgically.  
 
e. Intravenous line placement  
Venous catheter insertion can be associated with discomfort, bruising, infection, or clot 
formation. Using proper placement techniques will minimize these risks.  
In case of tracer extravasation, we will stop the study, remove the venous line from the 
arm, and apply cold compress to the site.  
 
f. Blood sampling  
 Participants will have arterial and venous blood sampling . The total amount o f blood 
drawn will not exceed 500 mL. Some of the blood will be collected via phlebotomy and some 
through venous and arterial lines. Blood sampling may lead to the formation of small 
subcutaneous hematomas caused by blood leaking from a punctured blood vessel. Such 
hematomas cause only  minor discomfort. They  are not dangerous and require no treatment other 
than reassuring the patient. There is also a small risk of infection at the site of the needle 
puncture, which can be readily treated with antibiotic therapy  We will ask participants not to 
donate blood within 8 weeks prior to the study or for 8 weeks following the study.   
 
g. MRI  
 People are at risk for injury from the  MRI magnet  if they have pacemakers or other 
implanted electrical devices, brain stimulator s, some types of dental implants, aneurysm clips 
(metal clips on the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, 
heart valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pump, or shrapnel 
fragments. Weld ers and metal workers are also at risk for injury because of possible small metal 
fragments in the eye of which they may be unaware. Subjects will be screened for these 
conditions before having any scan, and if they have any, they will not receive an MRI s can.   
 It is not known if MRI is completely safe for a developing fetus. Therefore, all women of 
childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed no more than 24 hours before each 
MRI scan. The scan will not be done if the pregnancy test is pos itive.  
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with 
back problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner. The noise from the 
scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already  have hearing loss. 
Everyone having a research MRI scan will be fitted with hearing protection. Subjects will be 
asked to complete an MRI screening form for each MRI scan they have. There are no known 
long-term risks associated with MRI scans.  
 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 30 of 41 h. BPN14770  administration  
 Participants in Phase 2 will receive BPN14770  50 mg BID for three days , and a single 
dose of BPN14770 on the fourth day . Only minor adverse events are expected , which include:  
headache , diarrhea,  nausea, vomiting,  hot flashes, increased alanine aminotransferase and 
aspartate aminotransferase , hypotension, and dizziness.    
 
 
8. Subject Safety Monitoring  
Participants will be carefully monitored by clinical staff and asked about the presence of 
adverse events throughout the study , including during the PET procedure . The site of the catheter 
insertion will be carefully monitored for signs of bleeding.  
 
a. Parameters to be monitored  
For each 11C-T-1650  scan: Pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate , and E KG (either 3- 
or 12 -lead)  will be recorded within three hours before tracer injection and again at about 15, 30, 
and 120 minutes after injection.  Laboratory tests  will be done before and after tracer 
administration  to monitor for changes.  Monitoring will be performed by a credenti aled clinician.  
For BPN14770  (Phase 2) : On the day of the first dose of BPN14770, before the dose  as 
well as after the PET scan , the following lab tests will be conducted: CBC; acute care panel; 
hepatic panel; mineral panel ; urinalysis;  lipid panel ; total protein; uric acid; creatine kinase; 
chole sterol; thyroid panel.  
In addition, 3 -7 days after the last dose of BPN14770, participants are asked to visit NIH 
to check the presence of adverse events. The following parameters will be monitored during t he 
follow up visit:  
• Brief physical examination  
• Orthostatic (supine sitting, standing) blood pressure and pulse  
• ECG  
• Body weight.  
• CBC; acute care panel; hepatic panel; mineral panel; urinalysis; urine pregnancy test 
(females); and lipid panel; tota l protein; uric acid; creatine kinase; cholesterol; thyroid 
panel . 
 
b. Criteria for individual subject withdrawal  
Patients will be removed from the study if they become pregnant, are unable to continue 
to cooperate, or have an alteration in clinical status  needing medical intervention. Patients may 
withdraw from the trial at any time at their own request. The investigators  may withdraw a 
subject if the subject cannot meet study requirements, or the investigator deems that it is not in 
the subjects’ best int erest to continue.  
 
9. Outcome Measures  
a. Primary outcome measures  
 In baseline scans of 11C-T-1650 , the primary outcome measure is its  binding , specifically 
identifiability, stability over time, and retest variability of VT calculated with compartmental 
modeling.  Phase 2 (BPN14770 administration)  has two primary outcome measures, VND of 11C-
T-1650 and binding site occupancy of BPN14770. VND of 11C-T-1650 will be measured by 
comparing  11C-T-1650 binding ( VT) between  Scan #1 ( baseline) and Scan #2 because arterial 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 31 of 41 data will be available to calculate VT. Binding site occupancy of BPN14770 under stable plasma 
concentrations of BPN14770 and VND of 11C-T-1650 will be measured  by comparing Scan #1 
and #3 using  brain uptake (SUV) normalized to venous concentrations of 11C-T-1650 because 
arterial line will not be placed for Scan #3 due to the short interval of the scans.  
 
b. Secondary outcome measures  
Biodistribution and dosimetry of  11C-T-1650 . 
 
10.  Statistical Analysis  
a. Analysis of data/ study outcomes  
Brain imaging data will be analyzed with compartmental modeling using a nonlinear least 
squares analysis, graphical analysis of integration plot, and multilinear regression analys is. PET 
and MRI scans will be co -registered for anatomic definition of regions of interest. SUV will be 
calculated in various brain regions. Parametric images will be created using PMOD software 
(PMOD Technologies Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland  
 
b.  Power analysis  
This kinetic modeling will give us 11C-T-1650 binding values  as well as  their 
identifiability and stability over time. Because of inter -subject variability in pharmacokinetics 
and metabolism of PET radioligands, a sample size  of approximately 1 2 is require d in such 
studies [19-21]. A similar or a little smaller sample size of 10 is often used to measure drug 
occupancy by PET [22]. In order to accou nt for drop -outs, we request a recruitment ceiling of 15 
subjects  for each of Phase 2 and 4 . To estimate radiation absorbed doses by performing whole 
body imaging, a sample size of about eight is used in many studies. In order to account for drop -
outs, we request a recruitment ceiling of 10 for w hole body imaging (Phase 1 and 3  combined).  
 
 
11. Human Subjects Protection  
a. Subject selection  
Participants will be selected based on the study's eligibility criteria. Participants will be 
admitted to the protocol regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity.  NIMH employees/staff and their 
immediate family members will be excluded from the study per NIMH policy.  
 
b. Justification for exclus ion of children  
 Because this protocol has more than minimal risk from radiation exposure without 
possibility of direct benefit, inclusion of children is not appropriate.  
 
c. Justification for the exclusion of vulnerable subjects  
Pregnant women will be ex cluded because this protocol involves exposure to ionizing 
radiation. Lactating women will be excluded because radioisotopes may be excreted in milk.
 Persons with brain disease and HIV infection are excluded to ensure that the results we 
see are related on ly to PDE4D  and not to another abnormality in the brain, such as diseases that 
are likely to be associated with a disruption of the blood -brain barrier or a viral infection of the 
brain.  
 
d. Justification for sensitive procedures   
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 32 of 41  Not applicable  
 
e. Safeguards for vulnerable populations  
Pregnancy testing will be performed before PET and MRI scanning for any participants 
of child -bearing potential. Per the protocol eligibility criteria, if participants are able to become 
pregnant or father a child, ad equate measures to prevent pregnancy must be in place. If 
participants chose to use barrier methods of contraception, the acceptable forms include  
diaphragm, cervical cap, male condom, female condom, and spermicidal  foam and sponges. 
Females who say they a re post -menopausal will have this status confirmed  by a follicle  
stimulating hormone (FSH) test at Screening. In addition, all females must have a negative 
pregnancy test  within 24  hours before the first dose of BPN14770 regardless of childbearing 
potential.  
Protections for NIH employees and staff participating in this study include : 1) ensuring 
that participation or refusal to participate will have no effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the 
subject’s employment or position at the NIH, 2) giving employees and staff who are interested in 
participating the “NIH Information Sheet on Employee Res earch Participation” prior to 
obtaining consent, and 3) ensuring that there will be no direct solicitation of employees or staff.  
This study collects sensitive information . For example,  we may collect information on  
drug and alcohol use, medical history an d diagnoses . The PI will train study staff regarding 
obtaining and handling potentially sensitive and private information about co -workers through 
staff discussions and written branch/section procedures.  
 
Patient advocate  
A patients ’ rights representative is available to participants on this protocol. The 
representative is located in Building 10 and can be reached by phone at 301 -496-2626. 
Participants may ask any questions about the study and may withdraw their consent at any time.

demonstrating the relationship between ketamine infusion and reductions in suicidal thoughts, 
and has s ince published over 10 articles related to the neurobiology of suicide risk.  He has a 
strong track record in recruiting, studying and publishing novel research findings and mentoring 
junior colleagues in his area of expertise. His  primary responsibility w ill be to provide 
independent safety monitoring in a timely fashion.  
b. Data and safety monitoring plan  
About every six months, t he PI will prepare  for the Independent Monitor a report on data and 
safety parameters , includ ing all AEs, SAEs, and protocol deviations . The Independent monitor 
will provide a written monitoring report to be submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
 
c. Criteria for stopping the study or suspending enrollment or procedures  
 The study will be stopped in the event of  a Serious Adverse Event related to research or if 
new data sheds light on the danger of any procedure used on this protocol.  The PI/Independent 
Monitor and IRB will determine if changes are needed for the research to continue or if it will 
be closed. Any  changes required as conditions for resuming the research must be submitted as 
an amendment and IRB -approved before the changes can be implemented.  
 
16. Quality Assurance  
a.QA Monitor  
Quality assurance will be monitored by the PI, the research team , and the Office of 
Regulatory Oversight (ORO).  
 
b. QA Plan  
ORO  monitors intramural research studies to ensure compliance with GCP, organizational 
policies and regulations. Audit frequency is determined by the ORO SOP based on the study 
level of risk. Results of th e ORO audits are provided to the PI, the Clinical Director and the CNS 
  
CNS IRB Protocol Template (05.04.17)     
   
Page 35 of 41 IRB. As an IND study, t his protocol will be subject to GCP audits at study initiation and after the 
first enrolled subject. Timing of subsequent review will be established by the ORO bu t no less 
frequent than every other year .  
 
17. Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events , and Protocol Deviations  
Reporting of Unanticipated problems, adverse events and protocol deviations  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for detecting, do cumenting, and reporting 
unanticipated problems, adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), and 
deviations in accordance with NIH policy, IRB requirements, and federal regulations. 
Relatedness to the research of all serious adverse even ts will be determined by the P I in 
consultation with the CD.  
Serious unanticipated problems, serious adverse events (including deaths) that are not 
unanticipated problems, and serious protocol deviations will be reported to the IRB and CD as 
soon as possib le and in writing not more than 7 days after the PI first learns of the event, unless 
immediate reporting is waived for specific serious adverse events as noted below. Not serious 
unanticipated problems and not serious deviations will be reported to the IRB and CD as soon as 
possible and in writing not more than 14 days after the PI first learns of the ev ent. Written 
reports will be submitted in PTMS.  
All adverse events, deviations, and unanticipated problems will be summarized and 
reported at the time of  Continuing Review.  
 
It is anticipated that participants in this study will occasionally miss or fail to complete an 
assessment or procedure, such as a completion of a rating scale or a blood draw, or fail to 
complete a procedure or visit within protocol -specified time frames.  Omissions such as these 
will be considered expected events and not protocol deviations provided they are infrequent and 
do not include data needed to assess safety or the primary study outcome.   Cumulative 
proportions of these missed  events in the study population will be presented to the IRB annually. 
In addition, the rate of omissions will be monitored by the Investigators. If an individual misses 
more than 15% of the required assessments/procedures or if more than 15% of the partic ipants 
miss completion of the same assessment or procedure, it will be considered a deviation and a 
deviation report will be sent to the IRB within two weeks.   
If the total number of expected items (study visits, study assessments/procedures) is less 
than 16, then two or more missed items are reportable. If the total number of expected items is 
greater than 16, then, if more than 15% are missed, it is reportable.   
 
 
For 11C-T1650 and BPN14770  Studied under IND  
The PI will immediately report SAEs to the Spon sor according to the requirements of 21 CFR 
312.64(b) and as agreed upon with the sponsor. The PI will record nonserious AEs and report them to the 
Sponsor  within 14 days.  
 
 
 
18. Alternatives to Participation  
Subjects do not receive any treatment in this study  or forego any treatment in order to 
participate in this study. The alternative, therefore, is not to participate.

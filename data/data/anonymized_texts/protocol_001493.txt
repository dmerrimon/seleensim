1. INTRODUCTION  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous 
system (CNS) that a ffects approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. It is a 
chronic condition characterized clinically by focal disorders of the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord, which remit to a varying extent and recur over a period of many years.  Most patients event ually experience progression and accumulation 
of symptoms which can include profound muscle weakness, impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive and visual impairments and sexual dysfunction [1].  
In patients that have disability t hat involves the upper extremity, this  
can lead to loss of independence in activities of daily living such as dressing, feeding and hygiene [2]. Upper extremity (UE) strength is also important for a 
patient being able to independently shift weight in a wheelchair, maneuver an 
electric wheelchair,  and change position in bed, thus minimizing risk for 
decubitus ulcers. As opposed to lower extremity function, a very small loss of strength and function can translate into significant changes in functional independ ence. The loss of independence then impacts quality of life ( QoL) for 
both the patient and the caregiver(s).  
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIV ES 
To measure for clinical stabilization  (defined as no significant change ( ≤20%)  
from baseline of UE function  in multiple sclerosis patients with upper extremity  
impairment  treated with Ocrevus™.   
 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECT IVES  
To evaluate the relationship between UE function (objective and subjective)  and 
fatigue, cognition and QoL.  
 
3.      STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF  THE STUDY  
Ocrevus™ is the first FDA approved disease- modifying treatment for primary 
progressive MS as well as relapsing MS [3]. In the clinical trials considered by the FDA (OPERA I/II, ORATORIO), the highest Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) inclu ded in the participants was 5.5 (OPERA I/II) and 6.5 
(ORATORIO) [4]. The EDSS score is heavily weighted on walking ability and is not a useful measurement for UE function [5,6]. The primary endpoint in the primary progressi ve MS trial with Ocrevus™ was EDS S and in the relapsing MS 
studies, EDSS was used as a secondary endpoint. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score (Z score), a composite of quantitative measure of walking speed, upper limb coordinated movement (9 Hole Peg Test/9HPT ) and c ognitive function, was obtained as a secondary clinical 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
4/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  measure with scores being favorably higher in patients treated with Ocrevus™ 
(OPERA I/II).The z score, however, is not very useful in delineating which of the three clinical functions was maintained or showed less progression given that three domains are included in the score [7,8,9]. Data presented recently  from 
the Oratorio trial analyzed the intention to treat population of PPMS patients and 
the subgroups of patients with upper extremity functional impairment using the 
9HPT ; results demonstrated reduction in risk of clinical progression in upper 
extremity disability in patients treated with Ocrevus compared to placebo.  There 
was improvement in the change from baseline to week 120 in 9HPT time in 
treated patients.  Abnormal baseline  9HPT was defined as >25 seconds and 
upper extremities were defined as “better hand” and “worse hand” , each 
individually tested, with clinical progression determined at 12 and 24 weeks in 3 sub-categories of progression: leng thened time of 9HPT >15%, >20% and 25%. 
[10] 
In our study w e aim to not only replicate the results in the Oratorio  trial with 
upper extremity dysfunction, but also widen the spectrum of patients that may benefit (given an expanded MS population of patients , not exclusive to PPMS 
and widen the range of potential disability that the patients may have (broader  
EDSS rage 4 -8). We anticipate that by using a test that better emulates activities 
of daily life performed with the upper extremity, such as the TEMPA ( Test 
d’Evaluation de la performance des membres Superieurs e Personnes Agees)  
we will obtain more real life application of the benefits of receiving treatment with 
Ocrevus, and anticipate that patients can maintain the function they have or potentially imp rove function.  
 
3.2 RATIONALE FOR ST UDY DESIGN 
We anticipate the use of Ocrevus™ in patients with progressive disease which 
includes  those with advanced disability , regardless of a dearth of data to guide 
the prescriber regarding its effect in this populat ion.  The rational for this study is 
to gain information which will help the prescribers of Ocrevus™ answer the question “Will Ocrevus™ help me  if I have hand or arm weakness ?” especially  if 
posed by a more advanced MS patient (EDSS 4 .0-8.0 with UE involvement) 
than those included in the clinical trial s. In previous trials (ORATORIO), the 
included patients were only those diagnosed with primary progressive MS and their entry EDSS was of a lower disability range (3.0- 6.5) than those proposed in 
this study. T herefore, the results cannot be completely extrapolated to the 
population of multiple sclerosis patients with more advanced disability that we propose to study.  We aim to identify MS patients that have weakness in at least 
one upper limb , knowing that delaying disability affecting the functional use of 
the UE will help patients remain independent for some activities of daily life and 
will contribute to an improved quality of life.  
 The importance of choosing validated upper limb outcome assessment tools cannot be emphasized enough. The Nine- Hole Peg Test ( 9HPT), an objective 
measure of manual dexterity, which is  incorporated into the MSFC , is a widely 
used measure across most  clinical trials in multiple sclerosis populations.   
 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
5/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  The EDSS is an ordinal scale o f neurological disability designed specifically for 
MS patients and will provide specific quantitative measure of upper limb 
strength, sensory impairment and ataxia of the upper limb with each Functional System Subscore.  This score will aid in deciphering limitations due to tremors or 
ataxias.  
 
The Test d'Evaluation de la performance des Membres Supérieurs des 
Personnes Agées  (TEMPA ) has been previously studied for validity in clinical 
trials  and specifically in multiple sclerosis patient populations  and the re was a 
strong  correlation between the TEMPA and 9HPT . [11, 12] The TEMPA consists 
of 9 tasks that mimic tasks of daily living such as picking up a jar, pouring water 
from a pitcher, handling coins, writing on an envelope and opening a pill 
container , as examples . The tasks are assessed by a rater by measuring speed 
of execution (seconds)  and by functional rating of the subject’s independence in 
performing them using an ordinal scale of 0 (completed without difficulty) to - 3 
(could not complete the task ). The test provides a unilateral and bilateral score 
and evaluates different grasp, grip and pinch functions.  Obtaining baseline 
scores and sequential measurements will  allow us to graph  scores over time for 
each patient and assess the change. T his type of testing  would give us a clear 
picture of any changes in UE functionality and would highlight meaningful 
clinical data that would be easily translated to patients - stability of function vs 
clinical progression >20% change from baseline. This  key data would be a 
helpful reference when discussing starting treatment with Ocrevus™ in this 
population of patients.  
 
The normative values available for the TEMPA were obtained in the elderly (ages 60- 80, men and women). The speed of execution of the 9 tasks in each 
hand takes about 70 to 80 seconds to complete in this population.  [12] 
When one reviews the validity study of the TEMPA in MS patients [average EDSS was 7 and age median was 46 years old], this same parameter took them between 100 and 400 seconds [1  and 1/2 to 6 minutes] to complete.  
 Schwid et al in 2002 showed that MS patients did not vary from their baselines in performing the 9HPT  by >20% day -to day and therefore the if there was 
change measured >20% from their baseline this was stipulated to indicate change in function [13]. 
In a pilot study where a technology enhanced training program for improving upper limb muscle strength in MS patients the TEMPA was used at baseline and 8 weeks later, and there was a trend towards statistical significance of improvement in function with TEMPA change of 20 to 40 seconds [14].  
Since the 9HPT and TEMPA have been show to correlate and there are numerical values measured in both, we plan to emulate the Oratorio study 
and look at   >15%, >20% and >25% [in better hand and in worse hand] change 
from baseline with increases in time implying clinical progression and stability or decrease in time implying stability or improvement in function.  
  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
6/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  The Jamar dynamometer is validated tool often used by occupational  therapist 
to meas ure grip strength  [15]. Grip strength is an important part of daily living  
tasks and can give clinicians insight into patient restrictions and clinical 
changes.   
 
The Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) is a self -report questionnaire that  
has been found reliable, valid and sensitive as a patient - reported outcome 
measure tool for quantifying UE function  rated on a 5 -point Likert scale This 20-
item measure is recommended in research and clinical setting due to its uni -
dimensionality: it measures only UE  function [ 16,17]. Scores range from 0 to 60 
with lower scores indicating more functional difficulty.  It has been used in 
several studies in patients with musculoskeletal upper extremity problems, to 
include patients with MS, and UEFI scores correlated with mean 9- HPT scores. 
[18] We anticipate  that patients in our study will have perceived stabilization of 
their upper extremity function and plan to use the UEFI to measure this by means of its validated 9 points of change from baseline for minimal detectable  
change in function.   The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a validated measure used to assess mental processing speed in MS clinical trials and has an oral response version.  
There is  evidence that cognitive measures may correlate with upper extremit y 
function. This can possibly be explained by a cerebral relationship between 
motor function and cognition [ 19]. As a secondary measure we will collect 
SDMTs at each visit to explore correlations with upper extremity function, as well as QoL measures . 
 The natural history of progression of disability in MS is foreseeable in a 2- year 
span period  and this is evident when one examines the placebo population in 
the recent Oratorio trial ; obtaining these measures over a 2- year period aims to 
observe stability of  the upper limb function with Ocrevus™ treatment.  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES  
• The UE function will be assessed every 6 months  over 24 months to gauge  for 
any small changes at certain intervals but to also have a sufficient  length of time 
that can be compared in order to assess for any type of change over time. *  
• Incidence of UE  functional changes (improved, worsening or stable)  with scores 
of time and performance on the TEMPA.  
• In this group of patients (advanced disability) there is less concern with relapse rate red uction; relapses happen at a low rate. There is more concern regarding 
any loss of function, and we will focus on UE  function. Studies like this would 
provide better data for this type of patient aiding in the process of selecting appropriate disease modif ying therapy.  
*UE function includes measures on the TEMPA, UEFI and 9HPT.  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
7/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  UEFI is subject ive and answered by the patient. The Upper Extremity Functional 
Index (UEFI) is a self -administered questionnaire which measures disability in 
patients  with upper extr emity conditions. The questionnaire lists 20 activities and 
the patient gives a score to each based on the difficulty they have completing 
that activity. The scores given to the 20 questions are added to give a highest 
possible score of 80. The lowest poss ible score is 0. A lower score indicates that 
the person is reporting increased difficulty with the activities as a result of their 
upper limb condition. The change from baseline per patient and for group means will be analyzed. A clinically significant change is determined as a 12% change.  
[20]  
 
The TEMPA scale is composed of nine  standardized tasks which represents 
activities of daily living. Four items are unilateral (pick up and move a jar; pick up a pitcher and pour water into a glass; handle coins; pick up and move small objects) and five bilateral  tasks (open a jar and take a spoonful of coffee; unlock 
a lock and open a pill container; write on an envelope and stick on a stamp; shuffle and deal playing cards; put a scarf around one ’s neck). The outc ome 
parameters used in this study are speed of execution (seconds) and the functional rating. The functional rating refers to the participant’s independence in 
each task measured on a four -level scale: (0) successfully completed without 
hesitation or diffi culty; ( -1) completed, but with some difficulty; ( -2) partially 
executed or some steps were performed with significant difficulty; and ( -3) not 
completed, even if any degree of assistance was offered.  A total score will be 
determined by adding the scores obtained for both the unilateral and bilateral tasks. Individual analysis of the unilateral and bilateral scores will be conducted 
to evaluate for functional improvement in the affected UE. Scores typically range from 0 to -50, with higher scores representi ng better performance. [12 ] The UE 
function will be measured by a consistent rater that is trained and qualified (must be a MD or equivalent).   The 9HPT is  an objective measure of manual dexterity, which is  incorporated 
into the MSFC , is a widely used measure across most  clinical trials in multiple 
sclerosis populations. The time to completion is measured twice on both the 
dominant and non- dominant hand. For this study purpose will also record the 
“better” and “worse” limb so that the data can be cautiousl y compared to prior 
studies completed in multiple sclerosis patients. The task of the 9HPT is for the patient to pick up each individual peg, one at a time, and place it in the board (that has the same number of peg holes for each peg). Once all the pegs are placed in the peg holes the patient then removes each peg, again one at a time, placing them back into the peg bowl from which they were originally located. Although this measure has been used in several multiple sclerosis trials due to its ease of admi nistration, there are many other factors of upper extremity 
function that are not being assessed that can be captured by the TEMPA.   
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measure  
No significant c hange in UE  function  over 24 months after initiation of Ocrevus™  
measured objectively by measure of time to completion  (seconds)  and functional  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
8/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  score s on TEMPA (0 to - 3). The hypothesis is that there is (stabilization) no 
significant change (within 20%) of TEMPA score from baseline to 24 months  
 
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
No signif icant c hange in UEFI,  or 9HPT from baseline to 24 months.  
Exploratory measures: correlations between change in TEMPA/UEFI/9HPT 
scores and  FSS, MUSIQOL and SDMT values from  baseline through 24months 
after treatment initiation with Ocrevus ™.  
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
Patients will be evaluated at each study visit for the duration of their participation 
in the study  for any new adverse events  (AEs) , especially  for those that may 
interfere with the testing or commercial dosing schedule.  
3.5 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW S AND REGULATI ONS  
This study will be conducted in accordance with current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and local ethical and legal requirements.  
4.0 MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
This is a 24 -month,  prospective,  observational study which w ill be conducted at 
the University of South Florida (USF) MS Center.  On average 80- 100 patients a 
week are seen at the study site.  This large patient population offers a suitable 
number of potential candidates in order to meet the enrollment goal. This stu dy 
will be conducted in adult multiple sclerosis patients who have upper extremity 
impairment  and must satisfy the approved therapeutic indication for Ocrevus™. 
Decision to treat with Ocrevus™ must precede enrollment.  We anticipate 
enrollment will be random and open to any patient that meets the criteria below which will aid in the evaluation of our results to the general MS population.  The 
targeted population are those patients that more often rely on their upper extremity function for activities  of daily living  due to impairment in other systems 
such as gait. ) 
 
Every effort  to maintain consistency (by use of the same rater) for the 
administration of the upper extremity assessments will be made. The same instructions for the patient questionnaires will be g iven at each time point.

4.9.1  Analysis of the Conduct of the Study  
All protocol  violations will be accounted for and summarized in the results and 
discussion. If there are large amounts of missing data imputation measures  may 
be used.  
Demographic information will be collected on all patients in order to present 
descriptive statistics of the population.  
4.9.2  Analysis of Treatment Group Comparability  
There is only one designated treatment group. Descriptive statistics of the baseline characteristics of the enrolled population will be presented in the final report and manuscript.  
 
 
4.9.3 Efficacy Analysis  
a. Primary Endpoint    
1. TEMPA scores after 24 months of OcrevusTM treatment.  
Paired sample t -test to compare the 24 month measurements to the baseline 
measurements.  
Mean within- patient changes from baseline through 24 months ( TEMPA).  One-
way repeated measures AN COVA for TEMPA  scores from baseline, 6 months, 
12 months, 18 months, 24 months  which will account  for baseline characteristics  
(baseline disability level) . A soft stratification will be applied so that recruitment 
will aim to in clude a spread of types of patients, those below overall EDSS of 6.0 
and those above 6.0. If more  than 2/3 of total enrollment is in one of the 
categories, the study team will reestablish efforts to recruit for the other cohort.  
 If data does not have nor mal distribution, then other non- parametric analysis will 
be employed (such as sign test  for TEMPA functional score).  
 The threshold to determine a significant clinical change will be > 20% from 
baseline value. This clinically significant difference is esti mated based on data 
from the Oratorio trials that showed progression among both groups (placebo 
and Ocrevus
TM) but to a lesser extent in the OcrevusTM arm with an established 
clinically significant threshold of 20% (data will be requested from sponsor for 
use to review 9HPT results for the abnormal function at baseline group of 
patients ). Measures will be collected and analyzed as units of time (seconds)  
and as functional scores on an ordinal scale that range from 0 to - 3 (0 indicating 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
13/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  no signs of dysfunctio n).Ad hoc analysis may occur that includes evaluation of 
patients with significant clinical changes versus those that did not have 
significant clinical change  based on any of the subscales within the TEMPA  or 
physical exam.  We will review   >15%, >20% and >25% [in better hand and in 
worse hand] change from baseline with increases in time implying clinical 
progression and stability or decrease in time implying stability or improvement in 
function  
 
b. Secondary Endpoints  
Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to evaluate correlations 
between UE function (measured by TEMPA  and 9HPT) primarily at baseline b ut 
also at  each time point over the 24- month time period to  compare patient 
responses on the UEFI, FSS, and MUSIQOL . Correlations with the primar y 
endpoint scores and the SDMT  will also be analyzed for any indication of new 
cognitive impairment that may interfere with the interpretation of the results.   
 
4.9.4  Safety Analysis 
No safety analysis will occur as these patients will be receiv ing commerc ial 
Ocrevus . A summary of adverse events will be constructed using descriptive 
statistics.   
4.9.5  Missing Data  
Study staff will work to ensure missing data is minimized. If there are less than 
two percent of time points missing, then during analysis , last value carry forward 
imputation will be used. If greater than two percent missing, multiple point 
imputation measures will be used.  
4.9.6  Determination of Sample Size  
It is expected that 30 patients will be eligible to enter this study during the 
proposed t imeframe. This is a pilot study;  the TEMPA is a more comprehensive 
assessment of upper extremity function which we will use in the analysis of this  
group of patients to evaluate what percentage remain stable (within 20% 
variation from baseline) and analyze correlations with other measures of upper 
extremity function (9HPT and patient perception using the UEFI).  Therefore, this 
is not a calculated sample size as there is a lack of historical data available for 
this population  and the modalities of testing  we plan to utilize . We do not have 
historical data to gather estimates for an accurate power calculation.  We plan to 
gather data on 30 patients but will screen up to 35 in case of screen failures or early withdraw als. Even with the limited calculations we believe that we will be 
able to analyze for a clinically meaningful lack of change (stabilization).  
  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
14/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  4.10 DATA QUALITY AS SURANCE  
Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of 
standard practices and procedures.  
5. REPORTING OF AD VERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1   ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
Specification of Safety Variables  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  per protocol.   This includes  all events 
of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
Adverse Events 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution.  
 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -
specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with Multiple Sclerosis  that were not present prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment 
associated with medication washout, no treatment run- in, or other protocol -
mandated intervention.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by the investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or changed in character duri ng the protocol -specified AE reporting period.  
Serious Adverse Events 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization.  
• It results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother exposed to the IMP.  
• It is consider ed a significant medical event by the investigator based on 
medical judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
15/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020   
5.2   METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY 
VARIABLES  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are 
observed or reported during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, 
appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Re ports).  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs  as described in section 5.1 
where the subject has been exposed to a Genentech product  must be reported . 
The Reporting period  begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of  
any study procedures  and ends 30 days following the last administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the subject, discovered by study 
personnel during questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE 
or SAE will be described by its duration (i.e.,  start and end dates), regulatory 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to ocrelizumab (see 
following guidance), and actions taken.  
 To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causal ity assessments, investigators 
should apply the following general guideline:  
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of ocrelizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the 
subject’s clinical stat e, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the 
AE follows a known pattern of response to ocrelizumab; and/or the AE abates or 
resolv es upon discontinuation of ocrelizumab  or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than ocrelizumab  (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to ocrelizumab administratio n (e.g., event  diagnosed 2 days after first dose of 
ocrelizumab).  
 Expected AEs are those AEs  that are listed or characterized in the Package 
Insert  (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure (IB).  
 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
16/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the P.I. or current  IB or not identified. 
This includes AEs  for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the 
description in the P.I. or IB. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected if the P.I. or IB  only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes 
or hepatitis.  
 
Unexpected disease progression defined by increase in 1 point on the upper 
extremity strength scores in the Pyramidal FSS of the EDSS above baseline subsequently confirmed at repeat assessment 6 months later would imply worsening  of upper extremity function and require clinical evaluation.  
 For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy.  
 
5.3   PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
Eliciting Adverse Events 
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points 
should be adopted. Examples of non- directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new  or changed health problems since you were last   
       here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting 
AEs or SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a 
single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable  to report 
the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see 
Section 5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that c aused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
17/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  c. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. 
Such conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be re- assessed throughout the trial and 
reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of  the 
condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including 
applicable descriptors (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).  
d. Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures  
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as an SAE. If a subject is hospitalized to undergo a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass surgery, record the heart condition that necessitated the bypass as the SAE.  
 Hospitaliza tions for the following reasons do not require reporting:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical 
procedures for preexisting conditions  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measure ment for the study or  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the 
target disease of the study.  
e. Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events 
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5 .0 Update 
current versions) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Below Table  should be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are not 
specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v 5.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden.  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event  
d. Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events   
 
f.         Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving ocrelizumab or with in 6 
months  after the last dose of ocrelizumab, a report should be completed and 
expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow -up to obtain the outcome 
of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spontaneous, s hould always be classified as serious, and expeditiously 
reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the ocrelizumab should be reported as an 
SAE.  
 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
19/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  Additional information on any ocrelizumab- exposed pregnancy and infant will be 
requested by  Genentech Drug Safety at specific time points (i.e. after having 
received the initial report, at the end of  the second trimester, 2 weeks after the 
expected date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the  infant’s life).  
 
g. Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject 
has completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior ocrelizumab exposure. If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE  adequately to Genentech Drug Safety during the follow -up 
period.  
 
h. Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports  
The Sponsor agrees to conduct  the Case Transmission verification to ensure 
that all single case reports have been adequately received by Genentech  via the Sponsor emailing Genentech a Quarterly line- listing documenting single 
case reports sent by the  Sponsor to Genentech in the preceding time period.  
The periodic line- listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the 
end of the agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be recei ved within 
the time period mutually agreed upon.  
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case- by-case basis until sati sfactory resolution.  The 
sponsor shall receive reconciliation guidance documents within the ‘Activation Package’.  
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been received by Genentech shall be forwarded by the  Sponsor to Genentech 
within five (5) calendar days from request by Genentech.  
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification report will be sent to Genentech .  
 
i.  AEs of Special Interest (AESI)  
AESIs are a subset of Events to Monitor (Et Ms) of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the product, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such an event might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it . 
Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial Sponsor 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
20/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  to other parties (e.g., Regulatory Authorities) may also be warranted . 
 
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:  
• Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical j aundice, as defined by Hy’s 
law: 
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below  
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non- pathogenic, 
is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that 
indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applie s only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected  
 
  
j. Adverse Event  Reporting 
The Sponsor will track all protocol -defined AE and pregnancy reports originating  
from the Study for the Product.  
 Investigators must report all AEs, SAEs , AESIs  pregnancy reports and special 
situation reports (if applicable) adequately  to Genentech within the timelines 
described below. The completed Medwatch or CIOMS I form or Genentech 
approved reporting forms should be faxed immediately upon completion to 
Genentech at the following contacts :

market or clinical trial.  
 
REPORTING RE QUIREMENTS FOR ADVERSE EVENTS ORIGINATING 
FROM PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES  
Although sites are not expected to review the PRO data, if physician/study personnel become aware of a potential adverse event during site review of the PRO questionnaire data, he/she will determine whether the criteria for an 
adverse event have been met and, if so, these must be reported using the Adverse Event and Special Situation Reporting Form or MedWatch form.  
5.4   MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information  (Section C & D) , the report should include the following 
information within the Event Description (section B. 5) of the MedWatch 3500A 
form:  
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
• Desc ription of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known 
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  (Section B.6)  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the AE  to each   
      investigational product and suspect medication  
Follow -up Informa tion 
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by any of the following methods:  
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow -up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up 
with the original MedWatch 3500A form  
• Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including patient identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, patient number), protocol description and number, if assigned, brief AE description, and notation that additional or 
follow -up information is being submitted (The patient identifiers are important 
so that the new information is added to the correct initial report) . 
 MedWatch 3500A (Mandatory Reporting) form is available at  
https://www.fda.gov/media/69876/download
 
 
5.5      Reporting to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators  
The Sponsor of the Study will be responsible for the expedited reporting of safety reports originating from the Study to the Regulatory Authorities (FDA) where it has filed 
a clinical trial approval, in compliance with local regulations.  
 Genentech will be responsible for the expedited reporting of safety reports originating from the Study to the EMA through Eudrav igilance Clinical Trial Module (EVCTM).  The 
Protocol:  (University of South Florida}  
23/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  Sponsor will be responsible for the distribution of safety information to its own 
investigators, where relevant . 
5.6      Additional Reporting Requirements for IND Holders  
For Investigator -Initiated  Studies, some  additional reporting requirements for the FDA 
apply in accordance with the guidance set forth in 21 CFR § 600.80.  
 
Events meeting the following criteria need to be submitted to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) as expedited IND Safety Reports accordi ng to the following 
guidance and timelines:  
7 Calendar Day Telephone or Fax Report:  
The Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life- threatening AE 
that is unexpected and assessed by the Investigator to be possibly related to the 
use of ocrelizumab. An unexpected AE is one that is not already described in 
the ocrelizumab IB. Such reports are to be telephoned or faxed to the FDA and 
Genentech/Roche  within 7 calendar days of first learning of the event.  
15 Calendar Day Written Report  
The In vestigator is also required to notify the FDA and all participating 
investigators, in a written IND Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected AE that is considered reasonably or possibly related to the use of ocrelizumab. An unexpected AE is one that is not already described in the ocrelizumab IB . 
 Written IND Safety reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32. All safety reports previously filed by the investigator with the IND concerning similar event s should be analyzed 
and the significance of the new report in light of the previous, similar reports commented on.  
 Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be submitted to the FDA, Genentech /Roche, and all participating investigators within 15 
calendar days of first learning of the event. The FDA prefers these reports on a MedWatch 3500 form, but alternative formats are acceptable (e.g., summary letter ).

6.4 INSTITUTIONAL RE VIEW BOARD OR ETHICS  COMMITTEE APPROVAL  
This protocol, the informed consent document, and relevant supporting 
information must be submitted to the IRB for review and must be approved before the study is initiated.  The study will be conducted in accordance with U.S. FDA, applicable national and local health authorities, and IRB requirements.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for keeping the IRB apprised of the progress of the study and of any c hanges made to the protocol as deemed 
appropriate, but in any case the IRB must be updated at least once a year.  The Principal Investigator must also keep the IRB informed of any significant AEs . 
Investigators are required to promptly notify their respect ive IRB of all adverse 
drug reactions that are both serious and unexpected.  This generally refers to SAEs  that are not already identified in the Investigator Brochure and that are 
considered possibly or probably related to the molecule or study drug by the investigator.  Some IRBs may have other specific AE  requirements that 
investigators are expected to adhere.  Investigators must immediately forward to their IRB any written safety report or update provided by Genentech (e.g.,  IND

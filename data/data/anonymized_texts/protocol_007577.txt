Name of Sponsor/Company:  Acceleron Pharma Inc., 128 Sidney Street, Cambridge, MA 02139  
Name of Investigational Product:  Dalantercept  (also known as ACE -041) 
Name of Active Ingredient: Dalantercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the 
extracellular d omain (ECD) of human activin receptor -like kinase 1 (ALK1) linked to the Fc 
(hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).   
Title of Study: A phase 1b, open label study  of dalantercept plus sorafenib  in patients with 
advanced  hepatocellu lar carcinoma  
Study Center(s):  Up to 20 centers  
Phase of Development:  1b 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of dalantercept plus sorafenib  in patients with 
advanced  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC ) to determine  the recommended  phase 2  
dose level of dalantercept  in combination with  sorafenib  
Secondary:  
• Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of dalantercept and sorafenib when used in 
combination  
• Evaluate the preliminary activity of dalantercept plus sorafenib  in patients with 
advanced HCC  as defined by response rates per RECIST v1.1, time to progr ession 
(TTP), progression free survival (PFS), disease control rate (D CR), and overall 
survival (OS) Explore the association of the expression of BMP9 /10, ALK1 and/or 
other relevant pharmacodynamic (PD) markers in archived  or recent tumor biopsy 
with tumor response and/or other assessments of clinical response  
• Explore association of serum pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers with assessments of 
response  
Study Design, Dosage and Administration :  
This is a n open label , multi -center  phase 1b study to eva luate the safety,  tolerability, PK and PD , 
and preliminary activity  of dalantercept plus sorafenib  in patients with advanced  HCC .   
The dose level of dalantercept  for the first cohort  will be 0. 6 mg/kg administered subcutaneously 
(SC) every 3 weeks  (Q3W)  plus sorafenib 400 mg  orally ( PO) once  daily (QD) .  
Dose escalation:   
The dose escalation portion will include up to  three  planned cohort s of a minimum of 3 patients

dose modification (s) of dalantercept or sorafenib as indicated per protocol or prescribi ng 
information, respectively.   
At least three patients must complete the Day 2 2 visit a t each dalantercept dose level with review 
of data through Day 22 by the Safety Review Team (SRT) prior to escalation to the next higher 
dose level.  The SRT may recommend adding additional patients , for a total of up to 6 patients,  to 
the current  dose level for further evaluation, escalating to  an intermediate dose level or 
discontinuing escalation . 
The planned dose  escalation for dalantercept and sorafenib is outlined below . 
Planned Starting Dose Regimen Per Cohort  
Dose Cohort  Dalantercept  Sorafe nib Number  of 
Patients  
1 0.6 mg/kg Q3W  400 mg QD  3-6 
2 0.9 mg/kg  Q3W  400 mg QD  3-6 
3 0.9 mg/kg  Q3W  400 mg BID  3-6 
Expansion  TBD  TBD  up to 20 
Total (planned)    up to 38  
Expansion cohort:   
Once the MTD  or maximum tested dose level has been determined  by the SRT and Sponsor , up to 
a total of 20 patients may be enrolled at or below the MTD to further evaluate the safety, 
tolerability , and PK profile of dalantercept plus sorafenib.   The SRT will meet after a minimum of 
10 patients ha ve been evaluated for a minimum of 21 days after the first dose of 
dalantercept/sorafenib  (Day 22)  to review safety data.   The SRT may recommend adding up to an 
additional 10 patients to the current  dose level for further evaluation  or to an intermediate  dose 
level . 
Duration of Treatment:   
The total duration of participation in the study will vary between  patient s.  There will be a 14 -day 
screening period, a treatment period lasting for as long as patients are eligible to remain on -study, 
a final visit approximately 1 month after the last dose of dalanterce pt and follow -up for 1 year 
from first dose  for patient survival.    
If a patient has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result at the last visit , the patient may be 
asked to return for additional ADA testing every three months, until a negative result is obtained 
or the result is considered to be stabilized .

proteins or excipients (10 mM Tris buffered  saline) in the investigational agent.   
27. Pregnant or lactating female patients.  
Assessments  for Evaluation:  
Safety:  Patient safety will be assessed by monitoring AEs using the NCI -CTCAE v4 current 
minor version , physical examinations, vital signs (including weight), clinical laboratory tests, 
ECHO, ECG and ADA testing.   
Preliminary Activity : Response to treatment with dalantercept plus sorafenib  will be determined 
according to  RECIST v1.1 evaluating  response rates, time to progression (TTP), progression free 
survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), and overall survival (OS). Patients will be assessed for 
efficacy using data from tumor response assessments as well as evaluation of PD biomarkers  in 
blood and tissue . 
Statistical Methods:  
Determination of Sample Size:  There is no formal sample size calculation for this study.  A 
standard dose escalation of 3-6 patients  will be implemented  for dose escalation  and up to 
20 patients may be enrolled in the expansion to further evaluate  safety, tolerability , and the PK 
profile of this combination.  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) will be used for all safety analyses and will consist of all patients 
who received any study drug.    
The Pharmaco kinetics (PK) population  will consist of  all patients who have received at least 
1 dose of dalantercept  plus sorafenib and have sufficient  PK samples collected and assayed . 
Primary Safety Analysis  
The safety analyses will be performed on the SAF populatio n.  Adverse event incidence rates will 
be tabulated by System Organ Class and preferred term and without regard to causality.  The 
frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades, will be summarized.  
Shift tables and change from baseline will be summarized by analyte for laboratory panels.  
Treatment -emergent laboratory findings will be summarized.   Change from baseline and shift 
tables may be presented for vital sign and ECG parameters.  
Interim Analysis

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 11 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  1   All visit day windows should be determined  relative to the date of the previous dose of dalantercept  except  for tumor assessments  (see footnote 11) .  Actual visit days (e.g., day 1, day 8, 
day 15) may be different than planned due to windows on visits and potential dosi ng delays.  
2   All screening procedures sh ould be performed within 14 days pri or to study day 1.  ECHO and  tumor response assessment scans obtained for clinical purposes within 28 days prior to 
study day 1 may be used as the baseline image for this study a nd do not need to be repeated.   
3   Perform all assessments prior to dosing  dalantercept  plus sorafenib and review  for potential dose modifications .  All AEs and abnormal laboratory or other findings that might require 
modification of dosing (see Section 11.5) should be reviewed prior to dosing to ensure that the patient is still eligible to receive dalantercept. Assessments perfor med on C1D1 prior to 
dosing will be considered baseline.   
4   If the patient has stable or responding disease at the end of 6 cycles of treatment , repeat the procedures performed for cycl es 5 and 6 until the patient completes cycle 14  (C7D1=C5D1, 
C8D1=C6D1, etc.).  NOTE: after cycle 6, ADA and urinalysis only need to be repeated once every 4 cycles (C10D1, C14D1, etc.). If the patient has stable or responding disease at the 
end of 1 4 cycles of treatment, please refer to Section  3. Schedule of E vents (Cycle ≥15)  
5   Patients who terminate from the study should complete the Final Visit.  The Final Visit should occur approximately 30 days after the last dose of dalantercept ±  10 days.  The tumor 
response assessment at the Final Visit should only be performed to  assess progression if progression has not already been confirmed by a previous tumor response assessment scan .  
6   ECHO scans for ejection fracti on and presence or absence of pericardial effusion  unless additional testing is clinically indicated.   ECHO scans may be performed up to 5 days prior to a 
scheduled visit . A complete cardiac evaluation i ncluding ECG and ECHO  should be performed  if determin ed to be clinically necessary even if it is an unscheduled time point .  Cardiac 
evaluation should be included at the Final Visit for early termi  nation patients if determined to be clinically necessary.  
7   Urine  or blood pregnancy test required for patients of child bearing potential only.  
8   Baseline hematology, chemistry,  coagulation  and urinalysis may be collected up to 72 hours prior to dosing.  If the screening visit is within 72 hours prior to  study day 1, hematology, 
chemistry , coagulation  and urinalysis do not need to be repeated.  This includes the following:   
Hematology  - complete blood count (CBC) with differential and reticulocyte count; CBC includes red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells ( WBCs), platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
mean  corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC);  
Chemistry  - albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide (CO 2), creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
serum osmolality,  phosphorus, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, amylase, and lipase ;  
Coagulation  - PT, INR;  
Urine  by urinalysis or  dipstick analysis  - pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite with microscopic examination if indicated ;   
Urine  Chemistry  - osmolality and sodium.     
9   Thyroid function  includes the following: f ree thyroxine (T 4) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH ). 
10 If the patient has a positive ADA result at their last assessment, the patient may be asked to return approximately every thr ee months for additional testing, until a negative result is 
obtained or the result is considered stabilized.  
11 Tumor response assessment scans may be performed up to 5  days prior to  a scheduled visit (except screening and final visit which have wider windows).  Tumor response assessment scans must  
be reviewed prior to dosing the next cycle of treatment.   Tumor res ponse assessment scans should be performed every 6 weeks regardless of dalantercept or sorafenib  dosing delays.   
 12 A full physical exam [skin (including telangiectasias) , head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neck, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal  (including 
edema), and  neurological  is required at screening, C1D1, C1D8, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1 ,C5D1, C6D1 and the final visit.  A targeted physical  exam requiring  assessment of the respiratory , 
cardiovascular and musculoskel etal (including edema) body systems is required at all other time points  including beyond cycle 6 .  If clinically indicated, additional assessment of other 
body systems should occur.  
13 Concomitant medications taken within 28 days prior to study  day 1 will be collected.  
14 Adverse events will be collected after the first dose administration.  Non -serious AEs prior to dosing on study day 1  will be collected as medical history.  
15  All patients should be contacted every 3 months (± 2 weeks) for up to 1 year from the date of first dose  for survival  
16  PK blood sample collection should be performed pre -dose for dalantercept and sorafenib at all time points.  In addition , PK blood sample s should be collected between 1 -3 hours  and 4-6 hours 
post dalantercept and sorafenib d osing at C1D1  visit and between 1 -3 hours and 4 -6 hours post sorafenib dosing at C2D8 visit . 
17 Informed consent must be obtained within 28 days prior to C1D1 and  prior to any study specific procedures.

1 All visit day windows should be determined relative to the date of the previous dose of dalantercept except for tumor assessments (see footnote s 2 and 9).  Actual visit days (e.g., day 1, day 8, day 15) 
may be different than planned due to windows on visits and potential dosing delays . 
2 If the patient has stable or responding disease at the end of 14 cycles of treatment repeat , the procedures performed for cycles 15 and 16 until the patient is taken off study (C 17D1=C 15D1, 
C18D1=C 16D1, etc.).  NOTE: after cycle 15, tumor assessments , ADA,  and AFP only need to be repeated once every 4 cycles (C 19D1, C 23D1, C 27D1, etc.).   
3 Perform all assessments prior to dosing dalantercept plus sorafenib and review for potential dose modifications.  All AEs and  abnormal laboratory or other findings that might require modification of 
dosing (see Section 1 1.5) should be reviewed pr ior to dosing to ensure that the patient is still eligible to receive dalantercept .   
4 Patients who terminate from the study should complete the final visit.  The final visit should occur approximately 30 days af ter the last dose of dalantercept ±  10 days .  The tumor response assessment 
at the final visit should only be performed to assess progression if progression has not already been confirmed by a previous tumor response assessment scan .  
5 A full physical exam [skin (including telangiectasias), head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neck, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal (including ede ma), and  
neurological is required at screening, C1D1, C1D8, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1,C5D1,C6D1 and the final visit.  A targeted physical e xam requiring assessment of the respiratory, cardiovascular and 
musculoskeletal (including edema) body systems is required at all other time points including beyond cycle 6.  If clinically indicated, additional assessment of other body systems should occur . 
6  Hematology - complete blood count (CBC) with differential ; CBC includes red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, hemoglobin, hematocrit;  
  Chemistry - albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), chloride, carbon dioxide (CO2), creatinine, glucose , lactate dehydro genase (LDH), potassium, total 
bilirubin, total protein , and sodium . Amylase and lipase  only if clinically indicated.  
7 A complete cardiac evaluation including ECG and ECHO should be performed if determined to be clinically necessary even if it is an unsch eduled time point.  Cardiac evaluation should be included 
at the Final Visit for early termination patients if determined to be clinically necessary .. 
8 If the patient has a positive ADA result at their last assessment, the patient may be asked to return approximately every three months for additional testing, until a negative result is obtained or the 
result is considered stabilized.  
9  Tumor response assessment scans may be performed up to 5 days prior to a scheduled visit (except final visit which have wider  windows).  Tumor r esponse assessment scans must be reviewed prior 
to dosing the next cycle of treatment.  Tumor response assessment scans should be performed every 12 weeks regardless of dala ntercept or sorafenib dosing delays

 8. INTRODUCTION  AND STUDY RATIONALE  
Dalantercept (also known as ACE -041) is a novel biologic anti -angiogenesis agent that inhibits 
signaling through activin recep tor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) .  ALK1  is a type I receptor in the 
transforming growth factor -β (TGF -β) superfamily that is selectively expressed on the surface of 
activated endothelial cells during development or in response to injury or disease.  ALK1 binds 
with high affinity to the ligands  bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) 9 and BMP10.  Signaling 
throu gh A LK1 requires binding of ligand  and simultaneous engagement of a type II receptor 
(ActR IIB, ActRIIA or BMPRII) which results in  phosphorylation of the intracellular Smad 1/5/8 
cascade  which activates proangiogenic transcription factors such as Id1 and I d3.1-3  Endoglin 
(CD105), an accessory receptor  to ALK1 and  may facilitate signaling by acting as a ligand 
chaperone but  is not required for ALK1 signaling and has no known intracellular signaling 
activity .  Dalantercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain 
(ECD) of human ALK1 lin ked to the Fc (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) portion of human 
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and acts as a ligand trap by binding to  BMP9 and BMP10.  
Multiple lines of evidence characterize the BMP9/ALK1/SMAD 1/5/8 pathway as playing a 
pivotal role in the maturatio n phase of angiogenesis which leads to the development of functional 
vasculature.4   The processes involved in vascular maturation  include vessel stabilization via 
incorporation of pericytes and other stromal cells which are commonly downstream of the 
proliferative stage processes which are driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) a nd 
other proangiogenic factors.  Furthermore, ALK1 expression is normally low in established 
blood vessels  but elevated in neovascular endothelium during tumor growth or wound healing  
which is in contrast to the VEGF/VEGFR axis which is  constitutively expr essed in new and 
estab lished blood vessels and in  other tissues.5   In addition, the BMP9/BMP10/ALK1 pathway 
regulates development of lymphatic vessels6,  which has  implications for metastatic spread of 
tumor cells through lymphatic vasculature.7  Thus t argeting the ALK1 and VEGF pathways 
simultaneously may result in more effective angiogenic blockade and delay tumor progression  in 
a variety of cancers .  
Dalantercept has demonstrated robust anti -angiogenic activity in tumor model studies, and has 
demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in a completed Phase 1 study  in advanced solid 
tumor patients.  In support of this therapeutic strategy , experiments were conducted in mouse 
xenograft renal cell carcinoma (RCC) models combining VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) , sunitinib, with  dalantercept  which demonst rated additive tumor growth delay 
beyond either agent alone and curtailed sunitinib resistance.  In an ongoing randomiz ed Phase 2 
study combining axitinib , a VEGF receptor TKI, with dalantercept in patients with advanced 
RCC, safety and preliminary  activit y of the combination have  been observed in the first two 
cohorts of patients all of whom had prior VEGF and in some cases mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) directed therapies.  
In addition to demonstrating efficacy in RCC models, dalantercept was tested  in an HCC 
xenograft model using the human BEL -7402 hep atocellular carcinoma cell line .  In mice with 
established BEL -7402 tumors, treatment with dalantercept as a single agent therapy 
demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor growth such that treated t umors were 25% the size 
of vehicle treated control mice (p  ≤ 0.001) after 35 days of treatment.  The only targeted agent

 currently approved for the treatment of advanced HCC is sorafenib, a VEGF receptor TKI and 
multi -kinase inhibitor.  Therapeutic respons es to sorafenib are short  lived and few options exist 
outside of a clinical trial. ALK1 has been detected in the vasculat ure of many human tumor types 
including hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) .8  BMP9 expression occurs predominantly in the 
liver.  Based upon immunohistochemical testing conducted at Acceleron Pharma and published 
results from the human protein atlas  (www.proteina tlas.org), BMP9 expression appears elevated 
in HCC compared to unaffected liver in human and mouse tissue .  In addition to its role in ALK1 
mediated angiogenesis, BMP9 has been shown to induce  epithelial to mesenchymal transition  
leading to cell migration and invasiveness  in the  HCC  HepG2 model .9,10  Furthermore, HepG2 
cells produce BMP9 as an autocrine growth factor  that directly supports  the proliferative and 
survival capacity of these tum or cells.10     
In summary, the BMP9/ ALK1 /SMAD 1/5/8  pathway is a novel target in angiogenesis and may 
play an important role in the malignant progression of HCC.  Given the limited efficacy of 
sorafen ib and growing incidence of HCC, there is a critical need for more effective therapies.  
We hypothesize dalantercept can be combine d safely with sorafenib and will augment the 
therapeutic response to sorafenib in HCC by enhancing angiogenic blockade and inhibiting 
BMP9 induced cellular proliferation.  
8.1. Overview of Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) most commonly develops in the setting of chronic liver disease 
and affects a diverse group of patients including those with hereditary and metabolic syndromes, 
auto-immune disease, viral hepatitis  B and C  and alcoholism.   In 2013, it is estimated there will 
be 30,640 new cases of HCC diagnosed and 21,670 deaths due to the disease in the US.11 
Moreover, HCC is the 5th leading cause of cancer mortality in US men.   Globally, HCC is the 7th 
leading cause of cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer mortality.12  
Historically, systemic t reatm ent options for pa tients with advanced HCC remained  limited to 
toxic chemotherapy regimens which were relatively ineffective in prolonging survival.  The most 
active chemotherapy agent in HCC is doxorubicin which is associated with a 4% response rate 
and s urvival of approximately 8 months.13  The exploration of growth factors in HCC has 
implicated VEGF and angiogenesis as a critical component in the malignant progression of the 
disease and has encouraged the development and investigation of novel anti -angiogenic agents.14  
Sorafenib is an oral  multi -targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR -1, 2, 3, PDGF, Raf, and 
other kinases.15  In the international phase 3 study entitled “Sorafenib HCC Assessment 
Randomized Protocol” (SHARP trial), 602 subjects with advanced HCC ( Child -Pugh Cl ass A 
cirrhosis) who had received no prior systemic therapy were randomized to sorafenib 400  mg 
twice daily or placebo.  The overall response to sorafenib was only 2%.  However, the disease 
contr ol rate 43% vs. 32% and overa ll survival 10.7 vs. 7.9 months (hazard ratio: 0.69, p  < 0.001) 
were significantly better with sorafenib compared to placebo.   The median TTP was 5.5 months 
with sorafenib and 2.8 months with placebo (p  < 0.001) .16 
Based upon the modest  activity of sorafenib, several clinical studies have been conducted to 
explore additional VEGF  and other  targeted agents  in comparison to sorafenib or after sor afenib 
failure.  Combinations with sorafenib have also been explored with epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) TKI, erlotinib.  To date, none of these approaches has resulted in meaningful

 improvements in time to progression or overall survival compared  to sorafenib monotherapy.17 
Importantly, there is growing interest in targeting the ALK1  pathway in HCC, as shown by 
recent or ongoing studies with TRC105 (anti -endoglin antibody) and PF-03446962 (anti -ALK1 
antibody).   There has been clinical activity reported in a completed phase I study with 
PF-03446962 in patients with HCC who were intolera nt to or progressed on sorafenib.   Of the 24 
patients in this cohort the disease control rate at 12 weeks was 29% and median TTP was 3 
months.18  
8.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
8.2.1.  Pharmacology Studies  
Signaling through the ALK1 receptor is import ant in vascular development and pathological 
angiogenesis.  Activation of the ALK1 pathway helps regulate endothelial cell sprouting after 
initiation of angiogene sis by various growth factors.19  The data from studies designed to 
evaluate the inhibition of angiogenesis in response to known angiogenic growth factors such as 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) demonstrat e that 
blocking signaling through the ALK1 receptor by the use of a soluble receptor [dalantercept or 
RAP -041 (murine ortholog of dalantercept)] can inhibit angiogenesis initiated by a variety of 
factors.  In oncology models, RAP -041 has demonstrated inhib ition of tumor progression in 
xenograft models of breast cancer (MDA -MB-231, MCF -7), lung cancer (Calu -6) and renal cell 
carcinoma Cell (A498) head and neck cancer (FaDu, CCL -30), as well as in genetic models of  
pancreatic cancer (RIP1 Tag2) ,20 breast cancer (mouse mammary tumor virus) and multiple 
myeloma (5T2MM).  Dalantercept has also shown efficacy as both a single agent and in 
combination with sunitinib using renal cell carcinoma xenograft models.   In the subcutaneously 
implanted A498 kidney carcinoma cell line dosing of dalantercept inhibited tumor growth similar 
to sunitinib treated mice.  Importantly combination therapy with both dalantercept and sunitinib 
inhibited tumor growth to a greater ext ent than either agent alone.  In a second xenograft model, 
subcutaneously implanted 786 -O kidney adenocarcinoma cells were also treated with 
dalantercept alone or in combination with sunitinib.  In this model dalantercept did not 
demonstrate single agent e fficacy.  In this model it is known that tumors treated with sunitinib 
develop rapidly develop resistance and continue to grow.  Combination therapy with dalantercept 
reduced tumor growth to a greater extent than single agent sunitinib and continued to sho w 
tumor inhibition even when the tumors treated with sunitinib alone began to develop resistance 
and progressed further.21  Overall, these data provide a rationale for the clinical development of 
dalantercept as an anti -angiogenic therapy in combination with VEGF pathway targeted therapy . 
8.2.2.  Toxicology Studies  
Dalantercept has been evaluated in two species, rats and monkeys, for toxicological effects and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties following single and repeated subcutaneous (SC) injections. 
Single -dose SC injections up to a high dose of 100 mg/kg were well to lerated in both rats and 
monkeys.  Repeat -dose toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and monkeys for 3 months; 
both studies included male and female animals, a recovery period, and toxicokinetic (TK) 
evaluations.  Dalantercept dose levels were 10, 3 0 and 100 mg/kg in the rat study, and 3, 10 and 
30 mg/kg in the monkey study.  Dose administration was weekly, which ensured continuous

 exposure to dalantercept, based on serum half -lives of approximately 3 days in rats and 
approximately 5 days in monkeys.  
Subcutaneous administration of dalantercept at ≥ 30 mg/kg resulted in edema and fluid in the 
thoracic and abdominal cavities that contributed to the death of moribund animals.  The most 
significant findings were observed in the heart.  In the 3 -month rat study, heart weights were 
increased at ≥ 30 mg/kg, with histological findings of myocardial degeneration/necrosis, LV 
hypertrophy, atrial dilation and mononuclear cell infiltration.  These effects resolved by the end 
of the one month recovery period.  In the 3-month monkey study, increases in heart weight were 
observed at 30 mg/kg.  By echocardiogram (ECHO) there was increased LV mass in animals 
dosed at 10 and 30 mg/kg in addition to increased left atrial (LA) area at 30 mg/kg.  Both effects 
were substanti ally or completely reversed after one month of recovery.  The increased heart 
weight in monkeys did not correlate with any microscopic changes or increases in serum markers 
of heart muscle damage.  Electrocardiography (ECG) and ejection fraction (EF) were normal.  
The highest dose level in the 3 -month rat toxicity study was 100 mg/kg with a no observed 
adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 10 mg/kg, while the highest dose level in the 3 -month monkey 
toxicity study was 30 mg/kg with a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg.  The two NO AEL values corresponded 
to a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.6 mg/kg (rat data) and 3.2 mg/kg (monkey data).    
8.3. Summary of Clinical Experience  
A Phase 1, open -label, multiple dose, dose escalation study (A041 -01)22 of dalantercept has been 
conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  A 
total of 37  patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled.  The first 25  patients were enrolled 
in 7 dose -escalating cohorts (0.1 to 4.8 mg/kg SC with a treatment cycle of 3  weeks), followed 
by 12  patients who were enrolled in an expansion cohort at a dose of 1.6  mg/kg (11 patients) or 
0.8 mg/kg (1 patient).  Based on the cumulative safety data observed at the 1.6 mg/kg and higher 
dose levels, the recommended phase 2 dose was selected as 1.2 mg/kg.   
Tumor response was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) v1.1.  Patients must have had a baseline and at least one post -treatment tumor 
response assessmen t to be evaluable; 29 patients met these criteria for the analysis.   
Antitumor activity as evident by partial response or prolonged stable disease was observed in 
9 of 29 evaluable patients at dose levels ranging from 0.2 to 4.8 mg/kg ; 1 patient with squa mous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) involving the base of the tongue had a partial 
response by Cycle 9 at a dose  level  of 0.4  mg/kg, and 8  patients had prolonged periods of stable 
disease (SD) for at least 3 months after the first dose across a range of dose  level s (0.2 to 
4.8 mg/kg), including 3 patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 1  patient each with 
neuroendocrine carcinoid, SCCHN, granulosa cell tumor, small bowel mucinous 
adenocarcinoma, and colorectal adenocarcinoma.  
Tumor m etabolic activity was evaluated using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission 
tomography -computed tomography (PET -CT) scan.  Tumor metabolic activity decreased from 
baseline in 17 (63%) of 27 evaluable patients.  Seven out of the 8 patients with prolong ed stable 
disease were evaluable for FDG PET -CT.  All 7 of these patients had a reduction in metabolic

 activity.  In addition, the patient with a partial response had a 44% reduction in metabolic 
activity.   
Tumor blood flow was evaluated using dynamic con trast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging 
(DCE -MRI).  Analysis by DCE -MRI found that 71% (10 out of 14) of patients with evaluable 
DCE -MRI data showed reduced tumor blood flow (K trans) at day 15 compared to baseline.  Nine 
out of 11 patients with evaluable  data from both DCE -MRI and RECIST data showed reductions 
in K trans at day 15 compared to baseline.  Six patients with stable disease had evaluable 
DCE -MRI data and 5 had decreases in K trans.  Three patients with prolon ged stable disease 
(≥ 3 months) were evaluable for DCE -MRI and all 3 patients had a reduction in K trans. 
A Phase 2, open -label study A041 -03 of dalantercept is currently being conducted in patients 
with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).  The first 
two patients received 80 mg however, due to the general co -morbidities of this heavily 
pre-treated patient population, the protocol was amended to a lower weight based dose of 
0.6 mg/kg.  Thirteen patients were enrolled at this dose  level  which demonstrated  a generally 
safe toxicity profile.  A second amendment increased the dose  level  to 1.2 mg/kg and an 
additional 31 patients were  enrolled.  In total, forty -six patients have been enrolled and 
enrollment has ended. The primary endpoint in this study is objective response rate.  
Study A041 -04 is a two -part, multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, phase 
2 study to evaluate saf ety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD of dalantercept in combination with 
axitinib in patients with advanced RCC.  The study will enroll up to 44 patients in the dose 
escalation , open label phase of the study (Part 1) and approximately 1 30 patients in the  
randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled  phase of the study (Part 2) for a total of up to 
approximately 1 74 patients.  The primary endpoint in this study is progression free survival.  
Two additional studies with dalantercept  at 1.2 mg/kg  as monothera py in ovarian and 
endometrial cancer  are ongoing under investigator -sponsored  IND(s) conducted by the 
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG).  Acceleron is responsible for providing dalantercept drug 
product for these studies.   
8.4. Potential Risks of Human Use  of Da lantercept  
Dalantercept  is designed to bind to the protein ligands BMP9 and BMP10 to inhibit their 
interaction with the ALK1 receptor, thus blocking a cell signaling process involved in 
angiogenesis.  Effects on other organ systems, including erythropoiesi s, may also be related to 
ALK1 or BMP9/10 inhibition.  
The most frequently observed AEs (  ≥ 10% patients ) in the dalantercept monotherapy clinical trials 
(A041 -01 and A041 -03) as of September 10, 2013  were  fatigue, peripheral edema, headache, anemia, 
dyspne a, nausea, constipation, vomiting, anorexia, pyrexia, abdominal pain, cough, dehydration, 
epistaxis, hyponatremia, telangiectasia, diarrhea, hypotension, insomnia, arthralgia, back pain, 
dizziness and pleural effusion .  
In the actively accruing two -part Ph ase 2 RCC A041 -04 study with the combination of 
dalantercept plus axitinib, as of September 10, 2013 , the most frequently observed AEs ( ≥ 20% 
of patients , n=10 ) regardless of causality, have included dysphonia , fatigue, diarrhea, arthralgia, 
constipation, hypertension, blood alkaline phosphatase increased, blood creatinine increased,

 chills, cough, dizziness, headache, hyperkalemia, muscle spasm, nausea, thrombocytopenia and 
vomiting.  
In the completed Phase 1  study, serious AEs considered related to dalantercept included 
congestive heart failure (1 patient at 1.6 mg/kg and 1 patient at 4.8 mg/kg), fluid overload 
(2 patients at 1.6 mg/kg), fatigue (1 patient at 1.6 mg/kg), and left ventricular dysfunction 
(1 patie nt at 0.4 mg/kg).  Three of these patients (2  patients with CHF and 1 with LV 
dysfunction) had a prior history of coronary artery disease.  Although dyspnea and other signs 
typical of heart failure were reported, serial echocardiograms did not show a trend  for worsening 
of LV ejection fraction in the majority of patients receiving dalantercept.  
In the Phase 2 SCCHN study (A041 -03), dalantercept -related SAEs to date have included 
2 events of pleural effusion (1 patient at 0.6 mg/kg, 1 patient at 1.2 mg/kg),  one event each of 
pulmonary edema and tracheal obstruction occurring in one patient receiving 1.2 mg/kg.   
In the GOG sponsored endometrial carcinoma study, serious adverse events possibly related to 
dalantercept reported to date in clude 2 patients with a scites, 1 patient each with   gastric 
hemorrhage, rectal fistula, pleural effusion, vomiting, anemia and dyspnea.  The gastric 
hemorrhage was a fatal event which occurred in a patient with a prior history of small bowel 
obstruction and radiation fibrosis.  
In the GOG sponsored ovarian carcinoma study, serious adverse events possibly related to 
dalantercept reported to date occurred in 1 patient  and include hypokalemia, anorexia, 
dehydr ation, and creatinine increase.   
Across studies, peripheral edema and wei ght gain events have responded to diuretic therapy.  A 
possible explanation of these events may be the effect of dalantercept on capillary or lymphatic 
vessels which may lead to fluid leakage and result in fluid overload.  Serial ECHO  data from the 
complet ed phase 1  and ongoing studies do not show a trend for a decline in LV ejection fraction 
in the majority of patients treated with dalantercept.   
In summary, the safety data to date suggest that patients with significant bleeding and/or 
cardiovascular risk s should be excluded from participating in studies with dalantercept.  The 
volume -related events such as peripheral edema, weight gain, pleural effusion, and pulmonary 
edema, across the studies appear to be least common when dalanter cept is administered at  doses 
≤ 1.6 mg/kg.  
The effects of dalantercept on reproduction and development are not fully known.  Although no 
histopathological effects were seen in reproductive organs in 3 -month toxicology studies in 
monkeys and rats, use of adequate birth control me asures should be required in dalantercept 
studies and dalantercept should not be administered to pregnant or nursing women.  
As with all biologics, there is the potential for the development of anti -drug antibodies that can 
be associated with altered drug c learance and/or hypersensitivity reactions.  No specific anti -drug 
antibodies were detected in the Phase 1 study.  Anti -drug antibody formation should be 
monitored in selected clinical studies.   
A comprehensive review of dalantercept , as well as details r egarding the information 
summarized above, is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  The most recent version of 
the dalantercept  IB should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.

 8.5. Potential Risks of Human Use of Sorafenib  
The most common side effects observed in  at least 20% of patients which were considered 
related to  sorafenib include  fatigue, weight loss, rash/desquamation, hand -foot skin reaction, 
alopecia, diarrhea, anorexia, nausea and abdominal pain .  For additional risks associated with 
patients taking sorafenib , please refer to the sorafenib prescribing information ( see Nexavar®

 10. OVERALL STUDY DESIG N AND PLAN  
10.1. Study Design  
This is a n open label , multi -center  phase 1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD , 
and preliminary activity  of dalantercept plus sorafenib  in patients with advanced  HCC .   
The dose level of dalantercept  for the first cohort  will be 0. 6 mg/kg administered subcutaneously 
(SC) every 3 weeks (Q3W)  plus sorafenib 400 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD).   
Dose E scalation  
The dose escalation portion will include up to  three  planned cohorts  of a minimum of 3 patients 
each to determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of the combination .  Patients may require 
dose modification (s) of dalantercept or sorafenib  as indicated per protocol or prescribi ng 
information, respectively.   
At least three patients must complete the Day 2 2 visit a t each dalantercept dose level with review 
of data through Day 2 2 by the Safety Review Team (SRT) prior to escalation to the next higher 
dose level.  The SRT may recomm end adding additional patients , for a total of up to 6 patients,  
to the current  dose level for further evaluation, escalating to  an intermediate dose level or 
discontinuing escalation .  The following general dose escalation rules will apply:  
1. Dalantercept s tarting dose level  is 0.6 mg/kg in combination with sorafenib starting dose 
level of 400 mg QD. 
2. Dalantercept will be escalated to a maximum dose level of 0.9 mg/kg plus sorafenib 
400 mg QD. 
3. Once the maximum tolerated dose level of dalantercept is determine d, sorafenib will be 
escalated to 400 mg BID. 
4. After the MTD level of the combination is determined  in the dose escalation portion , an 
additional 10 -20 patients  will be added  in the expansion portion.  
5. If the dalantercept starting dose level  of 0.6 mg/kg is not tolerated, there will be one dose  
level  de-escalation to  0.4 mg/kg.  
The planned dose  escalation for dalantercept and sorafenib is outlined below in Table 2.

 Expansion Cohort  
Once the MTD or maximum tested dose level has been determined  by the SRT and Sponsor , up 
to a total of 20 patients may be enrolled at or below the MTD to further evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK profile of dalantercept plus sorafenib .  The SRT will meet after a minimum 
of 10 patients have been evaluated for  a minimum of 2 1 days after  the first dose of 
dalantercept/sorafenib  (Day 22)  to review safety data.  The SRT may recommend adding up to 
an additional 10 patients to the current  dose level for further evaluation  or to an intermediate  
dose level . 
Duration of Treatme nt 
The total duration of participation in the study will vary for each patient.  There will be a 14 -day 
screening period, a treatment period lasting for as long as patients are eligible to remain 
on-study, a final visit approximately 1 m onth after the last dose of dalantercept and follow -up for 
for 1 year from first dose  for patient survival . 
If a patient has a positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) result at the last visit, the patient may be 
asked to return for additional ADA testing every three months, until a negative result is obtained 
or the result is considered to be stabilized . 
10.2. Discussion of Study Design  
Dalantercept is a novel anti -angiogenic agent that inhibits the BMP9/ALK1/Smad 1/5/8 
signaling cascade involved in blood vessel  maturation and stabilization .  In addition to its role in 
angiogenesis, BMP9 may directly stimulate HCC cellular proliferation  based on in vitro data . In 
an Acceleron  mouse xenograft study using the human BEL -7402 HCC cell line, single agent 
therapy with dalantercept significantly inhibited tumor growth when dosed at 15 mg/kg three 
times per week for 5 weeks. Preclinical, Phase 1  and early Phase 2 clinical data support the 
development of dalantercept in com bination with VEGF pathway inhibitors  to maximize growth 
inhibition in tumors that are sensitive to anti -angiogenic agents.   Importantly, the dalantercept 
side effect profile to date is mostly non -overlapping with the toxicity profiles of VEGF TKI 
therapie s including sorafenib. Ongoing studies targeting the ALK1 pathway in HCC are 
underway and support further development of combination approaches in this challenging and 
underserved disease.   Thus we propose to investigate the safety , tolerability , and PK pr ofile of 
the novel combination of dalantercept with sorafenib, a VEGF and multi -kinase TKI, in the 
treatment of patients with newly diagnosed advanced HCC  utilizing a dose escalation of 
sorafenib and dalantercept followed by an expansion .

10.4. Patient Withdrawal Criteria  
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from study  treatment  or from the 
study at any time for any reason without prejudice to their medical care.   
Patients may be withdrawn from study treatment for any of the following reasons:  
• Patient’s request  
• Patient’s unwillingness or inability to comply with the protocol  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Pregnancy  
• Progression of disease  
• Use of prohibited medications  
• Medical reason, at the discretion of the investigator and/or the medical monitor  
• At the  discretion of the sponsor  (i.e. discontinuation of the study)  
In addition, patients may be withdrawn fr om the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• At the  discretion of the sponsor (i.e. discontinuation of the study)  
The reasons for withdrawal must be recorded in the patient’s CRF.  The investigator must notify 
the sponsor, the medical monitor and the contract research organization (CRO) immediately 
when a patient has been discontinued/withdrawn due to an A dverse Event (AE) .   
The investigator must notify the sponsor and the CRO when a pa tient has been 
discontinued/withdrawn for reasons unrelated to the study or study drug (i.e., withdrawn consent, 
lost to follow -up).  
10.5. Patient Replacement Criteria  
Patients who discontinue prematurely from the study for reasons unrelated to the study or 
dalantercept (e.g., withdrawn consent) and prior to C2D1 may be replaced at the Sponsor’s 
discretion as required for the study to meet its objectives.  Data from the patients who are 
replaced will continue  to be evaluated for safety.

 11. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS  
11.1. Treatments Administered  
Once a patient is assigned to a cohort, the appropriate dose of dalantercept will be administered 
on study day 1 with the starting dose of sorafenib. Subsequent dalantercept doses will be 
administered once every 3 weeks  with safety follow -up visits after each dose as outlined in the 
Schedule  of Events ( Section  2).  Patients should be observed for a minimum of 30 minutes 
following treatment with dalantercept.   
Patients will administer  daily dosing of sorafenib , dispensed as per prescribing information 
(see Nexavar® [sorafenib ] presc ribing information,  Dosage and Administration ).  
Dose reductions for dalantercept  or sorafenib  may be required (see Section 1 1.5, Dose 
Modifications).    
11.1.1.  Continuation of Treatment  
11.1.2.  Progressive Disease   
Accumulating evidence indicates that the emergence of objective responses to anti-angiogenesis 
agents may follow delayed kinetics of weeks or months, and may be preceded by initial apparent 
radiological progression .  It is thus reason able, in the absence of clinical deterioration, to 
continue to treat these patient s until radiologic progression is both confirmed and found to have 
worsened at a subsequent imaging evaluation .23 
The initial tumor response assessment for all patients will occur prior to the C3D1 d osing visit.  
The decision to treat a patient with additional cycles of sorafenib plus dalantercept  will be based 
on tumor response evaluation performed every 2 treatment cycles, prior to Day 1 of the next 
cycle. After cycle 1 4, tumor response evaluation w ill be performed every 4 treatment cycles.  
Patients with PD per RECIST v1.1 should be managed as follows:  
• PD at the end of Cycle 2: At the discretion of the treating physician in consultation with 
the sponsor medical monitor, the patient may continue dosing with the combination in the 
absence of clinical progression and the lack of any new measurable disease.  
• PD at the end of Cycle 4 or later:  If there is worsening PD (e.g., increase in target 
lesions, increase in non -target lesions, development of new lesions)  in comparison to the 
end of Cycle 2 imaging , treatment will be discontinued and the patient will complete the 
final visit and  enter follow -up. 
11.2. Concomitant Medications  
During screening  and throughout the study, patients may take stable doses of medications for 
chronic conditions that are not specifically excluded by the protocol ( see Section 10.3.1, 
Inclusion Criteria  and Section  10.3.2, Exclusion Criteria ).  Concomitant medications will be 
documented at all study visits beginning at screening and will include all medications taken 
within 28 days prior to study day 1.

 • During the course of the study, concurrent therapy with any ne w prescription 
medication or dosage may be administered at the discretion of the investigator based 
upon clinical need.  If a patient requires treatment with any new medications that are 
specifically excluded by the eligibility criteria (Section 10.3.1, 10.3.2) or the 
sorafenib  prescribing label  (e.g., therapeutic anticoagulation medication, strong 
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, strong CYP3A4/5 inducers, and any anti -cancer treatment 
other than dalantercept or sorafenib ), the patient will be discontinued from the study .  
These patients should complete the final visit procedures and enter the follow -up 
period of the study.  The investigator should consult the medical monitor regarding 
any questions about whether a new medication or the dosage of an existing 
medication would require the patient to discontinue  from the study.  Note that 
treatment with diuretics is expected for some patients during this study and such use 
should not be used to determine grading of hypertension.   
11.3. Randomization  
This is an open -label dose escalation  study that does not require randomization.  
11.4. Treatment Compliance  
Each dose of dalantercept  will be administered by SC injection(s) at the clinical site by the study 
staff and will be documented in the study record.   
Daily dosing of sorafenib  will be the responsibility of each  patient.  Drug accountability will be 
performed at each study visit by the study staff  and recorded in the patient’s study record .  
11.5. Dose Modifications  
11.5.1.  Dose Modification s of Dalantercept  
Patients will continue to receive the same dose level of dalantercept  as they were assigned at 
study entry unless a dose modification is required to manage AEs.  Patients who experience 
dalantercept  related AEs may continue treatment with dalantercept , provided that the AE can be 
managed (see below ).   
Table  3 describes the management of related AEs and required dose modifications for 
dalantercept.  For any AE, including AEs not specifically mentioned in the table below, the 
investigator may decid e to delay dosing or modify the dose level of dalantercept based on their 
clinical judgment.  If possible, these decisions should be discussed with the sponsor medical 
monitor prior to implementation.  If more than 1 AE occurs that would require a dose 
modification, upon resolution of all AEs  to baseline or grade 1 , dalantercept should be reduced 
two dose levels , or the patient should discontinue treatment.  If a patient has a repeating AE or an 
AE of similar nature that would require a dose modification, t he patient should be dose reduced 
to the next dose level or the patient should discontinue treatment depending upon the nature of 
the AE and patient status.  The guidelines for management of AEs described in Table 3 are 
applicable to all scheduled visits a s well as any unscheduled visits.  Refer to  Table  4, 
Dalantercept  Dose Level Modifications, for dose level reductions.

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 39 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  
 A dose delay of up to 3 weeks for  dalantercept will be allowed for all AEs as outlined in  Table 3.  
Adverse events must resolve as outlined in Table 3 prior to further dosing.  If a dose is delayed, 
the patient should resume the study with the next scheduled dosing cycle.  
If administratio n of dalantercept cannot be resumed within 3 weeks after the scheduled start of 
the next treatment cycle, the patient must be discontinued from the study and should complete 
the Final Visit.  Exemptions may be considered for those patients who are determin ed by the 
investigator to have received clinical benefit from treatment.  
For individual patients judged by the investigator to be at an unacceptable risk, despite not 
meeting  the protocol -defined conditions for a dose modification, the investigator should consult 
with the sponsor’s medical monitor to decide whether to continue dosing at the same dose level, 
reduce the dose level, or discontinue the patient’s treatment with dalantercept.

11.5.2.  Dose Modifications  of Sorafenib  
Patients enrolled in cohort 1 and 2 may have their dose of sorafenib increased to 400 mg BID,   
after the sponsor and the principal investigator have conducted a complete review of the 
individual patient’s safety data through Day 43 and the first on -study tumor assessment is 
evaluated.  
Over the course of treatment  and at the discretion of the investi gator , management of some 
adverse events such as hypertension, venous or arterial thromboembolic events, hemorrhage, 
gastric perforation or fistula, and proteinuria may require temporary dose interruption or 
permanent discontinuation and/or dose reduction of sorafenib  (see Nexavar® [sorafenib ] 
prescribing information, Warnings and Precautions ).  If dose reduction from 400 mg BID is 
required, the recommended reduced dose is 400 mg QD or QOD .  Please refer to the labeling 
guidelines on the management of sorafenib related hand -foot skin reaction.  
In the event of a Grade 3 or greater toxicity, if it is deemed at the investigator’s discretion to be 
related to sorafenib , then sorafenib  may be held or  dose reduced until resolution of the toxicity or 
return to Grade 1 or baseline in keeping with the current labeling guidelines.  
Patients who require permanent discontinuation of sorafenib  due to an adverse event related  only 
to sorafenib  may continue to receive treatment with  dalantercept.   If patients requiring 
discontinuation of sorafenib  have received < 2 doses of dalantercept plus sorafenib , they may be 
replaced  (see Section 10 .5).  The patients remaining on dalantercept not in combination with

Table 3 outlining management of ascites.  
11.6. Safety Review Team  (SRT)  
11.6.1.  Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Definition  
A DLT is defined as any of the following events that are considered possibly  or probably related 
to dalantercept  and occur within 21 days after the first dose of dalantercept/sorafenib (Day 22):   
• Recurrent Grade 3 ascites  event  in a single patient  despite optimal management of 
first event  
• Pulmonary edema grade 2 or higher  
• Bleeding grade 2 or higher  with the exception of grade 2 epistaxis  
• Non-hematologic adverse event grade 3 or higher with the exception of grade 3 or 
higher amylase , lipase  or grade 3 hyponatremia without symptoms, and grade 3 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in the absence of appropriate prophylaxis  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with associated bleeding  
• Grade 4 anemia or thrombocytopenia  
• Grade 4 neutropenia with fever  
Safety and DLTs will be e valuated by the SRT .  The SRT,  which is comprised of a minimum of 
one study investigator, a Sponsor medical monitor , and a clinical investigator not participating in 
this study , will review safety data including AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), labor atory 
results (including hematology and chemistry), and vital signs data through the D ay 22 visit to 
assess the safety of a dose level prior to dose escalation.   
After  a minimum of 3 patients have been evaluated for a minimum of 21 days after the first dose 
of dalantercept/sorafenib  (Day 22) , the SRT will consider dose escalation to the next dose cohort  
or adding addition al patients , for a total of up to 6 patients,  to the current dose cohort  based in 
part upon the following dose escalation  criteri a: 
• If there are no DLTs, dose escalation to the subsequent dose level may proceed.  
• If 1 patient at a dose level experiences a DLT, additional patients may be enrolled at 
the current dose level  for a total of up to 6 patients in the cohort . 
▪ If there are no further DLTs in the additional patients, dose escalation to 
the next dose level may proceed.  
• If a DLT occurs in ≥ 2 patients in any dose cohort of 3 -6 patients, no further dose 
escalation will occur and a  previous or lower intermediate dose level will b e defined 
as the MTD .  Patients enrolled in this dose level cohort may continue to receive 
additional doses of dalantercept plus sorafenib  at an appropriate dose level as outlined 
in Table 2.

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 44 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  11.6.2.  Expansion Cohort  
Once the MTD or maximum tested dose level has been determined  by the SRT and Sponsor , up 
to a total of 20 patients may be enrolled at or below the MTD to further evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK profile of dalantercept plus sorafenib.  The SRT will meet after a minimum 
of 10 patient s have been evaluated for a minimum of 2 1 days after the first dose of 
dalantercept/sorafenib  (Day 22)  to review safety data.  The SRT may recommend adding up to 
an additional 10 patients to the current  dose level for further evaluation  or to an intermedia te 
dose level . 
If 4 out of 10 patients in the expansion cohort experience a DLT at any time during the first 2 1 
days after  the first dose of dalantercept/sorafenib (Day 22)  further enrollment in that expansion 
cohort will be discontinued.  The SRT may decide to cease enrollment if fewer than 4 out of 10 
patients experience a DLT if the nature of the event(s) is deemed a significant risk to patients for

Please refer to Section 2 , Schedule of Events for the schedule of procedures required for each 
visit.  All visit day windows should be determined relative to the date of the previous dose of 
dalantercept .  Actual visit days (e.g., day 1, day 8, da y 15) may be different than planned due to 
windows on visits and potential dosing delays.       
13.1. Screening  
Signature of the current IRB -approved ICF should occur within 28 days prior  to study day 1 and 
prior to initiation of any study -specific screening pro cedures.   
• All screening procedures should be performed within 14 days prior to study day 1 .  
Echocardiogram and tumor response assessment scans obtained for clinical  purposes 
within 28 days prior to study day 1 may be used as the baseline image for this s tudy 
and do not need to be repeated.   
• The urine or blood pregnancy test is only required for patien ts of child -bearing 
potential.  
• Archived or recent tumor tissue sample(s) should be sent as soon as possible to the 
designated tissue sample vendor.  
• Concomi tant medications taken within 28 days prior to study day 1 will be 
documented in CRF.  
• Screen failure information will be maintained to document specific information, 
including but not limited to, reason for failure.  
13.2. Dosing Days and Interim Visits  
• All screening and study day 1 procedure results required to confirm eligibility must 
be obtain ed and reviewed prior to dalantercept  and sorafenib  administration.  Patient 
eligibility for inclusion/exclusion criteria must be confirmed from these results, as 
applicable.   
• Baseline hematology, chemistry, coagulati on and urinalysis may be collected up to 72 
hours prior to dosing.  If the screening visit occurs within 72 hours of study day 1, the 
hematology, chemistry, coagulati on and urinalysis  testing do not need to be repeated.   
• Any non -serious AEs that occur prior to dalantercept  and sorafenib  dosing o n study  
day 1 should be recorded in the medical history CRF.  
• All AEs that occur after dalantercept  and sorafenib  dosing on  study  day 1 should be 
recorded in the AE CRF.  
• On subsequent dosing days, all AEs and abnormal laboratory or ot her findings that 
might require modification of dosing (see Section 11 .5) should be reviewed prior to 
dosing to ensure that the patient is still eligible to receive additional doses of 
dalantercept  or sorafenib .

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 48 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  • ECHO scans may be performed up to 5 days p rior to a scheduled visit.  
• Tumor response assessment scans may be performed up to 5 days prior to a scheduled 
visit (except screening and final visit which have wider windows).  Tumor response 
assessment scans must be reviewed prior to dosing the next cycl e of treatment.  
Tumor response assessment scans should be performed every 6 weeks regardless of 
dalantercept or sorafenib dosing delays.  
• PK blood sample collection should be performed pre -dose for dalantercept and 
sorafenib  at all  time points.  In additi on, PK blood sample s should be collected 
between 1 -3 hours and 4 -6 hours post dalantercept and  sorafenib  dosing at C1D1 and 
between 1 -3 hours and 4 -6 hours post sorafenib  dosing at C2D8 visit .  
• The schedule of events outlines procedures through C6D1.  If patients have stable or 
responding disease and are able to continue beyond 6 cycles of treatment, the 
procedures outlined for cycle 5 and 6 should be repeated until the patient completes 
cycle 14  (i.e. C7D1=C5D1, C8D1=C6D1, etc .).  The only exception is that after cycle 
6, ADA and urinalysis are required once every 4 cycles instead of o nce every 2 cycles 
(i.e., C10D1, C14D1, etc.).  
• If the patient has stable or responding disease at the end of 14 c ycles of treatment, the 
procedures outlined for cycle s 15 and 16 should be repeated until the patient comes 
off study.  Note: ADA collection continues on a schedule of once every 4 cycles  
starting at cycle 6  and tumor response scans only need to be repeated  once every 4 
cycles (C19D1, C23D1, C27D1 etc.) starting at cycle 15.  
13.2.1.  Final Visit  
• The final visit s hould occur when a patient discontinues from the study within 30 
days after the last dose of dalantercept  (± 10 days).  
• The tumor response assessment scan doe s not need to be repeated at the final visit to 
assess progression if progression of disease was confirmed  by a previous tumor 
response assessment scan . 
• If the patient has a positive ADA result at their last assessment, the patient may be 
asked to return a pproximately every 3 months for additional testing until a negative 
result is obtained, or the result is considered stabilized.  
13.2.2.  Follow -up 
• After the final visit, patients will be contacted by phone or other appropriate method 
of communication approximately every 3 months  (±2 weeks)  for up to 1 year from 
date of first dose  for survival.   
• Patients may also be asked to return to  the clinic approximately once every 3 months  
for tumor response assessment scans if progression of disease has not previously been 
documented and/or every 3 months  for additional ADA testing until a negative/stable 
result is obtained.

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 52 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  15. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
15.1. Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a study drug,  which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug  
whether or not it is considered related to the study drug.  
Abnormal laboratory and other abnormal investigational findings (i.e., physical exam, ECG) 
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead 
to treatment  discontinuation or are otherwise considered clinically relevant by the investigator.  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fatality, the cause of death is 
considered as the AE, and the death is considered as its outcome.  
Unexpected Adverse Events  
An unexpected AE is an AE that is not described in nature or severity in the IB.   
Events Not to Be Considered as Adverse Events  
Pre-existing medical conditions/signs/symptoms present before the screening period that do not 
worsen in severity or frequency during the study are defined as baseline medical conditions, and 
are not to be considered AEs.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE  is any AE, occurring at any dose level/regimen and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening: l ife-threatening means that the patient was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a re action which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form).  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; however 
a hospitalization for an elective procedure will not be considered a SAE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event: an important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 53 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
Events Not to Be Considered as Serious Adverse Events  
Elective hospitalizations to administer or to simplify study treatment or procedures are not 
considered as SAEs.  
15.2. Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure  
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information if a female patient or a ma le 
patient’s female partner becomes pregnant while the patient is participating in this study.  The 
pregnancy information will be recorded on the appropriate form and must be submitted to the 
sponsor within 2 weeks  of learning of the pregnancy.  The patien t or partner will be followed for  
the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will be 
forward ed to the sponsor or designee.  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks 
followin g the estimated delivery date .  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported.  
15.3. Severity  
Investigators must evaluate the severity/intensity of AEs according to the NCI -CTCAE v4  
current minor version , preferentially using the graded scales.  If a particular AE’s 
severity/i ntensity is not specifically graded, the investigator should apply the general guidelines 
for determination of Grade 1 through Grade 5 as listed in  the NCI -CTCAE v4  current minor 
version , cover page (reproduced below), using their best medical judgment:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (pre paring meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.).  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting se lf-care activities of daily living 
(bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden).  
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
15.4. Relationship to Study Drug  
Investigators must also assess the causal relationship of each AE to dalantercept  and sorafenib .  
Factors for the assessment of causal relationship include, but are not limited to, temporal 
relationship between the AE and the administration o f dalantercept  or sorafenib , known side 
effects of dalantercept  or sorafenib , medical history, concomitant therapy, course of the 
underlying disease and pertinent study procedures.

Revision Level: 02  
04 November 2016  
Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 54 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  Probabl y: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically highly plausible and there is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and adminis tration of 
dalantercept  or sorafenib  and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal.  
Possibl y: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is a plausible 
time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of dalantercept  or 
sorafenib . 
Unlikely:  A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the AE is 
most plausible.   
Not Related : A causal relationship can be definitively excluded and another documented cause 
of the AE is most plausible.  
15.5. Documentation and Methods of Reporting of Adverse Events by 
Investigator  
Patients will be evaluated and questione d generally for AEs during the course of the study, 
starting at the signing of the informed consent.  All non -serious AEs occurring after signing of 
the ICF until a patient is dosed on C1D1 are to be documented on the medical history CRF.  All 
AEs occurrin g after the C1D1 dose through 30 days after the last study drug administration (final 
visit) are to be documented on the AE CRF.   
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient and/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by obse rvation, physical examination or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded on the AE CRF.  Any clinically relevant changes in laboratory assessments, or other 
clinical findings as described in Section 15.1, are considered AEs and must be recorded on the 
AE CRF.  AEs are to be followed for resolution as described in Section  15.6.  
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, duration (onset and 
resolution dates), severity, relationship with dalantercept , relationship with sorafenib , any other 
potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action ta ken (including dose modification 
or discontinuation of dalantercept  or sorafenib ) and outcome.  In addition, SAEs should be 
identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.   Adverse events categorized as 
SAEs must also be documented using an  SAE Report Form as described in Section 15.5.1 . 
Specific guidance can be found in the CRF Completion Guidelines provided by the sponsor or 
designee.   
15.5.1.  Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after the first study drug administration on C1D1  until 30 days (final visit) 
after the last study drug administration are to be documented on the AE CRF.  SAEs should not 
be reported for patien ts who are considered screen failures unless the event is deemed due to a 
protocol required procedure.   For all SAEs, an SAE form must be completed with as much 
information as possible and submitted within the time frame described in Section 15.7 
(Notification about Serious Adverse Events).   
When new significant information is obtained as well as when the outcome of an event is known, 
the investigator should record the information on a new SAE form.

Study A041 -05 
Revision Level: 02  
04 November 2016  
Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 55 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  If the patient was hospitalized, a copy of the discharge summary must be included as part of t he 
patient medical file.  In all instances, the investigator should follow -up with patients until the 
outcome of the SAE is known.  
15.6. Reporting Period and Monitoring of Patients with Adverse Events  
All patients who took at least one dose of study drug should complete the final visit procedures.  
All AEs will be followed until clinical database lock (or stabilization/resolution if it occurs 
before database lock).  All SAEs will undergo active follow -up until resolved or the event 
becomes chronic or stable.  Fol low-up data for SAEs obtained after clinical database lock will be 
incorporated into the dalantercept  safety database.  
15.7. Notification about Serious Adverse Events  
If an SAE occurs during the reporting period, the investigator must immediately (i.e. within a 
maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the sponsor via the CRO by 
telephone, by fax or by e -mail.  
All written reports should be transmitted using the study specific SAE Report Form, which must 
be completed by the investigator following specific completion instructions.  Names, addresses, 
telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting are located on the SAE Report Form and in the 
completion instructions provided in the Study Reference Manual.  When an SAE (or follow -up 
information) is report ed by telephone, a written report must be sent immediatel y thereafter by fax 
or e-mail.  Reporting procedures and timelines for follow -up information are the same as for the 
initially reported SAE.  
Relevant pages from the CRF may be provided in parallel ( i.e., medical history, concomitant 
therapy).  In all cases, the information provided in the SAE Report Form must be consistent with 
the data that are recorded in the corresponding sections of the CRF.  
The investigator/reporter must respond to any request f or follow -up information or to any 
question the sponsor or designee may have on the SAE within the same timelines as described 
for initial reports.  This is necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by the sponsor 
and (as applicable) to allow th e sponsor to meet regulatory timelines associated with expedited 
reporting obligations.  
Requests for follow -up will usually be made by the responsible CRA or Medical Monitor, or in 
exceptional circumstances by the Acceleron  or CRO  Pharmacovigilance represe ntative who may 
contact the investigator directly to obtain clarification on a particularly critical event.  
15.7.1.  Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees 
Institutional Review Boards and Investigators  
The sponsor will send appropriat e safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations.  
The investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs involving his/her patients to the IEC/IRB that app roved the study.

Acceleron Pharma Inc.  Page 56 of 69 CONFIDENTIAL  In accordance with ICH/GCP guidelines, the sponsor will inform the investigator of “findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of patients, impact the conduct o f the study, or alter the 
IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the  study.”  
The sponsor will inform the investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are 
considered to be related to dalantercept  (“suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions” or 
SUSARs).  The investigator should place copies of these Saf ety Reports in the Investigator Site 
File.  National regulations with regard to Safety Report notifications to investigators will be 
followed.  
When specifically required by regulations and guidelines, the sponsor will provide appropriate 
Safety Reports dir ectly to  each site who is responsible for notify ing their IRB and will maintain 
records of these notifications.  When direct reporting by the sponsor is not clearly defined by 
national or site -specific regulations, the investigator will be respo nsible for promp tly notifying 
the concerned IRB of any Safety Reports and for filing copies of all related correspondence in 
the Investigator Site File.  
For studies covered by the European Union Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the sponsor’s 
responsib ilities regarding the reporting of SAEs/SUSARs will be carried out in accordance with 
that Directive and with the related Detailed Guidances.

relationship of this combination may be performed.  For all PK analysis, the PK population will  
be used.  
16.6. Determination of Sample Size  
There is no formal sample size calculation for this study.  A standard dose escalation of 3-6 
patients  will be implemented  for dose escalation  and up to 20  patients may be enrolled in the 
expansion to further evaluate  safety, tolerability , and PK profile of the combination of 
dalantercept and sorafenib based on clinical considerations.

17.1. Study Monitoring  
The CRA will arrange to visit the investigator sites at regular intervals during the study.  The 
monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH and GCP guideline s to 
ensure protocol adherence, quality of data, drug accountability, compliance with regulatory 
requirements, and continued adequacy of the investigational sites and their facilities.  During 
these visits, CRFs and other data related to the study will be reviewed and any discrepancies or 
omissions will be resolved.  The CRA will be given access to study relevant source documents 
(including medical records) for purposes of source data verification (SDV).  
17.2. Audits and Inspections  
The investigators and clinical  sites will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and 
regulatory inspections as requested by FDA and the sponsor or designee.  In addition to CRFs, 
the clinical site will permit direct access to source data/documents (i.e., original medical records, 
laboratory reports, hospital documents, progress reports, signed ICFs, etc.).  During and/or after 
completion of the study, quality assurance officers named by the sponsor or the regulatory 
authorities may wish to perform on -site audits.  The inve stigator is expected to cooperate with 
any audit and provide assistance and documentation (including source data) as requested.  
18. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
18.1. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
18.1.1.  Investigator Responsibility  
The investigator is  responsible for ensuring the study is conducted according to the protocol, 
CFRs, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.  The investigator’s responsibilities are 
outlined in these documents and must include the responsibility to obtain a signed infor med 
consent prior to patient participation in the study.  
18.1.2.  Protocol Modifications  
The investigator should not modify the protocol without agreement from the sponsor and prior 
review or approval by the IRB, unless an emergency situation requires protocol modi fication to 
ensure the safety of patients.  Any deviations from the protocol should be documented by the 
investigator or designee.

To maintain patient privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, study reports and 
communications w ill identify the patient by the assigned patient identification number.  The 
investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the sponsor or designee and regulatory 
authorities access to the patient’s original medical records for verification of data  gathered on the 
CRFs and to audit the data collection process.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained 
and will not be made publicly available.  The patient’s medical information will only be released 
to the extent permitted by the applicable la ws and regulations.  
All information regarding the investigational product supplied by the sponsor to the investigator 
is privileged and confidential information.  The investigator agrees to use this information to 
accomplish the study and will not use it f or other purposes without consent from the sponsor.  
It is understood that there is an obligation to provide the sponsor with complete data obtained 
during the study.  The information obtained from the clinical study will be used towards the 
development of  the investigational product and may be disclosed to regulatory authorities, other 
investigators, corporate partners, or consultants as required.  
20. PUBLICATION POLICY  
All information concerning dalantercept  is considered confidential and shall remain the sol e 
property of the sponsor.  The investigator agrees to use this information only in conducting the 
study and shall not use it for any other purposes without the sponsor’s written approval.  The 
investigator agrees not to disclose the sponsor’s confidential  information to anyone except to 
persons involved in the study that need such information to assist in conducting the study, and 
then only on like terms of confidentiality and non -use. 
It is understood by the investigator that the information developed fro m this clinical study will be 
used by the sponsor in connection with the development of dalantercept , and therefore may be 
disclosed as required to regulatory agencies.  To allow for the use of the information derived 
from clinical studies, it is understoo d that there is an obligation to provide the sponsor with 
complete test results and all data developed in the study.  
No publication or disclosure of study results will be permitted except as specified in a separate, 
written, agreement between the sponsor a nd the investigator.  
21. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Protocol amend ments that impact patient safety , change the scope of the investigation, or affect 
the scientific quality of the study must be approved by the IRB and submitted to the appropriate 
regulatory authoritie s before implementation.  
In the event that the protocol needs to be modified immediately to eliminate an apparent hazard 
to a patient, the sponsor will implement the protocol change and subsequently amend the 
protocol and notify the regulatory authorities and/or the IRB, as appropriate.

22.1. Case Report Form Completion  
Case report forms will be completed for each enrolled patient.  It is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the 
patient’s CRF.  Source documentation supporting the CRF data should indicate the patient’s 
participation in the study and should document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, 
and patient status.  
Investigato rs will maintain copies of the CRFs at the clinical site.  For patients who discontinue 
or terminate from the study, the CRFs will be completed as much as possible, and the reason for 
the discontinuation or termination clearly and concisely specified on th e appropriate CRF.  
22.2. Retention of Records  
The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements.  Records will be retained for at least 2 years after the last marketing application 
approval or 2 years af ter formal discontinuation of the clinical development of the investigational 
product, or according to applicable regulatory requirements.  If the investigator withdraws from 
the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a  person willing to 
accept the re sponsibility.  The sponsor must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs.

Evaluation o f target lesions    
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions.  
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) 
must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters while on study.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to  the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
Evaluation of non -target lesions    
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target les ions and normalization of 
tumor  marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological 
in size (<  10mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor  marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non -
target lesions.  
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).

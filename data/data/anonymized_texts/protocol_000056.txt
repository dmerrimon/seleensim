SYNOPSIS  
Title:  
A Randomized, Open -Label, Multiple Dose, Bioavailability Study of DFD -03 
(Tazarotene Lotion, 0.1%) Dosed Twice Daily Compared to Once Daily Tazorac® 
(tazarotene) Cream, 0.1% in Patients with M oderate Acne Vulgaris  
Sponsor:    Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd  
  8-2-337, Road No. 3  
  Banjara Hills  
 Hyderabad – 500034, Telangana, India  
Study Center s:  2 site s Number of Subjects:  Approximately 62  
Study Period:  21 days  Clinical Phase: Phase 2  
Objectives : 
The primary objective is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of tazarotene and 
tazarotenic acid after twice- daily  application of DFD -03 Lotion (Test product) versus  once -daily 
application of Tazorac Cream (Reference product)  for 21 days in  subjects  with mode rate acne 
vulgaris.  
The secondary objectives are  
a) Assessment of disease severity at baseline and at the pharmacokinetic ( PK) sampling days  for 
each treatment.   
b) To determine the safety and tolerability of each treatment .  
Methods:   
This will be a multicenter, randomized, multiple -dose, laboratory -blinded, open- label, 2 -arm, 
parallel -arm study in subjects  with moderate acne vulgari s.  
Approximately  62 subjects will be randomized to receive either Test or Reference product, 
stratified by age  (Adult subjects:  17 years or older ; Pediatric subjects : 9 years to 16 years 
11 months for the Test product and 12 years to 16 years 11 months for the Reference product) with approximately even distribution between males - and females  in each age -strata . The study 
will be conducted in two parts, Part A and Part B  in a sequential manner . Based on full PK 
profiles generated for adult subjects in Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric population has been established  in Part B.   
Part B (age 9 years to 16 years 11 months  for DFD -03 Lotion arm and age 12 years to 16 years 
11 months for Tazorac Cream arm ) will enroll up to 38 subjects,  which wi ll include a t least 6 
subjects 9 to 11years of age, and among those at least 2 subjects between 9 and 10 years of age .  
Target enrollment is 32 subjects, but up to 6 additional subjects may be enrolled to reach a minimum of 16 evaluable subjects, who have sparse samples collected on Day 14 and Day 21, randomized to the Test treatment.    
PK profiling will be performed on Day 14 and on Day 21
. Day 14 is selected as the earliest time 
point at which the steady state is expected to be achieved in subjects with m oderate acne 
vulgaris, before any significant improvement in skin barrier occurs.   
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 6 of 57 
In Part A, 24 adult s ubjects will be enrolled such that 12 subjects each will be assigned to 
receive either Test or Reference treatment. In Part B, up to 38 subjects will be enrolled where 
approximately 26 subjects will receive Test  treatment  and 12 subjects will receive  Reference 
treatment. Enrollment will continue until at least 16 evaluable subjects randomized to the Test 
treatment in Part B complete the study.  
For 21 da ys, study product will be applied on the face, neck, upper chest, shoulders and upper 
back region, not exceeding 15% of the body surface area. Th e Test product will be applied twice 
daily , 12 hours apart  (morning and evening ; 42 consecutive doses) and the Reference product 
will be applied once daily in the evening ( 21 consecutive doses).  
Subjects  will visit the  clinical site daily prior to each dose application. Subjects will be confined 
at the clinic prior to the evening dose on Day  1, allowing sufficient time for all pre -dosing 
assessments to be performed,  until after that dose, from Day 14 evening  to Day 15 evening, and 
from  Day 2 1 evening to Day  22 evening for dose application and/or PK sampling. The subjects 
will leave the clinic after completion of clinical activities. O n Days 14 and 21, blood sampling 
for PK estimation will be performed over an interval of 24 hours . Adequate trough samples will 
be collected at the evening visit on D ays 1 to assess baseline and on days 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 and 
21 to asses s attainment of steady state . For the pediatric  population in part B, the trough samples 
will not be collected on days 12, 13, 19 and 20. Any subject missing dosing of any one dose of Reference product and two consecutive doses of Test product between days  1 and 8, or between 
days 8 and 15 will be considered for steady state estimation at Day 14, or Day 21, respectively. Subject (s) missing either two consecutive dosing days (two doses for reference and four for test product) between day 1 and 8 or missing two non- consecutive dosing days between Day 2 and 
Day 11 will be assessed for steady -state estimation at Day 21.  Subjects missing dosing between 
Days 12 and 14 and between D ays 19 and 21 will not be considered for steady -state estimation  
or PK  and statistical analysis.  
For all dosing days (except confinement days), subjects will come to the clinical site ± 1 hour of  
each dose application (e. g., around 7:00 pm and 7:00 am) for twice -daily application of Test 
product and (e.g. around 7:00 pm ) for once daily application of Refe rence p roduct . Subjects will 
leave the clinical site  after completion of the scheduled activities. On Day 1, subjects will report 
to the clinical site prior to the first (evening) dose  and on D ay 14 and Day 21, subjects will 
report to th e clinic al site  before the evening dose  application  allowing sufficient time for all pre -
dosing assessments to be performed.  
Blood samples for PK estimation will be collected at scheduled interval s over a period of 
24 hours after the evening dose applicati on for Test and Reference treatments on Day 14 and 
Day 21 . On D ay 22, for asses sment of leave on exposure  for 12 hours , the last dose application  
of Test product  (morning dose on Day 22) will not be rinsed off .  
Based on the full PK profile of T est and R eference treatment s in Part A, the sparse sampling 
schedule for p ediatric subjects in Pa rt B has been  decided  (Table 3) .  
Number of Subjects:  
Approximately 62 subjects  across 2 study sites will be enrolled .

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics:  
The absorption and disposition parameters will be determined using a noncompartmental  
approach , trapezoidal rule will be used to estimate the area under the curve. The PK  parameters 
of interest for this study will be : 
Day 14 and Day 21:  Tmax(ss) , Cmax(ss) , AUC 0-12(ss), AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin(ss). 
For Part B of study, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum of  
4 time points from each subject) on D ay 14 and D ay 21 will be used for calculation of PK 
parameters : Cmax(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Disease severity: Disease severity will be assessed by the Investigator’s Global Assessment 
(IGA) score. Inflammatory and non- inflammatory lesion count (%  change from baseline for 
both parameters) will also be done.  
Safety:  
Safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), the investigator’s assessment of 
application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and 
itching), clinical safety laboratory evaluations (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and physical examination including vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).  
Statistics:  
Statistical analysis of all PK parameters will be based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. 
Two-sided 90% confidence intervals of the rati o of geometric least squares (LS) means will be 
presented  from the natural log (ln) -transformed PK parameters (C
max(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss)) for 
Test vs Reference on Day 14 and Day 21.  
Achievement  of steady  state will be performed by treatment, using log -transformed C min(ss)  (at

1 INTRODUCTION 
Tazarotene, an acetylenic retinoid, is a prodrug that unde rgoes rapid and complete metabolism 
to its active metabolite tazarotenic acid ( Chandraratna, 1996). Retinoids are a class of 
keratolytic drugs derived from retinoic acid used for the treatment of acne and psoriasis. Several 
synthetic retinoids have been de veloped for topical treatment of acne.  
Tazarotene was initially developed in gel formulation and subsequently in cream and foam formulations. Products containing tazarotene have been proven to be effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris and psoriasis, a s well as being effective in the mitigation (palliation) of facial 
fine wrinkling, facial mottled hyper - and hypopigmentation, and benign facial lentigines.  
Dr. Reddy’ s Laboratories has developed DFD -03 Lotion, a new formulation containing 
0.1%  tazarotene for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. This new product is intended to be 
used as a face wash twice daily. Treatment use will begin by applying a generous amount of product to moistened affected skin, rubbing until foamy, and then rinsing with water a fter 
1 minute.  
Acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodular cystic lesions) and non- inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) 
(Shalita,  2004). The four primary factors contributing to acne are a bnormal follicular epithelial 
desquamation, hyperactivity of the sebaceous glands, proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes , 
and perifollicular inflammation.  
Current ly available treatments for acne vulgaris include oral and topical antibiotics, topical 
benzoyl peroxide, topical salicylic acid, topical adapalene, topical azelaic acid, topical dapsone, 
oral and topical retinoids (including tazarotene), and phototherapy.  
Tazarotene is a well -characterized active ingredient, and many studies have been conducted  on 
its pharmacology, toxicology and clinical efficacy and safety  (Fabior Prescribing Information, 
Tazorac Cream Prescribing Information ). 
Tazarotene is characterized by the FDA as a Category X drug, indicating that it may or can cause fetal harm when admi nistered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in women who 
are or may become pregnant ( Menter, 2000 ). At least 6 women are known to have become 
pregnant during clinical studies with tazarotene and all reported the birth of healthy babies, although the timing and extent of exposure in relation to the gestation time are unknown in these 
cases.  
The purpose  of this study is to compare the bioavailability of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid 
after twice -daily application of DFD -03 Lotion with that after onc e-daily application of Tazorac 
Cream, with products applied for 21 days .  
More information about DFD -03 Lotion can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2 ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
2.1 Institutional  Review Board Review  
The protocol, protocol amendments, s ubject  recruiting materials,  the informed consent form , 
and any other materials provided to subjects  must be approved by an institutional review board 
(IRB) operating in c ompliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 56. A copy of 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 23 of 57 
the approval letter must be received by the sponsor or contract research organization ( CRO ) 
prior to shipment of drug supplies to the site. 
Records of the IRB’s  review and approval of all documents pertaining to the study must be kept 
on file by the investigator and are subje ct to sponsor and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) 
inspection at any time .   
2.2 Ethical Conduct of Study  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with the principles 
set forth in 21 CFR Part 50 – Protection of Human Subje cts and in the Declaration of Helsinki 
(2013) (s ee Appendix  1).  
2.3 Informed Consent  
Written informed consent must be obtained before a subject can participate in the study, prior to performing any study related procedures, and before withdrawal of any therapies prohibited during the study. Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the subject’s agreement to participate in the study and continuing throughout the subject’s study participation. The process involves an extensive discussion with the  subject about the study procedures and the 
risks and possible benefits of participation in the study.  
For subjects under the age of majority in the state they are enrolled, the subject’s parent or legal guardian will be required to sign the informed cons ent form  and the subject will sign an IRB-
approved “ Information and assent ” form before the subje ct is enrolled into the study.  
A copy of the signed consent form and “ Information and assent ” form (when applicable) will be 
given to every subject and the or iginal will be maintained with the subject’s records.  
2.4 Selection of Investigators  
Investigators for the study should be board- certified dermatologists licensed in the state where 
the study is being conducted, with knowledge and understanding of Good Clinica l Practice 
(GCP) and experience in treating acne vulgaris . In some cases, qualified physicians who are not 
board- certified dermatologists may participate based on training and experience in the treatment 
of acne vulgaris . Sub- investigators may be licensed physicians, physician assistants, or nurse 
practitioners with experience in treating acne vulgaris  or in dermatology  and a good 
understanding of GCP . Investigators may delegate study tasks to other site personnel if they are 
qualified to perform the task.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of tazarotene 
and tazarotenic acid after twice- daily application of DFD -03 Lotion (Test product) versus  once -
daily application of Tazorac Cream (Reference product) for 21 days in Patients  with moderate 
acne vulgaris.  
The secondary objectives are  
a) Assessment of disease severity at baseline and at the pharmacokinetic ( PK) sampling days for 
each treatment.  
b) To determine the safety and tolerability of each  treatment.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
This will be a r andomized, multiple -dose, laboratory -blinded, open- label, 2 -arm, parallel -arm, 
multicenter  study in subjects with moderate acne vulgaris.  
Approximately 62 subjects will be randomized to receive either Test or Ref erence product, 
stratified by age (adult subjects :17 years or older ; pediatric  subjects : 9 years to 16 years 
11 months for the Test product and 12 years to 16 years 11 months for the Reference product)  
with approximately even distribution between males and females  in each age stratum . The study 
will be conducted in two parts, Part A and Part B in a sequential manner. Based on full PK 
profiles generated for adult subjects in Part A, the sparse PK sampling design in pediatric subjects has been  established in Part B.  Part B (age 9 years to 16 years 11 months  for DFD -03 
and 12 years to 16 years 11 months for Reference ) will enroll up to 38 subjects, which will 
include at least 6 subjects 9 to 11years of age, and among those at least 2 subjects between 9 and 10 years of age.  Target enrollment is 32 subjects, but up to 6 additional subjects may be 
enrolled to reach a minimum of 16 evaluable subjects, who have sparse samples collected on Day 14 and Day 21, randomized to the Test treatment. 
PK profiling will be per formed on Day 14 and on Day 21
. Day 14 is selected as the earliest time 
point at which the steady state is expected to be achieved in subjects with moderate acne 
vulgaris, before any significant improvement in skin barrier occurs.   
In Part A, 24 adult subjects will be enrolled such that 12 subjects each will be assigned to receive either Test or Reference treatment. In Part B, up to 38 subjects will be enrolled where 
approximately 26 subjects will receive Test treatment and 12 subjects will receive Referen ce 
treatment . Enrollment will continue until at least 16 evaluable subjects randomized to the Test 
treatment complete the study.  
For 21 days, study product  will be applied on the face, neck, upper chest, shoulders and upper 
back region, not exceeding 15% o f the body surface area. The Test product will be applied twice 
daily, 12 hours apart (morning and evening; 42 consecutive doses) , and the Reference product 
will be applied once daily in the evening (21 consecutive doses).  
Subjects will visit the clinical site daily prior to each dose application. Subjects will be confined at the clinic on Day 1 from prior to the evening dose until after that dose, from  prior to the 
evening dose on Day 14 to after the evening dose on Day, and from  prior to the evening dose  on 
Day 2 1 to after the 24- hour post dose PK sample collection on Day 22. S ubjects will leave the 
clinic after completion of clinical activities. On Days  14 and 21, blood sampling for PK 
estimation will be performed over an interval of 24 hours. Adequate t rough samples will be 
collected at the evening visit on D ay 1 to assess baseline and on days 12, 13, 14, 19, 20 and 21 
to assess attainment of steady state . For the pediatric population in part B, the trough samples 
will not be collected on days 12, 13, 19 and 20. Any subject missing dosing of any one dose of 
Reference product and two consecutive doses of Test product between days 1 and 8, or between 
days 8 and 15 will be considered for steady state estimation at Day 14, or Day 21, respectively. Subject (s)  missing either two consecutive dosing days (two doses for reference and four for test 
product) between day 1 and 8 or missing two non- consecutive dosing days between Day 2 and 
Day 11 will be assessed for steady -state estimation at Day 21 . Subjects missing  dosing between 
Days 12 and 14 and between Days  19 and 21 will not be considered for steady -state estimation 
or PK and statistical analysis.

For all dosing days (except confinement days), subjects will come to the clinical site ± 1 hour of  
each dose application (e. g., around 7:00 pm  and 7 :00 am ) for twice -daily application of Test 
product and (e.g. around 7:00 pm ) for once -daily application of Reference p roduct. Subjects will 
leave the clinical site  after completion of the scheduled activities. On D ay 14 and Day 21 , 
subjects will report to the clinic al site   before scheduled dosing , allowing sufficient time for all 
pre-dosing a ssessments to be performed . 
Blood samples for PK estimation will be collected (within time window ± 15 minutes) at 
scheduled interval s over a period of 24 hours after the evening dose application for Test product 
and Reference product on Day 14 and Day 21. On Day 22, f or assessment of leave on exposure  
for 12 hours , the last dose application of Test product (morning dose on D ay 22) will not be 
rinsed off.  
Plasma  samples for analysis of t azarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma concentrations  will be 
collected on the schedule described in Table 2. The PK parameters of interest will be T max(ss) , 
Cmax(s s), AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
For Part B of study, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum of  
4 time points from each subject , Table 3) on Day 14 and D ay 21 will be used for calculation of 
PK parameters: C max(ss) , AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Disease severity will be assessed by IGA score and inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion 
count (% change from baseline for lesion counts) at Day 15 and Day 21/Day22.  
Safet y assessments will include adverse events (AE s), the i nvestigator’s assessment of 
application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and 
itching), clinical safety laboratory evaluations (chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis ), and 
physical examination including vi tal signs (blood pressure and pulse rate).

Page 31 of 57 
For each treatment arm, approximately 5 gram s of Test or Reference product will be applied by 
the subject to the face, neck, and upper chest and will be applied by a member of the clinical 
staff to the shoulders and upper back (with the total area not exceeding  15% of the body surface 
area) over 21 consecutive days (Days 1 to 21).  The study product should be applied to all 
affected areas  [face, neck, upper chest, and/or upper  back (including shoulders) ] avoiding 
contact with the eyes, eyelids , and mouth. Subjects will be asked to refrain from applying 
emollients (moisturizers, creams) to the application areas at least an hour before dose  
application.  
Note : For age group 9- 11 years 11 months, approximately 4 grams of  test product will be 
applied considering their lesser BSA.  
 
The following steps should be taken to ensure consistent product application across time points and subjects:  
 1. Weigh the empty boat and record weight ( e.g. 2.38g)  
2. Dispense 5g of product into the boat and record total weight ( e.g. 7.38g)  [For age group 9 -11 
years 11 months, dispense 4g of test product  into the boat and record total weight (e.g. 6.38g)]  
3. Dose the subject  
4. Put the empty boat on the s cale and record the final weight (e. g.  2.41g)   
5. Subtract the full boat weigh from the final weight to get the total weight of product applied  (7.38- 2.41 = 4.97g)  [For age group 9- 11 years 11 months, s ubtract the full boat weight  
from the final weight to  get the to tal weight of product applied ( e.g. 6.38 -2.41 = 3.97g) ] 
Study staff should wear gloves at all times while handling or applying the study product. If powdered gloves are worn, they should be rinsed and dried prior to handling study product.  
Test Product  
The Test product  will be applied twice daily, 12 h ours apart  (± 1 hour)  (morning and evening) , 
for 21 days ( 42 consecutive doses). Before each dose application, subjects will take a brief 
warm shower to wet their skin. Approximately 5 gram s of the product will be applied by the 
subject to the face, neck, and upper chest and will be applied by a member of the clinical staff to the shoulders and upper back, and rubbed into the skin until foamy (approximately 30 seconds for the total application area).  After being left on for about 1 minute, the subject will rinse off 
the Test product in the shower for about 1 minute. On Day 22, the last dose application in morning will not be rinsed off in the shower ; however, the subject will be permitted to towel dry  
after the Test product has been on for approximately one minute. Twelve hours following the last application, , the subject will rinse off in the shower for 1 minute. The subject should bare 
their exposed body parts when the product is rinsed off and the c linical staff should ensure that 
no residues are left on the body.  
Note : For age group 9- 11 years 11 months, approximately 4 grams of test product will be 
applied considering their lesser BSA.  
Reference Product  
The Reference product will be applied to dry skin once daily in the evening for 21 consecutive 
days.  There should be a 24 hour interval between applications (± 1 hour). Approximately 5 
grams of t he product will be applied by the subject to the face, neck, and upper chest and by a

member of the clinic al staff to the shoulders and upper back. The applied cream will be left on 
for 12 hours and showering will not be permitted until at least 12 hours after the application. 
All Subjects  
The times of dose ap plications should be recorded on the case report fo rm (CRF ).  
Heavy make- up used to cover -up blemishes and sunscreen should be removed before study  
product application using a gentle cleanser approved by the investigator, such as Cetaphil 
Gentle Skin Cleanser , etc. 
Subjects will be allowed  to use a n invest igator -approved cleanser, face wash, sunscreen, and /or 
non-comedogenic moisturizer  with SPF daily on the face. Subjects will be instructed to continue 
to use their  investigator - approved products for the duration of the study and should avoid any 
changes i n these consumer products.  
6.3 Treatment and Protocol  Compliance  
Subjects will be provided an instruction sheet. Study staff should review the instruction sheet 
with the subjects to ensure protocol compliance.  
Subjects will be instructed not to use any other topical medicated treatments or products on the face (sunscreens are allowed); and to avoid contact with eyes, eyelids, and mouth. Subjects will be allowed to use an investigator -approved cleanser, face wash, sunscreen, and/or non-
comedogenic moisturizer w ith SPF daily on the face. Subjects will be instructed to continue to 
use their investigator - approved products for the duration of the study and should avoid any 
changes in these consumer products. Subjects will be asked to refrain from applying emollient s 
(moisturizers, creams) to the application areas at least an hour before dose application. For subjects receiving the Reference product, they will be reminded to leave the applied cream on 
their skin for 12 hours and showering will not be permitted until at least 12 hours after the application. The Subject Instructions will be reviewed with each subject.  
At each visit, the investigator will ask about compliance with protocol requirements. Protocol deviations will be recorded in the subject’s chart and Prot ocol Deviation Form and included in 
the study report. A Protocol Deviation Form is not needed for missed visits, missed applications, out-of-window visits, or missing data. These items will be apparent from the missing data on the 
CRF and will be identifie d programmatically during data analysis for purposes of reporting. The 
sponsor should be consulted before discontinuing a subject due to protocol deviations unless 
safety is a concern.  
Any subject missing dosing > 1 day (more than one dose of R eference pro duct or  two 
consecutive doses of T est product) from D ays 7 to 14 and missing dosing between D ays 12 and 
14 will be removed from steady -state estimation at Day 14 but will be assessed for steady -state 
estimation at Day 2 1, provided the subject does not miss  dosing between D ays 1 9 and 21. 
Subjects missing dosing between D ays 12 and 14, and between Days 19 and 2 1 will not be 
considered for steady -state estimation or PK  and statistical analysis .  
6.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Each subject wil l be assigned a unique identification number upon screening. Subjects who 
complete the study screening asses sments and meet all eligibility criteria will receive the 
treatment as per randomization , the order of which will be according to randomization sche me 
generated for each site.

(papules and pustules), and nodulocystic lesions  (nodules and cysts)  on the face  (above the 
mandibular line), including the nose, will be counted and recorded separately at Screening/Baseline to determine study eligibility . Non-inflammatory  lesions of acne are the 
open (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads) comedones. C losed comedones may be more difficult 
to detect visually and may require stretching of the skin to aid in visualization. Inflammatory lesions are divided into papules, pustules, and nodules/nodulocystic lesions, depending on the severity and location of the inflammation within the dermis. Nodulocystic lesions will be counted separately from inflammatory lesions of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules

have surrounding halos of erythema allowing for their characterization as inflammatory. 
Nodules ar e typically erythematous and often tender and/or painful. Additionally, they are deep-
seated in the skin (i.e., centered in the dermis or subcutis). Nodules have been defined as being greater than 5  mm in diameter. The borders of these lesions may be difficult to determine 
because of the associated erythema/inflammation. The investigator/evaluator should use standard, good lighting to visualize lesions and a systematic counting procedure to ensure accurate counts.  The investigator will perform lesion count at Screening and the baseline visit 
(Day1) and at PK sampling day s at Day 15 (prior to evening dose  application) , Day 21 (post last 
evening dose application for Reference treatment) and Day 22 (post last morning dose 
application  for Test treatment) .  
Disease severity will be assessed by IGA, inflammatory and non -inflammatory lesion count (% 
change from baseline for lesion count) at Day 15 and Day 21/Day22.  
7.4.2 Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) of the Face  
The IGA will be performed by t he investigator, with best attempts made to assign the same 
evaluator for a subject throughout the study to obtain consistency in grading scores. The IGA will be performed  at Screening and the  baseline visit ( Day1) and at PK sampling days at Day 15 
(prior to evening dose appli cation), Day 21 (post last evening dose application for Reference 
treatment) and Day 22 (post last morning dose application for Test treatment) . 
The IGA scale to be used in the study is a measure of static evaluation of qualitative overall acne severity. I GA is an ordinal scale with five  severity grades (rep orted only in integers, e.g., 
0 to 4). Each grade is defined by a distinct and clinically relevant morphologic description to minimize inter -observer variability  (Table 5) . The grades on the scale have been sufficiently 
defined to appropriately and unambiguously represent each severit y grade on the scale. The 
investigator will perform IGA scoring at Screening and the  baseline visit ( Day 1) .To be 
enrolled, subjects  had to have an IGA score of 3 at Baseline (Day 1). Disease severity will be 
assessed by the Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score at baseline and PK sampling days.

7.5 Pharmacokinetic  Assessments 
On the schedule shown in Table 2 and Table 3, blood sample s (6 mL) for Part A (adult subjects) 
and 4 m L for Part B  (pediatric  subjects ) will be collected in s odium f luoride and potassium 
oxalate ( NaFKO)  anticoagulant for analysis of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma 
concentrations. If vital sign measurements  and PK blood samples are scheduled a t the same 
time, the PK blood samples are to be collected before blood pressure and heart rate are recorded.  
At each specified time, 2  aliquots of plasma  will be prepared and stored until the part of the 
study is comple ted and will then be sent to designated analytical laboratory (Algorithme ) for 
analysis.  
The PK assessment for P art A has been  conducted prior to P art B. Based on the full PK profile 
of Test and R eference treatment s in Part A, the sparse sampling schedule for pediatric subjects  
in Pa rt B has been  decided.  
The procedure s for blood sample collection, plasma separation, storage and sample shipment to 
each clinical site will be described in a sample processing instruction supplied by  the 
bioanalytical facility . 
Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid plasma concentrations will be determined at a designated 
laboratory from the blinded samples using a validated bioanalytical method.  
7.6 Safety Assessments 
Safety assessments include visual inspection of the skin (erythema, sc aling  [peeling] ) prior to 
dose application, assessment of application site reactions (dryness, non- lesional erythema, 
peeling, stinging, burning, and itching)  after dose application , clinical safety laboratory 
evaluation s (chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis), and physical examination s including vital 
signs (blood pressure and pulse rate). A 12- lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit , 
Baseline visit (Day 1) and Day 21. F or females of  childbearing potential  serum  pregnancy tests 
will be conducted at the Screening Visit and urine pregnancy test s will be conduc ted at Day 1, 
Day 7, Day 14 and Day 21 . Adverse events will be collected by spontaneous reports from 
subjects, by directed questioning of subjects , and by observation (see Section 8 for details about 
AEs).  Adverse events, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to treatment, 
will be recorded on the CRF . 
Before each dose application, the investigator or designated trained site s taff will visually 
inspect the skin and grade erythema and scaling using the scales  shown in Table 6 and  Table 7, 
respectively .   
After each dose application,  the investiga tor or designated trained site staff  will assess 
application site reactions  by examining treated areas  for clinically significant non- lesional 
erythema, peeling , and dryness  that will be graded as shown below ( Table 6 , Table 7, Table 8 ) 
and recorded on the CRF . Assessments will be recorded separately for the face and (if 
applicable) neck, chest and /or back  (including shoulders) . The investigator or designated trained 
site staff will also ask the subject if any stinging ( Table 9) , burning ( Table 10), or itching  
(Table 11) has occurred on the face  (neck, ches t and/or  back  (including shoulders) , if applicable  
since the previous drug application. D ay 1 assessments are made prior to first application . An 
AE should be recorded  if the severity is worse  than at Day 1 . In addition, overall cutaneous  
tolerance should be graded at Day 21 , or the last visit if earlier, using the grading shown in 
Table 12. The local cutaneous tolerance signs and symptoms will be assessed separately fo r the

uncooperative, or if the investigator feels that it is in the best interest of the subject to withdraw.  
2. Subjects with protocol deviations  or who were later  discovered to not have met exclusion 
criteria  should not be withdrawn unless there is a safety concern. The protocol deviation 
should be recorded in the subject’s chart  and Protocol Deviation F orm and inc luded in the 
study report.   
3. Subjects who experience an AE resulting in or requiring discontinuation of study product  
use should be encouraged to be followed in the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized .

4. If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  will be discontinued 
immediately and she will be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. Details of the 
pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report  
Form and the sponsor notified imme diately . 
5. At the time of study discontinuation, the investigator will record the reason for early withdrawal, date of last dose  application , date of last visit or contact, collect AE  data, and, if 
possible, perform all  Day 21  visit- specific evaluations. Every attempt should be made to 
contact subjects who are lost -to-follow -up for a final safety assessment. At least three 
attempts must be documented in the subject’s chart including the use of at least 1 certified letter. Any contact, either direct or indirec t, should be made with the purpose to document 
the final status of the subject with regard to safety.   
6. Subjects who withdraw early will not be replaced.  
7.8 Modification of Protocol  
No amendments to this protocol can be made without consultation with and agre ement of the 
Sponsor . Amendments must be made in writing  and requires IRB approval . Modifications 
needed for the safety of subjects will be made immediately with notifications made as soon as possible. 
7.9 Early Termination of Study 
If it is determined by the sponsor or investigators that the study presents an unreasonable and 
significant risk to subjects, the study will be terminated as soon as possible, and in no event later 
than 5 working days following the determination that the study should be discontinued. The IRB and FDA must be notified as soon as possible about early termination of the study due to safety 
concerns.

8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events will be collected by spontaneous reports from subjects, either verbal or recorded 
in the subject diary, by directed questioning of subjects, and by observation.   
The most common frequently reported adverse reactions during clinical trials w ith tazarotene 
cream 0.1% for the treatment of acne were desquamation, dry skin, erythem a, and burning 
sensation , occurring in 10% to 30% of subjects. Adverse reactions occurring in 1%  to 5% of 
treated subject s included pruritus, irritation, face pain, and stinging .  
The investigator is to pay special attention at each visit to any signs  of clinically significant 
dryness, non- lesional erythema , and peeling and report  as an AE  subsequent to the Baseline 
Visit if worse than at Baseline. An AE  is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial. The 
event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study product . An AE  can 
therefore be any sign, symptom, or disease, or any worsening of an existing sign, symptom , or 
disease, whether or not considered related to the study product  or trial procedures, including 
injuries.   Any medical condition that is present at the time of Screening or Baseline should be considered 
as medical history and reported on the medical history CRF  and should not be reported as an AE 
except for AEs  observed at the Baseline V isit due to study procedures performed at the 
Screening visit , which should be reported. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing 
conditions should not be re ported as AEs. Unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions 
should be reported as AEs . The disease or condition being studied or expected progression, 
signs, or symptoms of the disease or condition being studied such as worsening of acne should not be r eported as an AE  unless it is more severe than expected , results in discontinuation from 
the study or requires alternat ive therapy . 
All serious adverse events  (SAEs), all study product -related events , and all AEs leading to study 
product  discontinuation must be followed until the clinical outcome is determined or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted ( not recovered  is not an acceptable 
outcome  for acute conditions ). For other AEs, the status at the last visit can be entered i nto the 
CRF . 
8.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Adverse event data must be collected from the time of signing of Informed Consent  until study 
product  treatment is discontinued except for spontaneously reported SAEs,  which  should be 
reported up to 30 days after  discontinuing study product use  and entered in to the CRF . Adverse 
events occurring from the time of the Screening Visit until the Baseline Visit associated with study procedures should also be reported for all subjects , including screen failures . 
8.2 Recordin g Adverse Events  
The investigator will record all AEs , regardless of relationship to study product  on the AE  CRF . 
Standard medical terminology should be used when describing AEs. Whenever possible a diagnosis should be made and recorded on the CRF  rather t han listing signs and symptoms. 
Intermittent AEs  can be recorded once. The anatomical location of the AE  must be specified 
when  applicable. The following information should be recorded on the CRF :

1. Description , including whether on treated area or not  
2. Start  date 
3. Stop date or date of death , ongoing , or unknown  
4. Severity of the event (see S ection  8.3.1 Severity for details)  
5. Study product  use continued or not  
6. Outcome of the event ( recovered/ resolved, recovered/ resolv ed with sequelae, not 
recovered/not resolved, unknown, fatal ) 
7. Relationship to study product  (see S ection  8.3.2 Relationship to Study Product 
[Causality ] for details)  
8. Indication of whether the event is serious (se e Section  8.3.3 Seriousness for details)  
9. Actions taken including treatment with concomitant medication  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs  and laboratory abnormalities  (except at the Screening and Da y -1 visits and pre -dose 
on Day 1)  should be reported as AEs if they are out of range and considered to be clin ically 
significant, as per the i nvestigator’s judgment. If an abnormal laboratory value is associated 
with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE, and the 
associated abnormal laboratory result should be considered additional information. 
8.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Severity  
It is the investigator's responsibility to assess the severity of each AE . Descriptions of  severity 
are as follows:  
1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
 
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
 
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that  normal activity is prevented. Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
8.3.2 Relationship to Study P roduct  (Causality)  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between th e study product  and the 
AE. The degree of “ relatedness” of the AE  to the study product  should be described using the 
following categories:  
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.). Specify if known. Or, the event is most probably produced by other factors such as 
the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
 
2. Possibly Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use but can be 
explained by another etiology. Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 46 of 57 
3. Probably Related : The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the stu dy product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
 
4. Definitely Related : The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by other factors such as the subject ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic intervention , or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately 
following study  product administration or improves on stopping the product, or there is a 
positive r eaction at the application site.  
8.3.3 Seriousness  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an AE. A serious adverse 
event (SAE) is any AE  occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatenin g (subject at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death,  are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAE information must be faxed or emailed  within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event  to 
the Sponsor’s medical monitor and appointed Pharmacovigilance person. The minimum initial information required to be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Form is: the subject number, subject initials, the event, the causality, the date of the event , and the name of t he person 
reporting the event. This initial report should be promptly followed up with a completed  Serious 
Adverse  Event Form.

 Associate Director  
 Clinical Pharmacovigilance, NA  
 Fax:   908-450-1510  
 Email:   SAE@drreddys.com  
 
The initial information must include a causality assessment that is provided by the primary 
investigator or other medically qualified individual. The causality assessment can be amended as more information is available . Significant new information about  ongoing SAEs should be 
reported promptly to the s ponsor. 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion

Page 47 of 57 
Serious adverse events will be evaluated  by the m edical m onitor within 24 hours of receipt and 
plans for management and further reporting (i.e., FDA) determined.  
All serious and unexpected suspected SAEs will be reported to the Agency by the Sponsor.  
It is the responsi bility of the CRO, Symbio L LC, to promptly notify the IRB and other 
Investigators involved in this study about serious and unexpected SAEs for which there is a 
reasonable possibility of their being related to the investigational product. 
Follow -up of Serious Adverse Events  
All follo w-up reports will be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial Reports. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE  form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or  autopsy reports) , should be faxed 
or emailed to the Sponsor. 
8.5 Discontinuation Due to an Adverse Event  
The s ponsor  must be notified within 5 days if any subject is withdrawn or discontinues study 
product  use due to an AE if the event  is related to the study product  (see title page for contact 
information).   
8.6 Exposure in utero  (Pregnancy)  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study, study product  must  be discontinued 
immediately and she must  be followed through the pregnancy and delivery. The investigator 
should report the event to the s ponsor immediately (s ee contact information on title page) and 
complete the Pregnancy Report  Form.  The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy should be included in this information. The investigator is instructed to contact 
the subject every 3 months until the end of her pregnancy and repo rt the outcome to the sponsor. 
Details of the pregnancy, delivery and health of the infant should be recorded on the Pregnancy Report  Form.  
The following outcomes of pregnancy fall under the criteria for SAEs  and should be reported as 
such: delivery complications prolonging hospitalization, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn baby, congenital anomaly, and anomaly in a miscarried fetus.  
9 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
9.1 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Porta bility and Accountability Act. This regulation 
requires a signed authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use/disclosure of their 
PHI.  
• Expiration of authorization 
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 48 of 57 
If a subject revokes authorization to collect and use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to th e revocation of authorization. For subjects 
who have revoked authorization to collect and use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. , that the subject is alive) at the end of their 
scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Investigators  must keep accurate separate records (other than CRF s) of all subject visits that  
include all pertinent study -related information , including original signed/dated informed 
consent/  Information and assent forms. Source documents for this study include all w ritten 
records of study data. All study data must have a paper source document , including investigator 
assessments.   
9.3 Screening/Enrollment Log  
A subject Screening/Enrollment Log, noting reasons for screen failure where applicable, must 
be maintained for al l subjects who are consented. The log should also include screening date, 
subject number , and date of enrollment , which is when ICF is signed, where applicable.   
9.4 Case Report Forms  
CRFs for individual subjects will be provided by Symbio. CRFs  must be legib le and complete. 
CRFs for this study will be maintained in a study binder and data recorded on 2- part NCR 
paper. One copy will be kept by the investigator and the other copy will be c ollected by the 
study monitor. All forms should be complete d using a blac k ballpoint pen. Errors should be 
lined out, but not obliterated, and the correction inserted, initialed, and dated by designated study personnel. Further data corrections will be performed on special “data correction forms” (DCFs) that will be provided to the investigator in case  of erroneous or unclear data. The 
investigator will make the correction on the DCF  and sign the DCF. The original will be sent to 
Symbio and a copy retained with the CRFs. 
A CRF must be completed and signed by the investigator for  each subject enrolled, including 
those discontinued from the study  for any reason. The reason for discontinuation must be noted 
on a subject’s study termination form. CRFs must be kept current to reflect the subject’s status at each phase d uring the study . Subjects 
are not to be identified on CRFs by name; appropriately coded identification and the subject’s 
initials must be used. The investigator must keep a separate log of the subjects’  names and 
addresses  
A Data Management  Plan, which describes the prog ramming of database structure, will be 
prepared.  
9.5 Archiving of Study Documentation  
The investigator must retain study records for 2 years following the date a marketing application is approved for the investigational product; or, if the application is not f iled or is not approved, 
until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is notified.  
The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need to be maintained.

All study documents, original source documents, correspondence, IRB documents, etc. are 
subject to sponsor and FDA inspection at any time.  
10 MONITORING AND DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
Only persons who are appropriately trained and who have the scientific and clinical knowledge 
to adequately monitor the study will be selec ted for monitoring this study. The monitor must 
have at least 1 year of previous experience i n monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar with the etiology and signs and symptoms of acne and the treatment options tha t are 
currently available.   
Before study initiation, the investigator and site personnel will receive protocol training from the sponsor’s representatives to ensure collection of accurate, consistent, complete, and reliable data. This training will take p lace either at a web -based Investig ator Meeting or individually 
on-site. 
During the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and ensure  that 
the study is being conducted according to the protocol and GCP. Any review of the subjects’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. The investigator will ensure that the monitor or other compliance auditor is given access to all study -related documents and has adequate time and space to conduct the 
monitoring visit including availability of the investigator and site personnel to discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed  to ensure accurate transfer of data to electronic media.  
The sponsor’s Quality Assurance representative may conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5% to 10% of the investigator sites.  
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
All statistical processing will be perf ormed using SAS
® unless otherwise stated. Two- sided 
hypothesis testing will be conducted for all inferential analyses using a significance level of 0.05. Efficacy analyses performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will be considered 
primary. Efficacy analyses performed using the per -protocol (PP) population will be considered 
supportive. Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population (all subjects  who receive 
study product  and provide any post -baseline safety information ). Study popul ations are defined 
in Section  11.2. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan, describing all statistical analyses  and outlier testing , will be 
provided as a separate document prior to database lock and unblinding of the stud y treatments.  
11.1 Sample Size  
Approximately 62 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Since the study is not aimed to meet the bioequivalence  criteria , proper powering of the study is not required. The sample size chosen for 
the study attempts adequate repres entation of pediatric and adult population and was considered 
adequate to meet the study objectives.

11.2  Analysis Data Sets  
11.2.1 Safety Population  
All subjects who receive at least one confirmed dose of study product  and provide any post -
baseline safety informatio n will be included in the safety population. No imputation will be 
made for missing safety data.  
11.2.2 Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  Population  
Samples from all subjects who provide evaluable data will be assayed; these subjects will be 
included in the PK  and statistical analysis. In order to be considered evaluable, a subject must 
have PK samples collected on both Day 14 and Day 21. An unequal number of subjects per arm 
will be used.  
11.3 Demographic and Baseline Data 
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group for the s afety and P K populations.  
11.4 Pharmacokinetic  Analyses   
Tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  plasma concentrations produced by the application  of the study 
products  will be determined  to establish the  PK profile of each treatment regimen . Below limit 
of quantitation concentrations ( coded BLQ)  will be treated as zero for all statistical analyses. 
The PK  parameters will be derived from the plasma concentrations versus  time profiles . All 
reported sampling time d eviations following application  for test and Reference will be taken 
into consideration for evaluation of PK parameters. 
In the case where concentrations of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  cannot  be determined due to 
bioanalytical or clinical reasons, thes e values will be set to missing for the PK and statistical 
analysis.  
In the case where less than 3 consecutive measurable concentrations of tazarotene and tazarotenic acid  are observed, the area under the curve ( AUC ) parameters will not be estimated 
for th at specific study period.  
The following PK parameters  will be calculated for tazarotene and tazarotenic acid on Day  14 
and Day  21 using a noncompartmental approach. T he linear t rapezoidal rule will be used to 
estimate the AUC .  
C
max(ss): Maximum o bserved m aximum plasma concentration  during a dosing interval at 
steady state  
AUC 0-12(ss) Area under the concentration –time curve from time zero  to 12 hours post -dose, at 
steady state  
AUC 0-24(ss) Area under the concentration –time curve from time zero  to 24 hours post -dose, at 
steady state  
Tmax(ss) Time to reach observed maximum plasma concentration , at steady state  
Cmin(ss)  Minimum observed plasma c oncentration during a  dosing interval  at steady state

The absorption and disposition parameters will be determined usin g a noncompartmental  
approach , the t rapezoidal rule will be used to estimate the area under the curve. The PK  
parameters of interest for this study will be : 
Day 14 and Day 21:  Tmax(ss) , Cmax(ss) , AUC 0-12(ss), AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin(ss),  
For Part B, plasma concentration data generated from sparse samples (max imum 4 time points 
from each subject) on D ay 14 and Day 21 will be used for calculation of PK parameters: C max(ss) , 
AUC (ss), Cmin(ss). 
Descriptive statistics  will be calculated for plasma concentrations  at each individual time point 
and for all PK  parameters.  The individual plasma concentration/time profiles will be presented 
using the actual sampling times where as the mean plasma concentration/time profiles will be 
presented using the theoretical sampling times . Concentration/time profiles will be presented on 
linear and semi -log scales.  
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be generated using validated PK  software (e.g. Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® Version 6.3 or higher and Phoenix® ConnectTM version 1.3.1 or higher ). 
A statistical plan will prepared . Statistical analysis of all PK parameters will be based on a 
parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Two -sided 90% confidence intervals of the 
ratio of geometric least squares (LS) means will be presented  from the natural  log (ln) -
transformed PK parameters (C max(ss) , AUC 0-24(ss), Cmin (ss)) for Treatment  1 vs Treatment  2.  
Achievement  of steady  state will be performed by treatment, using log -transformed C min(ss) (at 
Days 12, 13 and  14 and 19 , 20 and 21)  in a mixed effect mo del through repeated -measure 
ANOVA or through other appropriate statistical methods .  
Disease severity will be assessed between baseline and sampling days by paired t -test or any 
other appropriate statistical test and will be presented by treatment.  
Descri ptive statistics will be presented for safety parameters.  
11.5 Safety Analyses  
11.5.1 Extent of Exposure  
The extent of exposure to study product  on the face in each treatment group will be summarized 
as the total number of applications. 
11.5.2 Local Cutaneous Safety Evaluati on 
Non-lesional erythema, peeling, dryness, burning, stinging, and itching scores  will be 
summarized by treatment group and visit including sample size, frequency count and percentage  
for each visit . A similar summary will be provided excluding subjects with signs or symptoms 
present at Baseline.  
11.5.3 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology. Treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) are AEs  with an onset on or after the date of the first study product  
administration. For the safety population, all reported TEAEs  will be summarized by treatment 
group, the number and percent of subjects reporting events, system organ class  (SOC), preferred 
term (PT), severity, relationship to study product , and seriousness. When summarizing TEAEs

Page 52 of 57 
by causality and severity, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or 
a preferred term by using the event with the greatest relationship and highest severity within each classification.  
Additionally, treatment -related TEAEs  will be summarized for each treatment group by SOC 
and PT, and further by severity . A TEA E will be considered treatment- related if it is reported as 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment.  
SAEs will be listed by subject. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely discontinued from the study due to an AE will be provided. 
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the study will be listed by su bject, detail ing 
verbatim term given by the investigator, preferred term, system organ class, onset date, 
resolution date, maximum severity, seriousness, action taken regarding study product , corrective 
treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will also be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first administration. 
AEs related to study procedures done before study product  administration will be provided in a 
data listing.  
11.5.4 Vital S igns 
Changes from Baseline in vital signs (blood press ure and pulse) will be summarized by 
treatment group at each evaluation visit using descriptive statistics.

A. PREAMBLE   
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as  a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with c onsideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians . The 
WMA encourages other s who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt 
these principles.   
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code o f Medical Ethics declares that “A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best  interest when providing medical care.” 
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health , well -being and rights of patients, 
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.   
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of d iseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and  quality.  
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects 
and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given 
consent.   
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the e nvironment.  
 
 
 
 
Version 3.0 
DFD -03 Lotion  
Protocol DFD -03-CD-007 
Page 55 of 57 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the 
appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients or healthy 
volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other 
health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to 
participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research 
only to the extent that this is  justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if 
the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriat e compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in 
research must be ensured.  
C. RISK, BURDENS AND BENEFITS  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research invo lving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective 
outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable 
risks and burdens to  the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with 
foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under 
investigation.  
Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be con tinuously monitored, 
assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are 
confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the r isks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of 
definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the 
study.  
D. VULNERABLE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS    
19. Some groups and individuals ar e particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of 
being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
 
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection.  
 
20. Medical Research with a vulnerable group is only jus tified if the research is responsive to the health 
needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non -vulnerable group. In 
addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices or interventions that result from the research.  
 
E. SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND RESEARCH PROTOCOLS  
 21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, 
be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, 
and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
 
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly 
described and justi fied in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical 
considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been 
addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, sponsors,  institutional 
affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the

research study. In clinical trials,  the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.   
 
F. RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concerned research  ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified . It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or  
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
subjects set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. 
The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and 
approval by the comm ittee.  After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research su bjects and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
 
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical research must 
be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential 
subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail, post- study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention should be given to the 
specific informat ion needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver 
the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the 
physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the p otential subject's freely -
given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research subjects should be 
given the option of being inf ormed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by an appropriately 
qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.  
28. For a potential research subject who is in capable of giving informed consent , the ph ysician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the  group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons  capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed co nsent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject's dissent should be 
respected.

30. Research involving sub jects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group . In such cir cumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon  as possible from the subject or a legally authorized representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to with draw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek inf ormed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of  a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO 
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, t he use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determ ine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm as a result of no recei ving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make 
provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as 
beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclos ed to participants during the informed 
consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible database 
before recruitment of the first su bject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on hum an subjects and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment  of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or  other known 
interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unp roven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cas es, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

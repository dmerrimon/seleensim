SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol ACCL1333/CV185155
Protocol Title: A Phase III Randomized, Open Label, Multi-center Study of the S afety and Efficacy of Apixaban for 
Venous Thromboembolism Prevention versus No Systemic Anticoagula nt Prophylaxis during Induction 
Chemotherapy in Children with N ewly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblasti c Leukemia (ALL) or Lymphoblastic 
Lymphoma (T or B cell) treated with asparaginase
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s) :  
Subjects 1 to < 18 years of age will be administered apixaban t wice daily by mouth or via a NGT or GT according to 
weight range as per below Table during approximately 28 days of in duction chemotherapy including asparaginase.
Weight range Dose
≥35 kg 2.5 mg twice daily 
<35 to 25 kg 2 mg  twice daily 
<25 to 18 kg 1.5 mg twice daily 
<18 to 10.5 kg 1 mg twice daily 
<10.5 to 6 kg 0.5 mg twice daily
The previously communicated dosing for the body weight tier of 9 to < 12 kg has been redistributed into a 6 to
< 10.5 kg weight tier and a 10.5 to < 18 kg weight tier.
Treatment with apixaban should b egin after randomization. Study medication must be initiated prior to or within 
12 hours of the first dose of asparaginase or by Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic i nduction chemotherapy, 
whichever is first and will stop on approximately Day 29 of planned  3-4 drug sys temic induction chemotherapy. 
During the study, the apixaban treatment will be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to any planned lumbar puncture 
(LP) and resumed no sooner than 18- 24 hours after the  procedure. In the event of a traumatic lumbar puncture (defined 
in this protocol as a lumbar puncture with ≥ 10 red blood cells (RBCs)/μL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), apixaban 
should be held for 48 hours after the procedure.
Study Phase:  Phase III
Research Hypothesis :  Oral or enteric administration of prophy lactic apixaban during induction chemother apy will 
reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (symptomatic + as ymptomatic), compar ed to no systemic 
anticoagulant prophylaxis, during induction chemotherapy in chi ldren with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T or B cell) with cen tral venous line treated with asparaginase.
Study Objectives: 
Primary Objectives:
To compare the effect of pr ophylactic oral or enteric apixaban versus no systemic anticoagulant during ~28 days of 
induction chemotherapy including asparaginase on the composite en dpoint of adjudicated non-fatal deep vein 
thromboses (DVT, including symptomatic and asymptomatic), pulmo nary embolism (PE), and cerebral venous sinus 
thrombosis (CVST); and VTE-related-death. 
To assess the effect of prophylactic oral or enteric apixaban v ersus no systemic anticoagulant during ~28 days of
induction chemotherapy including asparaginase on adjudicated majo r bleeding events. 
Secondary Objectives:
•To assess the effect of prophylactic apixaban versus no systemic anticoagulant during ~28 days of induction 
chemotherapy including asparaginase on single adjudicated endpoint s of non-fatal DVT (including symptomatic 
and asymptomatic), PE, and CVST; and VTE-related-death.

Study Design:  
Recruitment will start for children of ages 1 to < 18 years of age and weighing equal to or > 6 kg. 
The current study is a randomized, open-label, multi-center cli nical trial in which pediatric subjects will be randomized 
1:1 to prophylactic apixaban for thromboembolism prevention ver sus no sys temic antico agulant prophylaxis during 
induction chemotherapy. Subjects r andomized to apixaban will re ceive a prophylactic-dose of apixaban. While 
subjects≥5 years may be administered either 2.5-mg, 0.5-mg tablets or or al solution apixaban, use of 2.5 mg or 0.5 
mg tablets is encouraged. Subjects  < 5 years  and < 35 kg may b e administered 0.5-mg tablets only.
Subjects will be adminis tered apixaban twice d aily by mouth or via a NGT or GT  according to weight range as p er 
below Table during approximately 28 days of induction chemotherapy including asparaginase.
Weight range Dose
≥35 kg 2.5 mg twice daily 
<35 to 25 kg 2 mg  twice daily 
<25 to 18 kg 1.5 mg twice daily 
<18 to 10.5 kg 1 mg twice daily 
<10.5 to 6 kg 0.5 mg twice daily
The previously communicated dosing for the body weight tier of 9 to < 12 kg has been redistributed into a 6 to
< 10.5 kg weight tier and a 10.5 to < 18 kg weight tier.
Pediatric subjects randomized to apixaban should begin treatmen t following randomization (as long as conditions for 
apixaban administration are met).  St udy medicati on must be initiated prior to or within 12 hours of the first d ose of 
asparaginase or by Day 4± 3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy, whicheve r is first. Day 1 is the 
first day of planned 3-4 drug systemic induction ALL chemotherapy. 
For a subject who experiences a r eaction to asparaginase  during the infusion and has to switch to Erwinia asparaginase 
during the induction chemotherapy, it is recommended that the s ubject continue the study treatment. The percentage 
of the original asparaginase dose delivered will be collected i n the patient chart and case report form.
A platelet count ≥20,000 /μL must be obtained within 24 hours prior to the first dose of apixaban. A subject may be 
transfused platelets per investigator’s clinical judgment but m ay not be transfused solely to meet entry criteria.
Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to any pl anned lumbar puncture (LP) and resumed no sooner 
than 18-24 hours after the procedure. In the event of a traumat ic lumbar puncture (defined in this protocol as a lumbar 
puncture with ≥10 red blood cells (RBCs)/ μL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), apixaban should be held for 48 hours after 
the procedure. 
For example, for a LP schedu led on the morning of Day 8, the Day 7 PM and Day 8 AM a nd PM doses of apixaban 
should be held and may be restarted the morning of Day 9. If a subject will receive an LP on Day 29, the last dose will 
be the AM dose on Day 28.
During the study treatment period, study visits will occur on D ay 8 ±5 days, Day 15 ±5 days, Day 22 ±5 days and 
Day 29 ±5 days of planned 3-4 drug systemic i nduction chemotherapy. Windows  for study visits after randomization 
will be ±5 days. The timing of these study visits will coincide with standard of care visits for ped iatric subjects in 
induction chemotherapy. Visits will consist of reporting advers e events (including bleeding and secondary endpoints 
as described below), monitoring medication adherence and labora tory testing. On the Da y 29 visit, imaging evaluation 
will occur for all randomized subjects except for those who are  discontinued from protocol therapy. For those subj ects 
randomized to apixaban, imaging evaluations will be performed w ithin 3 days but no more than 5 days of 
discontinuing apixaban. For thos e subjects randomized to the st andard of care arm, it would be preferred that the 
imaging evaluations be performed w ithin three days but no more than 5 days from Day 29 (Day 24 to Day 34). The 
evaluation will include a) a bilateral Doppler ultrasound that will include imaging of the venous system in which the 
CVAD is placed and the similar location for the opposite side; and b) an echocardiogram to assess for right atr ial

thrombi according to the protocol guidance in appendices 1 and 2. Subjects will not undergo routine radiologic 
screening for CVST.
Additional clinical and radiologic evaluations prompted by clin ical suspicion of any DVT, PE, CVST, arterial 
thromboembolic events, bleeding or death will be performed at the discretion of the treating clinician; and information 
from these visits and imaging findings will be captured for study analysis. A chest X-ray is not mandated by the study. However, if a chest X-ray has been performed as part of the sta ndard of care, the chest X-ray should be submitted as 
part of the adjudication package.
Every effort must be made to confirm a suspected thromboembolic  or bleeding event before discontinuing a subject 
from protocol therapy. Management of any asymptomatic or sympto matic events will be according to the local 
standards of practice. If study medication is discontinued for a suspected thromboembolic event, alternative 
anti-thrombotic therapy may be initiated per the Investigator’s  discretion and standard of care.
All subjects who discontinue study drug due to an event (eg, thromboembolic or major bleeding event), or due to loss 
of the catheter prior to Day 29 end-of-study evaluation, should remain in the study a nd report any adverse events or 
clinical events and comply with protocol specified follow-up pro cedures. Every attempt must be made to have the 
study-related radiographic procedures, Ultrasound and Echocardi ogram within 72 hours of the event and the telephone 
or in-person safety assessment on Day 35 ±5 days. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject  withdraws 
consent for all study procedures including post-treatment study  follow-up or loses the ability to consent freely (ie, is 
imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
Sparse samples for PK and PD (ant i-FXa activity) will be taken i n subjects receiving apixaban. Pre-dose and post dose
concentrations of apixaban may be measured on the same day if fe asible (eg, in-patients). Alternatively samples may 
be collected on separate days (eg, out-patients), for example, th e pre-dose before the Day 8 LP and the post-dose 
concentrations on Day 15.PK/PD samples may be drawn through the CVAD. No PK/PD samples w ill be drawn in subjects who are not 
randomized to apixaban.
For all subjects, a follow up telephone or in person safety assessment will be scheduled on Day 35 ±5 days. Subjects 
will be instructed to r eport all adve rse events, including thos e symptoms suggestive of thromboembolism and bleeding 
to the Investigator.
If the catheter is lost or replaced before the Day 29 end-of-st udy evaluation because of achieving a primary endpoint 
(eg, VTE, major bleeding), protocol  therapy will be discontinued  and the ultrasound and echocardiogram should be
performed within 72 hours of this event or prior to the cathete r being replaced. The subject would discontinue study
treatment but be followed until the end of the study. If the cat heter is to be removed and replaced within 48 hours due 
to events other than a primary endpoint event, the subject should not have the study mandated ultrasound and 
echocardiogram until Day 29±5 and should continue with the study  treatment (for temporary apixaban interruptions 
related to an invasive procedure, see  Table 4.5.2-1 ).
Study Population: Subjects eligible for the study include males and females age 1  to < 18 years with newly diagnosed 
ALL or newly diagnosed lymphoblastic lymphoma (T or B cell) and a new CVAD inserted between Day -7 to Day 4
±3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy and planned to remain in place until at least Day 29 ±5 of

The Screening Period will occur after consent is obtained, and it can occur between Day -7 to Day 4 ±3 of planned 
3-4 drug systemic inducti on chemotherapy. Screening labs done as  standard of care prior to signing consent can be 
used. At the screening visit the IVRS system will be contacted to  obtain a unique subject number. A complete medical 
history and a physical examination including vital signs, height , BP, and body weight, will be obtained. The screening 
visit laborat ory stud ies will include: CBC with platelets, ALT,  AST, WBC and RBC in CSF (LP pri or to receiving 
study treatment), conjugated bilirubin (if total bilirubin is abn ormal) and serum creatinine (estimated GFR), PT (if 
available), aPTT, and INR and serum or urine pregnancy test for  females of reproductive potential (FRP). 
For all FRP that will be inpatients from consenting to the firs t dose of apixaba n, it is expected that a negative pregnancy 
test be recorded in the subject’ s hospital chart at any time po int from the time of hospitali zation but p rior to first 
treatment.
All FRP that will be treated as outpatients from consenting to the first dose of Apixaban must have a negative serum 
or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity  25 IU/L  or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start 
of study drug.
The Randomization visit will occur between Day 1 and Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 dr ug systemic induction 
chemotherapy. Day 1 is the first day of planned 3-4 drug sys temic induction ALL chemotherapy. For pediatric subjects 
who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the IVRS system will be contacted and the subjects will be randomized. 
The subjects randomized to apix aban will receive instructions a bout the study drug and will start the st udy drug 
following randomization as long as conditions for apixaban admi nistration are met (e.g. platelet counts are equal to or 
> 20,000 / microL). Study medication must be initiated prior to o r within 12 hours of the first dose of asparaginase or 
by Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 drug sys temic induction chemotherapy, whichever is first. 
The screening and randomization visits can be done on the same day if the subject is eligible by medical history, 
clinical exam, and has local laboratory results that are within  the appropriate inclusive parameters. 
Day 7 ±5 of chemotherapy: For all subjects randomized to apixaban who are inpatients on pla nned 3-4 drug systemic 
induction chemotherapy, a  pre- and post-dos e PK and anti-FXa sample may be taken on the same day. For example, 
the samples may be taken prior to the Day 7 ±5 AM dose of apixaban, followed by a PK and anti-FXa sample take n 
1-4hr post-dose.
Subjects who are not able to provide a pre and post dose sample o n the same day (eg, those who are outpatients) will 
have a PK and anti FXa sample co llected on separate occasions, fo r example once on Day 8 ±5 and once on Day  15 
±5.
Local CBC with platelets, SGPT (ALT), AST, and direct (conjugate d) bilirubin (if total  bilirubin is abnormal), RBC 
in CSF, adverse event data collection and concomitant therapy a ssessment will be performed.
Day 8 ±5 of chemotherapy:   The Day 8 assessment is meant to coincide with those patients  unable to attend the 
Day 7 visit. Local CBC with platelets, SGPT (ALT), AST and direct (conjugated) bilirubin (if total bilirubin is 
abnormal), RBC in CSF, adverse event data collection and concomi tant therapy assessment will be performed unless 
they were done at Day 7 for subjects that were inpatients.Subjects who are  randomized to apixaban and did not have a pre- a nd post- dose sample collected on the same day
(eg, those who are outpatients), wi ll have a PK and anti-FXa sam ple collected on separate days, for example, on either 
Day 8 ±5 prior to LP procedures and within 24 hours of the subjects last apixaban dose.
Day 15 
±5 of chemotherapy: Local CBC with platelets, SGPT (ALT), AST, and dir ect (conjugated) bilirubin (if 
total bilirubin is abnormal), adverse event data collection and  concomitant therapy assessment will be performed.
Subjects who are rando mized to apixaban and did not have a pre- and post- dose sample collected on the same day
(eg, those who are outpatients), will have a PK and anti-FXa sample collected on separate days, for example, on 
Day 15 ±5 of chemotherapy, 0.5 to 12 hr after the AM dose of apixaban (an d prior to the PM dose on that day).
Day 22 ±5 of chemotherapy: Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and direct (conjugated) bili rubin (if total bilirubin 
is abnormal), adverse event data collection and concomitant therapy assessment will be performed. 
Day 29 ± 5 of chemotherapy: Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and direct (conjugated) bili rubin (if total 
bilirubin is  abnormal), RBC in CSF, adverse event d ata collection and concomitant therapy assessment will be 
performed.

On the Day 29 visit, the ima ging evaluation will occur for all randomized subjects w ho remain on protocol therapy. 
The imaging evaluation will include a Doppler ultrasound and an  echocardiogram. The Doppler ultrasound will 
evaluate the extremity in which the CVAD is placed according to a standardized protocol, or at the location of the 
insertion if the CVAD is placed in the neck or chest, and the sim ilar location for the opposite side. The Doppler 
ultrasound should be performed for both the ipsilateral and the c ontralateral sides whenever possible. If there is 
difficulty in performing the imaging procedure, Doppler ultraso und from the ipsilateral side alone is acceptable (see 
Appendix 1 for detailed guidance). The echocardiogram will assess the right atrial thrombi. For those subjects 
randomized to apixaban, imaging evaluations will be performed p referably within 3 days but no more than 5 days of 
discontinuing apixaban. For thos e subjects randomized to the st andard of care arm, it would be preferred that the 
imaging evaluations be performed within 3 days but no more than 5 days from Day 29 (D ay 24 to Day 34). Sub jects 
will not undergo routine radiologic screening for CVST.
If the catheter is lost or replace d before the Day 29 end-of-st udy evaluation because of achieving a primary endpoint 
(eg, VTE, major bleeding), protocol therapy w ill be discontinued and t he ultrasound and echocardi ogram should be
performed within 72 hours of this event or prior to the cathete r being replaced. The subject would discontinue study
treatment but be followed until the end of the study. If the ca theter is to be removed and replaced within 48 hours due 
to events other than a primary endpoint event, the subject should not have the study mandated ultrasound and 
echocardiogram until Day 29±5 and should continue with the study  treatment.
Day 35 ±5 of chemotherapy: Telephone or in person follow up safety assessment will be sche duled on Day 35 ±5
for all subjects. In this assessment, adverse event data collec tion and concomitant therapy assessment will be obtained.
Statistical Considerations:  
Sample Size Determination:   With a total of approximately 500 randomized sub jects allocated with 1:1 ratio to the 
systemic thromboprophylaxis with apixaban (intervention) or no systemic anticoagulant prophylaxis (control) groups, 
there is more than 80% power to demonstrate superiority at a on e-sided 0.025 level, assuming the true event rates of 
primary endpoint (composite of no n-fatal asymptomatic and sympt omatic DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), and 
CVST; and VTE-related-death) are 17% and 8.5% in the control an d the apixaban groups, respectively.
Sample size estimation is based on Pearson’s chi-square test.
Additionally, there is more than 80% power to demonstrate super iority at a one-side d 0.025 level, assuming the true 
event rates are 20% and 10% in the control and the apixaban gro ups, respectively with analyses that assume that 20% 
of the subjects will be  excluded from the primary analysis due to either early dropout without  end-of-treatment imaging 
evaluation or non-evaluable end-of-treatment imaging measuremen t in the calculation
Randomization will be stratified by age groups as < 10 years or  ≥10 to < 18 years, to reflect the major peaks of disease 
prevalence and risk stratification criteria for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. 
Primary Endpoints: 
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of non-fatal DVT ( including asymptomatic and symptomatic), PE, and 
CVST; and VTE-related-death objectively confirmed by independen t adjudication. 
All components of the primary efficacy endpoint will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication 
committee.
Safety:
The primary safety endpoint will be adjudicated major bleeding which is defined as bleeding satisfies one or more of 
the following criteria: (i) fata l bleeding; ( ii) clin ically ove rt bleeding associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at 
least 20 g/L (ie, 2 g/dL) in a 24 -hour period; (iii) bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial, or otherwise 
involves the CNS; and/or (iv) bleeding that requires surgical i ntervention in an operating suite, including interventional 
radiology. Of note, the  major bleeding will not be considered as  part of the prima ry endpoint for t he purpose of the 
European application, but will be assessed as part of the safety  profile of apixaban.
Prophylactic transfusions wit hout overt bleeding and wit hout a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 20 g/L (ie, 2 g/dL) 
in a 24 - hour period are not considered bleeding events.

All bleeding events will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee as major bleeding, CRNM 
bleeding, or minor bleeding. These endpoints are consistent wit h those recommended by the International Society on 
Thrombosis and Haemostasis for pediatric clinical trials in venous thromboembolism.
Secondary Endpoints: 
Efficacy:
1) Non-fatal asymptomatic DVT
2) Non-fatal symptomatic DVT 3) Non-fatal PE
4) CVST
5) VTE-related-death
Safety:  
a) Composite of major and CRNM bleeding (CRNMB). CRNM bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies 
one or both of the following:
i. overt bleeding for which blood product is administered and no t directly attributable to the subject’s 
underlying medical condition and 
ii. bleeding that requires medical or surgical intervention to r estore hemostasis, other than in an 
operating room

Populations for Analyses
Enrolled Population:
The Enrolled Subjects population consists of all subjects who si gned informed consent.
Randomized /Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population 
The Randomized/Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population consists of all subjects who were ra ndomized to a treatment, 
regardless of whether they received study drug or not. Except a s noted otherwise, the Randomized/ITT Population 
will be used for the evaluation of efficacy.
Modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) Population
The mITT population includes rando mized subjects who have eithe r an adjudicated event making up the primary 
efficacy endpoint or evaluable end of study imaging evaluations, including ultrasound and echocardiogram.
Evaluable Population
The Evaluable population will in clude the Randomized/ITT populat ion except those subjects  with relevant protocol 
deviations expected to affect the primary efficacy endpoint.
Safety Population
The safety population include s all randomized subjects since the re is no intervention on top of standard care in the 
control arm and will be used for the evaluation of safety.
Pharmacokinetic Measures:
PK/PD samples will be taken in subjects receiving apixaban. Pre -dose and post dose concentrations of apixaban will 
either be meas ured on the s ame day if feasible (eg, in-patients) or on separate days (eg, out-patients). For example, 
the pre-dose may be taken on Day 8 ±5 and the post-dose may be taken on Day 15 ±5.  
A PPK model will be developed using plasma concentration versus  time data. Model-derived population and 
individual PK parameters (eg, CL/F, Vc/F, KA) will be used to e stimate Cmax, Cmin, and AUC(TAU) in each subject. 
Modeling results will be reported separately.

Anti-FXa Activity Measures: 
Observed pre-dose and post-dose an ti-FXa activity will either b e measured on the same day if feasible (eg, in-patients) 
or on separate days (eg, out-patients). For example the pre-dose on the Day 8 visit and the post-dose anti-FXa activity 
on Day 15 visit or another day.
A PPK-PD model will be developed using plasma concentration and  measured Anti-FXa activity versus time data. 
Model-derived population and individual parameters (eg, slope o f anti-FXa activity vs apixaban concentration 
relationship) will be used to estimate maximum and minimum Anti -FXa activity in each subject. Modeling results 
will be reported separately.Analyses:   For primary efficacy  endpoint and primary safety endpoint, st atistics including event rate, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for event rate, relative risk, 95% CI for relativ e risk and p-value will be displayed.
For other endpoints, descriptive statistics including single ev ent rate, 95% confidence interval (CI) for single event 
rate, relative risk and 95% CI for relative risk will be displa yed.
To construct p-values, the Cochra n-Mantel-Haenszel test stratif ied by age group s of < 10 and ≥10 years old will be 
used at the one-sided α = 0.025 level.
To construct descriptive statistics:
•The 95% CI for the relative risk will be computed based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel’s method stratified by 
age groups of < 10 years and ≥10 years. 
•Construction of CIs for event rates will be based on the Agrest i Coull’s method
The analyses on all the efficacy endpoints will be based on the  Randomized/ITT population. 
Listings of observed PK and Anti-FXa data will be provided by Visit and age-group as appropriate.
Analyses related to the PK, PK-PD relationship, and exposure-re sponse relationships will be described in a separate 
analysis plan and the results reported separate from the Clinic al Study Report (CSR).

Based on PK simulati
ons performed with this 
model a dosing scheme has been selected for the age cohort to be  enrolled (1 to < 18 years):
Dose Selection 
Wi
th the introduction of 0.5-mg tablets, the dosing paradigm of  apixaban changed from mg/kg 
dosing to a fixed-dos e, body wei ght-tiered regimen, as outlined  i n  Table 1.2-2 . The fixed-dose, 
body weight-tie red regimen w ill use apixaban doses in increments of 0.5-mg according to the  
appropriate weight range, regardless of apixaban formulations ( i.e. oral soluti on or 0.5-mg tab lets). 
The modelling and simulation results, support the current dosin g recommendation of a fixed-dose 
body weight-tiered regimen for pediatric subjects aged 3 months  to < 18 years. The age range for 
enrollment in this study will remain age 1 year to < 18 years. Study medication will be administered 
in accordance with the instructions provided.  While subjects ≥5 years may be administered either 
2.5-mg, 0.5-mg tablets or oral solution apixaban, use of 2.5 mg or 0.5 mg tab lets is encouraged.

Subjects < 5 years and <35 kg may be administered 0.5-mg tablets  only. Switching formulations 
during the course of the study is not encouraged but is allowed .
The previously unopened 9 to < 12 kg weight tier will be redist ributed into the 2 adjacent weight 
tiers and dosed as follows: 6 to < 10.5 kg patients will be dosed  0.5 mg and 10.5 to <18 kg patients 
will be dosed 1 mg. The original p roposal was for p atients with body weight in the tier of 9 to 
< 12 kg to receive a 0.75-mg dose. The redistributed regimen provides s imilar exposures to the 
0.75-mg dose originally listed in the protocol.
Subjects 1 to < 18 years of age will be administered apixaban t wice daily by mouth or via a NGT 
or GT according to weight range as per below Table 1.2-2 during approximately 28 days of 
induction chemotherapy including asparaginase.

<10.5 to 6 kg 0.5 mg twice daily
The previously communicated dosing for the body weight tier of 9 to < 12 kg has been redistributed into a 6 to < 10.5 
kg weight tier and a 10.5 to < 18 kg weight tier.
Apixaban will be administered during approximately 28 days of ind uction chemotherapy including 
asparaginase.
1.3 Research Hypothesis 
Administration of prophylactic apixaban, orally or via a nasoga stric or gastric tube (NGT, GT), 
during induction chemotherapy w ill reduce the risk of ve nous thromboembolism 
(symptomatic + asymptomatic), compared to no syste mic anticoagulant prophylaxis, during 
induction chemotherapy in children with newly diagnosed ALL or lymphoblastic lymphoma (T or B 
cell)treated with asparaginase.

(eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be pr ovided to subjects. The investigator 
or BMS should also provi de the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Inves tigator Brochure or product 
labeling information to be provided to subjects and any updates . The investigator or BMS should 
provide the IRB/IEC with re ports, updates and other i nformation (eg, expedited safety reports, 
amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory  requirements or institution 
procedures.
2.3 Informed Consent
Investigators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully i nformed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other critical issues regardi ng clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about th e purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate.
BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Loc al) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements re quired by ICH, G CP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to th e ethical principles that have 
their origin in the D eclaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information abo ut the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study pa rticipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally accepta ble representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by the  subject or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the i nformed consent discussion. 
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opinion of th e written informed consent form 
and any other information to be provided to the subjects, prior  to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally  acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of makin g and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new informatio n becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a perso n designated by the investigator, 
should fully  inform the s ubject or the subject's legally accept able representative or legal 
g u a r d i a n ,  o f  a l l  p e r ti n e n t  a s p e c t s  o f  t h e  s t u d y  a n d  o f  a n y  n e w  information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects mus t be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory requirements , the subjects' signed ICF and, in the

US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Au thorization. The consent form must also include a statement 
that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct access to subje ct records. 
For minors, according to local legislation, one or both parents  or a legally acceptable representative 
must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the info rmed consent form approved for 
the study prior to clinical study participation. The explicit w ish of a minor, who is capable of 
forming an opinion and assessing this information t o refuse participation in, or to be withdrawn 
from, the clinical study at any time should be considered by th e investigator. 
Minors who are judged to be of an age  of reason as determined b y local requirement should also 
give their assent. The assent should be documented based on local requirements.
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study subjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
Children and adolescents with newly diagnosed ALL or lymphoblas tic lymphoma (T or B cell) 
treated with asparagi nase will be eligible for this randomized, open-label, study. The subjects on 
the apixaban arm will receive study drug during approximately 2 8 days of induction chemotherapy
including asparaginase. The study sample size is approximately 5 00 randomized patients.
Design
The study is designed to compare the effect of prophylactic ora l or enteric apixaban versus no
systemic anticoagulant during approximately 28 days of induction c hemotherapy on the composite 
endpoint of adj udicated non-f atal deep vein throm boses (DVT, inc luding symptomatic and 
asymptomatic), pulmonary embolism (PE), and CVST; and VTE-relat ed-death in subjects (1 to 
< 18 years) with newly diagnosed  ALL or lym phoblastic lymphomas ( T or B cell), a functioning 
CVAD and receiving asparaginase during planned 3-4 drug systemic chemotherapy induction.
There are four study periods extending up to a maximum total of  approximately five weeks in 
duration:
•a screening period between Day -7 to Day 4 ±3 days of planned 3-4 dr ug systemic induction 
chemotherapy prior to randomization
•Note: Screening labs done as part of standard of care prior to signing the informed consent can 
be used to determine eligibility as long as they were obtained w ithin 1 week prior to enrollment
•Day 1 is defined as the fi rst day of pl anned 3- 4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy
•a randomization period occurring between Days 1 to 4±3 of planne d 3-4 drug systemic 
induction chemotherapy
•a treatment period, starting with the day of rando mization, and extending th rough 
Day 29 ±5 days of planned 3-4 drug systemic i nduction chemotherapy. Subjects ≥5 years will 
be administered either 2.5 mg, 0.5 mg tablets or oral solution as per Table 1.2-2 . Subjects < 5 
years and < 35 kg will be admin istered 0.5 mg tablets as per  Figure 3.1-1 .

5) Chronic d aily use of nonste roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSA IDs, eg, naproxen, ibuprofen, 
diclofenac) may increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, concom itant use of NSAIDS more 
than 7 days is prohibited.
During the entire study period, no other investigational agents , other than apixaban should be 
administered to the patient.
Note:   Fluconazole, topical azole antifungal agents, trimethoprim-su lfamethoxazole, 
H2-antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are permitted.3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
Based on pre-clinical and clinical data, apixaban might increas e the likelihood of bleeding. Hence, 
subjects with  platelet counts < 20,000 /microL, undergoing a lumbar puncture, or having surgical 
procedures, including a bone marro w aspirate and dental procedu res should be instructed to inform 
their doctors about these procedures, and proper cautions shoul d be taken by the investigator to 
reduce potential risk of bleeding (see  Section 4.5.2 for instruction).
Apixaban should not be administered if the platelet count is < 2 0,000/ microL. A subject may be 
transfused platelets per investigator’s clinical judgement but may not be transfused solely to m eet 
entry criteria.
3.4.3 Supportive Care Guidelines
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, an tiemetics, fluids, e lectrolytes and general supportive 
care are to be used as medically indicated.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discontinue investigational product (and non-inve stigational product at the 
discretion of the investigator) for a ny of the following reasons:
•Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s or guardian’s decisio n to withdraw for any reason).
•Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality or inte rcurrent illness which, in the 
opinion of the investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best 
interest of the subject
•Pregnancy
•Termination of the study by Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) / Pfizer
•Loss of ability to freely provide c onsent through imprisonment or involuntary i ncarceration for 
treatment of either a psych iatric  or physical (eg, infectious d isease) illness
•CVAD is lost before the Day 29 ±5 end-of-study evaluation due to endpoint related events 
(eg, VTE, serious bleeding)
•Major bleeding event
•Thromboembolic event such as DVT, PE, CVST or arterial thromboe mbolic event.

In the case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately not ify the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event. In most cases, the study drug w ill be permanently discontinued in 
an appropriate manner. If the investigator determines a possibl e favorable benefit/risk ratio that 
warrants continuation of study drug, a discussion between the i nvestigator and the BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee must occur.
All subjects who discontinue study drug (ie, are off protocol t herapy), including discontinuation 
due to thromboembolic or major b leeding event, or loss of catheter before the Day 29 ±5
end-of-study evaluation because of achieving a primary e ndpoint, should comply with protocol 
specified follow-up procedures as outlined in  Section 5 . Every attempt should be made to have the 
study-related radiographic procedures, Ultrasound and Echocardi ogram performed within 
72 hours of the event regardless  of receiving apixaban or not, a nd the telephone or in-person safety 
assessment completed on Day 35 ±5D a y s .  
If the catheter is to be removed and replaced within 48 hours d ue to events other than a primary 
endpoint event (eg, VTE or major bleeding), the subject should n ot have the study mandated 
ultrasound and echocardiogram until Day 29 visit and should con tinue with the study tr eatment 
(for temporary apixaban interruptions related to an invasive procedure, see  Table 4.5.2-1 ).
Once any study-specified thromboembolic or any major b leeding event endpoint occurs, every 
effort must be made to confirm a suspected thromboembolic or bl eeding event before removing a 
subject from protocol therapy. This applies to all subjects reg ardless of receiving apixaban or not. 
Management of any asymptomatic or symptomatic events will be ac cording to the local standards 
of practice. If study medication i s discontinued for a suspecte d thromboembolic event, alternative 
anti-thrombotic therapy may be initiated per the Investigator’s  discretion and standard of care.
The only exception to this requirement is when a subject withdr aws consent for all st udy 
procedures including post-treatment st udy follow-up or loses the ability to consent fr eely 
(ie, is imprisoned or involuntar ily incarcerate d for the treatmen t of either a psychiatric or physical 
illness).
If study drug is discontinued prior to the subject’s completion o f the study, the reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical rec ords and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.Emergency procedures
If a subject requires an emergency procedure or surgery that re quires immediate knowledge of the 
subject’s hemostatic status, the study medication s hould be disc ontinued. The treating physician 
should be informed about the specifics of apixaban administrati on such as timing and dosage. It is 
also important to let the treating doctor know that routine coagulation tests such as INR/PT and 
aPTT are relatively insensitive measures of anticoagulant effec t and are unsuitable for monitoring 
the anticoagulant effect of apixaban. No specific antidote with  an approved pediatric indication 
exists for apixaban reversal and apixaban is not substantially re moved from systemic circulation 
by dialysis. In the event of apixaban-related hemorrhage, the u se of prothrombin complex 
concentrate (PCC), activated prot hrombin complex concentrate, o r recombinant factor VIIa may 
be considered. The use of activated oral charcoal may be consid ered if ingestion occurred within

activity of apixaban. 
Temporary treatment interruptions are addressed in Section 4.5.2 .

In this study, the presence or absence of thromboembolism at Day 29 is a key endpoint of the 
study. Post treatment study follow-up on Day 35 ±5 days of chemotherapy is important and is 
essential to preserving subject safety a nd the integrit y of the study. Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment must continue to be followed for co llection of serious adverse event follow-up data as 
required and in line with Section 5 until death or resolution of the event.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discontinue protocol treatment will rema in on study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The on ly exception to this is when a 
subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorize d by the subject to provide this information. Subjects should no tify the investigator of the 
decision to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medi cal records by the investigator, as 
to whether the withdra wal is from further tr eatment with study drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study follow-up, and entered o n the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vital status (whether the subject i s alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
information should be used to determine vital status only as ap propriately directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow-Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to deter mine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up with  persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow-up 
is defined by the inability t o reach the subject after a minimu m of three documented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject t o one registered mail letter. All attempts 
should be  documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is  determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If the investigator’s use of a thi rd-party representative to ass ist in the follow-up portion of the study 
has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the i nvestigator may use a Sponsor-
retained third-party representative to assist site staff with o btaining the subject’s contact 
information or other public vital status data necessary to comp lete the follow-up portion of the 
study. The site staff and representative will consult publicly a vailable sources, such as public 
health registr ies and databases, in order to obtain updated con tact information. If after all attempts, 
the subject remains lost to fo llow-up, then the last known aliv e date as determined by the 
investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.

4 STUDY DRUGS
Study drugs include both Non-investigational (NIMP) and Investi gational Medicinal Products 
(IMP) and can consist of the following:
•All products, active or placebo, being tested or used as a comp arator in a clinical trial. 
•Study required pre medication, and 
•Other drugs administered as part of the study that are critical  to claims of efficacy 
(eg, background therapy, rescue medications)
•Diagnostic agents: (such as glucose for glucose challenge) give n as part of the protocol 
requirements must also be incl uded in the dosing data collectio n.
4.1 Investigational Product
An investigational product, als o known as investigational medic inal product in some regions, is 
defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, i ncluding products already with a marketing authorization but used 
or assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the auth orized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further informati on about the authorized form.
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investiga tional product is only dispensed to 
study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed o nly from official study sites by 
authorized personnel according to local regulations. 
In this study, investigational product is apixaban (ie, BMS-5622 47) in tablets and oral solution.
Apixaban will be provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb and is descri bed in Table 4.1-1.

4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used in the study for preventative, dia gnostic, or therapeutic reasons, as 
components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, are c onsidered non-investigational 
products and will not be supplied by the sponsor.
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager should ensure that the study drug i s stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the quality or appearance of the study drug arise, th e study drug should not be dispensed 
and BMS should be contacted immediately.
Investigational  product documen tation must be maintained that includes all processes required to 
ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes documentation of drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, recons titution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
4.4 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
At enrollment, each subject will be assigned a unique sequentia l number by the Interactive Voice 
Response System (IVRS). The IVRS will be available 24 hours per  day, seven days a week. The 
subject number will consist of a u nique 5 digit number which is  assigned sequentially within a 
study (starting with 00001) by the IVRS. This number will be us ed for identification throughout 
the study and will not be used for any other subject.
Patients will be randomized to apixaban or usual care (no syste mic anticoagulant) in a 1:1 ratio by 
the IVRS. Randomization schedules will be generated and kept by  Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
Randomization will be str atified by age groups as < 10 years or ≥10 to < 18 years, to reflect the 
major peaks of disease prevalence and risk stratification criter ia for acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) in children.40,58,59.
4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
A phased recruitment for this study has been done, based on the in formed dose selection from the 
single dose PK/PD study. Recruitment began for children of ages 2 to < 18 years. Subsequently, 
enrollment for children 1 to < 2 y ears has started given that the  dose selectio n by the s ponsor  
has been 
completed and endorsed by the DMC. This protocol update include s dosing for children > or equal 
to 1 year of age.
Subjects 1 to <18 years of age will be administered apixaban tw ice daily by mo uth or via a NGT 
or GT according to weight range as per below Table 1.2-2 during approximately 28 days of 
induction chemotherapy including asparaginase.

Study medication must be initiated prior to or within 12 hours o f the first dose of asparaginase or 
by Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy, whichever  is first. Dose 
modifications of study medication are not permitted. Patients m ay start their study medication at 
the same time each day.Missed dose : If a dose is missed the sub ject should take t he study medication immediately and 
then continue with twice daily administration as before. A doub le dose should not be taken to make 
up for a missed dose. Subjects may take a missed dose up to 6 ho urs after the normal dosing time. 
If it is greater than 6 hours from the normal dosing time, the dose should not be taken. Instead, the 
next scheduled dose should be taken at the normal dosing t ime.
Vomiting/regurgitation : If a subject vomits or regurgitates within 30 minutes of inges tion of the 
study drug, re-dosing is allowed and the study drug can be give n again one time. If the subject 
vomits/regurgitates more than 30 mi nutes after study drug ingest ion, no additional study drug 
should be taken and the subject s hould resume study drug ingestion according to the usual 
schedule.

4.5.2 Temporary Treatment Interruptions
During the course of the study, situations might occur in which the investigator considers a 
temporary interruption of study drug treatment necessary. For ex ample, a lumbar puncture, a 
planned catheter replacement, a scheduled surgical procedure, oc currence of thrombocytopenia or 
elevated liver function tests. The treating physician s hould be i nformed about timi ng and dosage 
of apixaban administration at such circumstances. It is importan t to let the treating physician know 
that routine coagulation tests such as INR/PT and aPTT are rela tively insensitive measures of 
activity and therefore may be unsuitable for monitoring. Dose interruptions for selected events are 
described in the table below ( Table 4.5.2-1 ). For treatment interruptions ≥48 consecutive hours,
the period of interruption should be noted and the investigator sh ould document on the CRF the 
time and date of discontinuation and restart of therapy, as well  as the reason for discontinuation 
and measures taken to correct the event, excluding protocol man dated interruptions. An AE/SAE 
should be reported if applicable. For an individual subject, do se interruptions and tr eatment 
discontinuation may be more or less conservative than ind icated below in Table 4.5.2-1 based on 
the clinical judgment of the investigator. Note that discontinua tion of subjects from tr eatment is 
addressed in Section 3.5
Apixaban should not be administered if the platelet count is < 2 0,000/ microL. A subject may be 
transfused platelets per investigator’s clinical judgement but may not be transfused solely to m eet 
entry criteria.
Note: Once enrolled in th e study, decisions to transfuse to mai ntain platelet counts ≥20,000/ 
microL or to interrupt study medications should platelet counts  fall < 20,000 microL is left to the 
discretion of the clin ician as to what is best available care fo r patients.

Table 4.5.2-1: Temporary Dose Interruptions for Apixaban
Event Apixaban
Lumbar punctures 
(LPs)Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to any plan ned lumbar puncture 
(LP) ie, there should be at least 24 hours between the last dose of apixaban and the planned 
LP. Apixaban should be resumed no sooner than 18 - 24 hours after t he procedure. In the 
event of a traumatic lumbar puncture (defined in this protocol as a lumbar puncture with 
≥10 red blood cells (RBCs)/ μL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)60, apixaban should be held 
for 48 hours after the procedure.
For example: for a LP scheduled on the morning of Day 8 :
1. Discontinue apixaban for at leas t 24 hours prior to the Day 8 Lum bar Puncture (hold 
apixaban the night before and the morning of the procedure, the  Day 7 PM and Day 8 
AM and PM doses of apixaban).
2. Resume apixaban 18-24 hours after the Day 8 AM Lumbar Puncture (resume 
apixaban with the AM dose on the day after the procedure, Day 9) .
Recommend participating institutions follow local standards of care regarding minimum 
platelet thresholds prior to lumbar punctures.
In the event of a traumatic lumbar puncture (defined in this protocol as a lumbar puncture 
with ≥10 red blood cells (RBCs)/μL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), apix aban should be held 
for 48 hours after the procedure.
The last dose of apixa ban will be on Day 29 ±5 of induction chemotherapy.
Lumbar punctures for study subjects should only be performed by  trained personnel.
Scheduled surgical 
proceduresIf a subject participating in the study requires an elective pr ocedure or surgery, the 
following considerations should be taken into account: The effe ctive half-life of apixaban 
when administered twice daily is approximately 12 hours and it is expected that most of the 
anticoagulation effect will be gone within 24 hours after the l ast dose of the drug. Apixaban 
must be stopped for a sufficient period of time (eg, at least 24  hours if low risk of bleeding 
and at least 48 hours for moderate or high risk of bleeding) pr ior to the procedure to 
minimize the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. The treati ng physician should be made 
aware of the time and dosage of apixaban administration and be informed that routine 
coagulation tests such as INR/PT and aPTT are relatively insens itive measures of 
anticoagulation activity and are unsuitable for monitoring the anticoagulation effect of 
apixaban. The subject will re-start study medication once hemos tasis is secure and when, in 
the opinion of the investigator, it is safe to do so. 
Thrombocytopenia.
An AE/SAE 
should be reported if applicableA platelet count should be ≥20 × 10
9per L within 24 hours of starting apixaban. There are 
no evidence-based guidelines for anticoagulation therapy in rel ation to platelet counts. In 
absence of any other coagulopathy, following guidelines are recommended during the course of the study period:
•Full-dose apixaban therapy for patients with platelet count ≥20×10
9per L.
•Withhold apixaban for platelet count < 20×109per L. Platelet transfusions can be given 
per the investigator’s clinical judgement.
It is important to maximize thromboprophylaxis therapy. In some circumstances, 
physicians may choose to give platelet transfusions prior to anticoagulation to maximize 
anticoagulation exposure in patients with thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of platelet
count and careful watching for signs of bleeding are necessary. Depending on anticipated drop in platelet count, the platelet counts should be checked at least twice a week and

apixaban should be re-started only after platelets are ≥20 × 109per L OR after a platelet 
transfusion that is predicted to increase the platelet count to this threshold according to 
clinical judgment.
Elevated liver 
function tests.
An AE/SAE 
should be reported 
if applicableIf at any time during the treatment period a subject’s liver function test (LFT) results show:
An isolated elevation of either SGPT (ALT)/SGOT (AST) ≥10 x ULN AND/OR a direct 
(conjugated) bilirubin > 3 x ULN, obtain the following laborator ies: ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, CK as s oon as possible (ie, within 3 
days). 
If the repeat tests indicate:
1) ALT/AST < 10 x ULN and conjugated bilirubin ≤3 x ULN, study medication may 
continue.
2) If the repeat ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN AND/OR the conjugated bilirubin is > 3 x ULN, the 
study medication must be discontinued .
The study medication must be discontinued if:
Clinical jaundice is present for a subject at any time
OR
If ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN on any two consecutive occasions
OR
Conjugated bilirubin > 3 x ULN on any two consecutive occasions.
All subjects with an ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 3 x ULN will be followed 
weekly until ALT/AST returns to < 3 x ULN or to baseline , and the conjugated bilirubin 
returns to ≤1.5 x ULN or to baseline . 
If study medication is discontinued due to elevated ALT/AST OR BILIRUBIN, as defined 
above, inform the medical Monitor and Study Director and perform the following:
-PT, aPTT, fibrinogen to assess liver synthetic function-Abdominal ultrasound, including liver and hepatobiliary system
-Hepatitis screen (anti-HAV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti -HCV.
Obtain relevant specialist consultation.
4.7 Treatment Compliance
Each time study
 medication is dispensed, compliance will be rei nforced. 
For inpatients, apix aban will be a dministered in the clinical fa cility under the supervision of 
clinical staff. The date, time and volume or dosage of administ ered drug will be rec orded at the 
clinical site by clinical personnel in the patient’s diary and eCRF. If an infant or a young child 
regurgitates a portion of or the entire drug product during or a fter administration, this should be 
recorded in the eCRF.

At each study visit, the patient/parents should bring the study  medication and compliance will be 
assessed based upon subject’s/parents interview and a count of the tablets or volume of solution 
returned. Compliance should be between ≥80% and ≤120% of that prescribed, excluding the 
protocol defined dose interrupti on period. The investigator (or  designee) will record the amounts 
of study medication dispensed and returned at each visit, as we ll as document reasons for 
non-compliance in the source document. The dates of all study m edication dosing, including 
interruptions, missed doses or overdose, must be recorded on th e eCRF. If a subject is not ≥80% 
compliant after exclusion of the protocol defined dose interrupt ion period, then the period of 
noncompliance s hould be noted as a protocol deviation and the sponsor should be notified. The 
subject should be re-educated regarding recording these values.
4.8 Destruction and Return of Study Drug
4.8.1 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study, study drugs (those supplied by BMS or sourced b y the investigator) such as partially 
used study drug containers, vials and syringes may be destroyed  on site. Any unused study drugs 
can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by t he responsible BMS Study Monitor 
unless study drug containers must be immediately destroyed as required for safety, or to meet lo cal 
regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal st andards are met:
•On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from  the drug.
•On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agr eement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
•Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and follo wed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provided t o BMS upon request.
•Records are maintain ed that allow for traceability of each cont ainer, including the date 
disposed of, quantity disposed, and identif ication of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
•Accountability and disposal records are complete, up-to-date, a nd available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If conditions for destruction ca nnot be met the r esponsible BMS  Study Monitor will make 
arrangements for return of study drug. It is the investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal 
of all empty containers, provided that procedures for proper di sposal have been established 
according to applicable federal, s tate, local, and institutional guidelines and procedures, and 
provided that a ppropriate records of disposal are kept.
4.8.2 Return of Study Drug
If study drug will not be destroyed upon completion or terminat ion of the study, all unused and/or 
partially used st udy drug that was supplied by BMS must be retu rned to BMS. The return of study 
drug will be arranged by the responsible BMS Study Monitor. It is the investigator’s responsibility

No study-related procedure may be performed until the subject o r their legally acceptable 
representative has been completely informed of the study, has f reely consented to take part in the 
study, and has signed and d ated an i nformed consent document, and where appropri ate assent form, 
approved by a licensed Institutional Board Review (IRB) or Inde pendent Ethics Committee (IEC). 
Every attempt s hould be made to coordinate the study-related visits with the s ubjects’ medical 
visits. 
The Screening Period will occur after consent is obtained between Day -7 to Day 4 ±3 of planned 
3-4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy, and will begin with a sc reening visit. Screening labs 
as part of the standard of care can be used prior to signing th e informed consent. At the screening 
visit the IVRS system will be con tacted to obtain a unique sub ject number. A complete medical 
history and a physical examination including vital signs, heigh t, BP, and body weight, will be 
obtained. The screening visit laboratory studies will include: CBC with plat elets, ALT, AST, 
conjugated bilirubin, WBC and RBC in CSF (LP prior to receiving study medication), and serum 
creatinine (estimated GFR), PT (if available), aPTT, and INR and  serum or urine pregnancy test 
for FRP.
For all FRP that will be inpatients from consenting to the firs t dose of apixaban, it is expected that 
a negative pregnancy test be recorded in the subject’s hospital  chart at any time point from the 
time of hospitalization but prior to first treatment.
All FRP that will be treated as outpatients from consenting to the first dose of apixaban, must have 
a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 2 5 IU/L or equivalent units of 
HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.
Day 1 is defined as the fi rst day of pl anned 3- 4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy.
The Randomization visit will occur between Day 1 and Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic 
induction chemotherapy. For pediatric subjects who meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the 
IVRS system will be contacted and the subjects will be randomiz ed. 
Pediatric subjects ra ndomized to apixaban will receive instructions about the study drug. If 
conditions for apixaban administration are met, study medicatio n must be initiated prior to or 
within 12 hours of the first dose of asparaginase or by Day 4 ±3 of planned 3-4 drug systemic 
induction chemotherapy whichever is first. Day 1 is the first da y of planned 3-4 drug systemic 
induction ALL chemotherapy. For a subject who experiences a reaction to asparaginase during  the infusion and has to switch to 
Erwinia Asparaginase during the induction chemotherapy, it is r ecommended that the subject
continue the study treatment. The percentage of the  original Asparaginase dose delivered w ill be 
recorded in the patient charter.
The screening and randomization visits can be done on the same day if the subject is eligible by 
medical history, clinical exam, and has local laboratory result s that are within the appropriate 
inclusive parameters.

Day 7 ± 5 of chemotherapy visit: For all consenting sub jects rando mized to apixaban who are 
inpatients on Day 7 ± 5 of planned 3-4 drug systemic induction chemotherapy, a pre- and post-
dose PK and anti-FXa sample may be taken on the same day, for exam ple, prior to the Day 7 ± 5
AM dose of apixaban, followed by a PK and anti-FXa sample taken 1 - 4h after the AM dose of 
apixaban.
Subjects who are not able to provide a pre and post dose sample  on the same day (eg, those who 
are outpatients) will have a PK and anti FXa sample collected o n separate occasions, for example 
once on Day 8 ±5 and once on Day 15 ±5. Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and dir ect 
(conjugated) bilirubin, RBC in CSF, adverse event data co llection and concomitant therapy 
assessment will be performed.
Day 8 ±5 of chemotherapy visit:   The Day 8 visit is required only if the Day 7 visit can’t be 
completed. Local CBC with platelet s, ALT, AST, and direct (conju gated) bilirubin, RBC in CSF, 
adverse event data collection and concomitant therapy assessmen t will be performed unless they 
were performed on day  7 for inpatients.
Subjects who are randomized to apixaban and did not have a pre- and post- dose sample collected 
on the same day (eg, those who are outpatients), will have a PK and anti-FXa sample collected on 
separate days, for example, on either Day 8 ±5 prior to LP procedures and within 24 hours of the 
subjects last apixaban dose.
Day 15 ±5 of chemotherapy visit: Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and direct (conjugated) 
bilirubin, adverse event data collection and concomitant therap y assessment will be performed.
Subjects who are randomized to apixaban and did not have a pre- and post- dose sample collected 
on the same day (eg, those who are outpatients), will have a PK and anti-FXa sample collected on 
separate days, for example, on Day 15 ±5 of chemotherapy, 0.5 to 12 hr after the AM dose of 
apixaban (and prior to the PM dose on that day).
Day 22 ±5 of chemotherapy visit: Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and direct (conjugated) 
bilirubin, adverse event data collection and concomitant therap y assessment will be performed. 
Day 29 ±5 of chemotherapy visit: Local CBC with platelets, ALT, AST, and direct (conjugated) 
bilirubin, RBC in CSF, adverse event data collection and concomi tant therapy assessment will be 
performed.
On the Day 29 visit, the imaging evaluation will occur for all randomized subjects who remain on 
protocol therapy. For those subjects randomized to apixaban, ima ging evaluations will be 
performed preferably within 3 days but no more than 5 days of d iscontinuing apixaban. For those 
subjects randomized to the standard of care arm, imaging evalua tions will be performed within 3 
days but no more than 5 days from Day 29 (Day 24 to Day 34). The  evaluation will include a 
bilateral Doppler ultrasound that w ill include imagi ng of the ve nous system in which the CVAD 
is placed and an echocardiogram to assess for right atrial thro mbi according to the protocol 
guidance in appendices 1  and 2 . Subjects will not undergo routine radiologic screening for CV ST.

Evaluations to be performed at clinical suspicion of VTE or oth er off protoc ol therapy 
criteria including catheter loss: All subjects who discontinue investigational product due to 
events such as thromboembolic or major b leeding event, or catheter loss before the Day 29 ±5
end-of-study evaluation shoul d remain on study. Every effort must be made to confirm a suspected 
thromboembolic or bleeding event prior to removal from protocol  therapy.
Additional clinical and radiologic evaluations prompted by clin ical suspicion of any DVT, PE, 
CVST, arterial thrombo embolic events, b leeding or death w ill be performed at the discretion of 
the treating clinician; and information from these visits and i maging findings will be captured for 
study analysis. Management of any  asymptomatic or symptomatic e vents will be according to the 
local standards of practice. If study medication is discontinue d for a suspected VTE event, 
alternative anti-thrombotic therapy may be initiated per the In vestigator’s discretion and standard 
of care. 
It is critical for all patients (SOC and apixaban) that every attempt should be made to have the 
study-related radiographic procedures, Ultraso und and Echocardiogram, performed within 72 
hours of the event and the follow-up safety assessment completed on Day 35 ±±5.
If the catheter is to be removed, it is preferred that the diagn ostic imaging procedures be performed 
prior to the catheter removal.
Day 35 ±5 of chemotherapy visit: Telephone or in person follow up safety assessment w ill be 
scheduled on Day 35 ±3 for all sub jects. In this assessment, adverse event data co llection and 
concomitant therapy assessment will be obtained.
5.1.1 Retesting During Screening
Retesting of laboratory parameters and/or other assessments dur ing the Screening period will not 
be permitted, except PT, aPTT and INR (this does not include pa rameters that require a 
confirmatory result).
Any new result will override the previous result (ie, the most current result prior to randomization) 
and is the value by which study inclusion will be assessed, as it represents the subject’s, most 
current clinical state.

5.3 Safety Assessments
Informed consent must be obtained pri or to any study screening procedures that would not have 
been performed as part of normal subject care. Screening activi ties should be conducted within 
14 days prior to randomization to either thromboprophylaxis with apixaban or no 
thromboprophylaxis.
A platelet count should be performed within 24 hours prior to t he start of apixaban therapy.
End of treatment visit must be completed on Day 29 ±5 days of induction chemotherapy and will 
be performed after:
•Completion of  approximately 28 days of induction chemotherapy in subjects.
•Subject withdrawal from the study as per any of the reasons lis ted in  Section 3.5 .
Any additional medical testing and procedures, whether more fre quent or in addition to those 
described, should be performed as medically indicated.
Any safety events occurring after consent and up to Day 35 ±5 should be sent for adjudication.
5.3.1 Bleeding Assessment
Major bleeding is defined as bleeding satisfies one or more of the following cr iteria: (i) fatal 
bleeding; (ii) clinically overt bleeding associated with a decr ease in Hgb of at least 20 g/L (2 g/dL) 
in a 24 - h period; (iii) bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmo nary, intracranial, or otherwise 
involves the central nervous system; and (iv) bleeding that requ ires surgical intervention in an 
operating suite (including interventional radiol ogy).
Clinically relevant non-major b leeding is defined as bleeding satisfies one or both of the 
following: (i) overt bleeding for which a blood product is admi nistered and which is not directly 
attributable to the patient’s underlying medical condition and (ii) bleeding that requires medical or 
surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an o perating suite.
Minor bleeding: is defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfill 
the above criteria for either major bleeding or clinically rele vant, non-major bleeding.
Menstrual bleeding resulting in a medical cons ultation and/or i ntervention will be classified as a 
minor bleeding event.
All bleeding events and their supporting documentation MUST be sent for adjudication.
5.3.2 Treatment guidelines for Bleeding / Suspected Bleeding
Patients with bleeding or suspected bleeding s hould undergo confirmatory laboratory or other 
testing as indicated clinically (eg, compression Ultrasound (US ), Computer Tomography (CT), 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The date and time of the onset  of the bleeding event will be 
recorded on the CRF. The following routine measures may be cons idered:

Table 5.3.2-1: Treatment Guidelines for Bleeding / Suspected Ble eding
Minor Bleeding Apixaban may or may not be held based on an individualized bene fit-risk assessment
Clinically Significant 
BleedingApixaban should be held if subject meets criteria outlined in  section 3.5 .
•Identify of the source and institute local measures to stop the  bleeding.
•Perform laboratory test monitoring (eg, hemoglobin, INR, aPTT, p latelet count, 
anti-Factor Xa activity).
•Apixaban may be best monitored using an anti-Factor Xa assay rather than the more 
standard coagulation tests (eg, INR, aPTT) which are less sensitive to apixaban.
•If bleeding occurs up to 6 hours after apixaban administration consider 
administration of activated charcoal oral solution to reduce ap ixaban plasma 
exposure.
•Consider appropriate symptomatic treatment (eg, mechanical compression, surgical 
intervention, fluid replacement and hemodynamic support, blood product or 
component transfusion)
•For bleeding that does not respond to local measures, consider administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as a supportive measure, recognizing that FFP does not 
reverse the anticoagulant effects of apixaban
Life Threatening 
BleedingApixaban should be held for all life threatening bleeding or if subject meets criteria 
outlined in section 3.5 .
•Administration of recombinant Factor VIIa may be considered, however, there is no experience with this agent in apixaban-treated patients. Its ef fectiveness for 
counteracting the effects of apixaban is not known.
•Activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or prothrombin  complex 
concentrate (PCC, also referred to as factor IX concentrate) are other procoagulants that may be considered, but considering the variety of formulat ions available and the 
complexity of dosing, the decision to employ aPCC or PCC should be made by an experienced clinician with careful evaluation of the risks and benefits.
•If bleeding occurs up to 6 hours after apixaban administration activated charcoal oral solution administration may be considered in order to reduce apixaban plasma exposure.
•Delay the next dose of study drug or discontinue study medicati on if indicated
•Fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion as indicated
•Fresh frozen plasma or general hemostatic measures as indicated
•There is no specific reversal agent for apixaban approved in the pediatric population

5.3.3 Laboratory Assessments 
B
lood samples will be obtained on selected visits of clin ical labora tory evaluations as outlined in 
Section 5.1 (Table 5.1-1 and Table 5.1-2 - Flow chart/ Time and Events Schedule). A local 
laboratory should perform the analyses and w ill provide reference ranges for these tests. The 
following laboratory tests are required for this study, and sho uld be analyzed by the local 
laboratory: CBC with platelets, serum creatinine, ALT, AST, and C onjugated Bilirubin, WBC and 
RBC in CSF (WBC at Day 1 Screen onl y), PT (if available), aPTT, IN R (or thrombin time or 
Reptilase) and pregnancy test when a pplicable. The PK and PD assessment will be analyzed by a 
third party laboratory. For these laboratory assessments, mater ials and detailed instructions for 
specimen collection, processing, storage and shipment will be p rovided in special kits and will be 
described in a separate laboratory manual. 
5.3.4 Pregnancy tests
For females of reproductive potential (FRP), a serum or urine p regnancy test should have a 
minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of βHCG. All  on-study pregnancy testing 
should follow the schedule detailed in  Table 5.1-1 .
5.3.5 Creatinine Clearance
Based on the results of the enrollment visit clinical laborator y tests, eGFR will be estimated based 
on the Schwartz formula (See  Table 5.1-1 for timing of assessments and Appendix 13 for eGFR 
assessment).

eGFR]. Subjects are require d to have an eGFR > 30% of normal for age and size to be enrolled in 
the study.
5.3.6 Physical Examination
A full physical examination s hould include general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throa t, neck, 
cardiovascular, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, neuro logical, skin, mu sculoskeletal, 
vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, bl ood pressure), height and weight, as well as assessment 
of central nervous system status (CNS 1, CNS2, CNS 3).
A targeted physical examination should include any organ systems pertinent to the subject’s signs, 
symptoms, or adverse events, such as assessment of signs of venous thromboembolism or 
bleeding .
Only Investigators licensed to conduct physical examinations an d who are listed on the 
Delegation of Authority Form are approved to perform physical examinations.
5.3.7 Treatment Guidelines for Thrombocytopenia
The platelet count should be ≥20 x 109per L within 24 hours of starting apixaban. There are no 
evidence-based guidelines for anticoagulation therapy in relati on to platelet counts. In the absence 
of any other coagulopathy, the following guidelines are recomme nded during the course of the 
study period:
•Full-dose apixaban therapy  for patients with platelet count ≥20 x 109per L.
•Hold apixaban for platelet count < 20 x 109per L and restart when platelet count ≥2 0x1 09
per L or presumed to be above this threshold following a pl atelet transfusion.
It is important to maximize the thromboprophylaxis therapy. In some circumstances, physicians 
may choose to give platelet tran sfusions prior to anticoagulati on to maximize the anticoagulation 
in patients with t hrombocytopenia. If at all possible, it is pr eferred to have as much uninterrupted 
anticoagulation as possible duri ng the treatment period. A clos e monitoring of platelet count and 
careful watching for signs of bleeding are necessary. For subjec ts with a platelet count < 20 x 109
per L or with platelet counts anticipated to drop to below 20 x 109per L, the platelet counts should 
be checked at least twice a week and apixaban should be re-started only after platelets are ≥20×109
per L OR after a platelet transfusion that is predicted to incr ease the platelet count beyond this 
threshold.
5.4 Efficacy Assessments
The primary efficacy assessment of the study is a composite of n on-fatal asymptomatic and
symptomatic DVT, PE, and CVST; and VTE-related-death objectivel y confirmed by independent 
adjudication. All components of  the primary efficacy e ndpoint w ill be adjudicated by a blinded, 
independent adjudication committee.
Any suspected efficacy clinical events occurring after consent and up to Day 35 ±5 should be sent

Details for the assessment of the components of the primary eff icacy endpoint are  provided in 
Appendices 3 , 4 and 5.
5.4.1 Imaging assessment for the study
On Day 29 ±3 days, the imaging evaluation will occur for all randomized subjects who remain 
on protocol therapy. For subjects in the apixaban treatment arm, Doppler ultrasound and 
echocardiogram should be performed within 3 days (not exceed 5 days) after termination of 
the study medication including early discontinuation. For those s ubjects randomized to the 
standard of care arm, imaging evaluations will be performed with in 3 days but no more than 
5 days from the Day 29 visit or early discontinuation from the s tudy.
The evaluation will include a b ilateral Doppler  ultrasound that  will include imaging of the venous 
system in which the CVAD is placed and an echocardiogram to assess for right atrial thrombi according to the protocol guidance in appendices 1  and 2. The Doppler ultrasound should be 
performed for both the i psilateral (extremity in which the CVAD was placed) and the contralateral 
sides whenever possible. If there is a difficulty in performing  the imaging procedure, Doppler 
ultrasound from the ipsilateral side alone is acceptable (see Appendix 1  for detailed guidance). 
Subjects will not undergo routine radiologic screening for CVST.
A chest X-ray is not mandated by the study. However, if a chest  X-ray has been performed as part 
of the standard of care, the che st X-ray should be submitted as  part of the adjudication package.
5.5 Pharmacokinetic and Anti-Xa Assessments
PK and anti-Xa assessments will only be performed for patients randomized to the apixaban arm. 
Table 5.5-1 summarizes the sampling collection schedule to be followed for t hese assessments. 
Sparse samples for PK and PD (anti-FXa activity) w ill be taken in sub jects receiving apixaban. 
Pre-dose and post dose samples of apixaban may be taken on the same  day if feasible (eg, in-
patients). Alternatively samples may be collected on separate day s (eg, out-patients), for example, 
subjects may have the pre-dose sample taken before the LP proced ures and the post-dose sample 
taken on an alternate visit.
The date and time of apixaban administration must be recorded f or the dose immediately before 
PK/anti-FXa sample collection. Whenever possible PK/PD samples should be collected at the 
same time as the clinical la boratory assessments and may be drawn through the CVAD. Further  
sample collection and processing instructions will be provided separately.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
Importance of Adverse Event Reporting
Timely 
and comp lete re porting of s afety information assists BMS in identifying any untoward 
medical occurrence, thereby allowing: (1) protection of safety of study patients; (2) a greater 
understanding of the overall safety profile of the investigatio nal product; (3) recognition of 
dose-related investigational product toxicity; (4) appropriate modification of study protocols; 
(5) improvements in study design or procedures; and (6) a dherence to worldwide regulatory 
requirements.
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in  a patient or clinical investi gation subject administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can, ther efore, be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
Revised Protocol No.: 05

Approved 8.0 v

Clinical Protocol ACCL1333/CV185155
BMS-562247 apixaban
use of investigational product, whether or not considered relat ed to the investigational product. 
Adverse events can be spontan eously reported  or elicited  during open-ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs .) 
For all adverse events, including those that are serious, if the diagnosis of the underlying illness or 
disorder is known; this diagnosis should be recorded, rather th an its individual symptoms.
All adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. 
In this study, expected chemotherapy-related CTCAE Grade 1 or G rade 2 AEs of nausea, vomiti ng, 
anorexia, fatigue, headache, fever, neutropenia, or an instituti on SOC practice to extend a
hospitalization for the possib ility of chemotherapy induced neutropenia w ill notbe collected on 
the non-serious AE case report form. However, any extended hosp italization due to a confirmed 
neutropenia or Grade 3 or higher AE/SAE of nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, fever, 
neutropenia, or headache willbe collected, whether considered related to chemotherapy or not.
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship  to investigational product as 
determined by a physician should be used for all BMS clinical s tudy AEs:
•Related - There is a reasonable causal relationship to study dru g administration and the AE.
•Not Related - There is not a reasonable causal r elationship to st udy drug administr ation and 
the AE.
The expression "reasonable causal relationship" is meant to con vey in general that there are facts
(eg, evidence such as de-challenge/re-challenge) or other argume nts to suggest a positive causal 
relationship.
AEs shoul d be followed to resolution or stab ilization, and reported as SAEs if the y become serious. 
This also applies to patients experiencing AEs that cause inter ruption or discontinuation of 
investigational product, or those experiencing AEs that are pre sent at the end of their participation 
in the study; such patients should receive post-treatment follo w-up as appropriate. If an ongoing 
AE changes in its severity or in its perceived relationship to study drug, a new AE entry f or the 
event should be completed.6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically m ight have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient  hospitalization or cause s prolongation of ex isting hospitalization (see NOTE
below)
•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Date: 03-Sep-2020 72
Approved 8.0 v

Clinical Protocol ACCL1333/CV185155
BMS-562247 apixaban
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based up on appropriate medical and
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical,
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious  outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples
of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room  or at
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or co nvulsions that do not result in
hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important
medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study drug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , ove rdose, and cancer are not always serious by regulatory definiti on, these 
events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to  study therapy (eg, d eath is an 
endpoint, if d eath occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported)  should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for repor ting details).
NOTE: 
The following hospitalizations are not c onsidered SAEs in BMS cli nical studies: 
•a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result in
admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threa tening event)
•elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
•admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
•planned chemotherapy
•routine health assessment requi ring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status
(eg, routine colonoscopy)
•medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill h ealth a nd planned prior to entry into the
study. Appropriate documentati on is required i n these cases
•admission encountered for another life circumstance that carrie s no bearing on health s tatus
and requires no medical/surgical in tervention (eg, lack of hous ing, economic inadequacy,
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Sections 5.6.1 a nd 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety 
Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events  for expedited reporting.
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the s tudy, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period
and up to 30 days after the last apixaban administration or las t induction chemotherapy drug.

Following study completion, any SAE thought to be related to st udy drug or clinical tr ial 
procedures should also be reported to the Sponsor.
An SAE report shoul d be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of
seriousness. If the investigator b elieves that an SAE is not rel ated to study drug, but is potentially 
related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of pr evious therapy, or a compli cation 
of a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in t he narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not  related to study d rug, and pregnan cies must be reported to BMS
(or designee) within 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). When u sing paper forms, the reports are 
to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transm ission to:

SAE Facsimile Number: See Contact Information list.
For studies capturing SAEs/pregnancies through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic 
submission is the required method for reporting. The paper form s should be used and submitted 
immediately , only in the event the elect ronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper 
forms are used, the original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pre gnancy reporting): See Contact Information 
list. If only limited i nformation is initially available, follow-up reports are required. 
(Note:  Follow-up SAE reports shoul d include the same investiga tor term(s) initially reported.) If 
an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to stud y drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within  24 hours to the BMS 
(or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the  initial SAE re port. All SAEs 
should be followed to re solution or stabilization.
6.2 Non-serious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE i nformation should begin at rand omization for all patients, 
including the patients randomized to the usual care arm.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stab ilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or discontinuation of study drug, or those that are present at the end of study treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). Completion of supplem ental CRFs may be requested 
for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study.

6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
In order for BMS to collect additi onal information about clinic ally important laboratory 
abnormalities, at a minimum, the f ollowing laboratory test resul ts abnormalities shoul d be captured 
on the non-serious or serious AE report pages of the CRF (paper  or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or me ets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subjec t to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnorm ality that required the subjec t to receive specific corrective 
therapy such as platelet transf usions in order to keep platelet s≥20x109per L or to treat bleeding 
episodes. Blood transfusion to corr ect an emia sec ondary to bleed ing. Plasma i nfusions to 
correct bleeding complications.
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than  laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value) .
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered that a study sub ject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant  at the time o f study exposure, including during at least 5 half-
lives after product administration, the investigator must immedi ately notify th e BMS Medical 
Monitor/designee of this event and complete and forward a Pregn ancy Surveillance Form to BMS 
Designee within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting p rocedures described in 
Section 6.1.1 . 
In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner.
Protocol-required procedures fo r study disconti nuation and foll ow-up must be performed on the 
subject. Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures shoul d be considered if indicated.
The investigator must immediately notify the BMS (or designee) Medical Monit or of this event 
and complete and forward a Pre gnancy Surveillance Form to BMS ( or designee) w ithin 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, in cluding perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be re ported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
Pregnancy and the accompanying forms must be followed up to 30 days following the 
discontinuation of apixaban.6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional adminis tration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurr ences of overdose, if excessive 
and medically important, must be reported as an SAE (see  Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
The following guidelines are intended to identify and manage su bjects with LFT abnormalities. 
Specific laboratory test criteria and instructions for further follow up are provided.
If at any time during the treatment period a subject’s liver fu nction test (LFT) results show:
An isolated elevation of either ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN AND/OR a dir ect (conjugated) bilirubin > 3 
x ULN, obtain the following laboratories: ALT, AST, total bilir ubin, dir ect bili rubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, GGT, CK as soon as possible (ie, within 3 days). 
If the repeat tests indicate:
1) ALT/AST < 10 x ULN and conjugated bilirubin ≤3 x ULN, study medication may continue.
2) If the repeat ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN AND/OR the conjugated bilirubin is > 3 x ULN, the 
study medication must be discontinued.
The study medication must be discontinued if:
Clinical jaundice is present for a subject at any timeOR
If ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN on any two consecutive occasions
OR
Conjugated bilirubin > 3 x ULN on any two consecutive occasions .
All subjects with an ALT/AST ≥10 x ULN or direct bilirubin > 3 x ULN will be followed weekly 
until ALT/AST returns to < 3 x ULN or to baseline, and the conju gated bilirubin returns to ≤1.5 
x ULN or to baseline. If study medication is discontinue d due to elevated ALT OR BILIRUBIN, as defined above, 
inform the medical Monitor and Study Director and perform the f ollowing:
•PT, aPTT, fibrinogen to assess liver synthetic function
•Abdominal ultrasound, including liver and hepatobiliary system
•Hepatitis screen (anti-HAV, HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HBs and anti- HCV.
•Obtain relevant specialist consul tation.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical  examinations, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required o r not required by protocol should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly.

7 DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE AND OTHER EXTERNAL 
COMMITTEES
7.1 Steering Committee
An academic Steering Co mmittee, par ticipated in the development of the protocol, w ill provide 
ongoing scientific and operational oversight to the study. The Steering Committee will monitor all 
aspects of the study, make recommendations to the sponsor based on the DMC recommendations, and oversee the presentation of the trial results and any publications.
7.2 Event Adjudication Committee
The Event Adjudication Co mmit tee (EAC), as described in the EAC charter, is an independent 
committee constituted by experienced clinicians independent of the Investigators and the Sponsor. 
The responsibilities of the EAC are to validate all study endpo ints that are central to the accuracy 
of results and conclusions of the trial. Specifically, the EAC will classify endpoints according to 
documentation provide d by Investigators. Adjudicated results will be the basis for t he final primary 
analyses.
7.3 Data Monitoring Committee
This study will be conducted under the monitoring of an indepen dent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC), whose activities will be described in a DMC charter. Sto pping rules for this study will be 
developed a priori in collaboration with the DMC. In addition, the DMC will use their clinical and 
statist ical j udgment to recommend that the study proceed or be terminated ea rly. This committee 
is constituted to oversee this apixaban pediatric study.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
With a total of approximately 500 randomized subjects allocated with 1:1 ratio to the sys temic 
thromboprophylaxis with apixaban or no systemic anticoagulant p rophylaxis (cont rol) group, there 
is more than 80% power to demonstrate superiority at a one-side d 0.025 level, assuming the true 
event rates of primary endpoint (composite of non-fatal asympto matic and symptomatic DVT, 
pulmonary embolism (PE), and CVST; and VTE-related-death) are 17 % and 8.5% in the control 
and the apixaban groups, respectively. Sample size estimation is  based on Pearson’s chi-square 
test.
Additionally, there is more than 80% power to demonstrate super iority at a one-sided 0.025 level, 
assuming the true event rates are 20% and 10% in the control an d the apixaban groups, respectively 
with analyses that assume that 20% of the subjects will be exclu ded from the primary analysis due 
to either early dropout without end-of-treatment imaging evaluation or non-evaluable 
end-of-treatment imaging measurement in the calculation.
Randomization will be str atified by age groups as < 10 years or ≥10 to < 18 years, to reflect the 
major peaks of disease prevalence and risk stratification criter ia for acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL) in children.

8.2 Populations for Analyses
•The Randomized/Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population consists of all  subjects who were
randomized to a tr eatment, regardless of whether they received study drug or not. Except as 
noted otherwise, Randomized/ITT Population will be used for the  evaluation of eff icacy.
•The Modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) population includes randomiz ed subjects who have 
either an adjudicated event making up the primary efficacy endp oint or evaluable end of study 
imaging evaluations, including ultrasound and echocardiogram.
•The Evaluable population will include the Randomized/ITT populat ion except those subjects 
with relevant protocol deviations expected to affect the primar y efficacy endpoint.
•The safety population includes all randomized subjects since the re is no intervention on top of 
standard care in the control arm and will be used for the evalua tion of safety.
•The analysi s population for pharmacokinetic assessments w ill include sub jects who have 
received at least one dose of apixaban and have a pharmacokinet ic sample collected.
•The analysis population for anti-FXa assessments w ill include sub jects who have r eceived at 
least one dose of apixaban and have anti-FXa samples collected.
8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy e ndpoint is a composi te of adjudicated non -fatal DVT (including 
asymptomatic and symptomatic), PE, and CVST and VTE-related-deat h objectively confirmed by 
independent adjudication. All components of the primary efficac y endpoint will be adjudicated by 
a blinded, independent adjudication committee.
Safety:
The primary safety endpoint will be adjudicated major bleeding which is defined as bleeding 
satisfies one or more of the following criteria: (i) fatal blee ding; (ii) clinically overt bleeding 
associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 20g/L (ie, 2g/dL) in a 24-hour period; 
(iii) bleeding that is retroperitoneal, pulmonary, intracranial,  or otherwise involves the CNS; 
and/or (iv) bleeding that requires surgical intervention in an operating suite, including 
interventional radiology. Of note, the major bleeding will not b e considered as part of the primary 
endpoint for the purpose of the European application, but will b e assessed as part of the safety 
profile of apixaban.
Prophylactic transfusions without overt bleeding and without a decrease in hemoglobin of at least 
20 g/l (ie, 2 g/dl) in a 24-hour period are not considered bleedi ng events.
All bleeding events will be adjudicated by a blinded, independe nt adjudication committee as major 
bleeding, CRNM bleeding, or minor bleeding. These endpoints are consistent with those 
recommended by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haem ostasis for pediatric clinical 
trials in venous thromboembolism.71

8.4.2 Efficacy Analyses
For the primary eff icacy e ndpoint, statistics i ncluding event rate, 95% CI for event rate, relative 
risk, 95% CI for relative risk and p-value will be displayed. Fo r other endpoints, descriptive 
statistics including single event rate, 95% CI for single event  rate, relative risk and 95% CI for 
relative risk will be displayed.
To construct p-values, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stratif ied by age groups of < 10 years 
and ≥10 years old w ill be used at the one-sided α= 0.025 level.
To construct descriptive statistics:
•The 95% CI for the relative risk will be computed based on Coch ran-Mantel-Haenszel method 
stratified by age group. 
•Construction of CIs for single event rates will be based on the  Agresti-Coull’s method
The above analyses on all the efficacy endpoints will be based on the Randomized/ITT population .
Following additional sensitivity analyses will also be performe d for the primary endpoint. 
•An analysis will be performed using the mITT Population.
•An analysis will be performed  for all randomized  subjects with m issing primary endpoint or 
non-evaluable imaging data to be  assessed via multiple imputatio n using 1000 repetitions, with 
imputation of events for patients with missing data in both tre atment groups based on the event 
rate observed from the corresponding stratum in the standard-of-c are arm
•If results from the primary efficacy analysis show a significan t difference between treatment 
groups, then a “tipping point” analy sis will be performed with a non-stratified analysis.  In 
each analysis, subjects with missing data in the standard-of-ca re arm will be assumed to be 
event-free, while progressively m ore subjects with missing data  in the apixaban arm will be 
assigned with an event, up to the limit of the number of subjec ts with missing data in the 
apixaban arm.  The number of subjects in the apixaban arm imput ed with event that would 
change the result from significant to non-significant would be noted.
•An analysis will be p erformed based on the Evaluable Population , if at least 10% of sub jects 
have a relevant protocol deviation.
8.4.3 Safety Analyses
For the primary safety endpoint, statistics including event rate , 95% CI for event rate, relative risk, 
95% CI for relative risk and nominal p- value will be displayed. To construct nominal p-values and 
95% CI for relative risk, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test stra tified by age groups of < 10 years 
and ≥10 years old will be used at the one-sided α= 0.025 level. Construction of CIs for event 
rates will be based on the Agresti Coull method.

8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
Pharmacokinetic Measures: 
Samples collected as described in Section 5.5 will be analyzed by LC-MSMS to determine 
apixaban plasma concentration. Individual data will be listed. I nterim analyses of PK will be 
performed to better understand apixaban PK and to inform apixab an dose selection.
A PPK model will be developed using plasma concentration versus  time data. Model-derived 
population and individual PK parameters (eg, CL/F, Vc/F, KA) wi ll be used to estimate Cmax, 
Cmin, and AUC(TAU) in each subject. Modeling results will be reported separately.
Anti-FXa Activity: 
Samples collected as described in  Section 5.5 will be analyzed by a one-s tep chromogenic anti-FXa 
assay. Individual data will be listed.  
A PPK-PD model will be developed using both apixaban plasma con centration and measured anti-
FXa activity versus time d ata. Model-derived population and individual parameters (eg, slope of 
anti-FXa activity vs apixaban concentration relationship) will be used to estimate maximum and 
minimum anti-FXa activity in each subject. Modeling results wil l be reported separately.

APPENDIX 1 ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE
1 ULTRASOUND IMAGING PROTOCOL
1.1 General Imaging Concepts and Principles
Test protocols should be followed as closely as possible, but the examination should be 
representative of what is feasible in clinical practice. It is understood that the sequence of image 
acquisition and ability to obtain all suggested images will vary, depending on patient related factors such as age, clinical condition, ability to cooperate, etc. The extremity sonogram can be paired with other SOC procedures, such as lumbar puncture, as long as no additional sedation is 
required beyond what is used for the SOC procedure.
The Radiology Core Lab (RCL) will determine wh ether or not an exam is adequate for purposes 
of study inclusion.
•For all sites, the first patient recru ited w ill receive a rapid turnaround feedback on the 
technique quality of its Ultrasound. 
•If a chest radiograph was obtained, the most recent film, prior  to performance of the
ultrasound, should be submitted along with the ultrasound exami nation
•Sedation or anesthesia should not be used for research purposes  only.
•A thrombus will be defined as a space occupying lesion seen wit hin a vessel or associated 
with a Central Venous Access Device (CVAD). It may be hyper- or hypo- intense. It may be 
mobile or adherent to a vascular or cardiac structure. It may be occlusive (if no blood flow is 
seen on Doppler imaging in that segment of the vessel) or non-oc clusive. The absence of color 
flow Doppler will typically prof ile the thrombus. Thrombus will  be differentiated from a 
“fibrin sheath/line cast” which is a more linear structure, oft en mimicking the appearance of 
a CVAD, is not mobile, and is the known locati on of a  prior CVAD.
• If the patient has a suspected thromboembolic event and the pat ient is not cooperating with 
the radiological interventions, sedation is recommended as per the institutional guidelines.
•The majority of the vascular sonogram should be performed using  the highest frequency linear 
transducer possible, usually 7 - 15 MHz. However, the brachioceph alic veins and superior 
vena cava should be assessed via the suprasternal notch, using a microcase 
(small footprint)/vector transducer (generally 3 - 10 MHz).
•A bilateral examination s hould be performed, even if the subject is asymptomatic. When no  
clot is seen in association with the PICC/CVL, sonography of the opposite/contralateral (non-
PICC/CVL) side can be less extensive. To clarify, the side with the P ICC/CVL (ipsilateral) 
side should be assessed using the full protocol, to the extent t hat is possible. If no clot is seen 
on the ipsilateral side, the contralateral side may be evaluate d in a targeted manner as follows:
For lower extremities: common femoral vein: long greyscale and long waveform views only.
For upper extremities: subclavian vein: long greyscale and long waveform views only. 
However, if the site thinks there is a clot on the PICC/CVL (ip silateral) side, a full examination 
on the contralateral side will be performed, following the full  protocol, to the extent that this 
is possible.

Approved 8.0 v

Clinical Protocol ACCL1333/CV185155
BMS-562247 apixaban
•Label all venous images with laterality (R T/LT), the vein name (with abbreviation as listed 
below), and segment of the vein interrogated where appropriate (central, mid, peripheral), in 
that order.
•Real-time Grey scale imaging with transducer compression of the vein should always be used 
in areas where the vein is accessible to compression
−Compression technique: The transducer is pressed gradually down  to fully compress the 
vein. Arteries resist compression and are visibly pulsatile. In s ome areas, overlying 
strictures (bones, ligaments) may hamper full compression. Compr ession should be app lied 
with the transducer at 1 cm intervals over the entire length of  the vessel.
•Color D oppler imaging improves vessel conspicuity and may help to better defi nition of the 
thrombus. However, it is important to remember that improper selection of color Doppler 
parameters can obscure thrombi, particularly non occlusive thro mbi.
−Pulsed-Doppler waveforms are used to document card iac phasicity, respiratory, and 
compression-induced flow changes. 
−Techniques to elicit changes in venous waveforms are termed aug mentation maneuvers
and include the Valsalva maneuver, sniffing, deep breathing, an d ipsilateral venous 
compression by the linear transducer. Normal cardiac phasicity,  respiratory variation and 
augmentation by direct ve nous compression are all markers of ve nous patency. 
Observation of asymmetry between right and left side waveforms implies the presence of 
a venous clot. However, observation of normal, symmetrical venou s Doppler waveforms 
does not exclude the possibility of a non-occlusive thrombus.
1.2 Imaging Protocol: Upper Extremity Central Venous Access Devi ce 
(CVAD) or Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Cather (PICC)
•Most recent chest radiograph following line placement should be reviewed before ultrasound 
to determine the course of the CVAD or PICC and the location of the tip.
During the ultrasound exam, the course of the catheter should b e demonstrated in all involved 
vessels. Attempt should be made to visualize the tip of the cat heter if it is located in the SVC 
or brachiocephalic, not if it is in the right atrium.
Use the “Upper Extremity Wo rksheet” as a s tudy protocol  guide.
The following veins should be scanned on both sides : Internal Jugular (IJ), 
Subclavian (SCV), Brachiocephalic (innominate) veins (BC), Super ior Vena cava (SVC), 
Axillary (Ax), Brachial (Brach), Basilic (Bas), and Cephalic ve ins (Ceph).
•Internal Jugular vein
−Use high frequency linear transducer.
−Internal Jugular vein should be followed from the base of the s kull to the junction with the 
subclavian/brachiocephalic veins.
−Evaluate internal jugular vein using Grey scale imaging in the transverse plane, following 
its course from superior (distal) to inferior (proximal) compressing every 1 cm. Take 
representative images with a nd wit hout compression at the superior, mid and inferior aspect 
of the vein.
−Evaluate internal jugular vein using Grey scale imaging in the transverse plane, following 
its course from superior (distal) to inferior (proximal) compre ssing every 1 cm. Using dual

showing that the vessel fills uniformly, and excluding filling defect of fresh, hypoechoic 
thrombus.

direction and phasicity/respiratory variation.
•Subclavian vein
−Use high frequency linear transducer.

junction with the axillary vein, to the junction with the inter nal jugular /brachiocephalic 
vein.
−Evaluate entire subclavian vein in longitudinal plane using Gre y scale imaging, evaluating 
for intraluminal thrombus, and take images that show the entire  course of the vein.
−Obtain color Doppler images of the subclavian vein in the longitudinal plane, showing that 
the vessel fills uniformly, and excluding filling defect of fre sh, hypoechoic thrombus.
−Obtain pulse Doppler waveforms of both the subclavian vein and t he adjacent subclavian 
artery to show the normal relationship between the two vessels and distinguish the 
subclavian vein from venous collaterals that can form in settin g of longstanding occlusion. 
Perform augmen tation maneuvers (squeezi ng arm), to demonstrate appropriate response in 
the subclavian vein.
•Brachiocephalic/SVC
−From the suprasternal notch, use vector transducer/microcase if  linear transducer does not 
allow visualization.
−Obtain Grey scale coronal image sh owing the confluence of the subclavian and internal 
jugular veins into the brachiocephalic, evaluating for intralum inal thrombus. If possible 
obtain another Grey scale image angled down to see the more cen tral portion of the 
brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
−Obtain Color Doppler coronal image showing the confluence of th e subclavian and internal 
jugular veins into the brachiocephalic. If possible obtain anot her Color Doppler image 
angled down to see the more central portion of the brachiocepha lic vein and SVC. The goal 
is to show that the vessels fill in uniformly, excluding fillin g defect of thrombus.
−If possible, obtain Pulse Doppler waveforms within the vessels showing normal direction 
and phasicity/resp iratory variation (quiet breathing).
−If possible, obtain Pulse Doppler waveforms within the vessels showing changes with 
augmentation maneuvers (Vals alva, sniffing, deep breathing).

1.4 Imaging Protocol: Lower Extremity CVAD/(PICC)
Most recent abdominal radiograph following line placement shoul d be reviewed before ultrasound 
to determine the course of the catheter and the location of the tip.
During the ultrasound exam, the course of the catheter should be  demonstrated in all involved 
vessels, and the tip shown by US, bearing in mind this may not be possible depending on the 
location of the tip and habitus of the patient.
Use the “Lower Extremity Worksh eet” as a study  protocol guide.
The following veins should be scanned on both sides: Inferior Vena Cava (IVC), common iliac 
(CIV), external iliac (EIV), c ommon femoral (CVF), superficial femoral (SFV), popliteal 
veins (pop).
• Common femoral, femoral, popliteal veins
−Begin superiorly at the inguinal fossa with the common femoral vein, and trace the course 
of the common femoral, femoral, and popli teal veins inferiorly, to the  popliteal fo ssa. Use 
high frequency linear transducer when possible. The deeper segments of the femoral vein 
may require use of the vector transducer in some patients.
−Evaluate veins using Grey scale imaging in the transverse plane, following their entire 
course and compressing every 1 cm. Using dual screen, take repr esentative images without 
com p r es s i on  (l ef t s c r e e n )  a n d  wi th  c om p r es s i on  (ri ght s c r e e n )  a t the superior, mid and 
inferior aspect of the vein. Using the caliper/measuring tool, mark the margins of the non-
compressed vein on the left image.
−Obtain longitudinal images of the veins, with Grey scale imagin g, assessing for 
intraluminal thrombus.
−Obtain longitudinal images of the veins with color Doppler imag ing, showing that the 
vessels fill uniformly, and excluding filling defect of fresh, hypoechoic thrombus.
−Obtain pulsed D oppler wave  form in the veins n in the longitudinal plane, showing normal 
direction and phasicity with augmen tation (squ eezing of the leg).
• External iliac, common iliac, IVC
−Begin inferiorly at the external iliac vein where it meets the common femoral vein, and 
trace the course of the extern al iliac vein, common iliac vein, and IVC superiorly into the 
abdomen. Use high frequency linear transducer where possible, however lower frequency vector or curved transducer may be necessary.

−Grey scale images of the vessels in transverse plane (compress if possible)
−Grey scale images in longitudinal plane, assessing for intralum inal thrombus.
−Color Doppler images in longitudinal plane, showing that the vessels fill in uniformly, and 
excluding filling defect of fresh, hypoechoic thrombus.
−Pulse Doppler waveforms showi ng normal direction and phasicity/respiratory variation.
−The tip of the catheter may be in the abdominal or intrahepatic  IVC.
For all exams, the catheters should be imaged and lab eled on longitudinal grey sca le images of 
relevant vessels. If the tip is demonstrated, cine clip demonstrating the tip should be obtained.
Study is positive for d eep venous thrombosis if there is a fill ing defect within any of the assessed 
vessels. It may be echogenic or hypoechoic (visible by absence of col or flow Doppler), central or 
peripheral, depending on the chronicity of the thrombus. It may  be occlusive (if no blood flow is 
seen on Doppler imaging in that segment of the vessel) or non-o cclusive
If intraluminal thrombus is seen within a vessel, a clip demons trating the thrombus should be 
obtained, longitudinal to the vessel. The length of the thrombu s should also be measured in the 
longitudinal plane. The anterior to posterior (AP) and transverse (TV) dimensions s hould be 
measured in the transverse plane.If a prominent valve is encountered which could be mistaken for  thrombus, a cine clip should be 
obtained demonstrating its motion.
If there is venous stasis with rouleaux formation, causing incr eased echogenicity of the blood, a 
cine clip should be obtained showing motion in the vessel, and demonstrating that it is not a 
thrombus.
The thrombus will be categorized to: 
•Occlusive thrombus: intraluminal filling defect is seen (thromb us), and color Doppler images 
do not demonstrate blood flow past this defect
•Non-occlusive thrombus: intraluminal filling defect is seen (th rombus), however color 
Doppler images demonstrate blood flow past this defect
•No thrombus: no intraluminal filling defect identified in the v essel
Presence of collateral vessels 
Collateral vessels are present if there are unnamed smaller caliber circuitous veins adjacent to the 
vessel in question.

APPENDIX 2 ECHOCARDIOGRAM PROCEDURE
1 ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC IMAGING PROTOCOL
1.1 Patient and Room Preparation
•ECG leads should be placed on every patient
•Optimize imaging conditions (darken the room, position ECG leads and other monitoring 
devices away from imaging positions, check to see that machine is sensing the ECG)
•If chest x-ray was used to guide the placement of the catheter it should be submitted with the 
Echocardiogram
1.2 General Imaging Concepts and Principles•Test protocols should be followed as closely as possible. The Echocardiography Core 
Laboratory (ECL) will determine whether or not an exam is adequate for purposes of study 
inclusion.
•For all sites, the first patient recruited will r eceive a rapid turnaround feedback on the 
technique quality of its Echocardiogram.
•Sedation or anesthesia should not be used for research purposes  only.
•A thrombus will be defined as a space occupying lesion seen wit hin a vessel or associated 
with a CVAD. It may be hyper- or hypo-intense. It may be mobile or adherent to a vascular 
or cardiac structure. It ma y be occlusive  (if no bl ood flow  is seen on Doppler imaging in that 
segment of the vessel) or non-occlusive. The absence of color f low Doppler w ill typically 
profile the thrombus. Thrombus will be differentiated from a “f ibrin sheath/line cast” which 
is a more linear structure, often mimicking the appearance of a CVAD, is not mobile, and is 
the known location of a prior CVAD.
• If the patient has a suspected thromboembolic event and the pat ient is not cooperating with 
the radiological interventions, sedation is recommended as per the institutional guidelines.
•For each new acoustic window, there should be a complete sweep of the relevant anatomy by 2D imaging
•After complete sweeps are recorde d, specific areas of interest can be targeted for further 
evaluation using the zoom feature, in 2D, color Doppler (CD), p ulsed wave (PW) Doppler, 
continuous wave (CW) Doppler, and/or color compare (CC) Doppler  as described below. Do 
not over zoom.
•Color Imaging
−The width and depth of the color sector should be adjusted to i nclude only the relevant 
anatomy. Avoid using color sector boxes that fill up the entire  2D screen.
−Use the highest Nyquist limit that provides color flow signal w ithin the structure of interest
−Avoid “color bleeding” by adjusting the color gain when lowerin g the Nyquist limit
−Maintain the highest possible frame rate possible, no less than  20 frames per second
•Spectral Doppler (PW and CW)
−Minimize the angle between the u ltrasound beam and the directio n of flow by adjusting 
transducer position (can disregard standard views). Use the aud io feature to assist with 
optimizing the alignment with the flow jet to obtain the highes t velocity with the minimal 
spectral dispersion

−Adjust the gain, compress, and reject controls to depict a complete spectral “envelope” 
while optimizing signal-to-noise ratio
−Adjust baseline and scale so the spectral “envelope” is (a) non-a liased, and (b) occupies ~
75% of the velocity range
−Use PW Doppler before CW Doppler
−Start recording the Doppler tracing only after a full screen of Doppler data is on the screen. Record between 4 and 8 cardiac cycles. 
•Clips should be limited to no more than 10 seconds
•Optimize the image BEFORE recording:
−Locate the best acoustic window for each view
−Adjust the depth and width of the sector to include only releva nt image data
−Adjust imaging parameters (trans mit gain, horizontal and lateral receive gains, compress, 
frequency range, harmonic imaging, etc.) to obtain optimal imag e quality (st rong signal 
from cardiovascular structures and minimal [but not absent] sig nal from the blood pool)
−Maintain the focal zone at the level of the relevant anatomy
−Imaging should be performed with the highest transducer frequen cy as possible, but trial 
use of lower frequency transducers if it improves image quality .
−Depending on which probe is being used, trial images with and wi thout harmonics
−Particular attention should be paid to maintaining a fr ame r ate over 20 Hz or fr ames per 
second during all acquisitions
•The order of the examination can be modified to accommodate pat ient- and diagnosis-specific 
circumstances. In addition to the above standard acoustic windows and imaging planes, the operator should exercise flexibility in transducer position and image orien tation in order to 
obtain the best possible images and full delineation of the rel evant anatomy and physiology.
•Example echocardiographic move clips and image stills demonstra ting acoustic windows, 
sweeps, and quality of imaging of each of the views will be pos ted on an online website.

•If a CVAD is visible in any i maging window, additional attention should be paid to evaluate 
for associated thrombus
•The CVAD should be followed along its length with particular att ention paid to the tip of the 
CVAD
•Imaging of the C VAD should be  done in 2D, CD, and CCD
•If venous obstruction is suspected, additional PW and CW interrogation is required
The thrombus will be categorized to: 
•Occlusive thrombus: intraluminal filling defect is seen (thromb us), and color Doppler images 
do not demonstrate blood flow past this defect
•Non-occlusive thrombus: intraluminal filling defect is seen (th rombus), however color 
Doppler images demonstrate blood flow past this defect
•No thrombus: no intraluminal filling defect identified in the v essel
Presence of collateral vessels 
Collateral vessels are present if there are unnamed smaller caliber circuitous veins adjacent to the 
vessel in question.
Report to accompany echocardiogram images:
For each protocol echocardiogram, the Center w ill send the local echocardi ography report, will 
complete a worksheet that w ill detail compliance with th e imaging protocol and complete a data 
form detailing interpretation and findings.

APPENDIX 3 DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF SUSPECTED DVT
At any time during the assessment peri od, if a sub ject experiences signs or symptoms that the 
investigator considers indicative of a potential DVT, related or not-related to the central venous 
catheter, a dossier package should be created by the site to be  sent for adjudication.
Hospitalized subjects will be assessed daily for signs and symp toms of DVT which include but are 
not limited to: phlebitis [eg, an inflammatory reaction within the vein, causing clinical findings of 
edema, pain/tenderness, or erythema of the involved extremity];  presence of congestion of 
tributary veins (eg, at the base of the neck, infraclavicular f ossa, shoulder, or arm, according to 
catheter location and type); a palpable cord; catheter occlusio n (inability to withdraw blood or 
infuse into an indwelling catheter); the presence of catheter-r elated infection, and signs and 
symptoms of pulmonary embolism (PE) (see Appendix 4).
Prior to discharge, subjects and/or caregivers will be taught s igns and symptoms suggestive of 
VTE and instructed to contact the investigator immediately if a ny of these signs or symptoms are 
observed.
Diagnostic tests for pres ence of DVT include:
•Ultrasonography: See  Appendix 1
•Echocardiography – See Appendix 2
•Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) - The accuracy 
of MRV in diagnosis of DVT is s imilar to that of contrast venog raphy performed with ionizing 
radiation. MRI/MRV will be performed according to the judgment of the clinical team caring 
for the patient. A DVT by MRI/MRV is diagnosed by a intraluminal filling defect, defined as 
−An area of reduced or absent filling that is at least partially surrounded by blood or with 
contrast medium in two or more projections, or
−Lack of filling in a vessel in w hich there is a cut-off which h as the configuration of a 
thrombus, or
−Lack of normal flow void with expansion of the vessel.
•Computerized Tomography (CT)/Computerized Tomographic Venograph y  ( C T V )-S o m e  
centers will perform CT/CTV rather than MR/MRV for diagnosis of  suspected DVT events. 
The criteria for a positive CT/CTV study are similar to those o n MR/MRV.
•Venography – Venography may be performed when clinical suspicion for deep venous 
thrombosis is high, but ultrasound is negative or nondiagnostic.  Installation of contrast into 
the vein (using the central line if a line study or another cat heter) under fluoroscopy /digi tal 
subtraction angiography may show a thrombus. 
Symptomatic DVT detected at any time during the study:
If a subject presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a symptomatic DVT, conduct physical 
examination and perform diagnostic imaging tests within 48 hours of event. Specific 
recommendations are as follows:
•Conduct physical examination

APPENDIX 4 DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF SUSPECTED PULMONARY 
EMBOLUS
This appendix has sections on sympt omatic and asymp tomatic pulm onary embolism (PE).
Symptomatic PE detected during the Assessment Period:
At any time during the assessment peri od, if a sub ject experiences signs or symptoms that the 
investigator considers indicativ e of a potential pulmonary embo lism (PE), a dossier package 
should be created by the site to be sent for adjudication
Clinical impression of acute PE tends to be nonspecific, with l ow sensitivity and specificity. For 
this reason, additional diagnostic evaluations are needed. D-dimer assays are generally performed 
in the work-up of suspected PE and have good sensitivity and ne gative predictive value, but poor 
specificity and positive predictive value. In addition, at leas t one of the following diagnosis 
techniques should be used to assess suspected PE: computed tomo graphy pulmonary angiography 
(CT-PA), ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scanni ng, invasive pulmonary angiography, magnetic 
resonance pulmonary angiography (MR-PA), and/or echocardiograph y. The specific diagnostic 
testing performed should be chosen in accordance with available  facilities at their instituti on and 
the safety for the patient.
CT pulmonary angiography (CT-PA) is used increasingly, with the  largest adult study3suggesting 
a sensitivity of 83% (rising to 90% when ve nous –phase imaging was added, ie, CTA-CTV) and 
specificity of 9 6%. When high, intermediate, or low clinical probability was co mbined with a 
negative CT-PA, the predictive value negatives were 60%, 89%, a nd 96%. Additional testing is 
needed when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the r esults of the CT scan.
CT will be classified as follows:
1) CT Negative: No intraluminal  filling defect (IL FD). NOTE: The  EAC will consider the 
assessment of additional tests performed for a non-diagnostic s piral CT (eg, V/Q lung scan, 
pulmonary angiography)
2) CT Positive: ILFD in the central pulmonary arteries (pulmonar y trunk; proximal right  or left 
pulmonary arteries, right or left interlobar arteries, right or  left segmental arteries)
3) CT indeterminate: Not all central  pulmonary arter ies (pulmonary trunk;  proximal right  or left 
pulmonary arteries, right or left interlobar arteries, right or  left segmental arteries) are 
visualized, and an ILFD is not present
Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) sca nning: The probability of a PE i s greatest when a V/Q scan 
suggesting high probability of PE is combined with a clinical p icture highly suggestive of PE.4A 
normal V/Q  scan virtually excludes PE. Results of a V/Q scan will be classified as follows:
A) Normal: No perfusion defects
B) High probability: Segmental perfusion defect ( ≥1), seen in at least two views, with normal 
ventilation at that spot
C) Lower Probability: A perfusion defect that does not qualify a s High Probability. NO TE: 
The EAC will consider the assessment of additional tests perfor med for a lower probability

V/Q lung scan (ie, spiral CT, pulmonary angiography, venography , and compression 
ultrasound [proximal region])
D) Not done: V/Q lung scan not performed
Venography or compression ultrasound in the setting of a lower probability V/Q lung scan after 
suspected PE event: Venography and/or compression ultrasound of  the proximal region will be 
classified as follows:
A) No acute DVT: No tests diagnostic for acute DVT were associat ed with the symptomatic 
PE
B) Acute DVT: Thrombus confirmed by diagnostic tests associated with a symptomatic PE
C) Not done: Venography or compression ultrasound not performed.
Echocardiography may demonstrate right ventricular enlargement,  decreased right ventricular 
function, and tricuspid regurgitation. Fewer than half of patie nts with pulmonary embolus have an 
abnormal echocardiogram, although the likelihood of abnormaliti es is related to the severity of the 
PE. 
Invasive (conventional) pulmonary angiography is the gold stand ard, but is rarely used. Pulmonary 
angiographic classification is as follows:
A) Normal: No ILFD and no sudden contrast cut-off in one or more vessels
B) Intraluminal Filling Defect (ILFD): An area of reduced or abs ent filling at least partially 
surrounded with contrast medium in two or more projections OR lack of filling in a vessel 
in which there is a cut-off which has the configuration of a th rombus
C) Sudden contrast cut-off: A s udden contrast c ut-off (dye abruptly stops) involving one or 
more vessels
D) Indeterminate: Lack of filling of a region of the pulmonary a rteries without being 
diagnostic for PE
E) Not done: Pulmonary angiography not performed
MR pulmonary angiogram (MR-PA): Criteria are similar to those o f CT-PA. MR-PA for diagnosis 
of PE is generally inferior to CT-PA because of motion artifact.   
Echocardiographic a bnormalities are found in 30 - 40% of individu als; these comprise dilated right 
ventricle with diminished fun ction and tricuspid regurgitation.
Patients will be classified with respect to PE events as follow s:
Positive PE Event : To be classified as having a positive PE event, patients must meet at least one 
of the following criteria:
A) The CT-PA is assessed as positive for an ILFD;
B) The V/Q scan is assessed as High Probability;

Clinical Protocol ACCL1333/CV185155
BMS-562247 apixaban
C) The V/Q lung scan is assessed as Lower Probability and either  venography or compression 
ultrasounds is diagnostic for acute DVT; 
D) An invasive pulmonary angiogram is positive for an ILFD or a sudden contrast cut- off in 
one or more vessels > 2.5 mm in diameter; or
E) An autopsy confirms the presence of a PE.
No PE event: To be classified as having no PE event, patients must meet none  of the criteria 
above:
Non Diagnostic/Non-evaluable: There is not enough information to make a determination of the 
presence or absence of a PE.
If PE is considered likely or confirmed, patient should be managed and further investigated 
according to investigator standard of care. If these tests are negative or indeterminate, then further 
testing per investigator’s choice should be performed.
Diagnostic imaging procedures performed such as vent ilation-perfusion scanning or CT scans 
should also be submitted for adjudication.To enable the Independent Event Adjudication Commi ttee to a ppropriately classify the event in 
subjects with a history suggestive of PE who die suddenly, inve stigators w ill be e ncouraged to 
obtain an autopsy or other post-mortem studies reportsIf a subject presents with a suspected symptomatic PE, a specif ic recommendations are as follows:
•Conduct a physical examination
•Evaluate with laboratory or diagnostic tests in accordance with  feasibility and safety at your 
institution

In the event that a PE is incidentally detected while undergoing other imaging procedures required 
for the subject’s care of his/her underlying condition, and the  subject does not manifest any signs 
and/or symptoms of a PE, the event will be considered an asympt omatic PE. The subject should 
be managed and further investig ated according to the investigat or’s standard of care. All diagnostic

APPENDIX 5 DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF SUSPECTED CEREBRAL 
VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS (CVST)
To satisfy criteria for symptomatic CVST event positivity, 1) pa tients must be symptomatic, and 
2) the diagnosis must be objectively documented by brain MRI wit h MR venography (MRI/MRV) 
or brain CT with CT venography (CT/CTV). In the event that a CV ST is inciden tally d etected 
while undergoing other imaging procedures required for the subje ct’s care of his/her underlying 
condition, and the  subject does not manifest any signs and/or s ymptoms of a CVST, the event will 
be considered an asymptomatic CVST event. 
At any time during the assessment peri od, if a sub ject experiences signs or symptoms that the 
investigator considers indicative of a potential CVST OR if an asymptomatic CVST is detected, a 
dossier package with medical records and CD/DVDs of imaging stu dies should be created by the 
site to be sent first to the Vendor for translation if needed an d de-identification, and then to the 
EAC Coordinator for adjudication.
The presentation of cerebral vein and dural sinus thrombosis is highly variable, with onset that can 
be acute, subacute, or chronic. The most common symptom is head ache, but other symptoms 
include altered consciousness/coma, cognitive dysfunction, foca l or multi-focal deficits 
(eg, hemiparesis), or seizures. The signs and symptoms of cerebr al sinus and vein thrombosis are 
dependent upon the particular site that has venous occlusion. F or example, in cavernous sinus 
thrombosis, orbital pain, oculomotor palsies, and other occult signs are the predominant 
manifestation. With sagi ttal sinus thrombosis, motor def icits, b ilateral deficits, and seizures are 
present. Lateral sinus thrombosis often presents with isolated headaches or intracranial 
hypertension. Severe signs and symptoms are often apparent with  occlusion of the deep cerebral 
venous system.
Patients will be classified with respect to CVST events as foll ows:
Positive symptomatic CVST Event: To be classified as having a positive CVST event, patients 
must meet each of the following criteria:
A. Consistent symptoms (unexplained headaches, vomiting, visual problems or 
neurological deficits, seizure, drowsiness or any change in men tal  status, si gns of rai sed 
intracranial pressure); AND
B. Confirmation of CVST on neuroimaging by either MRI/MRV or CT/ CTV.
No CVST event: To be classified as having no CVST event, patients must meet no ne of the criteria 
above.Nondiagnostic/ Indeterminate: There is not enough information to make a determinati on of the 
presence or absence of a CVST.

APPENDIX 6 DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF SUSPECTED ARTERIAL 
THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS
Each patient with suspected arterial thromboembolic outcome eve nts will be classified as 
a. Stroke
b. Myocardial infarctionc. Peripheral thromboembolic event
The signs and symptoms of a symptomatic arterial thromboembolic  event will entirely depend 
upon the site of thrombosis. In the event that an arterial thromboembolic event is incidentally 
detected while undergoing other imaging procedures required for  the subject’s care of his/her 
underlying condition, and the subject does not manifest any sig ns or symptoms of an arterial 
thromboembolic event, the event will be considered an asymptoma tic arterial thromboembolic 
event. The subject should be managed and further investigated a ccording to the investigator’s 
standard of  care. Regardless of  si te of  arteri al th romboembolic  events, all med ical rec ords and 
diagnostic imaging tests (CDs,  DVDs, and reports)should also be  submitted to the Vendor for 
translation and de-identificat ion, and then to the EAC for adju dication.
Specific criteria for stroke and myocardial infarction are list ed below.
Classification of stroke
An acute stroke will be defined as a new focal neurological def icit of sudden onset lasting at least 
24 hours that is not due to a readily identified non-vascular c ause, such as brain tumor or trauma.  
All reported stroke events will be assessed either by imaging (CT or MRI) or autopsy.Each stroke will be classified as 1) Primary hemorrhagic stroke: a stroke with documentation on im aging (eg, CT or MRI of 
hemorrhage in cerebral parenchyma, or subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Evidence of 
hemorrhagic stroke obtaine d from lumbar puncture, neurosurgery, or autopsy can also confirm 
the diagnosis
2) Non-hemorrhagic stroke: a focal ne urological deficit that results from a thrombus or embolus 
(and not due to a hemorrhage) that appears and is still partially evident at 24 hours
3) Infarction with hemorrhagic conversion: a stroke without evid ence of hemorrhage on an initial 
scan, but with appearance of hemorrhage on a subsequent scan
4) Unknown type: a stroke type that could not be or was not dete rmined by imaging or other 
means
Classification of myocardial infarction (MI)
An acute myocardial infarction is defined by the presence of my ocardial necrosis in a clinical 
setting consistent with acute m yocardial ischemia. Under these conditions, the diagnosis for 
myocardial infarction can be made in the setting of the patient  population in this protocol as 
follows:

with at least one of the following.
a) Symptoms of ischemia
b) New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (STTW) changes or 
new left bundle branch block (LBBB)
c) Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG ( ≥.04 seconds in ≥2

OR
B. Cardiac death with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia  and presumed 
new ischemic ECG changes or new LBBB, but death occurred before  cardiac biomarkers 
were obtained, or before cardiac biomarker values would be incr eased.
Classification of Suspected Peripheral Arterial Thromboembolic Events
At any time during the assessment peri od, if a sub ject experiences signs or symptoms that the 
investigator considers indicative of a potential arterial throm boembolic event, a dossier package 
should be created by the site to be sent for adjudication
Symptomatic arterial thromboembolic event detected during the assessment period:
If a subject presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of a s ymptomatic arterial 
thromboembolic event, co nduct physical examination and perform diagnostic imaging 
commensurate with site of the arterial thrombus within 48 hours  of event. Specific

APPENDIX 7 CENTRAL LINE ASSOCIATED BLOODSTREAM INFECTION 
(CLABSI)5
At any time during the assessment peri od, if a sub ject experiences signs or symptoms that the 
investigator considers indicativ e of a potential CLABSI, a doss ier package with medical records 
and laboratory studies should be created by the site to be sent  first to the Vendor for translation if 
needed and de-identification, and then to the EAC Coordinator for adjudication.
Definition of CLABSI will be derived from that pr oposed by the CDC and adapted in COG 
protocol ACCL1034. 
The patient must meet one of the following criteria:Criterion 1: Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from one or more b lood cultures and 
organism cultured from blood is not related to an infection at another site (Notes 1 and 2 below)
Criterion 1: Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from one or more b lood cultures and 
organism cultured from blood is not related to an infection at another site. (if infection at another 
site can colonize central line) 
Criterion 2: 
•Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fe ver (> 38
oC), chills, or 
hypotension and signs and symptoms and positive laboratory resu lts are not related to an 
infection at another site and
•A common skin contaminant (ie, diphtheroids [ Corynebacterium spp.], Bacillus 
[not B. anthracis ] spp., Propionibacterium spp., coagulase-negative staphylococci [including 
S. epidermidis ], viridans group streptococci, Aerococcus spp., Micrococcus spp.) is cultured 
from two or more blood cultures  drawn on separate occasions. 
NOTES: 
1) In criterion 1, the phrase “one or more blood cul tures” means  that at least one bottle from 
a blood draw is reported by the laboratory as having grown organisms (ie, is a positive 
blood culture). 
2) In criterion 1, the term “recognized pathogen” does not inclu de organisms considered 
common skin contaminants (see cr iteria 2 and 3 for a list of co mmon skin contaminants). 
A few of the recognized pathogens are S. aureus , Enterococcus spp., E. coli , Pseudomonas 
spp., Klebsiella spp., Candida spp., etc. 
3) In criteria 2, the phrase “t wo or more blood cultures drawn o n separate occasions” means 
1) that blood from at least two blood draws were co llected within two days of each other 
(eg, blood draws on Monday and Tuesday or Monday and Wednesday would be acceptable 
for blood cultures drawn on separate occasions, but blood draws on Monday and Thursday 
would be too far apart in time to meet this criteri on), and 2) that at least one bottle from 
each blood draw is reported by the laboratory as having grown t he same common skin 
contaminant organism (ie, is a positive blood culture). (See Note 4 for determining 
sameness of organisms.)

a) For example, an adult patient has blood drawn at 8 a.m. and ag ain at 8:15 a.m. of the 
same day. Bl ood from each blood draw is inoculated into two bottles and incubated 
(four bottles total). If one bottle from each blood draw set is positive for coagulase-
negative staphylococci, this part of the criterion is met. 
b) For example, a neonate has blood drawn for culture on Tuesday and again on Saturday 
and both grow the same common skin contaminant. Because the tim e between these 
blood cultures exceeds the two-day peri od for bl ood draws stipulated i n criteria 2 and 
3, this part of the criteria is not met.
c) A blood culture may consist of a single bottle for a pediatric blood draw due to volume 
constraints. Therefore, to meet this part of the criterion, eac h bottle from two or more 
draws would have to be culture-positive for the same skin conta minant. 
4) There are several issues to consider when determining samenes s of organisms. If the 
common skin contaminant is identified to the species level from  one culture, and a 
companion culture is identified with only a descriptive name (i e, to the genus level), then 
it is assumed that the organisms are the same. The speciated or ganism should be reported 
as the infecting pathogen (see examples below). 
Table 5: Examples of how to report speciated and unspeciated common skin 
contaminant organisms
Culture Report Companion Culture Report Report as… 
S. epidermidis Coagulase-negative staphylococci S. epidermidis 
Bacillus spp. (not anthracis) B. cereus B. cereus 
S. salivarius Strep viridans S. salivarius 
5) Additional considerations not included in the CDC criteria
A. Recurrent infections will not be counted as new infections. B. Criteria for recurrence of infection include:  
a. The subsequent positive culture occurs in association with th e same CVAD as the 
previous infection (the CVAD was not replaced with the previous infection)
b. The subsequent positive culture is due to the same organism/s  as the previous 
infection without new organism/s cultured
c. The subsequent positive culture occurs within 4 weeks of the first infection
All 3 criteria must be present for a positive culture to be dee med a recurrent infection.
Different species isolated withi n a week of an initial isolate will be counted as one infection 
episode.  
Different species identified at least one week after the initial  isolate will be categorized as 
a new infection.

APPENDIX 8 DEATH
At any time during the assessment period, if a death event occu rs, a dossier package with medical 
records, imaging d ata, laboratory studies a nd any other relevant med ical information s hould be 
created.
Deaths will be classified as A. VTE-related Death:
(1) Fatal pulmonary embolism
(a) Autopsy reveals major pulmonary embolism (occlusion of at le ast two segmental 
pulmonary arteries or their equivalent), or (b) Clinical course is compatible with pulmonary embolism AND th ere is not a more 
compelling alternative diagnosis to account for death.(2) Fatal non-hemorrhagic stroke related to paradoxical embolus : ischemic stroke with the 
presence of venous thromboembolism and a right-to-left shunt (e g, patent foramen ovale, a 
pulmonary fistul) revealed by imaging, surgery or autopsy. (3) F atal MI related to paradoxical embolus : acute MI with the presence of venous 
thromboembolism and a right-to-left shunt (eg, patent foramen ovale, a pulmonary fistul) revealed 
by imaging, surgery or autopsy. 
B. Fatal Bleeding
(a) Death will be  classified as related to fatal bleeding if the re is overt bleeding (including 
autopsy evidence) AND there is not a more compelling alternativ e diagnosis to account for death.  
(b) Death associated with pulmonary hemorrhage will usu ally be attributed to underlying 
pulmonary embolism.
C. Other (eg, malignancy, infection, tumor lysis s yndrome, cardiovascular – related, respiratory 
failure – related , central nervous system (CNS) – related, withd rawal of support, study drug 
toxicity other than bleeding (specify), and Other not mentioned ).
D. Unknown Cause : No data are available to assign a cause of death.

APPENDIX 10 COMMON STRONG INHIBITORS OF BOTH CYTOCHROME 
P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) AND P-GLYCOPR OTEIN (P-GP) (NOT ALL 
INCLUSIVE)26
Apixaban is hepatically metabolized by cytoc hrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and is a substrate for 
the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-GP). Co-administration  of drugs that are strong inhibitors 
of both CYP3A4 and P-GP can increase apixaban blood concentratio ns. Patients with renal 
insufficiency or of low body weight may be at increased risk of  excessive anticoagulation due to 
CYP and P-gp drug interactions, and avoidance of certain drug co mbinations should be considered.
Examples of strong inhibitors  of CYP3A4 are prohibited while su bjects are on treatment with 
BMS-562247. Some examples of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are:
Clarithromycin nelfinavir
telithromycin ritonavir
itraconazole saquinavir
ketoconazole indinavir
voriconazole cobicistat 
posaconazole
Strong inducers of P-gp and CYP3A4 are expected to decrease api xaban blood concentrations and 
can result in failure of therapeutic anticoagulant effect.Examples of strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp are:
Rifampin phenytoin
carbamazepine St. John’s wort
These lists are not meant to be all inclusive. Please consult in dividual drug labels for further 
information. 
Management suggestions:
Avoid co-administration of strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and  P-gp. Bleeding risk is expected 
to be further increased in patients with renal insufficiency, depending upon severity.
The efficacy of routine coagulation testing to evaluate the deg ree of anticoagulation with apixaban 
is limited.
Avoid co-administration of strong inducers of both CYP34 and P- gp.

APPENDIX 13 GFR ASSESSMENT
Inadequate renal function is defined as <30% of 1 standard deviation (SD) below normal GFR for 
age and size as determined by the Schwartz formula [eGFR (ml/min /1.73m2) = 0.413 * (height 
(cms)/serum creatinine (mg/dL). If serum creatinine concentration  is measured in SI units 
(umoles/L), divide this number by the c onversion factor of 88.4 to get the SI units (mg/dL) before 
inserting into the Schwartz formula to calculate eGFR.

APPENDIX 15 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until beco ming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hy sterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
•Premenarchal
•Premenopausal female wi th 1 of the following:
−Documented hysterectomy
−Documented bilateral salpingectomy
−Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of  the participant’s medical 
records, medical examinatio n, or medical history interview.
•Postmenopausal female
−A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of ame norrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of othe r biological or phys iological cause s. In addition, females under 
the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone, (FSH) level 
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Note: Females treated with hormone replacement thera py, (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may re quire a washout period in order to obtain a  physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the inves tigators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH levels. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long a s 6 months. If the serum FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the  woman can be considered 
postmenopausal.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PARTICIPANTS OF CHILD BEARING  
POTENTIAL
Any one of the approved methods of contraception (highly effect ive and/or less than highly 
effective) listed below is r equired during st udy durati on and f or 30 days after treatment has been

•Bilateral tubal occlusion
•Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
• Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception whe n complete abstinence is 
elected. 
•WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
•Acceptable alternate methods of hi ghly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abs tinence

NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consi stently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive metho ds for participants participating in clinical studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with th e study tr eatment, which may reduce the 
efficacy of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception i s permissible only when there is sufficient 
evidence that the IMP and other study med ications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contracept ion 
would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems  are acceptable methods of contraception in the

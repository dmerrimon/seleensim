PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
The purpose of this research study is to compare two different drugs used for hypothyroidism, 
a disease in which the thyroid is unable to produce enough hormones to regulate some of the 
body functions. This study may help guide the future development of medicines used in 
hypothyroidism. You are being asked to participate in this study because you may meet the 
requirements for study participation.
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
Hypothyroidism is a common condition that occurs when the thyroid does not produce 
enough hormones to regulate body functions. Patients with hypothyroidism are usually given 
tablets that contain replacement thyroid hormones: LT4 or LT3. Levothyroxine (LT4) is an 
inactive form of the thyroid hormone that must be converted into its active form (T3) in the 
body. Several studies showed that LT4 might not be sufficient to produce enough T3 in the 
body. For this reason, the addition of a synthetic form of T3, called liothyronine (LT3), is 
thought to improve the symptoms of hypothyroidism. 
The U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both drugs, LT4 and LT3, in tablet 
form for the treatment of hypothyroidism. However, in this study, these drugs will be given in 
liquid form. This study is designed to compare LT4 and LT3 to each other and to placebo (a 
look-alike inactive substance). The study will test whether LT3 works differently than LT4 on 
the cardiovascular system and help us to better understand the effects of these drugs on your 
heart and on the metabolism of your body.

Thyroid hormone medications (levothyroxine and liothyronine) are used to treat lo thyroid 
hormone levels, which are caused by surgery or disease of the thyroid gland. In this study, we 
use thyroid hormone medications to study their effects on the heart and the vascular system. 
This is defined as “experimental” use of a drug, where there is no immediate expectation to 
cure or treat a disease. Although the levothyroxine and liothyronine have been used for many 
years, there is always the possibility that you may develop an unexpected reaction .
Your participation in this study will include one screening visit (to make sure that you qualify 
for the study) plus three additional visits. During the three visits, we will measure the effects of 
the drugs on the heart and the metabolism. Approximately 20 individuals will participate in 
this study. 
The screening visit will last approximately 45 minutes, and it can be scheduled in either the 
morning or afternoon. Each of the study visits will last approximately 5 hours and a half and 
will be scheduled in the morning. 
PROCEDURES
If you decide to be in this research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form after you 
have had all your questions answered. 
At your screening visit (Visit 0), your medical, social and medication history will be recorded 
and a physical exam will be performed. This exam will include measurements of your weight 
and vital signs (pulse, blood pressure and temperature). Blood samples will be collected for 
routine lab tests and to determine eligibility. Approximately 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood will be 
collected. If you are unsure of your pregnancy status, a blood pregnancy test will be 
performed. If the result of the test is positive, the medical responsible investigator will notify 
you and you will not qualify to participate in the study. You will also have an electrocardiogram 
(EKG - tracing of the electrical activity of the heart) performed. 
If you qualify for the study, you will be scheduled for visits 1, 2 and 3. During Visits 1, 2 and 3, 
you will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to receive LT3, LT4, or placebo. By the end 
of the study, you will have received all three treatments (one per visit).
Your first visit (Visit 1) will be scheduled at least 24 hours after your screening visit. Prior to 
Visit 1, you will need to be fasting for at least 8 hours. An abbreviated history and physical 
examination with recording of height, weight, waist and hip measurements and vital signs 
(temperature, pulse, respirations and blood pressure) will be performed. A cannula (small 
plastic tube) will be inserted in the arm to draw blood. EKG electrodes will be placed on your 
chest/shoulder/leg and a finger-cuff will be placed to record blood pressure and cardiac 
function. A cardiac ultrasound (echocardiography) will also be done to measure heart function. 
We will also use a Bio-Impedance Analysis (BIA) as a mean to measure body composition. 
Specifically, BIA measures the amount of fluid (water) in your body. You will be asked to lie flat 
on a bed while four electrodes (two on the foot and two on the hand) are applied. A very low-
intensity electrical current (so low that you cannot feel it) is run through your body to measure

the amount of fluid (water) in your body. The test will last approximately 5 to 10 minutes. 
After these measurements, you will be asked to enter in a room and rest in a chair during the 
rest of the visit. This room is  called an indirect calorimeter chamber and will measure how 
much energy you are consuming. Once in the room, you will be asked to rest for 30 minutes 
before one of the study drugs (or placebo) will be administered in liquid form. The study drug 
administered will be randomly chosen (like the flip of a coin) between LT3, LT4 and placebo. 
Additional blood will be drawn every 60 minutes (for a total of 4 hours) after the study drug 
has been administered. Once finished, the canula will be removed from your arm, vital signs 
(Temperature, pulse and blood pressure) will be obtained, you will be asked to leave the room 
and an additional ultrasound of your heart will be performed.
Visit 2 and visit 3 will repeat the exact same procedures performed in visit 1. However, the 
treatment administered will change each time to assure, so that by the end of the study you 
will have received all three treatments (LT3, LT4, and placebo).
Neither you nor the study doctor will know which study drug you are receiving. This is done 
(blinding) so that a fair evaluation of results may be made. This information is only available to 
the study doctor if needed in an emergency.
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS OR PROCEDURES 
This is not a treatment study.  The procedures performed are for study related purposes only 
and not intended to diagnose or treat any specific disease.  However, some of the procedures 
performed in this study are also available in the health care environment.  Please talk with 
regular doctor to see if they are ones you need or want.  The following test performed for the 
study that are also available as a part of medical care include routine laboratory test 
(chemistry and Hematology, pregnancy test), Electrocardiogram -EKG (EKG - tracing of the 
electrical activity of the heart), and Echocardiogram ECHO used to measure heart function. Visit # 0 (

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS
LT3 or LT4 are generally well tolerated but, although unlikely, some side effects are possible:
Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) (up to 2% in chronic use)
Skipped heart beats (up to 6% in chronic use)
Myocardial infarction (up to 2% in chronic use) 
Low blood pressure (up to 2% in chronic use)
Sudden death (up to 2% in chronic use)
Anxiety
Heat intolerance
Weight loss
Note that you will receive a single dose of each of the study drugs, and that the percentages 
we are reporting refers to patients who generally have concomitant illnesses and are treated 
every day with these drugs.
Allergic reactions to LT4 and LT3 are possible.  Severe allergic reactions can be life threatening.
The effects of LT3 and LT4 in pregnant women might involve a risk to the embryo or fetus. 
Therefore, pregnant women may not participate in this study. For similar reasons, women who 
are nursing an infant may not participate in this study. Women who might become pregnant 
should use a medically accepted form of birth control.  
Other risks to participation in this study include the following:
Pain or bruising during blood draws. In rare cases, blood draws may results in 
skin/tissue infection. When possible, blood will be drawn from an existing intravenous 
cannula (tube) or at the same time as regular (standard) clinical blood draws to 
minimize the use of extra blood draws.
The placement of intravenous needles may cause transient pain, and occasional 
infection or bruising at the insertion site.
Minor discomfort of your arm or finger during blood pressure measurement.
Minor discomfort associated with the placement and removal of the electrodes on your 
skin.
BENEFITS TO YOU AND OTHERS
There is no guarantee or expectation that you will receive any medical benefits from being in 
this study. However, this study will significantly improve the knowledge of the two tested drug 
to treat hypothyroidism. In addition, information from this research study may lead to a better 
treatment in the future for people with hypothyroidism.

GENETIC TESTING
This study will use your samples to sequence all or part of your DNA.  Deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) is the “blueprint” or “recipe” that gives the body’s cells instructions on how to do their
 jobs. Scientists can use a test called whole genome sequencing to determine the order of all 
or part of the molecules that make up your DNA, like reading all the letters in a  book 
sequencing is usually done to look for changes in the molecules of DNA that may cause health 
problems..  In this study, genetic testing will be performed by using part of the collected blood 
during Study visit 1 only. We will study variants in the genes that regulate the response to the 
thyroid hormone, and genes that regulate the metabolism of thyroid hormone medications to 
see if any of these changes is associated to a different response to the study medications. 
These changes are not associated with diseases, and have no clinical importance. We are not 
planning to screen for genetic diseases, and the information collected are devoid of clinical 
interest. As such, you will not be informed of the findings of this analysis. We do not expect to 
develop any commercial product from this study, but please note that the data generated by 
the use of genetic material in this study are property of the Virginia Commonwealth University. 
You can decide to decline to participate in the genetic testing but still being part of the non-
genetic study.  If you decide that you do not want to participate in the DNA part of the study 
blood for this test will not be collected.

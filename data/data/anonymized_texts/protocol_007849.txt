Study Title 
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double- Blind, Placebo Controlled, Do se Range Finding Study to 
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Intramuscula r Injection of Human Placenta-Derived Cells 
(PDA-002) in Subjects With Di abetic Peripheral Neuropathy  
Indication 
This study will investigate the efficacy and safety  of intramuscular (IM) injections of PDA-002 
in subjects who have diabetic pe ripheral neuropathy (DPN) as a co -morbidity of Type 2 diabetes.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is to assess  the efficacy of PDA-002 versus placebo in 
subjects with DPN, based on the change from ba seline in epidermal nerve histology at 6 months.  
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and to lerability of IM administration 
of 2 different doses of PDA-002 or  placebo in subjects with DPN. 
The key exploratory objectives of the study are to assess potential trea tment effects of IM 
administration of PDA-002 in subjects with DP N as measured by changes from baseline in: 
 Epidermal nerve histology at 3 months 
 Lower limb microvascular oxygenation  
 Vascular reactivity  
 DPN signs and symptoms 
 Motor and sensory nerve conduction and autonomic function 
 Health-related quality of life 
 Vascular and immune, biomarke rs, and laboratory parameters 
 Assessment of the systemic versus local efficacy of PDA-002 
Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, dose range finding study in 
subjects with DPN.  The study will enroll approximately 24 subjects. Subjects will be 
randomized to receive one of 3 treatments:  PDA-002 (3 x 106 cells), PDA-002 (30 x 106 cells), 
or placebo (vehicle control) in a 1:1:1 randomi zation approach.  Investig ational product (IP) or 
placebo will be administered monthly (3 admi nistrations total; Study Days 1, 29, and 57).  
Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety for approximately one year from the day of the 
last IP administration.  
Study Population 
The study population includes subjects with Diab etic Peripheral Neur opathy due to Type 2 
diabetes mellitus (DM) as defined by the ADA or WHO criteria ( Appendix A ).

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 6 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Length of Study 
Subjects are expected to participat e in the study from screening (Day  28) to 1 year after the -last 
IP injection.   
Subjects will undergo a Screening Period of up to 28 days. During the Screening Period 
eligibility will be confirmed and baseline assessme nts will be performed. Subjects will then enter 
a 6 month Treatment Period consisting of 8 study visits.  During the Treatment Period, IP will be 
administered on Study Days 1, 29, and 57, and efficacy  and safety evaluations will be performed 
as outlined in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  Subjects will then ente r a Follow-up Period.  The 
Follow up Period will consist of bi-monthly study vi sits to continue to assess safety and longer-
term efficacy. 
End of Trial 
The End of Trial is defined as eith er the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the 
post-treatment follow-up, or the date of receipt of th e last data point from the last subject that is 
required for primary, secondary a nd/or exploratory analysis, as prespecified in the protocol, 
whichever is the later date. 
Study Treatments Subjects will be randomized 1: 1:1 to receive one of the following dose levels of IP:  
 PDA-002 Dose Level 1:  3 x 10
6 PDA-002 cells administered IM on Study Days 1, 
29, and 57.*  
 PDA-002 Dose Level 2:  30 x 106 PDA-002 cells administered IM on Study Days 1, 
29, and 57.* 
 Placebo (vehicle cont rol) subjects will receive placebo (vehicle control) administered 
in the same manner and at the same time points as the PDA-002 dosing groups. 
*Subjects will be dosed in the same leg.  The leg of injection will be the leg with the 
lowest combined qualifying NTSS-6 and UENS  and NIS-LL score.  In the case of a 
subject with an equal score for both legs, th e choice of the leg to inject is at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
PDA-002 and placebo (vehicle control) units will be  shipped to the study sites as cryopreserved 
units and will be thawed and filled into  syringes prior to IM injection. 
Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments 
The following efficacy assessments will be perf ormed as outlined in the Table of Events 
(Table 1 ). 
The primary efficacy assessment is the evaluation of change from baseline in Epidermal Nerve 
Fiber Density (ENFD) at 6 months. 
Efficacy will also be assessed in an explorator y manner by evaluating changes from baseline in 
the following: 
 ENFD at 3 months 
 Microvascular oxygenation of  the lower limbs by Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) 
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 7 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015   Vascular reactivity by Laser Doppler Iontophoresis and Nerve Axon Reflex 
measurements.  
 The 6-item Neuropathy Total Symp tom Score (NTSS-6) assessment 
 The Neurological Impairment Scor e of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL) 
 The Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS) 
Additional efficacy signals indicating changes in motor and sensory nerve conduction and 
autonomic function as evaluated by: 
 Nerve conduction studies  
 Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testi ng (QSART).  QSART is a measurement 
of autonomic involvement by evaluating pos tganglionic sudomoto r function deficits 
in the foot, distal le g, and distal thigh. 
Changes in health-related quality of life (QOL) will be assessed by the Norfolk QOL-DN.  
Various experimental biomarker analyses will be  performed to assess changes in the vascular 
and immune profile.  Samples for biomarker analys es will include blood a nd epidermal tissue. In 
addition, an assessment of the systemic vs. lo cal efficacy of PDA-002 will be evaluated.   
Overview of Safety Assessments Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the type, frequency, and severity of adverse events 
(AEs). As such, the following safety assessments will be performed as outlined in the Table of 
Events ( Table 1 ). 
 Assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
 Physical examinations including complete neurological examinati ons and vital signs 
 Clinical laboratory tests including chem istry, hematology, urinalysis, evaluation; 
urine pregnancy testing if applicable 
 Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) 
 Retinal assessments  
 Concomitant medications and procedures 
 Immunological assessments  
 Anti-human leukocyte antig en (HLA) antibodies 
Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The sample size of 24 subjects to tal, 8 per treatment arm, was selected in order to provide 
preliminary efficacy and safety information in  a randomized, double-blind fashion.  The study is 
designed to provide an estimation of the treatment effect of activ e therapy and placebo to plan a 
sample size for the next study. 
Based upon a previous study ( Jacobs, 2011 ), the mean ENFD was 1.56 fibers/mm at baseline and 
3.07 fibers/mm after 6 months of treatment with a standard deviation of 1.5 fibers/mm for the 
mean increase. Assuming the same treatment effect  is observed from baseline, the sample size of

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 8 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  16 subjects actively on therapy resulting from co mbining the 2 active arms has a 96% power to 
detect a similar mean change at 6 months from ba seline, with a two-sided test and a Type I error 
rate set at 0.05. Assuming the subjects treated with placebo would not have a change from 
baseline, the study has 60% power to detect si milar differences between placebo and active 
therapy with PDA-002, with a two-sided te st and a Type I error rate set at 0.05. 
Efficacy and Safety Analyses 
The planned efficacy and safety analyses will be  fully described in a comprehensive SAP.  
The efficacy analyses will also include a descript ive assessment of the exploratory objective to 
evaluate whether the treatment effect of PDA-002 is systemic or local.  This will be done by 
taking into account the intersubje ct variability between measuremen ts taken from the left and the 
right leg.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disease in which hyperglycemia damages the nerves, kidneys, eyes, 
and blood vessels over time. The estimated incide nce of diabetes in th e United States (US) 
exceeds 1.9 million new cases annually, with an overall prevalence of over 25 million people or 
8.3% of the US population ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011 ).  Type 2 DM 
(adult onset or non-insulin depende nt diabetes) is by far the most common form, occurring in 
about 95% of subjects diagnosed with diabetes . Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most 
common complication of DM.  It develops  on a background of long standing, chronic 
hyperglycemia, associated metabolic derangeme nts, and cardiovascul ar risk factors. 
Although the underlying mechanis ms of DPN remain unclear, central features in the 
development and progression of DPN are neural  cell degeneration and decreased nerve blood 
flow, and are usually associated with both axona l degeneration and demye lination.  This results 
in spontaneous pain (burning pain, electrical or  stabbing sensations, deep aching pain, etc.), 
hyperalgesia, and diminished sensation which is typically worse at night.  
Therapies for the treatment of DP N are currently limited to pain relief (tricyclic antidepressants, 
serotonin norepinephrine reupt ake inhibitors, anti convulsants, opioids, and non-prescription 
analgesics).  There are currently no treatment s approved to treat the underlying disease.  
Human placenta-derived cells (PDA-002) are characterized as  a cellular immune modulating 
agent that has the potential to induce angiogenesis. PDA- 002 is a mesenchymal-like cell 
population derived from normal, full-term human placental tissue.  PDA-002 is culture-expanded 
as a plastic-adherent, undiffere ntiated in vitro cell populati on that expresses the nominal 
phenotype CD34-, CD10+, CD105+ and CD200+.  PDA-002 cells constitutively express 
moderate levels of human leukocyte antigen (H LA) Class I and undetectable levels of HLA 
Class II, and they do not expr ess the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86.  PDA-002 is 
genetically stable, displaying a normal dipl oid chromosome count, normal karyotype, and 
exhibits normal senescence after prolonged in vitro culture. 
Similar to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) ( Aggarwal, 2005; Nauta, 2007 ) in vitro studies 
have shown that PDA-002 is capable of immunomodulation. PDA-002 suppresses T-cell 
proliferation and modulates other cell types i nvolved in immune and inflammatory responses 
such as T-cell subsets, m acrophages and dendritic cells. 
In vivo biodistribution and safety studies usi ng mouse models have demonstrated that PDA-002 
cells do not proliferate in any ti ssues and are not associated with  any observed toxicity or tumor 
formation. In a biodistribution study, PDA-002 cells were not detectable at Day 8 in the injected 
muscle by bioluminescence imaging. The cells did not distribute to other organs, including the 
lungs. The cells were only detected at the site of injection and in the draining lymph nodes. 
The potential beneficial effect s of PDA-002 on cellular components of the neurovascular system 
were tested using a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiment al systems.  The capacity of 
PDA-002 to elaborate angiogenic factors, induce endothelial cell survival/proliferation, induce 
endothelial cell migration, and induce endot helial cell tube form ation was assessed.

Confidential and Proprietary 16 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  In rat and mouse models of pe ripheral neuritis, placen tal-derived cells have demonstrated dose 
dependent analgesic effects including pain re duction, suppressed immune  cell infiltration, and 
reduced mechanical sensitivity. The analgesic effects were equivalent to high dose gabapentin. 
Additionally, treatment with PDA-002 in mouse hind limb ischemia models demonstrated 
improvement in blood flow and induced the form ation of new collateral blood vessels suggesting 
angiogenic activity. The effects were comparab le to VEGF controls. Please refer to the 
Investigator’s Brochure for details of these studies.  
PDA-002 is currently being investigated in 3 independent human studies in subjects with 
complications of DM.  The in itial (ongoing) phase 1 open-labe l, dose escalation study (CCT-
PDA-002-DFU-001) is being conducted in 15 subject s with peripheral arte rial disease (PAD) 
with diabetic foot ulceration (D FU) who were refractory to conve ntional therapy.  In this study, 
intramuscular (IM) inje ction of either 3 x 106, 10 x 106, 30 x 106, or 100 x 106 PDA-002 cells per 
treatment on Study Day 1 and Study Day 9 in the affected lower limb was being investigated.  Though designed as a safety study, results have dem onstrated efficacy in the healing or closure 
of the index ulcer within 3 months following the initial dose of PDA-002 in 15 subjects to date. 
Five subjects had complete healing, and 2 subjec ts had approximately 50% healing of their index 
ulcer within 3 months.  There was a trend for subjects to have increases in their peripheral 
circulation as measured by the ankle brachial index (ABI). The mean increase in ABI from 
screening to the start of do sing was 0.003. A clinically signi ficant increase in ABI at 3
 months 
was observed following dosing (0.15). PDA-002 was safe and well tolerated in these subjects 
who had DFU with PAD. 
Study PDA-002-DFU-002 is a Phase 2, randomi zed, double blind, place bo-controlled, dose 
range finding study in subjects who have DFU with PAD.  Three doses of PDA-002 (3 x 106, 10 
x 106 and 30 x 106 cells) versus placebo will be evaluate d in 2:2:1:2 randomization approach, 
with the lower number of subjects to be allocated to the highest  active dose.  Approximately 133 
subjects will be enrolled.  This study is desi gned as an efficacy a nd safety study with wound 
closure of the index ulcer within 3 months after dosing and retaining wound closure for the 
subsequent 4 weeks as the primary endpoint.  Th e study is ongoing, and the data remain blinded. 
Study CCT-PDA-002-DFU-003 is also a Phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled 
dose range finding study in 24 subjects who have  DFU with PAD. The study is designed to 
assess the safety of repeated monthly IM admini stration of PDA-002, and to generate the data for 
a clinical proof of m echanism.  The study is investigati ng 3 monthly doses with PDA-002 dose 
levels (3 x 106 or 30 x 106 PDA-002 cells) on Study Days 1, 29, and 57.  Vascular functional 
parameters as well as potential novel biomarkers will be assessed to predict efficacy and to 
characterize the treatment respons e in order to evaluate the pha rmacodynamics of treatment with 
PDA-002.  The study is ongoing, and the data remain blinded. 
To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDA-002, this Phase 2, randomized, double blind, 
placebo-controlled study will enroll 24 subjects  with DPN.  The study will employ the same 
doses and dosing schedule of PDA-002 as the aforementioned proof of mechanism study.  The 
primary endpoint of the study is to assess change s in epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD), an 
indicator of small nerve fi ber involvement in DPN ( Jacobs, 2011 ). Symptoms of small fiber 
neuropathy correlate with a decrease in the numbe r, density and length of small nerve fibers in 
the epidermal layer.  Therefore, an in crease in ENFD may in dicate PDA-002 induced 
neurogenesis. Additionally, since DPN involves both small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve

4.1. Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, pl acebo-controlled, dose range finding study in 
subjects who have DPN.  The study will enro ll approximately 24 subj ects. Subjects will be 
randomized to receive one of 3 treatments:  PDA-002 (3 x 106 cells), PDA-002 (30 x 106 cells), 
or placebo (vehicle control) in a 1:1:1 random ization approach.  Inve stigational product or 
placebo will be administered monthly (3 ad ministrations total on Study Days 1, 29, and 57). 
Subjects will be treated and evaluated as  indicated in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  
Subjects will undergo a Screeni ng Period (up to 28 days in du ration) to determine study 
eligibility and baseline levels of signs and sy mptoms of DPN will be established.  Subjects will 
then enter a Treatment Period (6 months in durat ion).  During the Treatment Period, subjects will 
be evaluated on an ongoing basis (at 8 scheduled  study visits).  Subjects will receive IM 
injections of IP on Study Days 1, 29, and 57 as fifteen 0.30 mL injections (below the knee and 
above the ankle) in one lower extremity in a blinded manner.  After completing the Treatment 
Period, subjects will enter the Follow-up Period where they will continue to be evaluated at 
scheduled study visits over the subsequent months. 
An analysis of all study data will  occur after the last subject has completed Visit 9 (Month 6) and 
after the last scheduled study visit. Analyses to  be performed can be found in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan. 
The study will be subject to oversight by an i ndependent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).  
The DMC will review unblinded efficacy and sa fety data on an ongoing basis (both scheduled 
and ad hoc [if needed]) as outlined in the DMC Charter. 
4.2. Study Design Rationale 
Therapies for the treatment of DP N are currently limited to pain relief (tricyclic antidepressants, 
serotonin norepinephrine reupt ake inhibitors, anti convulsants, opioids, and non-prescription 
analgesics). Current treatments do not adequately  address the symptoms in  a large proportion of 
subjects with DPN, and there ar e no approved treatments that ta rget the underlying disease.  
One of the major pathophysiologic factors that contributes to DPN is damage to the vasa 
nervorum or the vascular supply to  the nerves involved in DPN. In  DPN, vascular damage to the 
vasa nervorum is induced by glyc osylated proteins interacting w ith receptors to cells that are 
relevant to the atherosclerotic process, oxidative stress to the vessel wall, and hyperglycemia 
inducing protein kinase C, which is responsib le for increased blood vessel permeability, nitric 
oxide dysfunction, and increas ed leukocyte adhesion ( Kles, 2006 ).   
Results from the rat hind limb ischemia model show  that mesenchymal like stromal cells isolated 
from human placenta (formulated for IM injectio n as PDA-002) have poten tial clinical use in 
tissue repair through increasing angiogenesis. Fu rthermore, PDA-002 cells implanted in a mouse 
model of chronic hind limb ischemia improve d blood perfusion and limb functional recovery 
(see Investigators Brochure).  
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 21 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  The assessment of changes in nerve function a nd microvascular oxygenation in subjects with 
DPN will be based on a combination of evaluatio ns that will assess nerve histology, DPN signs 
and symptoms, and tissue perfusion and oxygenati on using measurement methods listed in the 
Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
With regard to route of administration, IM administration of PDA-002 has demonstrated an 
acceptable safety profile to date. After IM ad ministration in animal models, there was no 
evidence of distribution to the vascular compartment and PDA-002 cells were detected only at 
the site of administration and draining lymph no des. Care will be taken to avoid systemic 
injection of cells.  
The doses selected for this study are based upon th e effective doses adjusted for body weight that 
were administered in the previ ously described hind limb ischemia (HLI) animal models, as well 
as the dosing in the Phase 1 study PDA-002-DFU- 001. Data on the first 3 dose cohorts of the 
Phase 1 study in which subjects were administered 3 x 106 cells, 10 x 106 cells and 30 x 106 cells 
on Days 1 and 8 demonstrated that the doses were well tolerated with no reported dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). To date based upon the observed safety profile from the Phase 1 study, no new 
risks have been identified for PDA-002 that would preclude dosing in the Phase 2 studies. 
For this study, subjects will be randomized to receive PDA-002 or placebo in one lower 
extremity in a blinded manner. Although PDA-002 is  being administered IM, it is unclear if the 
therapeutic effect is localized to  the area of injection or systemic . In pre-clinical HLI studies, the 
therapeutic effect of PDA-002 wa s similar in animals administrated the IM and intravenous (IV) 
formulation. The mechanism of action of PDA-002 is due to a modulation of the immune system 
from a pro inflammatory to anti-inflammatory stat e that facilitates angiogenesis both in the area 
directly in contact with PDA- 002 along with other areas that ma y be affected by inflammation 
and ischemia. Since DPN causes a symmetrical  dysfunction to the ne rves of the lower 
extremities, assessments of nerve function as we ll as changes in neurologic signs will be 
assessed in both legs in order to determine if the therapeutic effect of PDA-002 is local vs. 
systemic.   
The dosing schedule of PDA-002 in this study will  be 3 repeated monthly administrations. The 
schedule is based on the safety of  3 repeat IM doses of PDA-002 de monstrated in animal studies. 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure fo r detailed information co ncerning the available 
pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clini cal studies, and AE profile of PDA-002.  
One additional design feature of this study is th at while PDA-002 is injected into one leg, both 
legs are checked for changes in neuropathy signs and symptoms. This will enable determining if 
the effects of PDA-002 on DPN are limited to the area in which the cells are injected, or the 
effect is systemic.

4.3. Study Duration 
Subjects are expected to particip ate in the study from screening (up to Day -28) to 1 year after 
the last IP injection. 
Subjects will undergo a Screening Period of up to 28 days.  During the Screening Period 
eligibility will be confirmed and baseline assess ments will be performed.  Subjects will then 
enter a 6 month Treatment Period consisting of 8 scheduled study visits.  During the Treatment 
Period, IP or placebo will be administered on St udy Days 1, 29, and 57, and efficacy and safety 
evaluations will be performed.  Following this, subjects will then  enter a Follow-up Period.  The 
Follow up Period will consist of sche duled bi-monthly study visits to  continue to assess safety 
and longer-term efficacy.

documents. 
IP Administration Vital Signs:  Vital signs including heart rate, respiration, blood pressure, and 
body temperature will be monitored prior to star ting the injections and at 1 and 2 hours after 
completion of the injections (± 15 minutes). 
IP Administration Additional Blood Sampling:   Blood samples for tryptase and histamine, 
coagulation assessments (PT/PTT), and explorator y biomarkers will be collected 2 hours before 
(± 15 minutes) IP administration and also at 2 hours after IP administration for tryptase and 
histamine assessments as indicated in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ).

SAEs that will be followed until the last study vi sit and made known to the investigator at any 
time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP, as described in Section 11.1.  
The Follow-up Period will take place from Visit 10 through Visit 13 and include Early 
Termination. Visits should occur on the day specif ied ± 3 days or ± 7 days as specified in the 
Table of Events ( Table 1 ).  
All other procedures (a s discussed in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2) will be conducted as per the 
Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
6.4. Efficacy Procedures 
The following efficacy assessments will be perf ormed as outlined in the Table of Events 
(Table 1 ). 
Epidermal Nerve Fiber Density (ENFD):   This assessment relies on an immunohistochemical 
localization of a neural antigen within axons.  Hi stological specimens will consist of serial 3mm 
thickness punch biopsies of the epidermis taken bilatera lly at the lateral aspect of the distal legs.  
To quantify ENFD (fibers/mm of epidermis), th e pathologist manually counts the number of 
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 31 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  epidermal nerve fibers in 3 to 5 sections and divides the value by the lengths of the epidermal 
specimens in millimeters.  In addition, a quantifi cation of the autonomic sudomotor (sympathetic 
cholinergic) and pilomotor (sympathetic adrenerg ic) nerve fibers will be conducted within the 
same biopsy. 
Histology of Immune Cells:  Two skin biopsies will be taken from the volar aspect of the 
forearm.  The first biopsy will be used for histology analysis to evaluate the inflammatory 
response by assessing inflammatory cell infiltrati on.  The second biopsy will be used to perform 
mRNA / protein analysis.  
Circulating Blood Biomarkers:  Blood collected to be used for biomarker analysis will include 
whole blood collection for blood immune biomar kers and red blood cell (RBC)-lysed peripheral 
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) sample for the chip cytometry immune phenotyping assay*.   
* These assessments for RBC-lysed periphe ral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) by the 
chip cytometry assay will only be performed at selected sites. 
Hyperspectral Imaging *:  Hyperspectral imaging (HIS) obtains multiple images at discrete 
wavelengths, providing a diffuse reflectance spectrum of each pixe l in the image. The system 
uses wavelengths between 500 and 600 nanomet ers which serve to obtain oxy- and deoxy-
hemoglobin absorption peaks.  Tissue oxygenation im ages or “maps” are then constructed from 
oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin values determined fr om each pixel in the image.  HSI will be 
measured in both lower limbs. 
*This procedure will be measured only if it is available for this study protocol at the 
participating site. 
6-item Neuropathy Total Symptom Score (NTSS-6):   The NTSS-6 questionnaire is used to 
evaluate the frequency and intens ity of neuropathy sensory sympto ms identified by subjects with 
DPN (ie, numbness and/or insensit ivity, prickling, and/ or tingling; burning pain; aching pain 
and/or tightness, sharp shooting la ncinating pain and allodynia a nd/or hyperalgesi a).  Symptoms 
are graded based on the experience of the subj ect during the past 24 hours.  Each symptom 
question can be assigned a maximum score of 3.66 points.  The symptom scores are summed, 
and the total score can range from 0 points to 21.96 points.  A higher sc ore indicates greater 
disability. 
Neurological Impairment Score of the Lower Limb (NIS-LL):   The NIS-LL is an assessment 
tool composed of a sensory subscore (which ev aluates sensory perceptions to touch, prickling 
pain, vibration, joint position, and to 1 gram a nd 10 gram monofilaments), and a motor subscore 
(which evaluates muscle strength, muscle wasti ng, and deep tendon reflexes) in the lower limbs.  
The scale is additive for all deficits and is appl ied in a bilateral manner for each modality tested.  
The subscores are totaled and can range from 0 points (normal neurological function) to 88 
points (absence of all motor, sensory, and reflex ac tivity).  An increase of  2 points is clinically 
significant. 
Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS):  The UENS uses a physical examination specific to 
early sensory predominant polyneuropathy which em phasizes severity and spatial distribution of 
sharp sensory loss in the foot a nd leg.  The total score can range from 0 to 42.  A higher score 
indicates greater disability.

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 32 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Electro physiologic Nerve Conduction Studies:   Nerve conduction studies allow for the 
quantification of the conduction amplitude, veloc ity, and latency of the tibial and peroneal 
nerves, and the amplitude and latency of the sural nerve.   Reduction of amplitudes of recorded 
responses generally indicates a loss of axons. Nerve conduction will be measured in both lower limbs.  
Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Testing (QSART):   QSART is a measurement of 
autonomic involvement by evaluating postganglioni c sudomotor function de ficits in the foot, 
distal leg, and distal thigh.   
Patient Global Impression of Ch ange in Neuropathy (PGICN):  The PGICN is a subject’s 
self assessment to describe and change in symp toms of neuropathy such  as pain, tingling, or 
numbness. 
Health-Related Quality of  Life (QOL) as measured by the Norfolk QOL-DN:   The Norfolk 
QOL-DN is composed of 5 domains (physical f unctioning/large fiber neuropathy, activities of 
daily living, symptoms, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic nerve function) encompassing 35 
scored questions related to subj ects’ neuropathy signs and symptoms , as well as to the impact of 
DPN on subjects’ activities of da ily life.  The total score can range from -2 to 138.  A higher 
score indicates higher disability. 
Vascular Reactivity Measurements*:  Vascular reactivity will be measured by using Laser 
Doppler Iontophoresis and Nerve Axon Reflex meas urements in both lower limbs.  By applying 
acetylcholine chloride, the endothelium-dependent  vasodilatation may be measured.  The MIC1 
iontophoresis system will be used in this study.  Specifically, a small quantity (<1 ml) of 1% 
acetylcholine chloride solution will be used on the forearm of the participating subjects; 
subsequently a constant current of 200 microamper e will be applied for 60 seconds achieving a 
dose of 6 mC.cm
-2.  The single spot reaction will be measured by Laser Doppler Flowmetry 
using a DRT4 Laser Doppler Blood Flow Monitor.  
The Nerve Axon Reflex measurement will be perf ormed at the foot level by using a single point 
Laser Probe during the acetylcholine iontophoresis.  The single spot reaction will be measured 
by Laser Doppler Flowmetry using a DRT4 Laser Doppler Blood Flow Monitor.  The probe will 
be attached to the center of the i ontophoresis chamber.  As the probe  is not in direct contact with 
the foot, it will only measure the nerve axon-related vasodilation.  The results are expressed as 
percentage of increase over the baseline blood flow. 
*This procedure will be measured only if it is available for this study protocol at the 
participating site. 
6.5. Safety 
Safety will be assessed by an ongoing review of clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum 
chemistry, coagulation, pregnancy, urinalysis , physical examination results, vital sign 
measurements, 12-lead ECG at screen ing only, weight, use of concomitant 
medications/procedures, and the in cidence and severity of injec tion site and injection-related 
reactions (including trypta se and histamine) and treatment-emergent AEs.

Confidential and Proprietary 33 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  6.5.1.  External Data Monitoring Committee 
An external unblinded DMC will monitor safety and efficacy information to ensure subject 
safety in accordance with a separate charter.  The external DMC will be comprised of members 
who are not involved in the day- to-day activities of the PDA-0 02 DPN study team.  Data review 
packets will be forwarded to the DMC members for review at least 7 days prior to each 
scheduled DMC teleconference/meeting.  Data will be current through 14 days prior to each 
scheduled DMC teleconference/meeting. 
The external DMC will be convened to assess th e benefit risk of PDA-002 when approximately 
25% and 50% of subjects complete the Month 3 (Visit 6) assessment. Study enrollment will be 
ongoing during these scheduled reviews. 
The external DMC chairman will be notified if an  AE of medical interest should occur and will 
determine if a full DMC will need to be conve yed. During any period of deliberation by the 
external DMC on an AE of medical interest, a temporary hold on enrollment of new subjects will 
be instituted. The AEs of medical interest  that would trigger this process are: 
 Identification of 1 or more subjects  within a dosing treatment arm with ≥ Grade 3 
allergic reaction that is suspect ed to be related to the IP.  
 Identification of 1 or more subjects e xperiencing a suspected unexpected, treatment-
related SAE (SUSARs) within 14 days followi ng the initial dose of the IP suspected 
unexpected serious a dverse reactions.  
 Identification of 1 or more s ubjects with a new malignancy.  
The sponsor will take appropriate action based upon the external DMC recommendation and this 
will be communicated to the investigators.  Th e investigators will be responsible for notifying 
their Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).  The external DMC will evaluate on an ongoing basis all available safety data, in pa rticular all SAEs and their poten tial relationship to PDA-002.  The 
external DMC may recommend modifications to enro llment or to the study design in order to 
ensure subject safety.  Further explanation of th e roles and responsibilitie s of the external DMC 
will be outlined in the external DMC charter.

Confidential and Proprietary 37 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  8. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS 
8.1. Description of Investigational Product 
PDA-002 is characterized as a cellular angi ogenic and immune modulating agent with 
therapeutic potential.  The pr oduct contains a mesenchymal-lik e cell population derived from 
normal, full-term human placental tissue.  The cel ls are culture-expanded as a plastic-adherent, 
undifferentiated in vitro cell population that expresses the nominal phenotype CD34-, CD10+, 
CD105+, and CD200+.  The cells constitutively expr ess moderate levels of HLA Class I and 
undetectable levels of HLA Class II. 
These cells demonstrate a range of potential biol ogical activities which incl ude the ability to (1) 
induce endothelial cell survival, migration and tube formation, s howing angiogenic and 
cytoprotective potential, and (2) modulate T-cell repertoire and affect the M1/M2 balance of 
macrophages demonstrating an immune modulator y effect.  Based on these properties, the 
proposed study will evaluate the safety of PDA-002 in subjects with DPN. 
PDA-002 or placebo (vehicle control) units will be  shipped to the study sites as cryopreserved 
units and will be thawed and f illed into syringes prior to IM  injection.  A PDA-002 unit are 
supplied at 2 dosage strengths and contains appr oximately 3 or 30 million cells in 4.5 mL of a 
5.75% dextran 40/10% human serum albumin (HSA) solution containing 2.5% DMSO for 
cryopreservation.  The solution also  contains Plasma-Lyte and sa line to maintain the cells’ 
osmotic environment.  Placebo (vehicle control)  units contain the above-mentioned components, 
without any cells. The product is intended for allogeneic use. 
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule 
Investigational product (IP) will be administered  on Study Days 1, 29 and 57.  Thawing of the IP 
should not begin until it is confir med that the subject meets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Investigational product thawing will be performed by qualified s ite personnel according to the 
instructions in Appendix E .  Three 3 mL syringes will each be filled with 1.5 mL of IP, and then 
capped.  Syringes will be masked to preser ve blinding, and transferred to the personnel 
administering the injections. 
Subjects will receive IP administ ered as fifteen 0.30 mL injections  (approximately 4.5 mL total) 
in one leg.  The target region is suggested to be  below the knee and above the ankle.  Injections 
are suggested to be at least 1 cm apart horizontal ly and laterally and at a depth of approximately 
1 to 4 cm.  It is suggested that they be administ ered in a pattern of 3 x 5 injections around the leg, 
and injections should not be near a blood vessel. The administrator wi ll be blinded to treatment.  
PDA-002 is not intended for intravenous administra tion.  When the injection is given, the syringe 
should be aspirated to avoid ina dvertent venous administration.  If any blood is aspirated into the 
syringe, the needle is to be pulle d out a little, and the syringe re -aspirated.  If no blood is seen, 
the IP may be injected. 
Vital signs (including heart ra te, respiration, blood pressure , body temperature) will be 
monitored prior to starting the in jections and at 1 and 2 hours (± 15 minutes) after completion of 
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 38 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  the injections.  Blood samples for tryptase a nd histamine, coagulation assessments, and 
exploratory biomarkers will be collected as indicated in the Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
The investigational cente rs must also offer appropriate supplemental services that support 
clinical care to ensure that the protocol sp ecified IP administration and monitoring will be 
followed. 
Administration Instructions.  Under aseptic conditions, PDA-002 or placebo will be injected 
IM at 15 sites in one limb on Study Days 1, 29, and 57.  The injection volume will be 0.30 mL per injection site.  A 3.0 mL syringe with a 20 to  22-gauge 1.5-inch long n eedle will be used to 
inject the IP.  The target region is suggested to be below the knee and above the ankle.  
Injections are suggested to be at least 1 cm apart horizontally and laterally and at a depth of 
approximately 1 to 4 cm.  It is suggested that they  be administered in a pattern of 3 x 5 injections 
around the leg, and injections should not be ne ar a blood vessel. The administrator and the 
subject will be blinded to treatment.  
A diagram of the recommended injection grid an d anatomical site selection is provided in 
Appendix E . 
The entire thawed IP must be administered with in 4 hours of thaw start time and within 1 
hour of the syringe fill time.   In the event that it becomes medically necessary to stop the 
injections, the stop time of the injections as well  as the time the injections are resumed must be 
noted in the eCRF and in the source documents.   If less than the total injection volume is 
administered, the volume injected should be re corded and the sponsor should be notified. 
Note :  For this study, all ≥ Grade 3 allergic reacti ons associated with th e use of IP must be 
reported to Celgene Cellular Therapeutics as an SAE within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. 
8.2.1.  Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation shou ld be recorded in the eCRF and in the source documents. The 
decision to discontinue a subject remains the resp onsibility of the treating physician, which will 
not be delayed or refused by the sponsor. Howe ver, prior to disconti nuing a subject, the 
investigator may contact the Medical Monitor an d forward appropriate su pporting documents for 
review and discussion.  Of note, the investigator is not required to contact a medical monitor to 
discuss discontinuation or unblinding  as the investigator has the ab ility to discontinue or rapidly 
unblind subjects.  
Subjects who discontinue will have the procedures performed as listed in the Early Termination 
column as per the Table of Events ( Table 1 ). 
8.2.2.  Overdose 
An overdose is defined for this protocol as a subject receiving any dose of greater than 30 x 10
6 
cells in a 24 hour period.  Advers e events associated with an ov erdose must be collected as an 
Adverse Event as outlined in Section 11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to  one of 3 treatment arms (3 x 106 PDA-002 cells, 30 x 106 
PDA-002 cells, or placebo) via Interactive Voice Response Syst em (IVRS) across sites in a 
double-blind fashion.

number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where  applicable), amount of IP per container, lot 
number, expiry date (where applicable), medication identification/kit number, dosing 
instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements a nd/or regulatory statements as 
applicable.  Additional information may be in cluded on the label as applicable per local 
regulations. 
8.5. Investigational Product Ac countability and Disposal 
Celgene (or designee) will review with the investigator and rele vant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee). 
The investigator(s) or designee is responsible for taking an in ventory and performing a visual 
inspection of each shipment of items received and for completing the “Human Placenta-Derived 
Cells (PDA-002) Product Receipt Record” enclosed  within the envelope provided with the 
shipment.  The investigator(s) or designee will verify the accuracy of the information on the 
form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to the sponsor. 
At the study site, all investigational IP will be  stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.  The IP should remain in the cryogenic shipper provided by Celgene until 
time of use. 
Accurate recording of all IP administration (inc luding dispensing and dosing) will be made in the 
appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and in the source documents.

investigative site during the course of the study. 
If any IP is lost or damaged, its disposition s hould be documented in the source documents.  The 
sponsor will provide instructions to  the investigator(s) for the retu rn or destruction of unused IP 
and IP supplies at the end of the study. 
PDA-002 is regulated by the US FDA as a hum an cellular product.  The FDA (21 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] 1271.290) requires that a reco rd-keeping system be used to track 
human cellular and tissue-based pro ducts from the donor to the cons ignee and vice versa, or any 
other final disposition (for example, shipment  was lost or the integrity of the unit was 
compromised).  In accordance with this regula tion, Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT) has 
established a tracking system for PDA-002. 
For each unit of PDA-002 that is administered, it is important to maintain records sufficient to 
permit prompt identification of th e recipient.  At no time will th e identification of the donor be 
known by the subjects in  the clinical study. 
To facilitate an effective tracking process: 
 Affix the PDA-002 tracking labels provided wi th the units to the recipient’s medical 
records and/or other pertinent records, if any, for each unit of PDA-002 that is 
administered to a subject. 
 Maintain the records described above a nd any other records necessary to permit 
prompt tracking of each unit of PDA-002 to its  recipient or other final disposition. 
 Ensure all such records are legibl e, accurate, indelible, and secure. 
 Ensure all such records are readily av ailable and allow the sponsor and any 
authorized government officers prompt access to such records to the extent required 
by law. 
 Ensure that the record security systems are adequate to ensure the confidentiality of 
recipients who were administered PDA-002. 
 Retain the records referenced in this docum ent for at least 10 year s after the date of 
the administration of PDA-002 to the recipien t or, if that date is not known, the date 
the product is received or di sposed, whichever is latest. 
 Do not further di stribute PDA-002. 
Celgene will instruct the investigator on the return , disposal, and/or destru ction of investigational 
product and/or medical device materials if applicable.  
Celgene (or designee) will review with the investigator and rele vant site personnel the process 
for IP return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Celgene 
(or designee). 
8.6. Investigational Product Compliance 
Accurate recording of all IP administration (inc luding dispensing and dosing) will be made in the 
appropriate section of the subject’s eCRF and in the source documents.

With the exception of individuals noted below, all study site personnel, subjects, and sponsor 
personnel and their designees i nvolved with the study, includi ng the sponsor medical monitor 
will remain blinded to treatment assignment until  the last subject has completed Month 6 and all 
relevant study data have been processed and inte grated into the clinical database and the data 
base is locked. At that time the sponsor a nd their designees will be unblinded.  Study site 
personnel and subjects will remain blinded during the course of the study.  The personnel in the 
Clinical Supply Management Group responsib le for shipping IP and Global Drug Safety 
personnel will be unblinded.  A scientist outside of  the study team will be unblinded to assess the 
data on biomarkers. The following personnel extern al to the sponsor will also be unblinded to 
treatment assignment: the pharmacist, or designee responsible for mixing/ thawing IP, at each 
study site and the IVRS group.  Members of the external DMC will have access to unblinded 
data as specified in Section 6.5.1 .

9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures 
Concomitant medications and procedures for treat ment of DPN are allowed; however, subjects 
should maintain stable doses and stable dose regimens of neuropathy medications (such as 
anticonvulsants like pregabalin, ga bapentin, and antidepressant medi cations such as duloxetine) 
for at least 2 months prior to the initial dose of IP.   
An effort should be made to maintain the subj ect’s standard medical care through the Treatment 
Period (through Visit 9) unless ch anges are necessary to ensure the best care fo r the subject. 
9.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures 
It is recommended that subjects continue to ma intain stable doses /dose regimens of DPN 
therapies through the Treatment Period (Study Visit 9) whenever possible. 
9.3. Required Concomitant Medi cations and Procedures 
Subjects should receive standard of ca re prior to and th roughout the study.

10.1. Overview 
The primary objective of the study is to assess efficacy of PDA-002 in subjects with DPN as 
measured by the change in epidermal nerve hist ology at 6 months following IM administration of 
2 different doses of PDA-002 or placebo.  Asse ssment of epidermal nerve histology will be 
quantified using an immunohistochemi cal technique to determine ENFD. 
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and to lerability of IM administration 
of 2 different doses of PDA-002 or placebo in subj ects with DPN.  Safety will be assessed by the 
type, frequency, severity, and pot ential relationship of adverse ev ents to treatment with IP. 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be  provided in a separate document.  Exploratory 
biomarker analysis and other experimental eval uations will be outlined in separate documents 
and will not be included as part of the Clinical Study Report.   
10.2. Study Population Definitions 
The following analysis populations are planned for this study: 
Screening Population (Screen):  The Screening Population incl udes all subjects who provide 
informed consent and screen for eligibility duri ng the Screening Period (Day -28 to Day -1). 
Safety Population (Safety):   The Safety Population include s all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP. 
Modified Intent To Treat (mITT):  The mITT population includes all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP and subsequently provid e at least one efficacy assessment. 
Other study populations or subgroup populations may be identified during the course of this 
study.  Any additional study populations or subgroups will be clearly identifie d either in the SAP 
or, if after database lock, then as post-hoc  study populations in the clinical study report. 
10.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The sample size of 24 subjects to tal, 8 per treatment arm, was selected in order to provide 
preliminary safety and efficacy information in  a randomized, double-blind fashion.  The study is 
designed to provide an estimation of the treatment effect of activ e therapy and placebo to plan a 
sample size for the next study. 
Based upon a previous study evaluating the th erapeutic effect of a combination of 
L-methylfolate, methylcobalamine, and pyr idoxal 5 phosphate in subjects with DPN 
(Jacobs, 2011 ), the mean ENFD was 1.56 fibers/mm at baseline and 3.07 fibers/mm after 6 
months of treatment with a sta ndard deviation of 1.5 fibers/mm fo r the mean increase.  Assuming 
the same treatment effect is observed from base line, the sample size of 16 subjects actively on 
therapy resulting from combining the 2 active arms has a 96% power to detect a similar mean 
change at 6 months from baseline, with a two- sided test and a Type I error rate set at 0.05.  
Assuming the subjects treated with placebo would not have a change from baseline, the study has

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 44 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  60% power to detect similar differences betw een placebo and active ther apy with PDA-002, with 
a two-sided test and a Type I error rate set at 0.05.   
10.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Baseline and demographic characteristic will be summarized by treatment arm.  Subjects’ age, 
height, weight, and baseline char acteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics, while 
gender, race and other categoric al variables will be provided using frequency tabulations.  
Medical history data will be summarized usi ng frequency tabulations by system organ class and 
preferred term. 
10.5. Subject Disposition 
Subject disposition (analysis population allocation, entered, di scontinued, along with primary 
reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and percentage for both 
treatment and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. 
Protocol deviations wi ll be summarized usi ng frequency tabulations. 
10.6. Efficacy Analysis 
The planned analyses will be fully de scribed in a comprehensive SAP.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be an evaluati on of change from baseline in ENFD at 6 months 
following treatment with either dose of PDA-002 or placebo. Results will be used to assess the proof 
of concept for further study of PDA-002 in subjects with DPN.   The analyses will also take into 
account the possible inter-subject va riability of measurements eval uated in both the treated leg 
(with active or placebo) and the other leg that received placebo. 
Changes in the various exploratory efficacy e ndpoints including within subject differences 
between left and right leg meas urements will be evaluated us ing descriptive statistics.  
In general, exploratory endpoint s that are categorical will be  examined using descriptive 
summaries such as counts and percentages, wh ereas exploratory endpoint s that are continuous 
will be examined using means, standard deviations and medians. The results of the exploratory analyses will allow for better definiti on of the clinical efficacy endpoints. 
10.7. Safety Analysis 
The safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety Population (all subjects who receive any 
amount of IP).  Adverse events, vital sign measur ements, physical examination findings, clinical 
laboratory test results, injection site assessments, retinal assessment results, ECG interpretations, 
and concomitant medications and procedures will  be tabulated and summ arized as appropriate. 
Adverse events observed will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) classification system.  If clinically significant, any or all laboratory 
evaluations should be reported as AEs and repeated more frequently, if clin ically indicated.  The 
severity of the toxicities will be graded acco rding to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) Version 4.03 whenever possible. 
The frequency of AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term.  In 
the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event more than once will be counted only

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 45 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  once.  Adverse events will be summarized by NC I CTCAE grade.  Adverse events leading to 
discontinuation from treatment, events classifi ed as NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or higher, study-drug-
related events, and SAEs will be tabulated and list ed separately.  By-subject listings of all AEs, 
SAEs, discontinuations due to AE s, and deaths will be provided. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized.  Laboratory data will be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE Version 4.03 criteria wherev er possible.  The frequencies of the worst severity grade 
observed during treatment will be displayed in cross-tabulations by screening status. 
Vital signs, ECG, and retinal examination data will be summarized by cross-tabulations 
presenting normal and abnormal values. 
Graphical displays will be provided where useful in the interpretation of results. 
10.8. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis will be conducted when th e last subject comple ted Visit 9 (Month 6).

11.1. Monitoring, Recording and Re porting of Adverse Events 
An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward me dical occurrence that may appear or worsen 
in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening 
concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including 
laboratory test values (as specifi ed by the criteria in Section  11.3 ), regardless of etiology.  Any 
worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the eCRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms  of the diagnosis or 
syndrome.  
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE.  Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is a ssociated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF.  See Section  8.2.2  for the definition of ove rdose.  Any sequela of 
an accidental or intentional overdose of an inve stigational product should be reported as an AE 
on the AE eCRF.  In previous studies doses that were one half log greater than the highest dose 
in this study were not associated with any dr ug related adverse events. If the sequela of an 
overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be  reported on an SAE report form and on the AE 
eCRF.  The overdose resulting in the SAE should be  identified as the cause of the event on the 
SAE report form and eCRF but should not  be reported as an SAE itself.  
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary.  There is no known specific antidote for PDA-002 overdose. 
Actual treatment should depend on the severity of  the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience of the treating physician. 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical  symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or su rgical findings, physical examina tion findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures. 
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded by the Invest igator from the time the subject signs informed 
consent until the last study vis it and those SAEs made known to  the Investigator at any time 
thereafter that are suspected of being related to  IP.  AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) will 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in  the subject’s source documents.  All SAEs must 
be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours  of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent 
form. 
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events 
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to:  
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 47 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.2.1.  Seriousness  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator , the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization 
(hospitalization is defined as an inpati ent admission, regardless of length of stay) 
 Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but  may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of th e other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.  
Any allergic reaction ≥ Grade 3 and associated with the IP  is to be reported as an SAE.   
Events not considered  to be SAEs are hospitalizations for: 
 A standard procedure for protocol thera py administration.  However, hospitalization 
or prolonged hospitalization for a complicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the st udied indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
 A procedure for protocol/disease-related  investigations (e g, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests,  bone marrow sampling).  However, 
hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE. 
 Hospitalization or prolongati on of hospitalization for tec hnical, practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an AE. 
 A procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to starti ng of treatment on study); must 
be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospitalization or prolonged 
hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE. 
 Emergency outpatient treatment or observa tion that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other se riousness criteria above. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pa ge/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide in formation on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action take n regarding IP, and outcome.

Confidential and Proprietary 48 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.2.2.  Severity / Intensity 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must as sess the severity / intensity of the event.  
The severity / intensity of AEs will be graded  based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(CTCAE, Version 4.03); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protoco lDevelopment/electronic_a pplications/ctc.htm#ctc_40 
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity / intensity according to 
the following scale: 
Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild disc omfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activit y, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy require d, hospitalization is possible 
Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention /therapy required, hos pitalization or hospice care probable 
Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death The term “severe” is often used to describe the in tensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itse lf, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe h eadache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with even ts that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
The term “severe” is often used to describe the in tensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarction); the event itse lf, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe h eadache).  This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is 
based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with even ts that pose a threat to a 
subject’s life or functioning.   
Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations. 
11.2.3.  Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relations hip between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspect ed or Suspected as defined below: 
Not suspected: Means a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP 
administration is unlikely or remote , or other medications, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Suspected: Means there is a reasonable possibility that the administration 
of IP caused the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means 
there is evidence to suggest a ca usal relationship between the IP 
and the adverse event.

Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 49 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Causality should be assessed and provided fo r every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available. 
If an event is assessed as suspected of being re lated to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the 
manufacturer when reporting the event. 
11.2.4.  Duration 
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provid e a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event. 
11.2.5.  Action Taken 
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP  as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or  reduction of IP, as appropriat e) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments we re given for the event.  
11.2.6.  Outcome 
The investigator will report the outcome of the event of both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have 
not resolved upon discontinuation of  the subject’s partic ipation in the study must be followed 
until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered or death (due to the SAE).  
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
An abnormal laboratory value is consid ered to be an AE if the abnormality: 
 results in discontinuation from the study; 
 requires treatment, modification/ interrupti on of IP dose, or a ny other therapeutic 
intervention; or 
 is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing 
condition. 
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory ab normalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/s creen of the eCRF.  If the abnormality was not 
a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
If possible, the laboratory abnorma lity should be recorded as a medi cal term and not simply as an 
abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thromboc ytopenia rather than decreased platelets). 
11.4. Pregnancy 
All pregnancies or suspected pre gnancies occurring in either a fe male subject or partner of a 
male subject are immediately reportable events 
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 50 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  11.4.1.  Females of Childbearing Potential 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnanc ies (including a positive pregnanc y test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subjec t occurring while the subject is on IP, or during the course of the 
study, are considered immediately re portable events.  IP is to be discontinued immediately.  The 
pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or other appropr iate method, using the Pregnancy Initial Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form. 
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the female subject  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome m eets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celg ene Drug Safety by facsimile, or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the even t using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form. 
All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the In vestigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be repo rted to Celgene Drug Safety by 
facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigat or’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. 
11.4.2.  Male Subjects 
If a female partner of a male subject taking i nvestigational product beco mes pregnant, the male 
subject taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregna nt female partner should be 
advised to call their health care provider immediately.  
11.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE re quires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF.  All SAEs must be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report  Form, or approved equivalent form.  This 
instruction pertains to initial SAE re ports as well as any follow-up reports. 
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) th at occur during the study 
(from the time the subject signs informed consen t until the last study visit) and any SAE made 
known to the Investigator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being re lated to IP.  SAEs 
occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured. 
The SAE report should provide a detailed descrip tion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospital records and other relevant documents.  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copies of the autopsy report and de ath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
PDA-002 Celgene Corporation 
Protocol CCT-PDA-002- DPN-001 Celgene Cellular Therapeutics 
Confidential and Proprietary 51 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be de tailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent fo rm, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety. 
Where required by local legislation, the Investigator  is responsible for informing the IRB/Ethics 
Committee (EC) of the SAE and providing them  with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. The Investigator mu st keep copies of all SAE information on file 
including correspondence with  Celgene and the IRB/EC. 
11.5.1.  Safety Queries 
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  Th e response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causal ity assessment) may be handled by phone. 
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to PDA-002 based on th e Investigator Brochure. 
In the United States, all suspected unexpected  serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
Celgene or its authorized representative shall notify the Investigator of the following 
information.  
 Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR); 
 Any finding from tests in laboratory animal s that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutage nicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
Where required by local legislation, the Investigat or shall notify his/he r IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects. 
The Investigator must keep copies of all pertinent safety information on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.  (See Section 15.3 for record retention 
information).

12.1. Treatment Discontinuation 
12.1.1.  Events Leading to Suspension of Enrollment Pending DMC Evaluation 
The following events in any subject will trigger a suspension of additional enrollment pending an 
evaluation by the Data monitori ng Committee (DMC) of the event at an ad hoc meeting. Should 
such an event occur, the DMC will review the av ailable data from the subject’s history and the 
event itself as well as available data on all other previously treated subjects.  The committee will 
recommend if it is appropriate to resume enrollment without study modifications, to resume 
enrollment with study modifications or to perm anently discontinue furt her enrollment into the 
study. Operational details are sp ecified in the DMC Charter. 
 Identification of 1 or more subjects  within a dosing treatment arm with ≥ Grade 3 
allergic reaction that is suspect ed to be related to the IP.  
 Identification of 1 or more subjects e xperiencing a suspected unexpected, treatment-
related SAE (SUSARs) within 14 days followi ng the initial dose of the IP suspected 
unexpected serious a dverse reactions.  
 Identification of 1 or more s ubjects with a new malignancy.  
12.1.2.  Mandatory Treatment Discontinuations 
Should subjects experience any of the following ev ents, they may not receive additional doses of 
PDA-002. They should stay on study however, a nd all scheduled evaluations are to be 
performed. 
 A Grade 3 or higher allergic reaction w ithin 24 hours of PD A-002 administration. 
 An episode of symptomatic  arterial vasospasm w ithin 24 hours of PDA-002 
administration.  Examples include acute cor onary ischemia and retinal artery spasm. 
 An episode of new venous thrombosis w ithin 3 days of PDA-002 administration. 
12.1.3.  Additional Treatment Discontinuations

Confidential and Proprietary 54 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  13. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES 
13.1. Emergency Contact 
In emergency situations, the I nvestigator should c ontact the responsible Clinical Research 
Physician/Medical Monitor or designee by teleph one at the number(s) listed on the Emergency 
Contact Information page of the protocol (after title page). 
In the unlikely event that the C linical Research Physician/Medica l Monitor or designee cannot be 
reached, please contact the global Emergency Ca ll Center by telephone at the number listed on 
the Emergency Contact Information page of the pr otocol (after title page).This global Emergency 
Call Center is available 24 hours a day and 7 da ys a week. The represen tatives are responsible 
for obtaining your call-back information and cont acting the on call Celgene/Contract Research 
organization (CRO) Medical Monitor, who will then contact you promptly. 
Note: The back-up 24 hour global emergency contact  call center should onl y be used if you are 
not able to reach the Clinical Research Phys ician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for 
emergency calls.  
13.2. Emergency Identification of  Investigational Products 
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study  unless  in the opinion of the 
investigator, it is absolutely necessary to safely tr eat the subject.  If it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discontinued if, in the opinion of 
the Investigator, continuing IP can  negatively affect the outcome of  the subject’s treatment.  The 
Investigator or authorized person should open the randomization envelope/peel apart the 2-part 
label; use an emergency unblinding personal id entification number (P IN) and call IVRS for 
unblinded dose information, etc. However, every e ffort should be made to contact the Clinical 
Research Physician/Medical Mon itor prior to breaking the blind. Contact or attempted contact 
with the Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor as well as the reason for breaking the 
blind must be documented in the source documents. 
The decision to break the blind in emergency situ ations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delaye d or refused by the Sponsor.  However, the Investigator may 
contact the Medical Mon itor prior to breaking th e blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the 
interest of the subject.  
The investigator should ensure that the code is  broken only in accordance with the protocol.  The 
investigator should promptly notify the Medica l Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be cl early documented by the Investigator in the 
subject’s source documentation. 
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by the investigator thro ugh the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) by using an emergenc y unblinding personal identification number 
(PIN), and the Investigator should ca ll IRT for unblinded dose information.

the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an author ized representative will ev aluate and approve all 
Investigators who in turn will select their staff. 
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assist ing with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments , as well as study-relate d duties and functions, 
including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene informati on. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qua lified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible fo r keeping a record of all subject s who sign an informed consent 
form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, mu st be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries  and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospital char ts, and study-related ch arts) for source data 
verification.  The Investigator mu st ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries. 
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by Celgene on public registry websites) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previ ously disclosed by Celg ene on a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by the Investigator or its institution, or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly

All aspects of the study will be carefully monito red by Celgene or its authorized representative 
for compliance with applicable government regulations with resp ect to current GCP and SOPs  
16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification 
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring pro cedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  All aspects of the st udy are reviewed with the Inves tigator and the staff at a study 
initiation visit and/or at an investigator meeti ng.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protocol , eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/ SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will 
include on-site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as we ll as any appropriate 
communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone .  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Ce lgene representative in accordance with the 
Study Monitoring Plan. 
Accuracy will be checked by performing source data  verification that is a direct comparison of 
the entries made into the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Invest igator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or  via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her 
staff. Monitoring procedures requ ire that informed consents, a dherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 
16.2. Audits and Inspections 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedur es, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Repr esentatives of this unit will conduc t audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celg ene SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator is requ ired to permit direct access to the f acilities where the study took place, 
source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporti ng records of study subj ect participation for 
audits and inspections by IRB/ IECs, regulatory authorities (e g, FDA, European Medicines 
Agency (EMA), Health Canada) and company aut horized representatives.  The Investigator 
should make every effort to be available for the a udits and/or inspections.  If the Investigator is 
contacted by any regulatory aut hority regarding an inspection, he/she should contact Celgene 
immediately.

Diagnostic Criteria by the American  Diabetes Association (ADA) ( ADA, 2014 ) include the 
following: 
1. A fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher,  
or 
2. A 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg/d L (11.1 mmol/L) or higher during a 75-g oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT),  or 
3. A random plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher in a subject with 
classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis  or 
4. HbA1C of 6.5%. The test shoul d be performed in a laboratory using a method that is 
National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Pr ogram (NGSP) certified  and standardized 
to the Diabetes Control and Co mplications Trial (DCCT) assay. 
Whether a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 6.5%  or higher should be a primary diagnostic 
criterion or an optional criterion remains a point of controversy.  
WHO Definition 
Currently HbA1c is not considered a suitable di agnostic test for diabetes or intermediate 
hyperglycemia.

Instructions for Thawing and Preparing PDA-002 
Thawing Protocol and Vial Preparation 
This section must be conducted by an unbli nded pharmacist or by delegated, trained study 
personnel. 
1. Obtain confirmation of enrollment from dele gated personnel responsib le for registering 
subject’s demographic information in the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).  
You will need this information to cross-check  the subject ID number and the information 
on the vial.   
2. Wearing appropriate personal pr otective equipment, obtain froz en vial from the shipping 
container.  
3. Record start time of the thaw procedure. 
If using a water bath, follow steps in bullet 4.  
4. Water Bath Instructions 
a.  Rapidly transfer the frozen vi al into a water bath float.  
b. Transfer the float and vial into a 37°C water bath such that the vial body is 
immersed in the water and the lid of  the vial is supported by the float. 
c. Remove the vial from the water bath afte r 9 minutes.  Investigational product (IP) 
should be predominantly thawed, but may contain a small residual ice crystal.  
d. Remove the thawed vial from float, a nd dry off any excess moisture from the 
outside of the vial.  
If Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT) supplie s alternate equipment for thawing, a separate 
manual for the thawing pr ocess will be provided. 
5. Ensure the vial is well mixed by ge ntly inverting the vial 3 times. 
6. Confirm the contents of the vial by verifying that the vial label matches the information 
on the appropriate forms.  
7. Prepare the vial by removing the lid cap from the vial. Wipe the vial septum with 70% 
isopropyl alcohol, allow the alcohol to dry, a nd insert a self-venti ng Mini-Spike through 
the septum. 
8. Cover the vial label with the prov ided product expira tion sticker.  
9. Blind the vial using the provided blinding bag and secure in place. Place a second product 
expiration label on the blinded vial. 
10. Blind and label the provided 3 mL syringes us ing the provided syri nge blinding labels. 
11. Record the date, time of thaw, expiration tim e, and subject identif ier on the appropriate 
forms.  The product expiration time is 4 hours from the time the vial was thawed.

Prepare as per your instituti ons’ Standard Operating Proce dure by a delegated, trained study 
personnel.  Use aseptic technique. 
1. Ensure that the vial is well mixed by gently inverting the vial 3 times. 
2. Remove the cap from the Mini-Spike and att ach a blinded/labeled 3 mL syringe to the 
vial. 
3. Orient the vial above the sy ringe such that the contents  can be withdrawn into the 
syringe, and retrieve 1.5 mL of the solution. En sure that no air bubbles  are present in the 
syringe. 
4. Disconnect the syringe from the Mini-Spike a nd connect it to a 22 gauge needle. If not 
used immediately (within 30 minutes), the IP may be stored in capped syringes oriented 
vertically (needle side down) for up to  1 hour in the syringe rack provided. 
5. Attach the next syringe to the vial then repe at Steps 3 and 4 until all 3 syringes have been 
filled. 
6. Record the time the syringes are filled on the Subject Dispensation Log. The product 
should be administered within 1 hour from the time the syringes are filled.

Confidential and Proprietary 71 CCT-PDA-002-DPN-001 Amendment 1 Final: 02 Sep 2015  Suggested Injection Pattern in the Gastrocnemius or Soleus Muscle.  
 
                                          
 
The following recommendations are made with the understanding that the investigator or 
designee will use his/her ow n judgment on how best to administer the treatment. 
 Subjects will be treated with IP administ ered intramuscularly (IM) on Study Days 1, 
29 and 57.  
 The target region on the limb is belo w the knee and above the ankle in the 
gastrocnemius or soleus muscle.  
 Injections are to be at least 1 cm apart horizontally and laterall y and at a depth of 
approximately 1 to 4 cm.  For subjects near  their ideal weight, inject at 2 to 3 cm 
depth.  For obese subjects, inject toward the deeper end of the range; for thin subjects, 
inject toward the shallower end of the range. 
 PDA-002 is not intended for intravenous (IV) administration.  When  the injection is 
given, the syringe should be aspirated to a void inadvertent venous  administration.  If 
any blood is aspirated into the syringe, the needle is to be  pulled out a little, and the 
syringe reaspirated. If no blood is observed the IP may be injected. 
 Injections are to be administered in a pa ttern of 3 x 5 injections around the leg and 
injections should not be near  a blood vessel.  See diagram above for injection pattern.

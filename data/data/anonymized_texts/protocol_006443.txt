2. Abstract 
This is a non -randomized, non -interventional study that is part of the RCT DUPLICATE  initiative (www.rctduplicate.org) of the Brigham and Women 's Hospital,  Harvard 
Medical School. It is intended to emulate, as closely as is possible in healthcare insurance  claims data, the PIONEER6  trial described below. Although many features 
of the trial cannot be directly replicated in healthcare claims  data , key design features, including outcomes, exposures, and inclusio n/exclusion criteria, were selected 
to proxy thos e features from the trial. Randomization cannot be emulated  in healthcare claims data but was proxied through a st atistical balancing of measured 
covariates according to standard practice. Investigators assume that the RCT provides the reference standard treatment effect  estimate and that failure to replicate 
RCT findings is indicative of the inadequacy of the healthcare claims data for emula tion for a range of possible reasons and does  not provide information on the 
validity of the original RCT finding.  
The PIONEER 6 trial,  is a is a non -inferiority trial to evaluate the effects of oral semaglutide versus placebo in terms of cardiovascular safety (CV death, nonfatal MI, or 
nonfatal stroke) in patients with type 2 diabetes.  
 
The database study designed to emulate PIONEER6  will be a new -user active comparative study, where we compare the effect of oral semaglutide v ersus sitagliptin 
on MACE outcome among patients with T2DM. Sitagliptin was selected to act as an ac tive-comparator proxy for placebo. Sitagliptin and the class of dipeptidyl 
peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors have been demonstrated not to have an effect on MACE in a series of RCTs, and they are  used in similar stages o f disease/line of 
therapy as semaglutide, as well as being similarly costly.  
The study will use three data sources: Optum Clinformatics, Merative Marketscan, and Medicare.  
Optum: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 – 29th February 2024  
Marketscan: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 - 31st Dec 202 2 
Medicare: Study period between 20th Sept 2019 – 31st Dec 2020

the FDA were not documented 
in the previous version.  
10th March 
2025  3 Appendices  Covariate code algorithms for Pap 
smear, COPD, pneumonia, and 
diabetic nephropathy were corrected.  Errors in the implementation of 
covariate code algorithms for 
Pap smear, COPD, pneumonia, 
and diabetic nephropathy were 
identified.  
17th April 2025  5 Negative control 
outcomes  Added Hernia and Lumbar 
radiculopathy  Given the ongoing discussion 
around semaglutide and its 
potential association with non -
arteritic anterior ischemic optic 
neuropathy (NAION)  as a 
negative control outcome , we 
wanted to include alternative 
negative control outcomes.

4.  Rationale and background 
The purpose of this protocol is to describe the emulation of the PIONEER6  trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Market availability of oral Semaglutide began on 19th 
September 2019.1 The trial enrolled 3,183  participants between January and August 2017 . The trial design was event -driven to collect 122 events, w ith an  
assumption of 3% event rate in both arms over a period of 7 months, which would result in 90% power, to r ule out 80% excess cardiovascular risk to assess 
non-inferiority .2,3 
5.  Research question and objectives 
Table 1 Primary and secondary research questions and objective  
A. Primary research question and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin  (proxy for  placebo)  on MACE outcomes 
(CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke).  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will be superior to sitagliptin at preventing MACE  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion 
criteria): The study population includes patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Type2DM) , >=50 years with established 
cardiovascular disease OR >=60 years with subclinical cardiovascular disease . 
Patients were excluded if they had type 1 diabetes, secondary or gestational diabetes, recent use of 
GLP-1, pramlitinide, or DPP4 -I, had a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, recent m yocardial 
infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina o r transi ent ischemic attack; heart failure class 
IV, personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 o r familial medullary thyroid 
carcinoma, chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, end stage liver disease, malignant ne oplasm 
within 5 years,  current or recent pregnancy, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring 
treatment, history of major stomach surgeries  
Exposur e: Oral Semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Major adverse cardiac event (MACE ), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all cause death  
Time (when follow up begins and ends): 1 days after cohort entry date until the first of outcome, disenrollment, end of study perio d, 365 days 
after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk window), switch between the arms, 
6 
 start of any other GLP1 agonists (including injectable Semaglutide) , Other DPP4 or Pramlintide, 
Nursing home admission  
Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured from inpatient 
hospitalizations and/or death.  
Main measure of effect: Hazard ratio  
 
B. Secondary research question 1 and objective 
Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin on negative control outcomes, including A. 
cataract surgery, B. hernia and C. lumbar radiculopathy  
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that semaglutide will not have a different effect than sitagliptin  
Popu lation (mention key inclusion-exclusion 
criteria): The study population includes patients with Type 2 Diabetes (Type2DM), >=50 years with established 
cardiovascular disease OR >=60 years with subclinical cardiovascular disease . 
Patients were excluded if they had type 1 diabetes, secondary or gestational diabetes, recent use  of 
GLP-1, pramlitinide, or DPP4 -I, had a history of diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, recent myocardial 
infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina o r transient ischemic attack; heart failure class 
IV, personal or family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 o r familial medullary thyroid 
carcinoma, chronic hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, end st age liver disease, malignant neoplasm 
within 5 years, current or recent pregnancy, proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring  
treatment, history of major stomach surgeries . In addition, pati ents were excluded for baseline hernia 
or lumbar radiculopathy  when the negative outcome was hernia or lumbar radiculopathy  respectively.  
Exposur e: Oral semaglutide  
Com parator:  Sitagliptin  
Outcome: Separate analyses were run for cataract surgery, hernia, and lumbar radiculopathy  
Time (when follow up begins and ends): 1 day after cohort entry date until the first of outcome, disenrollment, end of study perio d, death, 365 
days after cohort entry date, discontinuation (30 days grace and risk window), swit ch between the 
arms, start of any other GLP1 agonists (including injectable semaglutide)  
Setting: Patients may be treated in outpatient settings. The outcome will be measured from outpatient 
procedure codes

6.  Research methods 
6.1.  Study design 
Research design (e.g. cohort, case-control, etc.): New user active comparator cohort study  
Rationale for study design choice: For drug safety evaluations, a cohort study of new initiators is a powe rful design that may be able to address 
confounding by indication. It accomplishes this, in large part, through judiciou s selection of an appropriate active-comparator group.4,5 While 
selection of an appropriate comparator in the design phase is crucial, c ohort studies often require additional adjustment of measurable 
confounders. A common method for adjusting for confounding is via a propensi ty score (PS) .

 6.2.  Study design diagram 
 
Note: The CV disease inclusion may include acute MI codes but any acute MI in the 60 days is excluded. History of heart failu re is an inclusion criterion, but heart failure class IV is excl uded.

 6.3.  Setting 
6.3.1 Context and rationale for definition of time 0 (and other primary time anchors) for entry to the stud y population  
Time 0 in the database study was defined to emulate randomization to treatment oral semaglutide versus sitagliptin in the clinical trial design. See appendix 
tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . 
6.3.2 Context and rationale for study inclusion criteria:  
Study inclusion criteria were defined to emulate the inclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code 
algorithms . A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.3.3 Context and rationale for study exclusion criteria 
Study exclusion criteria were defined to emulate the exclusion criteria for the trial. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for  operational definitions and detailed code 
algorithms . A flowchart of the study cohort assembly is provided in Appendix 3.  
6.4.  Variables 
6.4.1 Context and rationale for exposure(s) of interest 
The exposure and comparator were defined to emulate the agents compared  for the trial , Oral Semaglutide versus Sitagliptin  (proxy for placebo) . See appendix 
tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms .  
Algorithm to define duration of exposur e effect:  
Assuming the effect of the drugs  lasts for 30 days after the days’ supply  finishes , we allow 30 days gap between the dispens ing (grace period) and also add 
30 days  extension  at the end of days’ supply of  the last  dispens ing (exposure risk window) .  
6.4.2 Context and rationale for outcome(s) of interest 
The primary outcome for the database study was defined to emulate the primary outcome for the tria l of MACE. In the trial, th is was a combination of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. In our e mulation, due to inability to capture caus e of death, our modified MACE outcome was measured as inpatient 
myocardial infarction, inpatient stroke, and all -cause mortality. See appendix tables 1 and 2 for operational definitions and d etailed code algorithms . Optum 
includes  death  information from the inpatient discharged dead status, s ocial security death master file, and deaths scraped f rom obituaries or other sources.  
MarketScan includes information from the inpatient disc harged dead status up until 2016.  Medicare includes information from the inpatient discha rged dead 
status, NDI cause of death, and social security death master file.  The positive predictive value for the myocardial infarction outcome  algorithm  using ICD -9 codes 
was observed  to be 88.4% and 94% in validation stud ies.6,7 The PPV for the ischemic stroke outcome algorithm was 88% and 95% in validation studies using ICD9 
10 
 codes.6,8 The ICD9 code algorithms were mapped to ICD10 codes and reviewed by a clinician, but the perform ance of the mapped codes was not further 
validated.  
Secondary outcomes from the trial that will be evaluated include:  
1. Myocardial infarction  
2. Stroke  
3. All cause d eath  
Control outcomes of interest include:  
1. Cataract surgery. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitagli ptin. 
2. Hernia. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide versus sitagliptin.  
3. Lumbar radiculopathy. This is a negative control outcome where no difference in effect is expected for semaglutide  versus sitagliptin.  
6.4.3 Context and rationale for follow up  
Both on -treatment (OT) and intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted. Adherence in clinical practice is expected to be much worse than in the trial , therefore 
the OT analysis will be the primary analysis . The OT analysis  targets the relative hazard of outcomes while on treatment and may more close ly emulate the effect 
observed in highly adherent trial participants.

1 Follow up ends at the first occurrence of any of the selected criteria that end follow up.  
6.4.4 Cont ext and rationale for covariates (confounding variables and effect modifiers, e.g. risk factors, comorbidities, comedications) 
We identified a series of covariates that were likely confounders due to being strong risk factors for the primary outcome that were associated with choice of 
treatment. These include demographics, disease severity related variables, como rbid conditions, comedications, frailty, healthcare utilization and markers of 
health  seeking behaviour.

6.5.  Data anal ysis 
6.5.1 Context and rationale for anal ysis plan 
The study will use a propensity score (PS) based fine -stratification weighting method with 50 strata7. The PS will be estimated as the probability of initiating oral 
Semaglutide versus Sitagliptin given the baseline patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regre ssion models. 50 strata will be created based on the 
distribution of PS in oral Semaglutide treated patients, and weighted Sitagliptin initiators proportional to  the distribution of oral Semaglutide initiators in the PS 
stratum. As diagnostics for PS models, the study will evaluate distributional overlap, weight distribution, and covariate bal ance using standardized differences post -
weighting. The  study will estimate the hazard ratio for oral Semaglutide versus Sitagliptin inhibitor on MACE outcome in the weighted popul ation using a Cox 
proportional hazards model.  
Table 4. Primary, seconda ry, and subgroup analysis specification

 Hypothesis: Oral Semaglutide might decrease risk of MACE outcome compared to Sitagliptin

Re-weighted 
population 
distribution  We will re -weight the 
population distribution of the 
pooled database study 
cohorts to reflect that of the 
RCT if that information is 
made public prior to 
publication of our results.  We will learn about potential 
effect modification due to 
different distributions of key 
characteristics such as 
age/sex in the RCT versus the 
database study.  The population distributions will 
be more aligned.  The measurement of these 
population characteristics may be 
measured differently in the RCT vs 
database study, with different 
levels of specificity and sensitivity.  
Negative control 
outcomes, including 
cataract surgery, 
hernia, lumbar 
radiculopathy  We evaluate negative control 
outcomes of cataract surgery, 
hernia, and lumbar 
radiculopathy, where no 
causal effect is expected from 
semaglutide or sitagliptin  We will evaluate the potential 
impact of residual 
confounding on this outcome 
for which there is not 
expected to be a causal effect  The evaluates the robustness of 
the interpretation of the primary 
analysis by evaluating the 
potential magnitude of 
unmeasured confounding  This analysis assumes that the 
confounding structure is the same 
or similar for the negative control 
outcome as the outcome of interest  
PS-adjustment 
method  Instead of 1:1 PS matching, 
we will use PS fine 
stratification weights.  
The analytic cohort will be 
asymmetrically trimmed at 1% 
of the tails. The analytic 
cohort will be weighted to 
estimate the average effect in 
the treated (ATT).  
Each exposed patient will be 
assigned a weight = 1.  Use of fine -stratification 
weights will have more power 
than 1:1 matching  More power to estimate ATT  More complex to understand than 
simple 1:1 match, potentially less 
closely balanced

sensitivity and tipping

difference in result from 
emulation of SUSTAIN6 to 
recalibrate the result from the 
database study emulation of 
PIONEER6. We will conduct a 
tipping point analysis with a 
range of plausible estimates 
of the expected difference.  We expect to learn about the 
performance of BenchExCal in 
an example where we emulate 
an RCT for an expanded 
indication and an RCT result 
for the expanded indication is 
available.  The analysis will calibrate the 
primary result based on expected 
differences due to bias and/or 
design emulation differences and 
propagate uncertainty regarding 
the impact of these factors into 
the frequentist primary result  The ability to appropriately calibrate 
the result depends on how “close” 
the clinical context is between the 
initial and expanded indication. The 
approach assumes that the net 
effect of bias and design emulation 
differences is the similar.  
 
6.6.  Data sources 
7.6.1 Context and rationale for data sources 
Reas on for selection: The study will be conducted in 3 US health care claims databases: Optum Clinformatics (2019 -Feb 2024), Merative Marketscan (2019 -
2022) and Medicare (a sample that includes all patients with diabetes or heart  failure diagnosis, 2019 -2020).  
Strengths of data source(s): Each data source contains deidentified, longitudinal, date -stamped information on patient enrollment, demographics, 
inpatient/outpatient diagnosis and procedures, admission a nd discharge dates, and medication dispensation. The dea th data is captured in the  Optum database 
from inpatient discharge status, social security death master file, and deaths scra ped from obituaries or other sources. The death data in MarketScan is captured 
from the social security death master file and in patient discharge status. It is recognized that the social security death master file has hig h specificity and positive 
predictive value for deaths. While this data resource has under captured deaths since 2011, the captu re of deaths is not expe cted to be differential between 
compa red exposure groups. The death data is captured in the Medicare database from inpatient discharge status, and so cial security death master file .12-14  
Limitations of data source( s): Patient healthcare encounters are only observable when they are enrolled in an insurance plan that contributes to the databas e. 
Patients may change insurance plans for multiple reasons. Both Optum Clinformatics and Merative MarketScan are primarily empl oyer based insurance 
databases where patients may disenroll with job changes. Patients in Medicare may  move in and out of fee -for-service plans. We are excluding person -time in 
health maintenance organization (HMO) plans due to concerns about the completeness of capture of  diagnoses and procedures. This means that we require 
patients to be enrolled in Medicare parts AB and D during the baseline assessment window and censo r patients if they switch t o part C. In claims data, dispensing 
data for inpatient medication is unavailable. Diagnoses reflect billing practic es, therefore algorithms (preferably validated) are needed for accurate phenotyping  of 
patient conditions.  Services that are not covered by insurance do not appear in the data. The trial evaluated cardiovascular deaths, however we will evaluate all 
cause death in the emulation because most deaths in this cohort of patients at high cardiovascular ri sk will be related to ca rdiovascular reasons, the cause of 
death is not recorded fo r databases not linked to NDI, and the perfor mance of NDI at identifying cardiovascular causes of  death may be suboptimal.14

 Data source provenance /curation: Information about Optum Clinformatics and Merative MarketScan c an be found in data dictionaries and user guides that are 
provided to clients. Information about Medicare data provenance and curation can be found on the ResDac website .15

6.7.  Data manag ement 
 Tracking data:  The Data Use Agreement (DUA) Custodian (Principal Investigator) and the Division Operations Manager (Winta Tekle) are responsible for receiving 
and creating a record of new data associated with the given request. The Operations Manager is responsible for al l indexi ng and archiving of documents and 
electronic media related to data that the Division receives  and will log data location, data contents, and associated DUA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
numbers in the Division’s centralized tracking system . 
Handling and storage: In-scope data will be stored utilizing Mass General Brigham approved information systems – i.e., Division servers and Mass General 
Brigham network storage.  
29 
 Archiving : Data retention and any removal will be executed by the Division Ope rations Manager (Winta Tekle) and Data Manager (Todd Mac Garvey). The Division 
follows Mass General Brigham enterprise record retention policies and follow the term s of the agreement throu gh which the in -scope data was received.  
Information security: The Division follows Mass General Brigham’s Enterprise Information Security Program (EISP). The EISP h elps by providing assur ance that 
Mass General Brigham information and information systems  are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure , duplica tion, modification, or destruction in 
order to maintain their confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To th at end, the EISP policies, standards and procedure s create an information security framework 
that is aligned with the rec ommendations of the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) publication 27001 and the National Institute of St andards 
and Technology’s (NIST) publication 800 -53 Family of Controls and MGB regulatory and legal requirements (as a HIPAA covered  entity).  
 
Mass General Brigham workforce members are required to c omplete new workforce privacy and information security  training upon hire and annually thereafter. 
Refresh training is provided as appropriate. Mass General Brigham workforce m embers are required to review and sign a Confidentiality Agreement upon hire and 
annually thereafter. Additionally, we follow Enterprise Information Security and Privacy policies,  including Managing Workfor ce Members Information Security 
Responsibilities Policy, which was developed to help assure that Mass General Brigham workforce members are competent and eligible to support the informat ion 
security responsibilities associated with their role. Mass General Brigham workforce, including D ivision staff, are required to comply with Enterprise Information 
Security and Privacy Policies.  
 
Facilities:  The research team uses a highly secure, state -of-the-art, computing facility housed at Mass General Brigham’s Corporate Data Centers in Needham and 
Marlborough, Massachusetts  as well as Amazon Web Services (AWS).  We maintain redundant storage for maximal data integrity and high -speed data access.  
The Division uses Mass General Brigham corporate provisioned servers to analyze and store data in c onnection with this projec t. There are strict access controls 
enforced by technical means to ensure that only study staff who have been approved t o conduct d ata analyses and contracted data engineers are able to access 
data (e.g., Mass General Brigham Authentication (Active Directory) utilized; auditing, logging, and monitoring enabled; firew alls enabled; etc.). All Division servers 
used in this study are acce ssible to only authorized staff only through the MGB network and utilizing VPN as appropriate (i. e., users must be on the net work and 
logged into VPN to access). Mass General Brigham has a network info rmation security monitoring team and in -scope servers a re enrolled in enterprise security 
tools (e.g., vulnerability scanning service, antivirus, etc.).   
The Division also uses AWS. In -scope AWS services / resources have undergone review and assessment by Mass General Brigham’s Informatio n Security Risk 
Assessment Team/ InfoSec Risk Management Team as required and in alignment with NIST 800 -30: Guide for Co nducting Risk Assessments. In -scope AWS 
servers are for our exclusive use (reserved instances), are covered under our organization’ s Business Associate Agreement wit h AWS. In -scope servers are housed 
in anonymous facilities that are not branded as AWS fac ilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimet er and at building ingress points by 
professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.  
Security attributes and controls for the Division’s use of in -scope AWS in connection with this project include: encryption at rest and in transit (industry standard 
AES-256 encryption, SSL/TSL), anti -malware, latest OS updates and patches as well as an ti-virus; multi -factor authentication (MFA), Identity and Access 
Management, including SSO; auditing and logging; princi ple of least privilege, including for traffic and po rts (e.g., deny al l default configurations), use of VPC 
enabled Step functions, etc.; separation between environments; minimum necessary (out of the box AWS roles are not used as they can be overly permissive); a ll 
data would reside in the US domestic regions – use only US east HIPAA compliant region; performance monitoring enabled and revie wed as per internal 
processes; passwords compliant with enterprise password policy and, as appropriate, more protective password requi rements; et c. Our Division’s AWS use is also 
subject to ongoing evaluation and monitoring as well – e.g., vulnerability sc anning and management, access review, etc.  
30 
 A data file list will be maintained in Amazon S3 and tracked through Cloudtrail and Cloudwatch. Reporti ng of data file availa bility for any file stored in an S3 bucket 
will be controlled by MGB.  
Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC are integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS 
service in Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon VPC. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon EC2, Ama zon EBS, and Amazon VPC as events, including calls 
from the console and from code calls to the APIs. MGB IT/security staff have full access to Clou dTrail to ensure that CloudTr ail monitoring is available at all times. 
Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a ne ar-real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Amazon Cloud Trail can log, continuously 
monitor, and retain account activity related to acti ons across the MGB AWS infrastructure. CloudTrail pro vides event history of MGB AWS account activity. This 
event history simplifies security analysis, resource change tracking, and troubleshooting and complies with requirements to e nsure the data file inventory is 
controlled by MGB.  
Backups : Backups are created using industry recognized Cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., 256 -bit AES encryption) as appropriate and required. Data are backed 
up within the MGB network from the MGB Needham data center to the MGB Marlborough data center via replicatio n/mirroring and volume -level snapshots.  AWS 
Backup supports both instance -level backups as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and volume -level backups as separate snapshots based on the resource tags. 
AMIs allow MGB IT and security staff to create backup s of all S3 and EC2 instances. This backup approach allows elimination of EC2 instances when access to 
CMS data files is no longer needed. Use of temporary instances will allow highest security control to be applied regarding for whom and when CMS data fil es are 
accessible.  
In addition to the safeguards listed above, the Division follows enter prise privacy and information security policies and mai ntains internally procedures in 
connection with this project to safeguard the data in connection with this project as appropriate a nd required including: Physical Security and Environmental 
Controls for Electronic Information Policy; IT Access Control Standards for Users policy; Safeguarding Fax Copiers Printers T elephone Use and Pagers; Physical 
Removal and Transport of Protected Hea lth Information and Personal Information policy, etc.

6.8.  Quality control 
Senior Programmers and Research Specialists perform QA/QC on raw or common data model converted data via SAS/R/Aetion software. The protocol will be 
iteratively developed and pre -specified data checks including feasibility counts and balance on baseline covariates will be cond ucted with outputs reviewed  by both 
MGB and FDA team members. Team members will review code li sts to ensure  fidelity to intended algorithms  
6.9.  Study size and feasibility 
First feasibility assessment: Details of power calculations after applying eligibility criteria and mat ching on ages, sex and  comorbidity score are available in  appendix 
4. 
31 
 Second feasibility assessment: Details of power calculations after matching or weighting on all pred efined propensity score v ariables are available in appendix 5. . 
Propensity score distribution plots with c -statistics are available in appendix 6. Table 1 showing prevalence of baseline characteristics and standardized differences i n 
distribution are available in appendix 7.  
7.  Limitation of the methods 
As we are using secondary data and the data were not collected for research, some important variables may not be collected or  will be measured imperfectly. We 
have selected validated algorithms when possible and we have created proxies for important v ariab les that are not directly captured in the data to reduce 
confounding by unmeasured factors.  One measurement difference is for the primary outcome, where for the RCT, MACE was def ined as stroke, myocardial infarction, 
and cardiovascular death, whereas in ou r database study, it is defined as stroke, myocardial infarction, and all cause  death.  
When comparing results from an RCT to a database study that emulates the design, we assume that the findings from the single RCT are internally valid which is not 
guaranteed.  
Although we plan to emulate the important features of each RCT as closely as possible in healthcare claims, t here may be some  elements of RCT design that are not 
emulable with a database study, which means that the  study generating  RWE and the RCT will address slightly different clinical questions. For example, in routi ne 
clinical practice , adherence to treatment is typically not as high as it is in an RCT w ith strong measures in place to encourage adherence to the study protocol. This 
means that there is m ore discontinuation and short -term medication use in the patients identified in claims databases than trial participants.  
Apparent agreement between RCT and database study results could occur if the effects of multiple factors (chance, em ulation d ifferences, bias) cancel each other 
out.

Final review and approval by 
FDA after comments were 
addressedDate reviewed: 3rd October 2024In order to complete the initial power analysis, a dummy out come of a 90-day gap in database enrollment was used. T his outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comp arative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. We 
completed a 1:1 PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. The PS included only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combined comorbidity index. Power calculations  are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008).
Superiority Analysis (fine strati) Superiority Analysis (fine strati)The clinical trial was powered to find the absolute risk difference of 4%. Using the values of risk fro m the trial, we calculated the risk ratio and

 4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  and Rationale  
Heart Failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by structural, metabolic and 
neurohormonal disorders that impair cardiovascular function, and is one of the leading causes of death in the developed world.   
The worldwide prevalence of heart failure in adults is estimated to be 2 -6%, with a higher 
prevalence in industrialized nations.  Each year in the US, 670,000 new cases are identified
1 and 
of the prevalent cases, 1 million are end- stage HF (NYHA class IV).  There are approximately 
5.7 million cas es diagnosed in the United States and up to 14 million cases in the European 
Union2.  Advanced HF is associated with significant  morbidity and disabling symptoms at rest.  
The one year mortality rate in patients newly diagnosed with NYHA c lass IV HF is 
approximately 25%3.  Improvements in treatment and survival as well as expansion of the aging 
population have contributed to the rising incidence  and prevalence of the disease.  
Cardiac transplantation is currently the most effective therapy for advanced heart  failure.  
However, the lack of available donor organs restricts the use of heart transplantation to fewer  
than 2500 patients  per year in the United States.   In 2009, 2211 heart transplants  were performed 
at 127 heart  transplant centers in the United  States  (United  Network  for Organ Sharing website  
accessed December 15, 2011).  Currently there are 3100 patients on the UNOS heart transplant list, with an average waiting time of approximately 6 months 
4.  
This Post Approval Study (PAS) is a study to provide  continued and consistent  follow -up on 
patients who have participated in prior IDE trials of HeartWare devices .  Eligible patients 
include those  who have reached the primary endpoint or outcome of that trial and entered longer 
term follow -up, as well as, those who have not yet achieved the primary endpoint or outcome at 
the time of PMA  approval . 
4.2 HeartWare® VAS  
A full  description of the HeartWare® VAS  is included in the  Instructions  for Use (IFU) for the 
approved indications .   
Ventricular Assist Devices are options for advanced HF patients  that sustain life, improve 
general medical condition and enhance quality of life as they  provide a bridge to cardiac 
transplantation or, in some patients, an alternative permanent therapy.  Approximately 32% of 
the patients who receive heart transplants are bridged with ventricular assist devices (ISHLT 
2011 data  4).  The use of permanent LVADs as an alternative to transplantation (Destination 
Therapy) has also proven to be more effective than medical therapy. 5 
The HeartWare® VAS  was designed to assist a failing left ventricle.  The HeartWare® VAS  
utilizes a blood pump, the HVAD® Pump or simply HVAD, which is a continuous flow, 
centrifugal device with a non- contacting rotating impeller and dual motor stators for compact 
size and increased fault tolerance.  The impeller is suspended by a combination of passive magnetic and hydrodynamic forces.  The inflow cannula is an integrated component permanently

 affixed to the pump and is attached to the left ventricular apex through a c -clamp type sewing 
ring.  Blood is pumped from the left ventricle into  the ascending aorta via  a 10mm gel 
impregnated polyester conduit that can be adjusted to fit patient size and is protected from kinking or compression by a strain relief.  This design facilitates surgical implantation entirely within the pericardial space avoiding the necessity for an abdominal pump pocket and potentially reducing perioperative risks such as bleeding and infections.  While the HeartWare
® VAS  is 
small (160g) , it can deliver up to 10 liters/minute of blood flow. 
A 4.2 mm diameter percutaneous driveline connects the pump to an external controller.  The controller, powered by two batteries or by one battery and electricity from the wall or car outlet, 
regulates pump function and provides digital messages, alarms and LED light patterns that alert 
patients to pump parameters that are outside pre -set limits or warn of malfunctions in the system.  
A separate monitor is used to display system performance and to change controller operating 
parameters.  A battery charger is also included.  
4.3 Previous Patient and Trial Experience  
4.3.1 CE Mark Trial  
The initial clinical experience with the HeartWare® VAS  was a 50 subject BTT trial conducted at 
5 centers in Australia, Austria, Germany and the U nited Kingdom .  The first 25 subjects were 
enrolled between March 2006 and December 2007 and the results were submitted for regulatory approval in the EU.  CE Mark was received on January 29, 2009.  The trial was continued to enroll  another 25 patients for a total of fifty (50) patients , with  the last patient  enrolled in 
December 2008.   
The primary endpoint of survival to 180 days  was successfully reached by 90% (45/50) of the 
patients .  
As of January 18, 2012, 29 of the 50 subjec ts were transplanted, four were weaned from the 
HeartWare
® VAS  due to myocardial recovery, 11 died while on support, and 6 subjects remain 
on support.  All 6 subjects currently supported by HeartWare® VAS  have been on the device for 
more than 3 years, with 2 patients greater than 4 years.  
4.3.2 US Bridge to Transplant Trial (ADVANCE)  
The HW003 Evaluation of the HeartWare® VAS  for the Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure 
Trial, or ADVANCE, was a multi -center, prospective trial that used an external 
contemporaneous  control group from the NIH sponsored Inter -Agency Registry for Mechanical 
Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS®) to compare the efficacy of HeartWare® VAS  with 
commercially approved LVADs.  The INTERMACS® control subjects were not homogeneous 
with respect to the type of left ventricular assist device, although more than 90% of the subjects 
received the HeartMate II LVAD (Thoratec Corporation) which is the only approved continuous flow LVAD in the United St ates.  In both the HeartWare
® VAS  and INTERMACS® registry 
control group, subjects were followed to death, device explant, cardiac transplantation or survival to Day 180.

 In ADVANCE there were 160 subjects enrolled at 30 sites .  Of the 160 subjects, 17 we re screen 
failures  and 143 subjects were implanted with the HeartWare® VAS .  Three  of these 143 patients 
were implanted under emergency use treatment.  Of the remaining 140 patients implanted, 3 
patients were found to have protocol violations which were pr e-specified in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) as major violations.  As a result, there were 137 subjects in the “per 
protocol” population and 140 subjects in the “safety” population.  The first subject was 
implanted on August 18, 2008 and the 180 day follow up for the last subject enrolled and 
implanted was completed August 23, 2010.   
The primary endpoint for the trial was defined as alive on the originally implanted device 
(HeartWare® VAS  or LVAD in the registry control group), transplanted or explan ted for 
recovery at the 180 day time point, all of which collectively constituted “success.”  
Secondary efficacy measures include overall survival, quality of life improvement, as measured 
by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and EuroQol  EQ-5D™ - (EQ -5D) 
and functional status improvement.   
Secondary efficacy measures were based upon change from baseline in the HeartWare® VAS  
treatment group since registry data were not specified for comparison in the protocol.  Safety endpoints consisted of the incidence of INTERMACS
®-defined events, serious adverse 
events (SAE), including neurocognitive changes, unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE); 
and device failures and malfunctions.  Events were classified and presented according to both the INTERMACS
®-defined adverse event categories and MedDRA coded categories.  Adverse 
events from the INTERMACS® control group were not pre -specif ied to be available for 
comparison. 
The pre -specified primary endpoint analysis was a comparison of success rates using a non -
inferiority margin of 15%.   In the HeartWare
® VAS  group the success rate in the ITT / Safety Population at 180 days was 
90.7% (127/140) and in the Per Protocol population 92.0% (126/137).  The success for both 
Safety and Per Protocol populations in the Control group was 90.1% (448/497).  
The Primary analysis found that the 95% one -sided upper confidence limit (UCL) on the 
difference in success rates between HeartWare® VAS  group and controls was 4.5% for the 
Safety population and 0.9% for the Per Protocol population.  Each of these limits was less than the 15% non -inferiority margin (p <0.0001).

 6.0 Study Design  
No new patients are being screened or implanted with the HeartWare® VAS  for this trial;  it is a 
follow -up trial only.  
Patients will be approached to participate in this PAS  after the HeartWare® VAS  receives PMA 
approval for the indicated use as a bridge to cardiac transplantation .  
Patients who participated in  a prior trial under IDE G070199 will be approached for this PAS as 
follows : 
• Patients who are on continued HeartWare® VAS support, (original or exchange device)  
• Patients who have been explanted for transplant or recovery and have not yet completed 6 
months of follow -up 
Patients who  participated in prior trials under IDE G070199 who will not be approached to 
participate in this follow -up study include:  
• Patients who have been explanted for transplant or recovery and have completed at least 
6 months of follow -up (documented in the prior IDE trial).  
• Patients who have had their HeartWare® VAS exchanged for another FDA approved 
VAD (e.g. HMII®) 
 
All patients will have an enrollment visit and then be followed at 6 month intervals until 5 years 
post implant of the original HeartWare® VAS . 
Patients who are explanted for transplant or recovery will be followed to 6 months post explant  
at which point their participation in the trial will be considered complete .  This visit will record 
patie nt status  only.  
6.1 Number of Clinical Sites  
This follow -up trial will be conducted at up to the 25 sites who enrolled and implanted patients 
with the HeartWare® VAS  under IDE G070199, and who have a patient active under that IDE at 
the time of approval .

 15.0 Reporting Requirements (interim and final reports) 
Interim reports will be submitted at 6 -months, 12 months, 18 and 24 months then yearly until the 
end of study follow -up.  The report after the last patient has completed the 5 year (60 month) 
follow -up visit post original device implant will be the end of study, or  final report.  
16.0 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
This trial is to be conducted according to the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with ICH GCP and applicable regulatory requirement(s)  inclu ding the  Code of Federal Regulations 21CFR Part 812, 21CFR Part 54 and 
21CFR Part 56. 
Good Clinical Practice is a standard for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, 
recording, analyses and reporting of clinical trials that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of the trial subjects are protected.  
The medical care given to, and medical decisions made on behalf of subjects should always be the respo nsibility of a qualified physician. Each individual involved in conducting the trial 
should be qualified by education, training and experience to perform his or her respective task(s).  
16.1 IRB Approval  
All centers are required to obtain IRB approval of the Post Approval Study, addenda, and 
Informed Consent Forms (ICFs)  prior to the study start at that center.   This study will be 
undertaken only after full approval has  been obtained from the applicable IRB and a copy of this 
approval has been received by Hea rtWare . 
16.2 Informed Consent  
The patient must give written informed consent to participate prior to enrollment in the trial.   No 
study procedures may be conducted unless consent is given and documented.  
Prior to participation in the trial, the subject, should receive a copy of the signed and dated written ICF and any other pertinent written information.  
All subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they can cease participation at any time without necessarily giving a reason and w ithout any penalty or loss of benefits to 
which they are entitled.  
The signed and dated consent form will be kept by the Investigator.

 16.3 Patient Data Protection  
Patients will be identified on the CRF by a patient identification number.  The investigator will  
maintain a confidential patient identification list to link medical records and patient identification 
numbers. 
All data used in analysis and reports will be used without identifiable reference to the patient.  At 
all times throughout the study, confident iality shall be observed by all parties involved . 
All patients consented for this study will be informed and must agree to the use and disclosure of their study information by the institution and investigators to HeartWare, their agents and representatives, the FDA or other government agencies or review boards.  This authorization is a 
HIPAA Authorization: Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information .  If the institution 
requires that an IRB -specific Confidentiality Authorization  (HIPAA) form be used, then the site 
must provide a copy of this form to HeartWare for review and approval . 
17.0 Investigators , Investigator Responsibility and Trial Administrative 
Structure 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the clinical study is performed in accordance with the Post Approval Study protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP Guidelines, and Code of Federal Regulations 21CFR Part 812, 21CFR Part 54 and 21CFR Part 56 and any country laws, as applicable.  
A Sub -Investigator (e.g., ass ociates, residents, research fellows) is any individual member of the 
clinical trial team designated and supervised by the principal Investigator at a trial site to perform critical trial- related procedures and/or to make important trial -related decisions.  
The Investigator must maintain a signed list of appropriately qualified persons to whom they have delegated significant trial -related duties which must be specified.  
Trial -related medical decisions are the responsibility of a qualified physician (the Inve stigator or 
delegate).  
The standard requirements for IRB review, informed consent, Patient data protection, investigator agreements, financial disclosures, protocol deviations, device accountability, and investigator reports will apply.  
17.1 Investigator Agreem ent 
Prior to study initiation, the Investigator must sign an Investigator Agreement (HeartWare or to provide Investigator Agreement template to sites).  The Investigator Agreement identifies the Investigator’s legal and ethical commitments with respect to the conduct of the clinical study as 
defined in 21 CFR Part 812, Part 56, Part 50, and Part 54.

 17.2 Financial Disclosure  
A Financial Disclosure Form must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator and sub -
investigator(s) prior to study initiation.  HeartWare or designee will provide Financial Disclosure 
Form to sites.  Updates to financial disclosure will be made during the course of the study and 
for 1 year following completion of the study (21 CFR Part 54).  The Financial Disclosure form is 
required to record the Investigator’s and Sub- Investigator’s financial interests in HeartWare, 
which may be a potential source of bias in the outcome of the clinical study.  
17.3 Post Approval Study  Deviations and Medical Emergencies  
The Investigator will not deviate from the Post Approval Study protocol without the prior written approval of HeartWare except in medical emergencies or in unforeseen, isolated instances where minor changes are made that will not increase the subject’s risk or affect the validity of the study.  In addition HeartWare will not allow any deviations/waiver from the Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.  
In medical emergencies, prior written approval for deviations will not be required, but HeartWare personnel must be notified via telephone within 24 hours of occurrence.  
If there are any circumstances during the clinical trial which can affect the safety o f the subjects, 
users or third person, HeartWare and the investigator will take all necessary security measures immediately to protect the subjects, users and third persons against direct or indirect risk.  HeartWare and the investigator have to inform the  responsible IRB/IEC immediately about these 
new circumstances and the measures taken.  
However in case of any deviation for a scheduled assessment e.g. out of window assessment, missing laboratory sample, and prior approval from HeartWare is required in ad vance for 
changes in or deviations from the Post Approval Study. 
17.4 HeartWare (Sponsor)  
HeartWare accepts the responsibilities of the Sponsor.  
17.5 Contract Research Organization  
A CRO (commercial, academic or other) may be employed by HeartWare to perform 1 or more of its trial -related duties and functions.  The extent of the delegation must be specified in a 
contract between the involved parties.  The CRO should implement quality assurance and quality control but HeartWare will have the right to supervise the imp lementation of the methods for 
quality assurance and quality control.

 18.0 Documentation of Trial Data 
18.1 Case Report Forms  
An Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be utilized to collect all patient data during the 
course of the study. Data must be entered i nto eCRFs in English.  The eCRFs are to be 
completed within 72 hours of the subject's visit, with the exception of results from tests performed outside the investigator's office, so that they always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participa ting in the study.  A predetermined/designated individual (s) will be 
responsible for completion of the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).  The PI will ultimately be responsible for the review, completion and accuracy of data entered into the eCRF.  
Com pleted eCRFs will be verified by a Sponsor monitor at the site at regular intervals 
throughout the study.  The Investigator will allow the monitor and the FDA or other regulatory 
bodies to review the study files, patient CRFs, medical records and other study- related 
documents. 
18.2 Data Management  
18.2.1 eCRF  
During data entry in the eCRF, queries will be directly issued to clarify missing data, inconsistencies and incorrect values.   After completion of the eCRF, further queries will be 
issued to the Investigator to clarify (e.g., inconsistencies resulting out of the medical and manual review).  Resolutions of queries will be made by the Investigator or the trial site’s designated persons.  
18.2.2 Coding  
Medication names will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary.  Adverse events will be coded according to the NIH funded INTE RMACS
® registry definitions.  Adverse 
events  categorized as “Other” within the INTERMACS® definit ions will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) . 
18.2.3 Source data  
Source data is all information in original records and certified copies of original records of 
clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinica l trial necessary for the 
reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents which 
comprise clinical documentation, data and records (e.g., hospital records, clinical and office 
charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, e valuation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments and data and records arising from other departments 
such as the pharmacy, laboratory and medico -technical departments).  
Clinical documentation relevant to the trial includes all records in any form including, but not 
limited to:

 • Medical history/physical condition of the patient before enrollment sufficient to verify  
• Post Approval Study entry criteria  
• Dated and signed notes for specific results of procedures and exams  
• Laboratory reports  
• Information related to adverse events  
• Notes on subject’s condition with device implanted and when explanted  
• Stroke Scale and Quality of Life studies  
• Discharge Summaries/Procedure reports  
• Autopsy reports  
All clinical documentation and data arising from the trial are to be kept by the Investigator who 
has to provide direct access for trial -related monitoring, audits, IEC review, and regulatory 
inspection.  
At the end of the trial, the Investigator will recei ve a certified copy of all data captured for their 
subjects, in human readable form, on a read -only CD -ROM.  Data captured of all subjects will be 
sent to the sponsor in human readable form, on a read- only CD -ROM for archiving . 
18.2.4 Data Review and Data Quality  Assurance 
All eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and clarity.  Missing data will be investigated by the monitor and clarified by study personnel as necessary.  HeartWare may request additional documentation such as physician procedure notes or writte n summaries relating to adverse events 
or procedures.  HeartWare will be responsible for the quality control of the database and confirming the overall integrity of the data.

 19.0 Data Monitoring and Administrative Requirements  
19.1 Monitoring of the Study  
HeartWare or designees will perform on -site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary.  Visits 
are usually made at regular intervals .  At these visits the monitor will compare the data entered 
into the eCRFs with the hospital or clinic records (source documents).  At a minimum, source 
documentation must be available to substantiate proper ICF procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of AEs, administration of concomitant medication 
and device receipt/  return records.   
The s ponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the investigator (and as appropriate the study 
coordinator) will be available, the source documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study- related documents.  
19.2 Quality System, Audit and inspection  
HeartWare is responsible for implementing and maintaining quality assurance and quality control systems with written Standard Operating Procedures.   HeartWare is responsible for 
ensuring that all parties involved with the trial agree to direct access to all trial -related sites, 
source data and documents, and reports for the purposes of monitoring and auditing by HeartWare, and inspection by FDA.  
19.3 Audit  
The Investigator will permit an appointed person by the Quality Assurance  Unit of HeartWare to 
audit the facilities and documentation at agreed times.  Auditors are independent of the clinical trial and its performance.  
An audit is the systematic and independent examination of trial -related activities and documents 
to determine whether the evaluated trial -related activities were conducted, and the data recorded, 
analyzed and accurately reported according to the Post Approval Study protocol, HeartWare 
Standard Operating Procedures, GCP  and applicable regulatory requirements.  
19.4 Inspection  
Inspection is the act by the FDA of conducting an official review of the documents, facilities, records and other resources that are deemed by the FDA to be related to the clinical trial and that may be located at the trial site, at HeartWare, at the CRO, or at other facilities deemed appropriate by the regulatory authorities.  The Investigator is obliged to cooperate with any inspection.  
In the event of an FDA audit, the Investigator must allow FDA access to the study records for inspection and copying.  The Investigator must inform HeartWare of any FDA audit and provide HeartWare with a copy of Form FDA 483 (Lis t of Observations), if issued.

• Site Delegation and Responsibility log 
• Source Documents  supporting information on eCRFs  
• Any other study specific documents  
19.6 Protocol Modifications  
Changes to the protocol during the trial will be documented as amendments.  The amended 
protocol will be signed by the relevant personnel at HeartWare, and by the Investigator(s).  
Depending on the contents of the amendment and local legal requirements, the amendment will 
be submitted to the relevant IRB.  
If an amendment substantially alters the trial design, increases the potential risk to the patients or affects the treatment of the patient, then the Informed Consent form  must be revised and 
submitted to the relevant IRB/IEC for review and approval.  When  a patient is currently 
undergoing trial procedures and is affected by the amendment, then the patient must be asked to consent again using the new Informed Consent form .  Informed Consent form  must be used to 
obtain consent from new subjects before enroll ment . 
19.7 Compliance and Investigational Site Termination  
19.7.1 Compliance  
Compliance is the adherence to all trial -related requirements, to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to regulatory rules and regulations.

 19.7.2 Investigational Site Termination  
An initiative for center closure or study termination can be taken at any time either by the sponsor 
or by the investigator, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  HeartWare reserves the r ight to terminate an investigational site from 
the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Repeated failure to complete case report forms  
• Failure to obtain ICF  
• Failure to report SAEs and UADEs  
• Repeated protocol  violations  
• Failure of investigator to comply with training or Instructions for Use  
• Insufficient patient and caregiver/Companion training  
19.8 Record Retention  
HeartWare and all participating Investigators must establish and maintain records and reports.  The Investigator must maintain the signed Informed Consent Forms, eCRFs, study documentation (listed above) and source documents for at least 4 years after study completion or termination.  In accordance with the Investigator Agreement, HeartWare should be contacted if the Principal Investigator plans to leave or otherwise absent themselves f rom the investigational 
site.   
19.9 Site Training  
Sites will be trained by HeartWare on the device usage and on implant technique as appropriate.  Training on GCP, Clinical Protocol required procedures and data collection w ill be provided by 
HeartWare and its vendor (s).

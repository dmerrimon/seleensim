Study Title:  Patient Portal Reminder/Recall for Influenza Vaccination in a Health System-  RCT 3  
Initial IRB Approval:  12/20/2017  
RCT 3 IRB Approval:  8/14/2020 
Clinical Trials Registration: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
  
Protocol  
Brief Summary:  
This trial is taking place in Los Angeles, CA among patients from primary care practices within 
the UCLA Health System.  
Despite the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation in 2010 
that all people above 6 months of age should receive an annual flu vaccine, vaccination rates 
remain low. The investigators plan to assess the effectiveness of reminder/recall messages (direct appointment scheduling, no direct -appointment scheduling, pre -appointment, and no 
pre-appointment) encouraging influenza vaccinations sent to patient portal users, as well as the 
effectiveness of a pre -commitment prompt (pre -commitment prompt, no prompt) asking about 
a patient's intention to get the influenza vaccination, using a 2 x 2 x 2 nested factorial design.  
Methods and Procedures  
We pr opose a two- arm randomized controlled trial, and a 2 x 2 x 2 nested factorial design 
within the treatment arm. Patients are randomized within UCLA primary care practices to 
intervention arms sent via the portal or a control group. Study arms: 1) standard o f care control 
(no reminder messages, no pre -commitment prompt, except for UCLA employees sent a 
reminder), 2) direct appointment scheduling reminder, pre -appointment reminder, pre -
commitment prompt, 3) direct appointment scheduling reminder, pre -appointme nt reminder, 
no pre -commitment prompt, 4) direct appointment scheduling reminder, no pre -appointment 
reminder, pre -commitment prompt, 5) direct appointment scheduling reminder, no pre -
appointment reminder, no pre -commitment prompt 6) No direct appointment scheduling 
reminder, pre -appointment reminder, pre -commitment prompt, 7) No direct appointment 
scheduling reminder, pre -appointment reminder, no pre -commitment prompt, 8) No direct 
appointment scheduling reminder, no pre -appointment reminder, pre -commitmen t prompt, 9) 
No direct appointment scheduling reminder, no pre -appointment reminder, no pre -
commitment prompt.

Spacing of R/R messages: The pre -commitment prompt will be sent in September, direct 
appointment scheduling and no direct appointment scheduling remi nders will be sent one time 
per month until record of vaccine receipt appears in the patient EHR in October, November, 
and December. The pre -appointment reminders will be sent 2 -4 days in advance of scheduled 
visits.  
Languages: messages will be in English.    
Health Literacy: We will use plain language <7th grade reading level per Flesch -Kincaid analysis.  
Eligibility : Our EHR will identify subjects who are eligible for either 1 or 2 influenza vaccinations 
based on ACIP algorithms (2 are recommended for children <9 years who have not had prior 
vaccination).  
Inclusion criteria  
Inclusion criteria will involve -- all UCLA primary care patients over 4 months of age who have 
made at least 1 visit to the practice within the prior 3 years and who have signed up f or 
MyUCLAhealth (UCLA’s portal) and have used the portal at least once within 12 months. 
Currently this includes 298,112 patients; from these patients, index patients per household will 
be randomly selected.  
a. Active patient: We selected >1 visit in 3y ba sed on our prior studies and the literature to 
focus the intervention on active patients; practices do not have a good mechanism to inactivate 
patients.  
b. Focusing on Portal Users: We can only send portal R/R messages to patients who have signed up for t he portal. Since some patients sign up for the portal but never use it we will restrict our 
inclusion criteria to patients who used the portal within 12m (75% of UCLA patients). This 
standard has been applied before. We will assess intervention effects for  the included 
population, and also for the entire practice, since the impact of the intervention reflects the 
extent of portal penetration.  
Exclusion criteria  
Patients will be excluded if they are not a patient at one of the 67 primary care practices with in 
UCLA’s Health System, and/or if they do not meet the above specified requirements for being an active patient or portal user.  
Main Outcomes and Measures  
Primary Measure: Receipt of >1 influenza vaccine among index patients between 10/1/2020 -
03/31/202 1 as documented in the EHR which is supplemented electronically by the health 
system with influenza vaccination data from external sources (e.g., pharmacies) and claims data.   
Secondary Measures: Receipt of annual influenza vaccine between 10/1/2020 -03/31/202 1 
among all included patients in identified households.

Background treatm ent/ 
concom itant medications / 
prohibited therapiesConcomitant best standard of care (BSoC) is permitted according to local 
clinical practice.  Allowed concomitant treatments for prostate cancer include: 
luteinizing -horm one-releasing hormone ( LHRH) analogs, s urgery, radiation 
therapy, flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone acetate, 
ketoconazole, corticosteroids, estrogens, and enzalutamide. Radium -223 
dichloride should not be given concurrently with abiraterone plus
prednisone/prednisolone.
Subjects who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy are to receive LHRH 
agonists or antagonists or polyestradiol phosphate throughout the study.  
Subjects receiving bone health agents (BHA), such as bisphosphonates or 
denosumab ,prior to receiving study drug treatment may be maintained on 
these therapies throughout all or part of the treatment period. Subjects in the 
treatment period can also initiate these therapies at any time. Based on the 
available data on radium -223 dichloride, t he option of startin g a BHA during 
the follow -up periods should be considered taking into consideration 
applicable guidelines. Treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab may be 
stopped at the discretion of the investigator.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy ,including taxanes, estramu stine, and mitoxantrone,
for prostate cancer , other systemic radioisotopes, concomitant hemibody 
EBRT, or other investigational drugs may not be used during the treatment 
period.  If prohibited therapy is considered appropriate BSoC for a subject 
during th e treatment period, further radium -223 dichloride administrations 
must be discontinued, and if possible, prohibited treatment should not be given 
until following the end of treatment (EOT) visit, defined as 30 days after the 
last injection of radium -223 di chloride.
Background treatment, concomitant medications, and prohibited therapies 
modified by Amendments 2 and 4.

Study design International, multicenter, randomized, open -label Phase II study
Methodology Subjects enrolled into the study will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment 
arms in 1:1:1 fashion: radium -223 di chloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) IV every 28 days for up to 6 doses
(Treatment Arm A) or radium -223 dichlori de 80kBq/kg (88kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) IV every 28 days for up to 6 doses
(Treatment Arm B) or radium -223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) IV every 28 days for up to 12 doses
(Treatment Arm C) .
The randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by use of prior 
chemotherapy ( ≤1 regimen versus >1 regimen ),by total ALP (< 220U/L 
versus ≥220U/L) ,and by average w orst pain score (WPS) of the Brief Pain 
Inventory Short Form ( BPI-SF) ( WPS ≤4 versus WPS >4).
The treatment period for efficacy purposes begins at the time of 
randomization.  During the treatment period, study medication is administered 
every 28 days (±7days) from Dose 1 and may be delivered in an outpatient
setting .  At each visit, prior to receiving radium -223 dichloride, the subject w ill 
beevaluated for adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities to 
determine whether it is safe to continue treatment .
Symptomatic s keletal events will be assessed every 28 day sthrough the latter 
of Week 24 or the EOT visit ( Week 24 for Treatment ArmsA and B, and 
Week 48 for Treatment ArmC)and every 12 weeks thereafter, until anSSE is 
experienced.   Subjects in Treatment Arms A and B who have not experienced 
anSSE will be contacted b y telephone at Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44, evaluated 
for SSE risk, and encouraged to come to the clinic if a risk is identified.
Radiological assessment, including whole body technetium -99 bone scan,
MRI / CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, 
and chest X -ray (in the presence of 
suspicious lesion[s], a chest CT scan will be performed to confirm and 
characterize the lesion[s]) ,will be performed at Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, 
then every  12 weeks for 2 years after the subject’s last dose of radium -223 
dichloride or until radiologic progression .  If progression is detected by bone 
scan, a confirmatory bone scan is required at least 6 weeks later.  Radiological 
assessments will continue until disease progression is experienced in bone 
according to the PCWG2 
criteria orin soft tissue according to R esponse 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid T umors1.1 guidelines . Radiographic imaging will 
be evaluated by blinded central review.
Pain en dpoints will be based on subject -reported outcome data. Pain data will 
be collected every 4 weeks through Week 48 in all treatment arms using a 
handheld device. Pain will be assessed by means of selected questions from
the BPI-SFdaily for 4 days immediately prior to randomization , in order to 
stratify subjects by WPS ≤4 or > 4, and the n as follows:
for Treatment Arms A and B, daily for 7 days prior to each scheduled 
dosing visit from Dose 1, Day 1 through Week 24 .During the Active 
Follow -up,pain data will be collected for the 7 days prior to Week 36 
and 48 visits ,and for 7 days prior to each telephone contact at 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 11of 291
Weeks28, 32,40 and 44.  
for Treatment Arm C ,daily for 7 days prior to each scheduled dosing 
visit from Dose 1 , Day 1 through Week 48 .
Pain w ill also be assessed by means of the BPI -SF questionnaire every clinic 
visit or telephone contact from Dose 1, Day 1 visit until the Week 48 visit.  In 
treatment Arms A and B only ,the BPI -SF questionnaire will also be completed 
on the day of each telephone contact at Weeks 28, 32, 40,and 44.  
The NCCN -FACT FPSI -17questionnaire w ill be completed by the subject in 
all treatment arms every clinic visit starting on Dose 1, Day 1 up to Week 48
visit.  In treatment Arms A and B only the NCCN -FACT FPSI -17
questionnaire will also be completed on the day of each tel ephone contact at 
Weeks 28, 32, 40 ,and 44.  
Both the pain assessment using the BPI -SF questionnaire and the NCCN-
FACT FPSI -17 questionnaire will be self -administered by the subject using a 
handheld device. 
Analgesic use will be collected throughout the study.  In addition ana lgesic use 
over the 24 -hour period prior to the day of the visit will be collected by the 
study investigator at each visit for all treatment arms from Dose 1, Day 1 until 
the Week 48 visit , 
andanalgesic use over the 24-hour period p rior to each 
telephone contact (in Arm sA or B) will be collected by the study investigator 
at the telephone contact at Week s28, 32, 40,and 44 .
The AQA score will be calculated programmatically from the assessments of 
analgesic use in the last 24 hours .
AJoint Safety Review Committee w ill conduct safety reviews at regular 
intervals. There is no formal interim analysis
planned .The main objective of 
these safety revie ws is to ensure subject safety and to identify whether any 
protocol modifications are needed.
Follow ing the EOT visit, s ubjects will enter theactive follow -up period and 
will come to the clinic for selected safety and efficacy evaluations every 
12weeksfor at least 2 years follow ing last study treatme nt. Subjects not 
experiencing an SSE by 2 years following last study treatm ent will continue 
active follow -upuntil the subject experiences an SSE or the primary endpoint 
matures, whichever occurs first.  During active follow -up, every effort w ill be 
made to follow  subjects through clinic vis its; however, phone contacts will be 
undertaken for subjects unable to come to the clinic .
All study subjects w ill be eligible for further follow -up either in this study or 
in a separate long -term follow -up study for up to 7 years.  The separate 
long-term follow -up study has been set up to foll ow subjects who received 
radium -223 dichloride or placebo in the course of Bayer -sponsored clinical 
trials.  The long -term follow -up study has a specific focus on investigator 
reported, radium -223 dichloride -related AEs and serious AEs, all occurrences 
of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, primary bone cancer 
or any other new primary malignancy, cancer treatment (including any 
systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy for any malignancy; all 
systemic therapies for prostate cancer, including androgen synthesis inhibitors

/ androgen -receptor antagonists , systemic radiois otopes ,and radiation 
treatment; excluding analgesics), in subjects who receive cytotoxic 
chemotherapy: all occurrences of febri le neutropenia or hemorrhage during 
their chemotherapy treatment and for up to 6 months thereafter , and survival 
for up to 7 years after last dose of radium -223 dichloride or until death .In 
addition, during the long -term follow -up a ll bone fractures and bone associated 
events (e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if the 
criteria of SAE w ere met, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.   
During long -term follow -up, subjects , their treating health care professiona l, or 
caregiver will be contacted every 6 months by telephone.  All subjects who 
transition into this separate long -term follow -up study will require a separate 
signed informed consent.   Subject data collected at other standard -of-care 
visits and / or cont acts may be used to satisfy study -required data.
Transition of all subjects into the separate long -term follow -up study will 
begin following the later of prim ary endpoint completion or 2 years after the 
last radium -223 dichloride treatment is administered to the last treated subject .
Until the transition to the long term follow -up study begins, some subjects may 
begin long -term follow -up in this study.   This study wi ll end when all subjects 
have transitioned into the long -term follow -up study or discontinue d from this 
study for another reason (e.g., Consent Withdrawn, Lost to Follow -up).

Plan for statistical analysis Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to:
Treatment Arm A: radium -223 dichloride 50kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) intravenously every 28 days up to 6 doses
(“standard dose”)
Treatment Arm B: r adium -223 dichloride 80kBq/kg(88kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) intravenously every 28 days up to 6 doses
(“high dose”)
Treatment Arm C: radium -223 dichloride 50kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) intravenously every 28 days up to 12 doses 
(“extended dosing”)
The primary efficacy endpoint , SSE-FS, will be analyzed separately in 
2respectiv e com parisons, as described below .
Both comparisons will be performed at the time of final analysis, after the 
latest of (1) approximately 135 SSE-FS events in subjects included in 
Com parison 1 as defined below; (2) approximately 75 SSE-FS events 
following the 6th dose in subjects included in Comparison 2 as defined below , 
and (3) the last subject has been followed for 30 days from last treatment.   In 
the event the applicable number of events is not reached, the primary endpoint 
analysis will mature 7 years after the last subject has received last treatment.
No alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed in this 
Phase II study.
Comparison 1: Standard dose versus high dose: SSE-FS from  
randomization in radium -223 dichlorid e-naïve subjects
Com parison 1 will test the follow ing hypotheses:

date. 
Com parison 1 will pool SSE-FS in subjects in Treatment Arm A, with SSE-FS 
truncated at 24 w eeks in subjects in Treatment Arm C, and compare this 
pooled value w ith SSE- FS in Treatment Arm B.  Only intent -to-treat ( ITT)
subjects will be included in this ITT analysis.   In this study, extended dosing 
subjects (Treatment Arm C) will receive the same treatment regimen as 
standard dose subjects (Treatment Arm A) for the first 6 doses, with Dose 7 
scheduled to start after 24 w eeks.  Accordingly ,data from Treatm ent Arm C 
subjects arising during the first 24 weeks is relevant to this comparison and 
including it increases the analysis' pow er under the study assumptions.
It will be performed using a log -rank test with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.1 stratified 
by the randomization factors (previous chemotherapy [ ≤1 regimen v ersus
>
1regimen ], and total ALP [< 220 U/L versus ≥220 U/L]).  The high -dose 
regimen will be declared superior to the standard -dosing regimen if the 1 -sided 
p-value from the stratified log rank test is less than 0.1. 
The hazard ratio (high dose /standard dose) w ill be computed together with 
2
-sided 80% and 95% confidence interval s using a stratified Cox regression 
model with treatment as a factor and previous chemotherapy [≤ 1 regimen 
versus >1 regimen ] and total ALP [< 220 U/L versus ≥220 U/L] as strata in 
the model for the ITT analysis set .  Kaplan -Meier survival distribution tables 
and plots w ill also be produc ed for both Treatment Arm sA and B.  
Additional 
details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .
Comparison 2: No further radium -223 dichloride treatment versus
extended dosing: SSE -FS analysis from  the 6th dose in subjects receiving 
standard -dose regimen
Com parison 2 will test the follow ing hypotheses:
H02: In a population of subjects treated w ith a regimen of up to 6 doses of 
50kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) (standard dose) 
radium -223 d ichloride w ho survived SSE -free and are eligible for further 
radium -223 dichloride treatment at 24 w eeks, population SSE -FS beyond the 
6th dose in subjects treated w ith a regimen of up to an additional 6 doses of 
50kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after implementation o fNIST update) (extended dose) 
radium -223 dichloride is equal to population SSE -FS beyond the 6th dose in 
subjects receiving no further radium -223 dichloride treatment beyond the 
standard dose regimen, versus
HA2: In a population of subjects treated w ith a regimen of up to 6 doses of 
50kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) (standard dose) 
radium -223 dichloride w ho survived SSE -free and are eligible for further

radium -223 dichloride is greater than population SSE -FS beyond the 6th dose
in subjects receiving no further radium -223 dichloride treatment beyond the

1.Introduction
1.1 Background
Section modified by Amendment 1 (Section 13.1).
According to the American Cancer Societ y estimates for 2013 , the number of new prostate 
cancer cases will be 238,590 and the number of deaths from prostate cancer is expected to be 
29,720 in the United States (US) .(2)  A recent review of tumor registry -derived data 
estimated the number of prostate cancers cases in Europe to be 417,000 , with 92,00 0
deaths.( 3
)
Bone metastases are the main cause of disabilit y and death in subjects with 
castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC),( 4,5) and approximately  90% of men with CRPC
have radiological evidence of bone metastasis.( 4
)  Although treatment with docetaxel 
chemotherap y is well -established in this population and has been shown to achieve disease 
responses and improve overall survival (OS), the magnitude of the OS benefit is modest.( 6)  
It is estimated that approximately  50% of men diagnosed with CRPC are either judged unfit 
to tolerate docetaxel or elect not to receive it.  
Consequently , recent drug development efforts 
have attempted to improve on options for patients with CRPC and metastases using multiple 
strategies, including cy totoxic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , and immunotherapy .
In the context of CRPC with bone metastasis, the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid,( 7) has 
been available for more than 10 y ears for the treatment of prostate cancer with bone 
metastasis. More recently , denosumab, the monoclonal antibody  that targets receptor 
activator of nuclear factor κB ligand ,was approved by  the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA )in November 2010 for the prevention of skeletal -related events (SREs) 
and as an 
alternative to zoledronic acid .(8)  Importantly , while these 2 drugs are able to modify  the 
course of patients with metastatic CRPC and bone metastasis, neither agent has been found to 
improve OS in this group of patients.
Over the past 3 years,a variet y of new drugs have been approved for the treatment of CRPC, 
including the vaccine Sipuleucel -T in 2010 for as ymptomatic or minimally  symptomatic 
patients, cabazitaxel also in 2010, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in 2011, and 
enzalutamide in 2012.  These drugs demonstrated improved OS, and are tolerable, but they  
were approved without respect to the specific clinical manifestations of C RPC
.(9,10,11)
Given the reality  that more than 90% of patients with CRPC develop bone metastases, and 
the well -known subsequent impact on quality  of life (QoL) 
as well as survival, an agent that 
specificall y targets the major complications of bone metastasis, provides a survival benefit, 
and has a good safet y profile would represent a relevant treatment option and a major 
therapeutic advance.
Alpha particle -emitting radiopharmaceuticals represent a new class of cancer therapy  for the 
treatment of men with CRPC with bone metastases.( 12)  Unlike beta emitting 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 25of 291
radiopharmaceuticals, alph a particle -emitting radiopharmaceuticals have a more localized 
action( 13)(a range of 2 to 10 cell diameters) and are much more potent, causing 
double -strand deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) breaks leading to cell death.( 14)
Radium -223 is a calcium mimetic, alpha particle emitting nuclide ,which sele ctively  targets 
areas of increased bone turnover.( 15)  The half
-life of radium- 223 is 11.4 days, allowing 
sufficient time for its preparation, distr ibution , and administration to subjects.( 16)  Unlike 
beta particle -emitting radionuclides, which cause single strand DNA breaks, which can be 
repaired, alpha particle -emitting radium -
223 causes difficult to repair double-strand DNA 
breaks, (16) resulting in a highl y cytotoxic effect in targ et areas containing bone metastatic 
cancer cells.( 15)  Since radium -223 is targeted to bone, its distribution to soft tissue is 
limited.( 15)
The results of nonclinical pharmacology  studies indicate that radium -223 dichloride delivers 
potent radiation targeted to bone in areas of high metabolic ac tivity  and increased bone 
turnover ,
such as skeletal metastases.  No effects on central nervous s ystem(CNS) , 
respiratory , or cardiovascular function were observed in safet y pharmacology or toxicology 
studies conducted in rats and dogs.( 16)  Radium -223 dichloride is rapidly  eliminated from 
blood and distributed to bone.  In mice and dogs, excretion occurred b y both feces and urine.  
No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of radium -
223 
dichloride.( 17)  In humans, clinical data show that excretion occurs mainl y via the feces, with 
minimal urinary  excretion and no entero -hepatic re circulation.( 18)
In preclinical studies, in single and repeated dose toxicity  studies in rats administered 
radium -223 dichloride
,the main findings were reduced body  weight gain, hematological 
changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ,and microscopic findings in the bone 
marrow (depletion of hematopoietic cells, fibrosis), s pleen (secondary  extra -medullary  
hematopoiesis) ,and bone (depletion of osteocy tes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro- osseous 
lesions, disruption /disorganization of the ph ysis/growth line).  With the exception of bod y
weight decrease, t hese findings were related to radiation -induced impairment of 
hematopoiesis and a reduction of osteogenesis, and occurred in the dose range of 20 to
80kBq (0.000541 to 0.00216 mCi) per kilo grambody  weight.( 17)
Dose -limiting my elotoxicity  was seen in dogs after single administration of 450 kBq
(0.0122 mCi) radium- 223 dichloride per k
ilogrambody  weight (9 times the clinically  
recommended standard dose).( 17)
Osteosarcomas occurred in rats at extended times (7 to 12 months) after treatment with single 
doses of ≥ 325 kBq/kg and repeated doses of ≥25kBq/kg (12 doses) or 
≥ 325 kBq/kg 
(4doses).  However, the relevance of these animal data needs to be interpreted with caution.  
The appearance of osteosarcomas was anticipated based on literature references identify ing 
sarcomas in animals treated with ionizing radia tion or bone -seeking radionuclides, 
particularl y in skeletall y immature and growing animals.  Further details on the toxicology  
studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).( 16)

Nine clinical studies with radium -223 dichloride have been conducted in over 1 ,300 subjects 
with prostate or breast cancer with bone metastases.( 16)
The safet y and tolerability of radium-
223 dichloride was first investigated in a single 
injection dose ranging study  in 31 subjects diagnosed with prostate (n = 21) or breast cancer 
(n=10).( 18)  Thirt y-one subjects with breast or prostate cancer received escalating single or 
multiple doses of radium -223 dichloride (single doses of 46, 93, 163, 213, or 250 kBq/kg 
body  weight ; multiple doses of 5 x 50 kBq/kg at 3 -week intervals or 2 x 125 kBq/kg at 
6-week intervals) , and subjects were followed for 8 weeks.  Mild and reversible 
myelosuppression with a nadir 2 to 4 weeks after the injection was observed.  Preliminary  
evidence of efficacy  was seen with reduction in total serum ALP concentrations and 
improved pain control across all dose levels.
Radium -223 dichloride was subsequentl y evaluated in a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized 
Phase II study.  Subjects diagnosed with CRPC and bone pain needing external 
beam radiotherap y (EBRT) received up to 4 doses of 50 kBq/kg body  weight intravenous 
(IV) radium -223 dichloride administered every  4 weeks in the active arm.( 16,19)  The 
relative change in bone ALP from baseline to 4 weeks post-last treatment was 
-66% 
(range: -92% to 125%) for the 33 subjects who received treatment compared with 9% (range: 
-77% to 384%) for the 31 subjects who received placebo.  The results obtained with 
biochemical markers for bone turnover (ty pe I collagen cross-linked C- telopeptide, 
procollagen I N propeptide) and tumor load ( prostate specific antigen [PSA] ) support the 
presence of a treatment effect during the treatment period and for 1 to 2 months after the end 
of treatment ( EOT ).  
A Phase II double -blind, randomized, dose -ranging stud y was performed to assess the 
palliative effect of 4 
single dose levels (5, 25, 50, and 100 kBq/kg b ody weight radium -223 
dichloride) in 100 hormone refractory  prostate cancer subjec ts.  The target population was 
subject s suffering from bone pain (with at least a score 2 on the Brief Pain Inventory  [BPI ]
average pain) due to multiple bone metastases secondary  to prostate cancer. The aims of the 
study  were to assess the effect of one injection of radium
-223 di chloride on painful bony  
metastases, and to assess tolerability  and safet y.  A significant dose response for pain index 
was seen at W eek 2 (P =
0.035). At W eek 8, there were 40%, 63%, 56% ,and 71% pain 
responders (reduced pain and stable analgesic consumption) in the 5, 25, 50, and 100 kBq/kg 
groups, respectively .  There was also a significant improvement in the pain and functional 
indexes of the Brief Pain I nventory  
Short Form (BPI -SF) for all dose groups (P = 0.04, 0.01, 
0.002, and 0.02; Wilcoxon signed rank test).  Furthermore, a decrease in bone ALP in the 
highest dose group was demonstrated (P = 0.0067).  All doses were safe and well tolerat ed.
A Phase III stud y was conducted to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of radium -223 dichloride.  
ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) was a multinational, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  in subjects with s ymptomatic CRPC with 
bone metastases.( 20,21,22 )  A total of 922 subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive 6 IV 
doses of either 
50kBq/kg radium -223 dichloride or placebo every  4 weeks.  Subjects were 
followed until 3 years from the first dose of study  drug.  The ALSYMPCA study  was 
terminated b y the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) based on the results of a

pre-planned interim analy sis that evaluated OS.  Overall survival was statistically  
signif icantl y longer with radium -223 dichloride (hazard ratio = 0.695, 95% confidence 
interval [0.552% to 0.875%] ; 2-sided P = 0.00185) compared to placebo.  Median OS was 
prolonged to 14.0 months with radium -223 dichloride treatment compared to 11.2 months 
with placebo.  Time to first SRE was statistically  significantl y longer in the radium-223 
dichloride group compared to placebo (median 13.5 months for radium-223 dichloride versus
8.4 months for placebo; P =
0.00046).  Overall, treatment-emergent serious adver se events 
(SAEs) were experienced by  fewer subjects (43.2%, 220 / 509) in the radium -223 dichloride 
group than subjects in the placebo group (54.9%, 139 / 253).
A randomized, double- blind, dose -finding, multicenter Phase IIstudy  evaluated 
122
randomized C PRC subject s who received 3 injections of radium- 223 dichloride at 6-
week intervals.( 23) The doses were 25 kBq/kg (n = 41), 50 kBq/kg (n = 39), and 80 kBq/kg 
(n=42).  Efficacy  was evaluated using blood samples to measure PSA and other tumor 
markers, and SREs and pain assessments were recorded.  Safet y was evaluated using adverse 
events (AEs), ph ysical examination s
,and clinical laboratory  tests.  The study  met its primary  
endpoint with a statistically  significant dose-response relationship in confirmed (≥ 50%) PSA 
declines for no subjects in the 25 kBq/kg dose group, 2 subjects (6%) in the 50 kBq/kg dose 
group, and 5 subjects (13%) in the 80 kBq/kg dose group ( P = 0.0297).  A greater than 
50% decrease in bone ALP levels was identified in 6 subjects (16%), 24 subjects (67%), and 
25subjects (66%) in the 25, 50, and 80 kBq/kg dose groups, respectivel y (P
< 0.0001).  The 
most common treatment- related AE s occurring up to Week 24 across all dose groups were 
diarrhea (21%), nausea (16%), and anemia (14%).  No difference in incidence of hematologic 
events was seen among the dose groups.  These data suggested that treatment with 80 kBq/kg 
radium -
223 dichlorid e may result in better efficacy  as compared with 50 kBq/kg in patients 
with CRPC without a significant increase in toxicity .(23
)
Further details of the efficacy  and safety  of radium -223 dichloride can be found in the IB,( 16
) 
which contains comprehensive information on the study  drug.
1.2 Study ration ale
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1) and 2 (Section 13.2).
Clinical experience with radium -223 dichloride, as described above, demonstrates that 
treatment with 6 
administrations of radium -223 dichloride at 50 kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after 
implementation of National I nstitute of Standards and Technology [NIST]update )every  4
weeks is associated with important clinical benefit s
, including a significant improvement in 
median OS as compared to placebo in subject s with CRPC and bone metastases , and with a 
favorable safety  profile.  Side effec ts are mild and predominantly  gastrointestinal ( diarrhea 
and vomiting).  M yelosuppression is minimal with a low incidence of Grade ≥3 neutropenia 
and thrombocy topenia, and no evidence of cumulative bone marrow toxicity .  These 
observations suggest that tr eatment bey ond 6 doses is plausible.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 28of 291
The dose-response relationships that were observed in the Phase II studies suggest that 
further clinical benefit, in terms of disease control and pain relief, may  be achieved with 
higher doses of radium -223 dichloride without a worse safety profile .  
The tolerability  of radium -223 dichloride and preliminary  evidence of a dose -response 
relationship suggest possible strategies for enhancing the efficacy  of radium -223 by  
increasing exposure to radium-223 dichloride.  Two potential strategies to increase total dose 
are: 1) to increase the total number of treatments with the standard 50 kBq/kg(55kBq/kg 
after implementation of NIST update )dose or 2) to increase the total dose given for each 
treatment , while retaining t he 6-dose regimen .
This3-arm randomized study  was designed to explore both treatment strategies b y comparing 
the standard dose regimen of radium -223 dichloride 50 kBq/
kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update )every  4 weeks for up to 6 doses to the high dose regimen of 
80kBq/kg(88kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) and, in subjects receiving the 
standard dose regimen, to compare an extended regimen of up to 6 additional doses of
radium -
223 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after implementa tion of NIST update )every  4 weeks with 
no further radium -223 dichloride treatment.  Efficacy  will be evaluated in terms of 
symptomatic skeletal event -free survival (S S
E-FS).  Radiological progression- free survival 
and time to progression will be evaluated as secondary  objectives. Additional secondary  
objectives include p ain improvement rate and time to progression based on subjects ’self-
assessment of pain, change in analgesic use based on subject s’ analgesic use in the last 
24hours as evaluated b y the 
Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA) .
This study  will be conducted to provide data regarding the optimal use of radium -223 
dichloride and long -term safet y .
Long -term safety assessment
The key  attrib ute of radium -223 dichloride is its specific targeting of bone with limited
radiation exposure bey ondthe intended target.  However, the proximity  of the bone marrow 
space to site of action of radium-223 dichloride means that there is potential for 
radiati on-induced bone marrow abnormalities.  These abnormalities, including bone marrow 
dysplasia or new primary malignancies, may  not become evident until y ears after the initial 
exposure to radium -223 dichloride; therefore, long
-term follow -up is required to detect them.  
For this reason, both acute and long -term safet y of radium -223 dichloride will be assessed in 
this study , with the follow -up period extending to up to 7 y ears after the last dose of 
radium -223 dichloride.

4.Study design
4.1 Design ov erview
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1), 2 (Section 13.2 ), 3 (Section 13.3), and 4 
(13.4.1.2 ).
Subjects enrolled into the study  will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms in a 
1:1:1fashion: radium -223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST 
update )IV every  28 day sfor up to 6doses(Treatment Arm A) ,or radium -223 dichloride 
80kBq/kg (88kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) IV every  28 day sfor up to 
6doses(Treatment Arm B) ,or radium -223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NISTupdate )IV every  28 day sfor up to 12 dose s(Treatment Arm C) .
The randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by  use of prior chemotherapy  
(≤
1regimen versus >1 regimen ),by total AL P (< 220 U/L  versus ≥ 220 U/L) ,and b y 
average worst pain score (WPS) of the BPI -SF(WPS ≤4 versus 
WPS > 4).
The treatment period for efficacy  purposes begins at the time of randomization.  During the 
treatment period, study  medication is administered every  28 day s(± 7 day s)from Dose 1 and 
may be delivered in an outpatient setting .  At each visit, prior to receiving radium -223 
dichloride, the subject will be evaluated for AEs and laboratory  
abnormalities to determine 
whether it is safe to continue treatment.
Symptomatic skeletal events will be assessed every  
28 da ysthrough the latter of Week 24 or 
theEOT visit (Week 24 for Treatment Arms A and B, and Week 48 for Treatment Arm C)
and every  12 weeks thereafter, until anSSE is experienced.  Subjects in Treatment Arms A 
and B who have not experienced anSSE will be contacted b y telephone at Weeks 28, 32, 40, 
and 44, evaluated for SSE risk, and encouraged to come to the clinic if a risk is identified.
Symptomatic skeletal events are defined as :
The use of EBRT to relieve skeletal s ymptoms
New symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral and non -vertebral)
Tumor -related orthopedic surgical intervention
Spinal cord compression
Radiological assessment, including whole bod y technetium -99 bone scan, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) /computed tomograph

chest X -ray (in the presence of suspicious lesion[s], a chest CT scan will be performed to 
confirm and characterize the lesion[s]) ,will be performed at Week 8, Week 16, Week 24,
then every  12weeksfor 2 y ears after the subject’s last dose of radium- 223 dichloride or until 
radiologic progression .  If progression is detected by  bone scan, a confirmatory  bone scan is 
required at least 6 weeks later.  Radiological assessments will continue until disease
progression is experienced in bone according to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working 
Group 2 [PCWG2] criteria or in soft tissue according to Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors 1.1 [RECIST 1.1] guidelines , see Section 14.1 and Section 14.2).  
Radiographic imaging will be evaluated b y blinded central review.
Pain endpoints will be based on subject -reported outcome data.  Pain will be assessed b y 
means of selected questions from the BPI -SF daily  for 4 day s immediatel y prior to 
randomization, in order to stratify  subjects by WPS ≤4 or > 4, and then daily  for 6 day s prior 
to Cy cle 1, Day  1 or subsequent visits including telephone contacts, as applicable, plus the 
day of the visit o
r telephone contact, until Week 48.  Pain will also be assessed b y means of 
the BPI -SF questionnaire for all treatment arms at each clinic visit or telephone contact from 
Dose 1, Day  1 until the Week 48 
visit and for treatment Arms A and B on the day  of each 
telephone contact at Weeks 28, 32, 40 ,and 44.
The NCCN -FACT FPSI -
17 questionnaire will be completed b y the subject in all treatment 
arms every  clinic visit starting on Dose 1, Day  1 up to Week 48visit and for treatment Arms 
A and B on the day  of ea ch telephone contact at Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44 (see Section 14.8).
Both the pain assessment using the BPI -SF questionnaire and the NCCN -FACT FPSI -17
questionnaire will be self -administered b y the subject using a handheld device .
Analgesic use will be collected throughout the study .  In addition analgesic use over the 
24-hour period prior to the day  of the visit will be collected by  the study  investigator at each 
visit for all treatment arms from Dose 1, Day  1 until the Week 48 visi t,andanalgesic use 
over the 24
-hour period prior to each telephone contact (in Arms A and B) will be collected 
by the study  investigator at the telephone contact a t Week 28, 32, 40 ,and 44.
The AQA score will be calculated programmatically from the assessments of analgesic use in 
the last 24 hours (see Section 14.9).
Following the EOT visit, subjects will enter the active follow -up period and will come to the 
clinic for selected safet y and efficacy  evaluations every  12 weeks for at least 2 y ears 
following last study  treatment
. Subjects not experiencing an SSE by  2 years following last 
study  treatment will continue active follow- up until the subject experiences an SSE or the 
primary  endpoint matures, whichever occurs first.  During active follow -up, every  effort will 
be made to follow subjects through clinic visits; however, phone contacts will be undertaken 
for subjects unable to come to the clinic .  
Active follow-
up period with clinic visits:
Subjects who discontinue study  treatment and who did not have an SSE will enter an active 
follow -up period with cli nic visits. These subjects will be evaluated every  12 weeks

and serious adverse events (SAEs), and the initiation of other anti-cancer therapies for 
prostate ca ncer, and cy totoxic chemotherapy  and radiotherap y for an y new malignancy . In 
addition, subjects who receive cy totoxic chemotherapy  will be followed up for the 
development of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy  treatment and 
for up to 6 months at a frequency  based on local clinical practice. During this period, all 
occurrences of leukemia, my elodysplastic s yndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary  bone 
cancer or an y other new primary  malignancy  must be reported as SAEs, regardless of t he 
investigator’s causalit y assessment. In addition, all bone fractures and bone associated events 
(e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met,
regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.
The active follow-up period with clinic visits extends from the discontinuation of the 
treatment period until the subject experiences an SSE, can no longer travel to the clinic, 
receives further treatment with cy totoxic chemotherap y for prostate cancer, ot her sy stemic 
radioisotopes, hemibody  EBRT, or other investigational drugs, dies, is lost to follow -up, or 
withdraws informed consent and activel y objects to collection of further data. 
Active follow-up period without clinic visits:
Subjects from the treat ment period or the active follow -up period with clinic visits who can 
no longer travel to the clinical site will be followed for survival, treatment -related AEs and 
SAEs, SSEs, pain endpoints, and the initiation of other anti -cancer therapies (for prostate
cancer, and cy totoxic chemotherapy  and radiotherapy  for any  new malignancy ) with a phone 
call every  12 weeks (± 7 day s).In addition, subjects who receive cy totoxic chemotherap y 
will be followed up for the development of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhag e during their 
chemotherap y treatment and for up to 6 months at a frequency  based on local clinical 
practice. During this period, all occurrences of leukemia, my elodysplastic sy ndrome, aplastic 
anemia, and primary  bone cancer or any  other new primary  mali gnancy  must be reported as 
SAEs, regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment. In addition, all bone fractures and 
bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if the 
criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.
The active follow- up period without clinic visits extends from the end of treatment (EOT) 
period or the end of active follow
-up with clinic visits until the subject experiences an SSE, 
dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws informed consent and activel y objects to collection of 
further data.
The maximum duration of the active follow- up is 7 y ears from the last dose of radium -
223 
dichloride received b y the subject .
All study  subjects will be eligible for further f ollow -up either in this study  or in a separate 
long-term follow -up study  for up to 7 y ears.  The separate long -term follow -up study  has 
been set up to follow subjects who received radium -223 dichloride or placebo in the course of

caregiver will be contacted every  6 months by  telephone.  All subjects who transition into this 
separate long -term follow -up study  will require a separate signed informed consent.  Subject 
data collected at other standard -of
-care visits and / or contacts may  be used to satisfy  study -
required data.
Transition of all subjects into the separate long -term follow -up study  will begin following the 
later of primary  endpoint completion or 2 y ears after the last radium -223 dichloride treatment 
is administered to the last treated subject.
Until the transition to the long- term f ollow -up study  begins, some subjects may  begin 
long-term follow -up in this study .  This study  will end when all subjects have transitioned 
into the long -term follow -up study  or discontinued from this study  for another reason (e.g., 
Consent Withdrawn, L ost to Follow- up).
4.2 Primary and s
econdary variables
Section modified by Amendment 1 ( 13.1).
The primary  efficacy  variable will be SSE-FS.
Safety  and tolerability  variables will be the incidence and severit y of treatment- emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) including serious TEAEs , and laboratory  abnormalities plus drug- related AEs 
during the follow- up period.  The severit
y of AEs will be graded b y the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology  Criteria Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), version 4.03 and 
coded b y Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) .
Secondary  efficacy  variables will be OS, time to first SSE, rPFS, time to radiological 
progression, pain improvement rate, time t opain progression ,and change in analgesic use
.
4.3 Interim Analyses and Joint Safety Review Committee
Section modified by Amendment 1 ( 13.1).
No formal interim anal ysis is planned.  A JSRC, which may contain sponsor, investigator, 
and/or independent members, will conduct safet y reviews at regular intervals.  The objective 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 36of 291
of these safet y reviews is to ensure subject safet y and to identify  whether any  protocol 
modifications are needed.  The JSRC will not evaluate efficacy .  Details on the JSRC and its 
safet y review monitoring will be described in a separate JSRC charter.
4.4 End of study
Section modified by Amendments 1 ( 13.1), and 3 (Section 13.3).
The final analy sis of this study  will take place after the primary  endpoint cut -offis reached.
The primary  endpoint cut -offwill be reached at the later of 1) 135 SSE-FS events in subjects 
included in Comparison 1 as defined in Section 8.4below, and 2) 75 SSE -FS events 
following 
the 6th dose in subjects included in Comparison 2 as defined in Section 8.4below, 
and 3) the last subject has been followed for 30 day sfrom last treatment. In the event the 
applicable number of events is not reached, the primary  endpoint anal ysis will mature 7 y ears 
after the last subject has received last treatment.
Subjects alive at the time of the final analy sis will continue to be followed for up to 7 y ears 
after the last dose of radium -223 dichloride or death for an updated anal ysis of long -term 
survival and long -term radiation -related safet y.
For each participating E uropean U nion (EU) country , the end of the study  according to the 
EU Clinical Trial Directive will be reached when the last visit of the last subject for all 
centers in the re spective country  has occurred.
However, as the primary  endpoint of this study  is event -based, the end of the study  as a 
whole will only  be reached when this endpoint has been achieved in subjects in all 
participat ing c enters (EU and non- EU).

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 43of 291
The alpha particle -emitting radiopharmaceutical, radium- 223 dichloride, is a read y-to-use, 
sterile, non -pyrogenic, clear and colorless aqueous solution of radium- 223 dichloride for IV 
administration.  Radium -223 is an alpha particle emitter with a phy sical half -life of 11.4 day s.  
The product is isotonic and has a pH of 6.0 to 8.0.  The radioactive concentration at the 
reference date is 1,000 kBq/mL (1,100 kBq/ mL afte r implementation of NIST update ).  The 
product has a pre -calibration of 14 days.  When administered on a day  other than the 
reference day , the volume should be corrected according to the phy sical decay  table.
The product is manufac tured by Institute for Energy  Technology  (IFE), Isotope laboratories 
Instituttveien 18, NO
-2007, Kjeller, Norway  on behalf of Bayer AS, Kjelsäsveien 172 A, 
N0-0884 Oslo, Norway .  The product is produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP).  The product will be delivered in a glass vial, read y-to-use with a certified activity .  
Radium -223 dichloride is shipped in a lead container and Ty pe A radioactive package 
according to international transportation guidelines for radioactive materials.
The volume per vial is 6 mL , corresponding to 6 MBq (6.6 MBq after implementation of 
NIST update) at the reference day .  Radium -223 dichloride has a shelf life of 28 day s from 
production day , when stored at ambient temperature.  The shelf life has been demonstrate d 
for temperatures from cold storage (2ºC to 8°C) up to 40°C.  I n addition, it has been shown 
that the product quality  is not jeopardized upon freezing.   For the US, study  drug may  be 
forwarded to the country  depot in vials, where it will be prepared as a patient ready  dose 
([PRD
], in a sy ringe )before being delivered to the site.
All study  drugs will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and legislati on.  
Label text will be approved according to the sponsor’s agreed procedures, and a cop y of the 
labels will be made available to the study  site upon request.
For all stud y drugs, a s ystem of numbering in accordance with all requirements of GMP will 
be use d, ensuring that each dose of study  drug can be traced back to the respective bulkware 
of the ingredients.  Lists linking all numbering levels will be maintained by the sponsor.
A complete record of batch numbers and expiry  dates of all study treatment as well as the 
labels will be maintained in the sponsor study  file.
6.3 Treatment assignment
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1) and 2 (Section 13.2).
This study  is a randomized, 3- arm open -label Phase II study .
A subject number (a unique identification number) will be assigned via IVRS / I WRS when a 
subject is evaluated for inclusion into the study .  The subjects will then undergo screening 
procedures and will enter the study  after successful screening.  Subjects will be randomized 
1:1:1 to receive one of:
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 44of 291
Treatment Arm A:  R adium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update )intravenously  every  28 day sfor up to 6 doses
(“standard dos e”)
Treatment 
Arm B: R adium-223 dichloride 80 kBq/kg(88kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) intravenously  every  28 day sfor up to 6 doses (“high
dose”)
Treatment 
Arm C:  R adium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update )intravenously  every  28 day sfor up to 12 doses
(“extended dos
e”)
The randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by  use of prior chemotherapy  
(≤ 1 regimen versus >1 regimen ),by total AL P (< 220 U/L  versus ≥220 U/L) ,and b y 
average WPS of the BPI -SF (WPS ≤4 versus 
WPS > 4).
6.4 Dosage and administration
Written information about radium- 223 dichloride and instruction about handling and injection 
of radioactive material will be provided to study personnel.
In general, the administration of radioactive drugs involves a potential risk for third parties, 
due to radiation from the subject and due to possible contamination by spilling urine or feces.  
When radium -223 dichloride has been injected intravenousl y into a subject, the risk for 
external radiation exposure to third parties is extremely  low, due to the short range of the 
alpha particles (< 100μm) and the low pro portion of beta and gamma radiation emitted .  For 
these reasons, the product can be administered in an outpatient setting .  To minimize the risk 
of contamination, the subject and his caregivers will receive instructions regarding h ygiene 
precautions to abide b y after receiving the radioactive drug according to the investigational 
site radiation protection guidelines.  After each dose, the subject should be given the subject 
informatio n card to carry with him until the next dosing visit.
6.4.1 Dose calibration
Section modified by Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
Radium -223 dichloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator instrument.  When 
written approvals for the use of radium -223 dichloride from the Radiation Protection Agency  
for the specific center have been received b y the sponsor, a vial of radium- 223 for technical 
use will be se nt to the study  center.
Different clinical stud y centers possess dose calibrators from various suppliers; thus, the 
isotope calibration factor may  differ from center to center.  Consequently , each center must 
perform the radium -223 dial setting on their re levant dose calibrator(s).  For dial setting, the 
clinical study  center will receive a sealed vial containing a radium- 223 solution for 
calibration only .  The vial is identical to the vials used for study  treatment.  The amount of 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 45of 291
radium -223 in the vial will be stated on the label.  Instructions for the dial setting, including 
the calibration log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample.  If 
calibration was previously performed and documented at a given site, that documentation 
needs to be provided to the sponsor (i.e., recalibration for those sites may  not be necessary ).  
A similar dose calibration and approval process will be implemented with the country  PRD 
depot, as applicable.
As of Amendment 2, NIST has established an updated standardization for radium-223 
dichloride, which indicates that an approximate 10% difference existed between activity  
values obtained using the current standard and the updated standardization.  The current 
NIST standard for radium -223 dichloride (NIST 2010 [ 31
]) will remain in effect for this 
protocol until all Health Authorities for which Bayer holds a marketing application for 
radium -223 dichlor ide have approved the regulatory  variations for Xofigo®, anticipated Q 2 
2016. All sites will be notified by  Bayer when regulatory  approvals are in place and the 
updated NIST standardization is to be implemented.  Upon notification, and prior to the 
implem entation, all sites will need to add a new dial
-setting to their dose calibrators for the 
new NIST standardization for radium -223 dichloride (NIST update [32]), which should be 
documented on the appropriate study  forms.  This step will be performed so that all sites will 
have the new dial setting (NI ST update [32]) in place at the time of implementation.  The 
current dial setting (NI ST 2010) will be used until the worldwide global implementation date 
anticipated for Q 2 2016.
The change in the NIST r adium -223 standard has no impact on subjects; subjects are 
receiving, and will continue to receive, the same actual dose and volume that was studied in 
ALSYMPCA and is associated with the proven safety  and efficacy  of radium -223 dichloride, 
though the stat ed nominal radiation dose received is being updated to reflect the new 
standard.  Subjects who are on -treatment at the time the new NI ST reference standard goes 
into effect will be notified of this change and will be required to sign a Patient I nformation 
Sheet to acknowledge that they  have received information on the updated NI ST standard 
calibration.  All patients randomized after the new reference standard is in effect will sign a 
revised ICF thatcontains the updated NIST standardization.
The formula fo r the calculation of the volume to be administered has to be changed 
respectivel y.  See Section 6.4.3.
6.4.2 Dose handling
Ordering of stud y drug will be done by  notify ing the IVRS / I WRS from the study  site at 
pre-defined lead times before each planned administration.  The next dose may  be requested 
in the I VRS / I WRS upon registration of the current dose through the pre -defined lead time 
(maximum number o f days in transit for the given country  plus a 2 -day buffer) prior to the 
next planned dose date.
The radium -223 dichloride vials must be stored inside their lead container in a secure facility .  
The study  drug should be used within 28 day s of production.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 46of 291
Radium -223 dichloride is an alpha particle -emitting radiopharmaceutical and should be 
handled by individuals who are qualified b y training and experience in the safe handling of 
radionuclides.  One dedicated person and a back -up designee will have responsi bility  as 
assigned from the principal investigator for handling and storage of radium -223 dichloride.
Control measurements of both the radium-223 dichloride vial (before and after dispensing) 
and sy ringes (before and after administration) are performed as part of the clinical study  
documentation.  For the US sites which have PRDs prepared at the country depot, the 
measurements of the vial activity  before and after dose preparation should be checked and 
recorded by the depot staff and a cop y of the documenta tion should be provided to the site for 
each PRD .  All administrations of radium- 223 dichloride will be based on the certified 
activity  of radium -223 at the reference date.
6.4.3 Dose calculation
Section modified by Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
The dosage of radium- 223 dichloride is 50 kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST 
update )body  weight (Treatment Arms A and C) or 80kBq/kg (88kBq/kg after 
implementation of NIST update) body  weight (Treatment Arm B) .  The total activity  to be 
injected will be calculated volumetrically  using the subject’s body  weight, the 50 (55kBq/kg 
after implementation of NI ST update) or 80kBq/kg body (88kBq/kg after implementation of 
NIST update) weight dosage level, and the decay  correction factor (DK) to correct for 
physical decay  of radium -223.  A table with DKs according to ph ysical decay  of the study  
medication will be provided with each vial of radium-
223 dichloride.  The total amount 
(volume to be drawn into the sy ringe) to be administered to a subject should be calculated as 
follows:
Body Weight (kg) x 50 kBq/kga
= volume to be injected (mL )DK x 1,000 kBq/mLb
a55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update 
b1,100 kBq/mL after implementation of NIST update 
For high dose treatment arm:
Body Weight (kg) x 80kBq/kgc

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 47of 291
For the US sites which have PRDs prepared at the country depot:
The subject’s weight measured at the dosing visit will be obtained at the site 
approximately  3 to 5 days prior to the planned dosing date.
This wei ght will be communicated to the country PRD depot for preparation of the 
current dose; a record of this information transfer will be retained at the site.
Documentation b y the central PRD depot of the required activity, calculations, and 
volume in the sy ringe will be retained at the depot with a copy  provided to the site.
6.4.4 Dose preparation
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1) and 2 (Section 13.2).
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during sy ringe filling 
and application to prevent contamination with the r adioactive solution (lab coats, medical 
gloves /protective glasses).  S taffshould adhere to all relevant radiation safety  regulations as 
prescribed b y local authorities administering their site radiation license, including as low a s 
reasonabl y achievable principles.
A radio pharmacy  will prepare a subject ready dose for dispensing to the subject .  In the US, 
Cardinal Health is the radio pharmac y that will dispense the subject ready dose.
Filling of the s yringe should take place in a safet y bench or simil ar cabinet in the 
Radiopharmacy  / Nuclear Medicine department.  The individual responsible for study  drug 
preparation will draw the correct volume of stud y drug into a s yringe.  The size of the sy ringe 
should be chosen according to the applied volume to re ach the required dosing accuracy .
Radium -223 dichloride should not be diluted or mixed with any  solutions.  If the vials have 
been stored in a refrigerator, they  should be left at room temperature for 1 hour prior to use, 
since cold material should not be injected in a subject.
6.4.5 Dose administration
The subject should be encouraged to arrive at the clinic well- hydrated on each dosing day .  
Subjects should avoid drinking or eating within 1 hour before and after administration of the 
study  drug.  After administ ration of study  drug, the subject should be encouraged to be 
well-hydrated and to drink ad libitum.
Aseptic technique should be used in the administration of radium -223 dichloride.  The 
syringe should be handed over to the individual who will perform the i njection.  The study  
medication will be administered as a slow bolus IV injection.  The actual radioactivity  
administered must be within the tolerance limits of ± 10% of the calculated radioactivity .  
After administration, the equipment used in connection with the preparation and 
administration of drug is to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed of in 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 48of 291
accordance with hospital procedure for the handling of radioactive material.   For central PRD 
depots, the same principles apply  to dose prepa ration and handling of radioactive material.
6.4.6 Dose adjustments
Every  effort will be made to administer the full dosing regimen of radium -223 dichloride.  
Adjustment of dose level is not permitted.
6.4.7 Dose delays
Section modified by Amendment s 1 (Section 13.1)and 2 (Section 13.2).
Study  visits during the treatment period should occur at 28- dayintervals (within a window of 
± 7 day s).  Delay s up to 4 weeks are allowed when the subject is recovering from toxicity .  
Adverse events will be followed as clinicall y indicated (see Section 7.5.1.3).
Dosing delay s may  be instituted under the following circumstances:
Disease progression:
In this subject population, disease progression is expected.  Bone pain is a prominent 
symptom; other sy mptoms may  include fatigue, nausea, anorexia, depression, constipation 
(also secondary  to opioids), bowel and bladder s ymptoms, ly mphedema, or neurological and 
hematological complications, as well as metastases to other organs, such as liver and lung.
The investigator should delay  treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer , 
including taxanes, estramustine, and mitoxantrone, other sy stemic radioisotope s, hemibody  
EBRT, or other investigational drug , ifpossible, until the follow -up period.  If 
the 
investigator determines that such treatments must be given while the subject is receiving 
study  drug, further stud y drug administration must be discontinued.  Subjects who are 
discontinued from study  drug willbe classified as “withdrawn from treatment” and will enter 
the active follow -up period. If the subject is not treated with an y of the prohibited anti-cancer 
therapies , the administration of study  drug may  be continued until completion of 6/12 cycles
if, in the investigator’s opinion ,the subject will continue to receive clinical benefit from 
remaining on stud y treatment .
Myelosuppression:
Treatment -related changes in hematology  parameters may  occur.  Hematology  values will be 
graded according to the NCI -CTCAE, version 4.03 (14 JUN 2010).
If a subject experiences NCI-CTCAE Grade s3 or 4 neutropenia or thrombocy topenia 
(seeTable 6–1), the study  drug administration should be delay ed until recovery  to 
Grade 2 (minimum 1.0 x 109/L) or better .
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 49of 291
If a subject experiences sustained CTCAE Grade 3 neutropenia orsustained CTCAE 
Grade s3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (see Table 6–1) lasting > 2 weeks despite adequate 
treatment and regardless of causalit y,the 
subject must be discontinued from treatment 
with radium -223 dichloride.
If a subject experiences sustained CTCAE Grade 4 neutropenia (see Table 6–1) 
lasting > 1 week despite adequate treatment and regardless of causalit y, the subject 
must be discontinued from treatment with radium-
223 dichloride.
Blood transfusions are acceptable during the treatment period , but ery thropoietin is 
not allowed.  Use of biologic response modifiers, such as GM -CSF or G -CSF, is 
allowed in the management of acute toxicity during the treatment period .  Such drugs 
(and tra nsfusions) cannot be used for 4 weeks prior to screening and during the 
screening period, or prior to the start of treatment
.

<50.0 to 25.0 x 109/L<25,000/mm3;
<25.0 x 109/L
Gastrointestinal events:
Diarrhea: Diarrhea should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of study  medication 
should not be given before diarrhea has recovered to CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 2 or 
lower.
Nausea / vomiting: Nausea or vomiting should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose 
of study  medication should not be given before nausea or vomiting has recovered to CTCAE 
(version 4.03) Grade 2 or lower.
Spinal cord compression:
If the subject experiences spinal cord compression during the treatment period, the subject 
should be treated for the event, and may  receive further study  drug administration if 
adequatel y recovered.  A dose delay  of up to 4 weeks is permitted.
External beam radiotherapy :
No dose delay  is needed for EBRT.
Surgical intervention:
If surgery  is required, the subject should continue with study  treatment, if this is considered 
safe in the treating investigator’s opinion.  The surgeon needs to be notified that the subject 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 50of 291
has been given radioactive drug and needs to follow the guidelines for radioactive protection.  
The subject should continue with study  treatment if it is considered safe in the treating 
investigator’s opinio n.
Non-pathological fractures:
For traumatic fractures in weight- bearing bones during the treatment phase, the study  drug 
administration should be delay ed for 2 to 4 weeks from the time of fracture.
Pathological fractures:
Pathological fractures may  occur as the result of either progressive disease or increased 
physical activity  associated with significant pain palliation.  Pathologic fractures are to be 
treated in a manner that attempts to maintain the best functional status and QoL.  Study  
treatment may  continue as planned.
Any other adverse event :
If a subject experiences any  non-hematological CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 4 adverse event
regardless of causality  lasting more than 7 days despite adequate treatment, further study  drug 
administration must be di scontinued.
Logistical difficulties:
Screening to Dose 1: An additional 14 day s will be permitted for the 14-day screening 
window for ‘failed’ quality  of investigational product that requires replacement or 
extraordinary  logistical issues.  Prior written a pproval by  the sponsor designee is required and 
screening assessments may  need to be repeated to be within the 14 (± 7) -day window prior to 
randomization.  The maximum period allowed for screening will be 35 day s(14 day s 
screening + 7 day window + 14 day sfor rescreening) .
Doses 2 to 6 (or Doses 2 to 12 for Treatment Arm C) : An additional 28 days will be 
permitted for Doses 2 to 6 (or Doses 2 to 12 for Treatment Arm C) for ‘failed’ quality  of 
investigational product that requires replacement or extraordinary  logistical issues.  Prior 
written approval b y the sponsor designee is required.
A dose delay  of more than 4 weeks (maximum of 8 weeks between 2 injections) will lead to 
study  drug discontinuation.
Note: efficacy  assessments should be performe d as scheduled despite delays in dosing.

6.6 Drug logistics and accountability
All study  drugs at the investigational site will be stored in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and GMP requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical supplies 
department of the sponsor (or its affiliate / clinical research organization [CRO]), and will be 
inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  Special storage conditions and a complete record of 
batch numbers and expiry  dates can be found in the sponsor study  file; the site -relevant 
elements of this information will be available in the investigator site file.  Records of the 
study  drug received at the site (and at the country  PRD depot, when used in the US) will be 
retained as required.  The responsible site personnel will confirm receipt of study  drug via the 
IVRS /IWRS and will use t he study  drug only  within the framework of this clinical study  
and in accordance with this protocol.  Receipt, distribution, and destruction of the study drug 
must be properl y documented according to the sponsor’s agreed and specified procedures.  
The moni tor will review overall drug accountability  and destruction per the site 
documentation only .  The remains of radioactivity  and contaminated material (i.e., vials, 
syringes, containers) should be disposed of in accordance with the local regulations and the 
hospital procedure, respectively .  A log of study  medication (received, administered to 
subjects, and destro yed) must be maintained and signed by  the dedicated person responsible 
for drug handling at each center.  An y labels or mandatory  logs provided by  the sponsor are 
to be utilized according to instructions.  A copy  of study  drug documentation will be 
collected for the sponsor file.
Written instructions on medication destruction will be made available to affected parties as 
applicable.
6.7 Treatment complian ce
Subjects will receive treatment with radium-223 dichloride under the supervision of a 
physician licensed in the administration of radioisotopes.  Personnel will check the 
administration volume and total radioactivity  injected.  The activit y dose (total and per bod y 
kilogram) along with the volume and the radioactivity  measured in the s yringe before and 
after the injection will be recorded in the source data and the appropriate eCRF.   The actual 
administered radioactivity  must be within the tolerance limits of ± 10% of the calculated 
radioactivity .
6.8
Post-study therapy
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1), 2 (Section 13.2), 3 (Section 13.3), and 
4(Section 13.4.1.2 ).
Subjects will have an EOT visit 30 (± 7) day s following the last dose of study  drug, including 
early discontinuation of study  drug, and will be followed every  12 weeks for safet y and SSE
evaluations.  Every  effort will be made to follow subjects through clinic visits; however, 
phone contact will be undertaken for subjects unable to come to the clinic.  The active 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 52of 291
follow -up period will continue for 2 years after the subject’s last dose of radium-223 
dichloride or until the primary  efficacy  anal ysismatures , whichever occurs last .  
All study  subjects will be eli gible for further follow -up either in this study  or in a separate 
long-term follow -up study  for up to 7 y ears.  The separate long -term follow -up study  has 
been set up to follow subjects who received radium -223 dichloride or placebo in the course of 
Bayer-sponsored clinical trials.  The long- term follow -up study  has a specific focus on 
investigator reported radium -223 dichloride- related AEs and SAEs, all occurrences of 
leukemia, my elody splastic sy ndrome, aplastic anemia, primary  bone cancer or any  other new
primary  malignancy , cancer treatment (including any  systemic cy totoxic chemotherap y or 
radiotherap y for an y malignancy ; all sy stemic anti -cancer therapies for prostate cancer, 
including androgen s ynthesis inhibitors / androgen -receptor antagonists , systemic 
radioisotopes, and radiation treatment; excluding analgesics), in subjects who receive 
cytotoxic chemotherapy : all occurrences of febrile neutropenia or hemorrhage during their 
chemotherap y treatment and for up to 6 months thereafter , and survival for up to 7 years after 
last dose of radium -223 dichloride or until death.  In addition, during the long- term follow -up 
all bone fractures and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either 
AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality  
assessment.  During long- term follow -up, subjects , their treating health care professional, or 
caregiver will be contacted every  6 months by  telephone.  All subjects who transition into this 
separate long -term follow -up study  will require a separate signed informed consent.  Subject 
data collected at other standard -of
-care visits and / or contacts may  be used to satisfy  study -
required data.
Transition of all subjects into the separate long -term follow -up study  will begin following the 
later of primary  endpoint completion or 2 y ears after the last radium -223 dichloride treatment 
is administered to the last treated subject.
Until the transition to the long term follow -up study  begins, some subjects may  begin 
long-term follow- up in this study .  This study  will end when all subjects have transitioned 
into the long -term follow -up study  or discontinued from this study  for another reason (e.g., 
Consent Withdrawn, L ost to Follow -up).
6.9 Prior and concomitant therapy
6.9.1 Prior therapy
Section modified by Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
Prior hemibody  EBRT or sy stemic radiotherap y with strontium- 89, samarium - 153, 
rhenium -186, or rhenium -188 is not allowed.  Subjects are not allowed to receive an 
investigational drug or cytotoxic chemotherapy  for prostate cancer , including taxanes, 
estramustine, and mitoxantrone, within 4 weeks prior to randomization in this study .  Blood 
transf usions, ery thropoietin, or biologic response modifiers, such as GM- CSF or G -
CSF, are

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 53of 291
not allowed within 4 weeks of screening , during the screening period, or prior to the start of 
treatment .
Information about previous treatment both for primary  tumor and bone metastases will be 
recorded in the medical record and in the appropriate eCRF.
All other prior medications, including but not limited to pain medications , anti biotics, 
steroids, bisphosphonates, iron therap y, or radiation therap ytaken in the 30 day s prior to start 
of study  treatment will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and in the appropriate 
eCRF.  The generic or trade name, indication, dosage, and start and stop dates must be 
recorded.
6.9.2 Concomitant medication
Section modified by Amendment s2 (Section 13.2) and4 (Section
s13.4.1.1, 13.4.1.3, and 
13.4.1.5
).
During treatment, all concomitant medications, including therapies for prostate cancer, must 
be recorded in the source documentation as well as the appropriate pages of the eCRFs.  The 
gene ric or trade name, indication, dosage, and start and stop dates must be recorded.
Contrast media will not be captured as concomitant medication unless there is an AE or SAE 
related to administration of contrast media.
Allowed concomitant treatments for pro state cancer include: LHRH analogs, surgery , 
radiation therap y, flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, cyproterone acetate, ketoconazole, 
corticosteroids, estrogens, and enzalutamide.  Subjects who have not undergone bilateral 
orchiectom y are to receive LHRH agonists or antagonists or pol yestradiol phosphate 
throughout the stud y.
Radium -223 dichloride should not be given concurrentl y with abiraterone plus
prednisone/prednisolone.
Subjects receiving bone health agents (BHA), such as 
bisphosphonates or denosum ab,prior 
to receiving stud y drug treatment may be maintained on these therapies throughout all or part 
of the treatment period.  Subjects in the treatment period can also initiate these therapies at 
any time.  Based on the available data on radium -223 dic hloride, the option of starting a BHA 
during the follow up periods should be considered ,taking into consideration applicable 
guidelines. Treatment with bisphosphonates or denosumab may  be stopped at the discretion 
of the investigator.  
Analgesic use will be followed and an y medications taken for pain should be recorded in the 
source documentation and in the appropriate eCRF.  Use of biologic response modifiers, such 
as G-CSF or GM -CSF, is allowed in the management of acute toxicity  such as febrile 
neutropenia when clinically  indicated or at the discretion of the investigator.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507

aOnce a subject switches from active follow -up with clinical visits to active follow -up without clinical visits, the subject will not be allowed to switch back.  A 
subject with a possible SSE may, and is encouraged to, return to the clinic a t any time to assess for the presence of an SSE.
b.Subjects, their treating health care professional, or caregiver will be contacted every 6 months by telephone.  Once a separat e, extended safety follow -up 
protocol, for the inclusion of subjects who received radium-223 dichloride in the course of Bayer sponsored clinical studies, has been implemented, the study 
subjects surviving after the end of the 2 years of active follow -up will be transitioned to this separate, extended safety follow -up protocol and the current study 
will be terminated at the time the last study subject is transitioned. Subject data collected at other standard -of-care visits and / or contacts may be used to 
satisfy study -required data.

c. The maximum period for rescreening screen failed subjects is 35 days (14 days screening + 7-day window + 14 days for rescreening) from signing the ICF to 
randomization.  Rescreening of a subject requires prior approval of the Bayer -designated medical representative (see Section 5.1).  Eligibility should be 
confirmed within 14 ± 7 days of randomization.
d.The subject should return to the clinic in advance of the scheduled dose visit such that results of the laboratory assessment are available within 72 hours prior 
to dosing (each dose period is 28 ± 7 days after the prior dose of radium -223 dichloride).
e.Subjects who can no longer travel to the clinical site or who receive further anticancer therapy will only be followed up by telephone (active follow-up without 
clinic visits).  Symptomatic skeletal events will not be collected over the phone.
f.The study record or subject’s clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtaine d prior to any other study procedures being performed.  
Eligibility should be confirmed during the screening period and reconfirmed prior to dosing at Dose 1, Day 1.
g.Reconfirmation of eligibility and registration in the IVRS / IW RS: hematology results o btained within 72 hours of Dose 1, Day 1 should be reviewed and it should 
be confirmed that the values are still within the treatment ranges (absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥100x109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 
g/dL).  
h.Body weigh t should be obtained without shoes, using a calibrated electronic physician (column) scale with digital display, measurement units 0.1 kg.  The same 
scale should be used for a given subject throughout the study.  At all sites (in US and outside US), weight is to be taken only once for each dose.  For non -
US sites the weight should be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing.  For US sites, subject weight for the dose day shoul d be obtained at the site within 3 
to 5 days prior to the dose visit.  This weigh t must be reported to the country PRD depot to allow adequate time for PRD preparation and delivery 
(approximately 2 days).  All efforts should be made to measure weight at the same visit with the pre -dose laboratory assessments in order to avoid 2 pre-
dose clinic visits.  Please note this is applicable to all dosing visits.  Body weight can be obtained at the local healthcare provider on a calibrated scale and 
the results sent by fax to the Principal Investigator with advanced notice and agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor for each subject.  No other 
procedures can be done at the local healthcare provider.
iWhen a subject is determined to be eligible, the subject will be trained on daily PRO pain data collection using a handheld d evice.  The subject will then 
complete the pain assessment daily for 4 days prior to randomization and then daily for one week (6 days prior to Cycle 1, Da y 1 or subsequent visits, as 
applicable, plus the morning of the visit).
j.Pain will be assessed during the screening period daily for 4 days prior to randomization and daily for one week (6 days prio r to Cycle 1, Day 1 or subsequent 
visits, as applicable, plus the day of the visit).  Subjects will complete the daily pain assess ment using a handheld device.  The daily PRO pain input results 
should be reviewed at the visit to check for completeness.
kFor Treatment Arms A and B only, pain data will be collected daily using the handheld device for one week (6 days prior to th e app licable visit, plus the morning 
of the visit) prior to W eek 36 and 48 visits, and daily for one week (6 days prior to the applicable phone call, plus the mor ning of the phone call) prior to each 
telephone contact at W eeks 28, 32, 40 and 44.  For Treatment Arms A and B only the BPI- SF and the NCCN FACT -P Symptom Index -17 (NCCN -FACT 
FPSI -17) questionnaires will be completed on the day of the W eek 36 and 48 visits and on the day of each telephone contact at W eeks 28, 32, 40 and 44.  
Twenty -four (24) hour analg esic use will be collected by the study investigator at W eek 36 and 48 Visits and at each telephone contact (in Arms A and B) at 
Weeks 28 (±7 days), 32 (±7 days), 40 (±7days), and 44 (±7 days).
l.The randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by th e use of prior chemotherapy ( ≤ 1 regimen versus > 1 regimen), by total alkaline phosphatase 
(<220U/L versus ≥220U/L), and by average W PS of the BPI -SF ( WPS ≤4 versus WPS >4).  Treatment group assignment will occur when the subject is 
randomized via IV RS / IW RS; this randomization step at up to 28 days prior to Dose 1.  Randomization triggers an order for study drug (durations vary based 
on country specific ordering lead times; US depot requires additional step).
m. The BPI -SF questionnaire will be comp leted at each clinic visit from Dose 1, Day 1 until the W eek 48 visit and for Treatment Arms A and B only, on the day of 
each telephone contact at W eeks 28, 32, 40 and 44.  For further details, see Section 14.7.
n. Prior to randomization, the subject will use the hand -held device to complete selected questions from the BPI-SF questionnaire, Question 3, worst pain in the 
last 24 hours will be completed for at least 4 days during a period of no more than 1 week prior to randomization. The average of the 4 days will be used as 
the randomization stratification value.

o.Twenty -four (24) -hour analgesic use will be collected and it will be assessed by the study investigator until the W eek 48 visit.  Twenty -four (24) -hour analgesic 
use will also be collected by the study investigator at each telephone contact (in Arms A and B) or visit at W eeks 28, 32, 40, and 44. 
p.Systolic / diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and heart rate will be measured after the subject ha s rested for at least 5 minutes.
q.After a complete physical examination at screening , subsequent physical examinations may be 'brief,' but should include any systems with symptoms.  All 
physical examinations will be performed by a physician according to the standard of care.
r.Complete blood count, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red b lood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, platelet count, and differential blood count reported as absolute count or percentage for neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, mo nocytes, eosinophils, and basophils will be collected.  Chemistry panel including serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, chlori de, calcium, 
phosphorous, magnesium, total bilirubin, total alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lac tate dehydrogenase (screening only), 
and albumin (screening only).
s. Laboratory assessments should be performed within 72 hours of the visit and the results assessed and documented prior to dosing.
t. The PSA result for each dosing visit may be assessed p ost-dose.
u. Radiological / progression (according to PC WG2 criteria) will be assessed by means of whole body technetium-99 bone scan, chest X-ray (in the presence of 
suspicious lesion[s], a chest CT scan will be performed to confirm and characterize the l esion[s]), and MRI /CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  Baseline 
tumor assessment should be performed within 14 (± 7) days of randomization.  If standard of care bone scan and / or MRI / CT scan of the abdomen and 
pelvis and chest X -ray within 8 weeks of randomization are available, they do not need to be repeated at baseline.  If they are not available, they should be 
performed within 14 days ± 7 days of randomization (i.e., during the screening period).  Subsequent tumor assessment should b e performed at Week 8, 
Week 16, Week 24 and every 12
weeks thereafter for up to 2 years after the subject’s last dose of radium -223 dichloride or until radiological progression 
(according to PC WG2 criteria or RECIST guidelines), or death, whichever comes first.  If prog ression is detected by bone scan, a confirmatory bone scan is 
required at least 6 weeks later.  All images should be obtained with the same technique (e.g., CT or MRI) as those obtained a t screening.  Schedule 
deviations of ± 2 weeks for imaging / tumor ev aluations are allowed.
v.Imaging is not required at the EOT visit if the subject discontinued due to radiological progression or the last tumor evalua tion is not older than 4 weeks.
w. Bone imaging should be within 8 weeks of randomization.  If no prior documentation is available, a whole body technetium-99 bone scan will be obtained at 
screening (within 14 ± 7 days of randomization).
x.The IVRS / IW RS will be used to register requests for eligibility / study drug doses.  Once the subject eligibility is a pproved and registered in the IVRS / IW RS, 
including entry of required demographic and stratification information, the initial drug shipment may be prepared.  Additiona l IVRS / IW RS transactions for 
dose orders may be required; follow the country-specific guidance in the IVRS / IW RS manual.  The latest order date for the next dose is no later than the 
pre-defined lead time (number of days from order received to delivery to site in the country) prior to the planned dosing date.  The planned date for the next
dose must be specified, when the dose is requested in the IVRS / IW RS.  At Doses 1 through 5, the site should order the next dose in the IVRS / IW RS, as 
soon as the current visit’s dose is registered in the IVRS / IW RS.  The latest order date for the next dose is no later than the pre -
defined lead time (number of 
days from order received to delivery to site in the country) prior to the planned dosing date.  For subject visit registratio ns in the IVRS / IW RS, see the IVRS / 
IWRS manual.
y.The subject shou ld be encouraged to arrive at the clinic well -hydrated on each dosing day and to drink ad libitum after each dose of radium -223 dichloride.  The 
subject should avoid drinking or eating within 1 hour before and after administration of the study drug.
z. Thesubject contact card is to be provided at each dosing visit for the subject to carry with him until the next visit.
aa. Subject and family instructions should be reviewed with the subject during screening through Dose 1, Day 1.
bb. Subjects identified wit h possible SSEs will be asked to come to the clinic for an SSE evaluation.  An SSE risk questionnaire will be developed.  Sym ptomatic 
skeletal events will not be identified over the telephone.
cc. If a subject has an SSE in the active follow -up period, he will continue active follow -up for 2 years following last study treatment.  At Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44, 
subjects in Treatment Arms A and B will receive telephone contacts assessing for possible SSE risks.  Subjects exhibiting sym ptoms indicative of possib le 
SSEs will be encouraged to visit the clinic early to assess SSE

status.  Symptomatic skeletal events will not be determined over the phone. 
dd.Except for complete analgesic use information recorded through W eek 48, limited concomitant medication, incl uding narcotic pain medication, will be recorded 
during the active follow -up with clinic visits period.  Contrast agents will only be captured as concomitant medication if there is an AE or SAE relat ed to 
administration of contrast media. 
ee. Subjects who receive further anticancer therapy during the active follow-up period will have an end of active follow -up with clinic visits and will enter the active 
follow -up without clinic visits (telephone follow -up).  Subjects who receive further anticancer therapy after 2 years from last study treatment will enter long -
term follow -up. Radium-223 dichloride should not be given concurrently with abiraterone plus prednisone/prednisolone.
ff. All AEs and SAEs will be assessed and recorded from the time the ICF is signe d until 30 days after the last dose of study medication.  All AEs should be 
assessed and documented prior to each dose of radium -223 dichloride.
gg. Any AEs and SAEs occurring beyond 30 days after the last treatment must be documented and reported if consi dered to be related to study medication or if 
related to an SSE.  However, all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary 
malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time and regardle ss of the investigator’s causality assessment. In addition, during follow -up all bone fractures 
and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s 
causality assessment.
hh. Any SAEs must be documented and reported if considered to be related to study medication.  However, all occurrences of leukem ia, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time and regardless of the 
investigator’s causality assessme nt.In addition, during follow -up all bone fractures and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as 
either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 76of 291
The active follow-up has 2 distinct periods: the active follow- up with clinic visits and the 
active follow -up without clinic visits.   Once a subject switches from active follow -up with 
clinical visits to active follow
-up without clinical visits, the subject will not be allowed to 
switch back. However, in the event an SSE is identified at an unscheduled clinic visit in a n
active follow -up subject, an unscheduled -visit SSE should be recorded regardless of whether 
the subject is receiving clinic visits or telephone- only follow -up.
7.1.2.7.1 Active follow
-up w ith clinic visits
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1), 2 (Section 13.2 ), 3 (Section 13.3), and 4 
(Section 13.4.1.2 ).
The subject should return to the clinic every  12weeks (± 14 day s) following the EOT visit
until the subject experiences a s ymptomatic skeletal event or until the primary  efficacy  
analysis matures, whichever occurs first.  
Active follow -up will continue for 2 y ears in this 
study  and not more than 7 y ears total including the long term follow
-up study  (if the subject 
has signed the ICF).
To the extent possible, subjects discontinuing treatment prematurel y should nonetheless 
complete the Week 8, 16, 24, 36, and 48 clinic visits and an y applicable tumor assessments 
scheduled with respect to treatment start. Similarly , subjects in Treatment Arms A and B 
should receive Week 28, 32, 40, and 44 telephone contacts at the regularl y scheduled time 
with respect to treatment start.
In addition to the visits at Weeks 36 and 48 (from the start of treatment) the subjects in 
Treatment Arms A and B will r eceive telephone contacts at Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44 (from 
the start of treatment) to assess for possible SSE risks and wil l continue PRO data collection. 
Pain data, 24 -hour analgesic use ,BPI and NCCN -FACT FPSI -17 questionnaire s will also be

Assessment of radiological progression 
will be made by independent central review .
Radiological progression of soft tissue disease is determined according to RECI ST 1.1 based 
on MRI  or CT scans (see S ection 14.1) .  Radiological progression of osseous disease is 
determined according to adapted PCWG2 criteria based on whole body technetium -
99 bone 
scans (30) (see Section 14.2).  Radiologic al bone progression is determined if at least one of 
the following criteria is met:
The first bone scan with ≥ 2 new lesions compared to baseline is observed <
12weeks 
from randomization and is confirmed by a second bone scan taken ≥ 6 weeks later 
showing ≥ 2 additional new lesions (a total of ≥ 4 new lesions compared to baseline); 
or
The first bone scan with ≥2 new lesions compared to baseline is observed ≥ 12 weeks 
from randomization and the new lesions are verified on the next bone scan ≥ 6weeks 
later (a total of ≥2 new lesions compared to baseline).
Further details will be defined in the imaging charter and / or related central review 
documentation, and / or the SAP.

Pain assessments will occur dail y for one week, beginning a week prior to each visit and 
including the day  of the visit.  An evaluable pain assessment interval requires completion of a 
minimum of 4 out of 7 daily  questions. Pain progression is defined as the occurrence of a 
pain increase with respect to the applicable baseline.
A pain increase is defined as follows:
For asymptomatic subjects (WPS 0 to < 1 at baseline), pain increase is defined as an 
increase of 2 or more points in the average (i.e., average of 7 -day assessments) “worst 
pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥ 4 
weeks apart .

For mildly  symptomatic subjects (WPS 1 -3 at baseline), pain increase is defined as an 
increase of 2 or more points in the ave rage (i.e., average of 7 -day assessments) “worst 
pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations ≥ 4 
weeks apart and a n average worst pain score of ≥ 4”.
For s ymptomatic subjects with WPS > 3 and ≤ 7 at baseline), pain increase is defined 
as an increase of 2 or more points in the average (i.e., average of 7 -day assessments) 
“worst pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 consecutive evaluations 
≥ 4weeks apart .
The time to pain progression is defined for each applica ble baseline for applicable subjects as 
the time (in day s) from the respective baseline until occurrence of the first post-baseline pain 
progression event. Subjects without pain progression as of the last applicable post-baseline
assessment, whether or not surviving, will be censored at the last applicable post-baseline

Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1) and 3 (Section 13.3).
Time to increase in ph ysical sy mpto ms of disease based on the NCCN -FACT FPSI -17 
physical disease related sy mptoms (FPSI -DRS -P) subscale score measured up to Week 48 
after start of treatment will be assessed using the NCCN- FACT FPSI -17 questionnaire 
(Section 14.8).
The NCCN -FACT FPSI -17 is a validated instrument that was developed to assess symptoms 
of prostate cancer, s ymptoms caused b y the treatment of prostate cancer, and the health 
related qualit y of life of prostate cancer patients.( 26)  The instrument was developed in 
accordance with recent FDA guidance for the development of instruments for 
electronic
patient -reported outcome ( ePRO ).  The instrument contains 17 items, each of which utilizes a 
Likert scale with 5 possible responses.  The ten items reflect disease related phy sical 
symptoms of disease and the responses on the items are be summed to calcul ate a disease 
related ph ysical sy mptom subscale score.  One item represents emotional sy mptoms of 
disease and the response to that item is used to calculate a disease related emotional sy mptom 
subscale score.  Four items represent treatment related sy mptom s and the responses to these 
items are summed to calculate a treatment side effect subscale score.  Finally , two items 
represent functional well
-being and the responses to those items are summed to calculate a 
functional/well -being subscale score.
The NCCN -FACT FPSI -17 will be self- administered by  the subject via an ePRO device. 
Time to increase in ph ysical sy mptoms of disease based on (FPSI -DRS -P) will be calculated 
with respect to baseline value collected prior to first dosing , based onl y on assessments 
through Week 48. Details, including definition of an increase, will be provided in the SAP.

Section modified by Amendment s 1 (Section 13.1) and2 (Section 13.2).
For purposes of determining exploratory increase in analgesic use, pain improvement without 
an increase in analgesic use ,and pain progression without an increase in analgesic use , a 
daily  analgesic use score will be calculated programmatically  for each subject for each day , 
based on the subject’s complete case report fo rm (CRF ) data on analgesic use.  Analgesic use 
data will be coded using the World Health Organization ( WHO )drug dictionary .  Oral 
morphine equivalents (OMEs) will be calculated.  Each day ’s analgesic use in OME units 
will be calculated using the applicabl e CRF -reported dates and date ranges.  The AQA will be 
applied to obtain a daily  analgesic use score.  Details will be described in the SAP.

No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 97of 291
For subjects not on opioids at the applicable baseline, initiation of short or long -acting opioid 
use for pain will constitute an increase in analgesic use .  For subjects being treated with 
≤ 600 O ME (oral morphine equivalents) of opioids at the applicable baseline, an increase b y 
1point in the daily  AQA score and increase ≥ 50% in daily  OMEs will constitute an increase 
in analgesic use .  For subjects being treated at the highest AQA level (> 600 O ME/day ) at the 
applicable baseline, an increase ≥50% in dail y OMEs from that baseline will constitute an 
increase in analgesic use .

baseline for applicable subjects as the time (in days) from the respective baseline until 
occurrence of the first post
-baseline pain progression (pain increase) event or increase in 
analgesic use event, whichever occurs first.  Subjects with neither pain progression nor an 
increase in analgesic use as of the last applicable post -baseline assessment, whether or not 
surviving, will be censored at the last applicable post -baseline assessment.  Subjects not

adequate post -baseline assessment(s), will be censored at the applicable baseline date.  
Additional censoring and other details will be described in the SAP. 
Change in the last 24 -hour analgesic use score
Change in the last 24 -hour analgesic use score is calculated based on the subject’s analgesic 
use in the last 24 hours CRF data.

taken at applicable clinic visits (and in Arms A and B, at telephone contacts) will be coded 
using t he WHO drug dictionary  and OMEs will be calculated from the coded data.
For each subject and applicable visit or telephone contact, analgesic use in the last 24 hours 
will be scored using the AQA (see Section 14.9) based on the coded medications and 
corresponding OME quantities. 
Details on coding and scoring will described in the SAP. 
For each subject, for each applicable baseline and post- baseline time point, the subject’s

7.5.1 Adverse events
7.5.1.1 Definitions
Definition of adverse event
In a clinical study , an AE is any  untoward medical occurrence ( i.e.
,any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory  findings], sy mptom, or disease) in a patient 
or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 100of 291
the study .  Therefore, an AE may  or may  not be temporally  or causall y associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study  by any physician treating 
the subject should not be recorded as AE (however, the condition for wh ich the surgery  is 
required may be an AE).
In the following differentiation between medical history  and AEs, the term “condition” may  
include abnormal s ymptoms, diseases, laboratory , or vital sign findings.
Conditions that started before signing of ICFand for which no s ymptoms or treatment 
are present until signing of ICFare recorded as medical history  (e.g., seasonal allergy  
without acute complaints).
Conditions that started before signing of ICFand for which sy mptoms or treatment are 
present after signing of ICF, at unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history
(e.g., allergic pollinosis) .
Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as AEs.
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose, meets any  of the 
following criteria (a – g):
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization wil l not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met:
-The admission results in a hospital stay  of less than 12 hours
- The admission is pre- planned 
(i.e.,elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to the start of the study )
-The admission is not associated with an AE 
(e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during an y hospitalization may 
fulfill the criterion of ‘medicall y important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 101of 291
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory  authorities 
speci ficall y require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct normal life’s 
functions.
e.Is a congen ital anomal y / birth defect
f.Is another medically  important serious event as judged b y the investigator
g.Is an occurrence of leukemia, my elodysplastic s yndrome, aplastic anemia, and 
primary  bone cancer or any  other new primary  malignancy  (regardless of the 
investigator’s causalit y assessment)
If disease progression leads to signs and s ymptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness (e.g., 
hospitalization), the associated signs and s ymptoms should be reported as SAEs, not the 
underly ing cause (i.e., “progressiv e disease” should not be recorded as an SAE).  In this case 
disease progression should be mentioned on the SAE form as an “alternative explanation.”
An isolated laboratory  abnormality  that meets the criteria for CTCAE Grade 4 classification 
is not reportab le as an SAE, unless the investigator assesses that the event meets standard 
International Conference of Harmonisation criteria for an SAE.  All laboratory  abnormalities, 
including CTCAE Grade 4 abnormalities, will be documented on the laboratory eCRF 
(including values reported from central laboratories).
7.5.1.2 Classifications for adverse event assessment
All AEs will be assessed and documented b y the investigator according to the categories 
detailed below. 
7.5.1.2.1 Seriousness
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section 7.5.1.1.
7.5.1.2.2 Intensity
The intensity  of an AE is classified according to the grades specified by  the NCI -CTCAE, 
version 4.03 (see Section 14.4).

7.5.1.2.3 Causal relationship 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatm ent 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the 
eCRF.
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to the study  treatment in question.
Possible answers are “ yes” or “no”
An assessment of “no” would include:
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g., mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site.
or
2.Non-plausibility , e.g., the subject is struck by  an automobile when there is no 
indication that the dru g caused disorientation that may  have caused the event; cancer 
developing a few day s after the first drug administration.
An assessment of “y es” indicates that there is a reasonable suspicion that the AE is associated 
with the use of the study  treatment.
Important f actors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study  treatment 
include:
- The temporal sequence from drug administration
: The event should occur after the drug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the 
clinical context of the event.
-Recovery  on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re
-introduction 
(re-challenge) .
-Subject’s response after de -challenge or subjects response after re- challenge should be 
considered in the v iew of the usual clinical course of the event in question.
-Underl ying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases : 
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history  and course of the 
disease being treated and any  other disease the subject may  have.
-Concomitant medication or treatment: 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be 
examined to determine whether an y of them may  be suspected to cause the event in 
question.
-The pharmacology  and pharmacokinetics of the study  treatment: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study  treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacody namics should be 
considered.

Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to 
protocol -required procedure(s).
Possible answers are “y es” or “no”
7.5.1.2.4 Action taken with study treatment 
Any action on study  treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories 
listed below.
-Drug withdrawn
-Drug interrupted
-Dose reduced
-Dose not changed
-Dose increased
-Notapplicable
-Unknown
7.5.1.2.5 Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events

7.5.1.3 Assessments and documentation of adverse events
Section modified by Amendments 2 (Section 13.2) and 4 (Section 13.4.1.2 ).
All AEs occurring from the time the subject signs the I CFuntil 30 day s after the last dose of 
study  medication must be recorded on the eCRF.  Treatment- emergent AEs and all SAEs that 
occur during the treatment period and up to 30 days after the last administration of 
radium -223 dichloride must be reported on the appropriate eCRF.
A laboratory  test abnormality  should be reported as an AE if it is considered clinically  
relevant (e.g., causing the subject to withdraw from the study ), requires treatment, causes 
apparent clinical manifestations, or is judged as relev ant by  the investigator.   Laboratory 
abnormalities that are not considered clinically  significant do not need to be entered as an 
AE. Laboratory  abnormalities related to the disease under stud y (e.g. ,PSA, testosterone) do 
not need to be recorded as AEs. Each event should be described in detail along with start and 
stop dates (onset and resolution of event), intensity , temporal and causal relationship to 
investigational product and / or protocol- related procedures, possibly  alternative factors (co -
morbidi ties, co-medications), therapeutic action taken, result of therapeutic action, and 
ultimate outcome of the AE.  The investigator’s assessment of AEs and laboratory  results 
with grades and causality assessments must be documented and retained in the source 
documentation.
If more than one AE occurs, each event should be recorded separatel y.  All AEs and SAEs 
are to be followed until resolved or as clinically  required.
All AEs and SAEs occurring bey ond 30 day s after the last treatment have to be reported if 
considered to be related to study  medication or if related to anSSE (during active follow-up 
with clinic visits only ).  However, all occurrences of leukemia, m yelod ysplastic sy ndrome, 
aplastic anemia, and primary  bone cancer or any  other new primary  maligna ncy must be 
reported as SAEs at an y time, and regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.  In 
subjects who receive cy totoxic chemotherapy ,all occurrences of febrile neutropenia or 
hemorrhage during their chemotherap y treatment must be reported as SAEs at any  time and 
for up to 6 months thereafter. In addition, during the long- term follow -up a ll bone fractures 
and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if 
the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.  If a 
subject is unable to provide required details for events of interest, this information may  need 
to be obtained from the primary  provider.
Adverse events may  be reported spontaneousl y by the subject or elicited through open 
(non-leading) questioning during each visit during the treatment period and for 30 day s after 
the last dose.  As far as possible, all AEs must be described b y their duration (start and stop 
date), severity  (graded according to the CTCAE, version 4.03), relationship to treatment, and 
according to the need of other specific therap y. All information will be recorded in the 
source documentation and AE eCRF.

Subjects who sign the ICF and are randomized but who discontinue prior to receiving the first 
dose will not be followed for safety .
7.5.1.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
Section modified by Amendment 4 (Section 13.4.1.2 ).
The definition of SAEs is given in Section 7.5.1.1.
Each SAE must be followed up until resolution or stabilization by  submission of updated 
reports to the designated recipient.
If disease progression leads to signs and s ymptoms that meet the criteria for seriousness (e.g., 
hospitalization), the associated signs and s ymptoms should be reported as SAEs, not the 
underly ing cause (i.e., “progressive disease” should not be recorded as an SAE).  In this case, 
disease progression should be mentioned on the SAE form as an “alternative explanation.”
Reporting of additional malignancies
All occurrences of leukemia, my elodysplastic s yndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary  bone 
cance r or any  other new primary  malignancy  must be reported as SAEs at any  time, 
regardless of the investigator's causality  assessment.
Investigator’s notification of the sponsor
All investigators will be thoroughly instructed and trained on all relevant aspect s of the 
investigator’s reporting obligations for SAEs.  This information, including all relevant 
contact details, is summarized in the investigator site file.  This information will be updated 
as needed.
All SAEs occurring during the observation period de fined in Section 7.5.1.3 must 
immediately  (within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness) be reported to the recipient 
detailed in the manual.  An SAE form must also be completed within 24 hours of the 
investigator awareness and forwarded to the designated recipient.  Each SAE must be 
followed up until resolution or stabilization by  submission of updated reports to the 
designated recipient.
Serious AEs occurring after the protocol- defined observation period will be processed by  the 
sponsor according to all applicable regulations.
In addition, during the long- term follow -up a ll bone fractures and bone associated events 
(e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, 
regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.
Any CTCAE Grade 4 screening laboratory  abnormality  that is part of the disease profile 
should not be reported as an SAE, specifically  when they  are allowed or not excluded by  the

protocol inclusion / exclusion criteria.  If an investigator is in doubt about the applicable 
reporting obligations, he / she should consult with the study monitor for the sponsor.
Notification of the independent ethics committees / independent review boards
Notification of the independent ethics committees ( IECs )/ institutional review boards ( IRBs)
about all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions 
[SUSARs ]) will be performed by the sponsor and / or by the investigator according to all 
applicable regulations.
Notification of the authorities
The processing and reporting of all relevant events ( e.g., SAEs, SUSARs) to the authorities 
will be done by  the sponsor according to all ap plicable regulations.
Sponsor’s notification of the investigational site
The sponsor will inform all investigational sites about reported relevant events ( e.g.,
SUSARs) according to all applicable regulations.  The sponsor will send SUSARs to a site 
once t he site initiation visit has occurred and will stop sending SUSARs to a site once the last 
subject EOT visit for that site (30 day s after last dose) occurs.
7.5.1.5 Expected adverse events
For this study , the applicable reference document is the most current versi
on of the IB.  
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the clinical development are 
shown in the current IB.  If relevant new safet y information is identified, the information will 
be integrated into an update of the IB and distri buted to all participating sites.
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor according to the applicable 
reference document and according to all local regulations.
7.5.2 Pregnancies
The investigator must report to the sponsor an y pregnancy occurri ng in a study  subject ’s 
partner during the subject’s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted within 
the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy  per se is not considered an SAE.  
Bayer usuall y does not gather information of drug exposure via the father ;however, if those 
cases are reported , all efforts should be made to obtain similar information on course and 
outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used.

7.5.3 Further safety
7.5.3.1 Laboratory evaluations
Section modified by Amendment 1 (Section 13.1).
Blood samples will be collected b y a member of the investigator’s team per the schedule of 
assessments.  The same local laboratory  should be used throughout the study  for a given 
subject.  The following laboratory assessments will be recorded with reference ranges:
CBC, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, RBC count, MCV, MCH, MCHC, WBC 
count, platelet count, and differential blood count reported as absolute count or 
percentage for neutrophils, lymphocy tes, monocy tes, eosinophils, and basophils
Chemistry  panel, including serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
phosphorous, magnesium, total bilirubin, total ALP, AST, AL T, LDH (screening 
only), and albumin (screening onl y)
7.5.3.2 Physical examination
The phy sical examination (by  means of inspection, palpation, auscultation) will be performed 
by a ph ysician at the investigational site.  A complete phy sical examination will be performed 
at the screening visit; a brief ph ysical examination wi ll be performed at all other visits.  Brief 
physical examinations will include sy stems of primary  relevance and those sy stems 
associated with s ymptoms.  Full and brief phy sical examinations will be performed according 
to the standard of care.
7.5.3.3 Vital signs
Systolic / diastolic blood pressure, respiratory  rate, body  temperature, and heart rate will be 
measured after the subject has rested for at least 5 minutes.
7.5.3.4 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
A screening ECOG PS of 0 to 2 must be confirmed and documented.  The ECOG PS is 
defined in Section 14.5.
7.5.3.5 Body w eight
Section modified by Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
Body weight will be mea sured without shoes, using a calibrated electronic phy sician 
(column) scale with digital display , measurement units 0.1 kg.  The same scale should be 
used for a given subject throughout the stud y.  At all sites (in US and outside US), weight is 
to be taken only once for each dose.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 108of 291
For non -US sites ,the weight should be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing.
For US sites using the central PRD depot ONLY, subject weight for the dose day  
should be obtained at the site within 3 to 5 day s prior to the dose visit.  This weight 
must be reported to the country  PRD depot to allow adequate time for PRD 
preparation and delivery  (approximately  2 day s).  All efforts should be made to 
measure weight at the same visit with the pre- dose laboratory  assessments in order t o 
avoid 2 pre-dose clinic visits.   Body  weight can be obtained at the local healthcare 
provider on a calibrated scale and the results sent by  fax to the P rincipal Investigator
with advanced notice and agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor for each 
subject.  No other procedures can be done at the local healthcare provider.
7.6 Other procedures and variables
Not applicable.
7.7 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements
The proced
ures chosen for the evaluation of safety  in this study  population are consistent 
with the appropriate and ethical standards used in P hase II studies of oncology  drugs.
Tumor progression will be assessed b y MRI / CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis , chest 
X-ray,and whole bod y technetium -99 bone scan and it will be evaluated according to the 
PCWG2 criteria (see Section 14.2).  All images should be obtaine d with the same technique 
(e.g., MRI or CT) as those obtained at screening.
8.Statistical methods and determination of sample size

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 109of 291
Randomization will be stratified b y: 
Prior chemotherap y (≤1 regimen versus >1 regimen )
Total AL P (< 220 U/L versus ≥220 U/L ).
Average WPS of the BPI -SF(WPS ≤4 versus WPS > 4)
Analy sis of the primary  variables will be performed for each subgroup for individual 
stratification factors.  
Statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS; the version used will 
be specified in the SAP.
8.2 Analysis sets
Section modifie d by Amendments 2 (Section 13.2) and 3 (Section 13.3).
The following 3 anal ysis sets will be defined:
Intent -to-treat (ITT): All randomized subjects.  The ITT analysis set will be used in the 
analysis of all efficacy  endpoints.  Subjects will be included in all ITT anal yses according to 
the treatment to which they  were randomized.
Week 24 (W24):All ITT subjects in Arm A (standard dose) and Arm C (extended dosing) 
treated with radium-
223 dichloride and eligible for further treatment at W 24(i.e., 7th 
injection).  Week 24 applies to subjects who received the 6th injection without any dose 
delay s. As dose delay s are allow ed per protocol, 6th injection can occur after Week 24 for 
subjects who had dose delay s. Hence, this population is defined based on the number of 
injections not based on the timing.  The W24 dataset will be used for the analy sis of efficacy  
endpoints relat ed to Comparison 2 and associated evaluations.  Subjects will be included in 
W24 analy ses according to the treatment to which they  were randomized .  
Safety: All randomized subjects who have received at least one study  drug administration.  
This safet y analysis set will be used in the anal yses of all safet y endpoints.  Subjects will be 
included in the anal yses according to the treatment they  received.

8.4.1 Primary efficacy analysis
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1), 2 (Section 13.2 ), and 3 (Section 13.3).
Decision r ules and adjustment of alpha for p rimary endpoints
The primary  efficacy  endpoints, SSE-FS, will be analy zed separately  in 2respective 
comparisons, as described below.
Both compar isons will be performed at the time of final anal ysis, after the latest of 
(1)approximately  135 SSE -FS events in subjects included in Comparison 1 as defined below; 
(2) approximately  75 
SSE-FS events following the 6th dose in subjects included in 
Comparison 2 as defined below ;
and (3) the last subject has been followed for 30 day sfrom 
last treatment. In the event the applicable number of events is not reached, the primary  
endpoint anal ysis will mature 7 y ears after the last subject has received last treatment.
No alpha adjustment for multiple comparisons will be performed in this Phase II study . 
Comparison 1: Standard dos eversus high dose: SSE- FS from randomization in radium -

of up to 6 doses of 50 kBq/kg(55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update )(standard 
dose) radium -223 dichloride.
Comparison 1 will analyze SSE-FSwith randomization date as start d ate.
Comparison 1 will pool SSE-FS in subjects in 
Treatment Arm A, with SSE -FS truncated at 
24weeks in subjects in Treatment Arm C, and compare this pooled value with SSE-FS in 
Treatment 
Arm B.  Onl y ITT subjects will be included in this I TT anal ysis.  In this study , 
extended dosing subjects (Treatment Arm C) will receive the same treatment regimen as 
standard dose subjects (Treatment Arm A) for the first 6 doses, with Dose 7 scheduled to start 
after 24 weeks.  Accordingl y, data from Treatment Arm C subjects arising during the first

the study  assumptions.
It will be performed using a log -rank test with a 1 -sided alpha of 0.1 stratifie d by the 
randomization factor s (previous chemotherap y [≤1 regimen v ersus >1 regimen ] and total 
ALP [< 220 U/L versus ≥220 U/L ]).  The high-dose regimen will be declared superior to the 
standard -dosing regimen if the 1 -sided p- value from the stratified log- rank test is less than 
0.1. 
The hazard ratio (high dose / standard dose ) will be computed together with 2
-sided 80% and 
95% confidence intervals using a stratified Cox regression model with treatment as a factor 
and previous chemotherapy  (≤1 regimen v ersus >1 regimen) and total ALP ( <220 U/L  
versus ≥220 U/L ) as strata in the model for the ITT population.  Kaplan -Meier survival 
distribution tables and plots will also be produced for both Treatment ArmsA and B.

8.6 Determination of sample size
Section modified by Amendments 1 (Section 13.1), 2 (Section 13.2 ), and 3 (Section 13.3).
The sample size is calculated to have the indicated power, separatel y and with no 
multiple -testing adjustment, to detect one or both of the following:
Comparison 1: A 50% increase in SSE-
FS in subject s receiving a regimen 6 doses of 
80kBq/kg(88kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update) radium -223 dichloride 
every  28 day s (high dose) over subject s receiving a regimen of 6 doses of 50 kBq/kg
(55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update )radium -223 dichloride every  28 
days (standard dose )in a population of radium -223 dichloride -naïve subjects, and / or
Comparison 2: A 65% increase in SSE-FS following 24 weeks in 
subject s receiving a 
regimen of up to 6 additional doses of radium -223 dichloride 50kBq/kg (55kBq/kg 
after implementation of NIST update )every  28 day s (extended dose) over subject s 
receiving no further radium -223 dichloride treatment , in a population of subject s 
surviving SSE -free to 24 weeks who received a standard regimen of up to 6 doses of
radium -223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg (55kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update )
and who either completed standard treatment, or remained eligible to receive further 
radium -223 dichloride (not permanentl y dis continued from treatment) at 24 weeks.
The sample size calculations assume 30 subjects /month enrollment with 7 months ramp -
up 
and a 3% loss to follow -up per month.  The accrual period is anticipated to last approximately  
16 months. Overall, 360 subject s are expected to be randomized. The primary  endpoint 
cut-off, as defined in Section 8.4, is estimated to be reached in an average of 39 months. 
Comparison 1 will analyze SSE-FSfrom randomization date in subjects randomized to 
standar d dosing and high dose regimens, and SSE-FStruncated at 24 weeks in subjects 
randomized to the extended dose regimen . Subjects randomized to the standard dosing and 
extended dosing regimens will be pooled. Constant hazards are assumed with a median 
SSE-FS of 9 months throughout the stud y for the standard dosing regimen, a median SSE-FS 
of 9 months for the first 24 weeks from randomization for the extended dosing regimen, and a 
50% improvement (median 13.5, hazard ratio 0.667) throughout the stud y for the high dose 
regimen. Simulations indicated an average of 186.6 events would occur for this comparison 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507

at primary  endpoint cut-off, and a 1 -sided log -rank test with 0.10 significance gave 
approximately  90.5% power to test H01 versus HA1. 
Comparison 2 will 
analyze SSE-FSfrom the 6th dose ,in subjects surviving SSE-free to the 
6th dose . (27,28) A median SSE-FS of 9 months with constant hazards is assumed for 
standard dose. Extended dosing is assumed to have the same SSE-FS efficacy  as standard 
dosing for the first 24 weeks, and 65% improvement (hazard ratio 0.606) thereafter.  With 
240 of 360 subjects randomized to Treatment 
Arm A and Treatment Arm C, simulations 
indicated that 44.65% of randomized subject s (107.2 of 240) would have anSSE-FS event or 
loss to follow -upduring the first 24weeks, leaving an estimat ed55.35% (132.8) surviving 
SSE-free and eligible for inclusion at 24 weeks.  An average of 74.9 simulated events 
occurred for this comparison, and a 1- sided log -rank test with 0.10 significance gave 
approximately  80.6% power to test H02 versus HA2. 
Simulations assume continuous event and censoring times. Last treatment is assumed to 
occur 44 weeks (10.12 months) after last subject accrued.
Primary  endpoint power calculations were based on simulations programmed using SAS 
version 9.2 
and used 10,000 replicates.
9.Data handling and quality assurance
9.1 Data recording
It is the expectation of the sponsor that all data entered into the eCRF has source 
documentation available at the site.  The site must implement processes to ensure this 
happens.  A source document checklist will be used at the site to identify the source data for 
all data points collected an d the monitor will work with the site to complete this.
Data recorded from “only screened subjects (screening failures)”
Data of 'onl y screened subjects' will be recorded at least as source data, as far as the reason 
for the premature discontinuation is identifiable.  At minimum, data to be recorded in the 
eCRF are demographic information (subject number, date of birth / age, sex, race, and 
ethnicity ), the reason for premature discontinuation and date of last visit.  These data will be 
transferred to the respective database.
For screening failures with an SAE, the following additional data should be collected in the 
eCRF , in addition to demographic information, primary  reason for discontinuation and date 
of last visit :
All information about the SAE
All information related to the SAE such as:

9.2 Monitoring
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor’s / CRO’s procedures, monitors 
will contact the site prior to the start of the study  to review with the site staff the protocol, 
study  requirements, and their responsibilities to satisf y regulatory , ethical, and sponsor’s 
requirements. When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification and documentation of source data items.
Thesponsor /designee will monitor the site activity  to verify  that the:
Dataare authentic, accurate and complete

All study  subjects will be eligible for further follow -up either in this study  or in a separate 
long-term follow -up study  for up to 7 y ears.  The separate long -term follow -up study  has 
been set up to follow subjects who received radium -223 dichloride in the course of 
Bayer-sponsored clinical trials.  The long -term follow -up study  has a specific focus on 
inves tigator reported, radium -223 dichloride- related AEs and SAEs, all occurrences of 
leukemia, my elody splastic sy ndrome, aplastic anemia, primary  bone cancer or any  other new 
primary  malignancy , cancer treatment (including any  systemic cy totoxic chemotherap y or 
radiotherap y for an y malignancy ; all sy stemic anti -cancer therapies for prostate cancer, 
including androgen s ynthesis inhibitors / androgen -receptor antagonists , systemic 
radioisotopes and radiation treatment; excluding analgesics), in subjects who recei ve 
cytotoxic chemotherapy : all occurrences of febrile neutropenia or hemorrhage during their 
chemotherap y treatment and for up to 6 months thereafter , and survival for up to 7 years after 
last dose of radium -223 dichloride or until death. In addition, dur ing the long -term follow -
up, a ll bone fractures and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need to be reported as 
either AEs or SAEs if the criteria of SAE were met, regardless of the investigator’s causality  
assessment.  
During long- term follow -up, s ubjects , their treating health care professional, or 
caregiver will be contacted every  6 months by  telephone.  All subjects who transition into this 
separate long -term follow -up study  will require a separate signed informed consent.  Subject 
data collected at other standard -of
-care visits and / or contacts may  be used to satisfy  study -
required data.
Transition of all subjects into the separate long -term follow -up study  will begin following the 
later of primary  endpoint completion or 2 y ears after the last r adium -223 dichloride treatment 
is administered to the last treated subject.  
Until the transition to the long term follow -up study  begins, some subjects may  begin 
long-term follow -up in this study .  This study  will end when all subjects have transitioned 
into the long -term follow -up study  or discontinued from this study  for another reason (e.g., 
Consent Withdrawn, L ost to Follow -up).
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at an y time.
For an y of the above closures, the following applies:
Closures should occur only  after consulta tion between involved parties.   Final decision 
on the closure must be in writing.
All affected institutions ( e.g., IEC[s] /IRB
[s]; competent authority [ies]; study  center ; 
head of stud y center ) must be informed as applicable according to local law.
All study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must be 
returned to the sponsor.  The investigator will retain all other documents until 
notification given b y the sponsor for destruction.
In case of a partial study  closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study  
follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.2.1.

study  conduct; the investigator may  not modify  or alter the procedures described in this 
protocol.  
Modifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  either the sponsor or the 
investigator without agreement by  both parties.  However, the inve stigator or the sponsor 
may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to the trial subjects without prior IEC / IRB / sponsor approval / favorable opinion.  
As soon as possible, the implemented deviation o r change, the reasons for it and if 
appropriate the proposed protocol amendment should be submitted to the IEC /IRB /head of 
medical institution / sponsor.  Any deviations from the protocol must be explained and 
documented b y the investigator.
Details on discontinuation of the entire stud y or parts thereof can be found in Section 10.
11.2 Subject information and consent
All relevant information on the study will be summarized in an integrated subject information 
sheet and ICFprovided by  the sponsor or the study  center.  A sample subject information and 
ICF is provided as a docum ent separate to this protocol.
Based on this subject information sheet, the inve stigator or designee will explain all relevant 
aspects of the stud y to each subject / legal representative or prox y consenter (if the subject is 
under legal protection), prior to his entry  into the study  (i.e.,before any  examinations and 
procedures 
associated with the selection for the study  are performed or an y study -specific 
data is recorded on stud y-specific forms).
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IEC / IRB has been obtained.

Each subject / legal representative or p roxy consenter will have ample time and opportunity 
to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study  at an y time 
without any  disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision.
Only  if the subject / legal r epresentative or prox y consenter voluntaril y agrees to sign the ICF
and has done so, may  he enter the study .  Additionally , the investigator and other information 
provider (if an y) will personally sign and date the form.  The subject / legal representative or 
proxy consenter will receive a cop y of the signed and dated form.
The signed ICFstatement is to remain in the investigator site file or, if locally  required, in the 
subject ’s note / file of the medical institution.
In the event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are 
performed, the study  record or subject’s clinical record must clearl y show that informed 
consent was obtained prior to these procedures.
The I CF and any  other written information provided to subject
s / legal representatives or 
proxy consenters will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that 
may be relevant to the subject’s consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol that 
necessitates a change to the content of the subj ect information and / or the written I CF.  The 
investigator will inform the subject / legal representative or proxy  consenter of changes in a 
timely  manner and will ask the subject to confirm his participation in the study  by signing the 
revised ICF.  An y revised written I CF and written information must receive the IEC’s / IRB’s 
approval / favorable opinion in advance of use.

13.Protocol amendments
13.1 Amendment 1
Description of the amendment
Amendment 1 is an amendment to the original protocol dated 09 AUG 2013.  Changes to the 
protocol include:
Clarification of the comparisons performed and populations of inference for the 
primary  objective
Reduction of estimated time until CSR is produced with long -term safet y evaluations 
reported separatel y.
Addition of a n exploratory objective to evaluate the quality  of life based on the 
NCCN FACT -P Symptom I ndex -17 (NCCN -FACT FPSI -17)with associated data 
collection.

arm, every  28 weeks for the first 48 weeks.
Added a clarification of when the primary  anal ysis will be performed in the event that 
too few SSE events occur to trigger the primary  analy sis (135 SSE -FS events for 
Comparison 1 and 75 SSE- FS events for Comparison 2).
Clarification of the safety  analy ses performed.
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 127of 291
Clarification of how and when the IVRS / I RWS will be used in the study  so that 
study  drug is shipped to the investigator sites on- time for the subject ’s next dose .
Clarification of central review of radiological and quantitated bone scan endpoints.
Added a stud y specific dose modification to mandate discontinuation of treatment 
with radium -223 dichloride in subjects who experience Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 
> 7days despite adequate treatment.
Changed the safety  review during the study  from an independent data monitoring 
committee to a joint safety review committee ;membership may  include investigators, 
sponsor team members, and/or independent members.
Changed laboratory assessments from bilirubin to total bilirubin.
13.1.1 Overview of changes
Change 1:
Revised primary  objectives to be co- primary  objectives to evaluate efficacy  in treating 
metastatic bone cancer in subjects with CRPC.  Also clarified the descriptions of the 
populations in the two overall comparisons; the revised descriptions are as follows:
oThe first co- primary  objective compares subjects who receive radium-223 
dichloride 50 kBq/kg every  28days for up to 6 doses with radium -223 
dichloride 80 kBq/kg every  28 day s for up to 6 doses in radium -223 
dichloride- naïve subjects.  
oThe second co -primary  objective compares subjects who receive radium- 223 
dichloride 50 kBq/kg every  28 day s for up to 6 additio nal doses compared to 
no further radium -223 dichloride treatment in subjects with CRPC metastatic 
to the bone who previously  received radium- 223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg every  
28days for up to 6 doses, and survived SSE free and are eligible for further 
radium -223 dichloride treatment.

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 130of 291
Rationale :Post hoc analyses of the impact of body size on the efficacy  and safet y of 
radium -223 dichloride have previousl y been performed on the ALSYMPCA database .  After 
reviewing the original protocol version 1.0 (dated 09 Aug 2013), the FDA requested that this
be evaluated prospectively  in this study  as an exploratory  objective and the Sponsor agrees.  
Due to the dosing regimen based on total body weight, the evaluation of the potential impact 
of other bod y size descriptors on the efficacy and safet y of radium -223 dichloride may  
provide information relevant to the radium
-223 treatment optimization program.
Change 5:
Added an inclusion criteria to include subjects who are at least 18 y ears of age and not 
expose adolescent subjects whose bone development ma y be adversel y affected b y radium -
223 dichloride.
Sections affected include:
Synopsis - Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion
5.1.1 I nclusion criteria
Rationale: This change was made to be consistent with the approved label for Xofigo and to 
eliminate any exposure of potential, though unlikely , adolescent subjects whose bone 
development might be affected.
Change 6: 
Added an inclusion criteria to only  include male subjects who agree to use condoms, if 
sexually  active, and /ortheir female partners to us e effective methods of birth control to 
prevent pregnancy .  This requirement complies with the US package insert.
Sections affected include:
Synopsis - Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion

Rationale:   The definition of bone progression was revised to the adapted PCWG2 criteria to 
be consistent across the radium-
223 dichloride program following recent comments from the 
FDA on another radium -223 dichloride study .  Appropriate changes to the time points of the 
assessment of radiological progression were made and a reference to the new definition was 
also added.
Change 8:
Changed the exclusion criteria concerning treatment with an investigational drug by  deleting 
“or planned treatment with an investigational drug during the treatment period or follow -up”.  
Subjects would unlikely  plan to be treated with another investigational drug y ears in advance 
and, if they  do receive an investigation study  drug during the treatment period or follow -up, 
then they  would be excluded from the efficacy  analy sis because of receiving prohibited 
concomitant drugs.

Revised method and schedule of pain and analgesic use assessments to provide for addition
al
daily  electronic patient- reported outcome (e PRO )pain assessments for 7 day s and telephone 
contacts to assess BPI -SF and analgesic use, in Arms A and B at Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44.
  
Consistent collection schedules thro ugh Week 48 supports deleting language characterizing

Change 10:
Change dthe point when the primary  endpoint will be performed b y reducing minimum 
follow -up after last patient last treatment from 24 months to 1 month, and providing that in 
the event that too few SSE events (135 SSE events for Comparison 1 and 75 SEE events for
Comparison 2) occur to trigger the primary  anal ysis.  This change reduces the estimated 
study  duration and slightly  reduces the estimated power.

8.6 Determination of Sample Size
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 133of 291
Rationale:   Dependence of primary  endpoint completion on safet y follow-up is being relaxed 
to enable primary  endpoint completion to mature earlier to support FDA post -marketing 
commitment deadlines. Safet y events re ported after primary  endpoint completion will be 
reported in a separate document.
Change 1 1:
Revised randomization stratification to include to be stratified by  worst pain score (WPS) of 
the BPI -SF (WPS ≤4 versus WPS > 4), and provided for collection of s elected BPI -SF pain 
data for 4 day s prior to randomization to calculating stratification value .

6.1 Treatments to be administered
6.3 Treatment assignment
7.1.1 Tabulated overview, Table

7.1.2.1 Screening period
8.1 General considerations
Rationale:   Pain added as randomization stratification factor to address FDA comment 
requesting a method to better ensure that baseline pain levels are consistent across the 
treatment arms.  Not adde d to efficacy  anal ysis stratification to avoid added risk of sparse 
cells.
Change 1 2:
Modified end of active follow -up to continue bey ond minimum of 2 y ears from last treatment 
to earlier of first SSE or primary  endpoint maturation in patients receiving cl inic visits, while 
ending active follow -up at 2 y ears in all cases in subjects receiving telephone contact onl y.

7.1.2.6.2 Active follow -up without scheduled clinic visits
7.1.2.7.1 End of active follow- up with clinic visits
7.1.2.7.2 End of active follow- up without scheduled clinic visits
Rationale:   End of follow -up was made different for acti ve follow -up with clinic visits and 
telephone -only active follow -up to reflect their different capacities.  To ensure primary  
endpoint completion and adequate stud y power, patients in study  need to continue follow -
up 
for SSEs to first SSE if before primary endpoint completion, if after the two -year period 
selected to evaluate safety . As subjects without clinic visits cannot have primary  endpoint 
SSE evaluations, telephone- only follow -up need occur onl y for 2 -year safety  period. 
Change 1 3:
Changed the safety  review during the study  from an independent data monitoring committee 
to a joint safety  review committee; membership may  include investigators, sponsor team 
members, and/or independent members.
Sections affected included:
Synopsis - Meth
odology
3 Investigators and other study  personnel
4.3 Interim Anal yses and Joint Safety  Review Committee -new section
8.4.4 Safet y anal ysis
Rationale:   A Data Monitoring Committee, with a stringent membership requirement of onl y 
independent members, is not necessary  for this open -label study .  Therefore, a Joint Safety  
Review Committee (JSRC), whose membership requirements that are less stringent and can 
include investigators, sponsor members, and/or independent members, is adequate for this 
study .  The JSRC ’s mandate will be limited to safety  to reduce the possibility  of any  bias 
arising from study
 principal participation.
Change 1 4:

Sections affected included:
7.1.1 Tabular overview, Table 7 -1 Schedule of procedures
7.1.2.1 Screening period
Rationale:   Clarification
Change 1 6:
Added that on Study  Day 1 visit, study  eligibility  must be reconfirmed for hematology  tests if 
the results are greater than 72 hours prior to the first do
seof study  drug.  This is not a new 
requireme nt.  Itwas in Section 7.1.2.2, but stated differentl y.
Section affected include:
7.1.2.2 I nitial visit -Dose 1, Day  1 (Treatment Arms A, B, and C)
Rationale:   Moved this text and r estated to emphasize that he matology  results should be 
reconfirmed to be within the entry  criteria prior to the first dose of study medication .
Change 1 7:
A study  specific radium -223 dose modification to mandate discontinuation of treatment in 
patients who experience grade 4 neutrope nia lasting more than 7 days.
Section affected:
5.2.1 Withdrawal
6.4.7 Dose delay s
Rationale:   
Thestudy  specific radium -223 dose modification was added as per FDA request. 
The addition of the dose modification was agreed with Bay er Global Pharmacovigilance in 
consideration of the higher doses and extended regimen investigated in this trial.

Change 19:
Modified safet y anal ysis section to define treatment -
emergent period, and to provide for an 
analysis of safety  events arising after primary  endpoint completion i n a separate document 
from the CSR
Sections affected include:
8.4.4 Safet y anal ysis
Rationale:   Change clarifies treatment- emergent safet y event anal ysis.  As primary  endpoint 
completion following amendment is expect edto occur before the end of 2 -year active safet y 
follow -up, 
this provides for an anal ysis of events emerging after primary  endpoint 
completion, as well as any long- term follow -up events in a separate document.
Change 
20:
Added that IVRS / I WRS procedures can be found in the I VRS / I WRS manual.
Section affected:
7.1.2.2 I nitial visit -Dose 1, Day  1 (Treatment Arms A, B, and C)
Rationale:   Clarification
Change 21:
Changed the terminology for “active safet y follow -up” period to “active follow -up” period 
since efficacy  assessments are also included 
in these visits.  I n addition, the terminology  for 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
No.  16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 137of 291
“extended active follow- up” period was changed to “long -term follow -up” period; this 
change was done to ensure the use of a consistent term across the radium-223 program.

17 items, each of which utilizes a L ikert scale with 5 possible responses.  The t en 
items reflect disease related phy sical sy mptoms of disease and the responses on the 
items are be summed to calculate a disease related phy sical s ymptom subscale score.  
One item represents emotional sy mptoms of disease and the response to that item is 
used to calculate a disease related emotional sy mptom subscale score.  Four items 
represent treatment related sy mptoms and the responses to these items are summed to 
calculate a treatment side effect subscale score.  Finally , two items represent 
functional well -being and the responses to those items are summed to calculate a 
functional/well -being subscale score.  
The NCCN -FACT FPSI -17 will be self- administered by  the subject via an ePRO 
device. 
For each applicable baseline, time to increase in phy sical s ymptoms of disease based

until occurrence of the first pain progression event.  Subjects without pain progression 
as of the last included pain assessment, whether or not surviving, will be censored at 
the la st included pain assessment.
New text:
Pain progression is defined for each baseline in subjects evaluable for pain 
progression at the applicable baseline, i.e., subjects with a WPS of ≤ 7 at the 
respective baseline assessment.  Pain assessments will occur daily for one week, 
beginning a week prior to each visit and including the day  of the visit.  An evaluable 
pain assessment interval requires completion of a minimum of 4 out of 7 daily  
questions.  Pain progression is defined as the occurrence of either a pain increase or 
an increase in pain management with respect to the applicable baseline, whichever 
occurs first.
A pain increase is defined as follows:
For asymptomatic patients (WPS 0 to < 1 at baseline), pain increase is defined 
as an increase of 2 or mo re points in the average (i.e., average of 7 -day 
assessments) “worst pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 
consecutive evaluations ≥ 4 weeks apart 
For mildly  symptomatic patients (WPS 1 -3 at baseline), pain increase is 
defined as an increase of 2 or more points in the average (i.e., average of 7- day 
assessments) “worst pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 
consecutive evaluations ≥ 4 weeks apart and an average worst pain score of ≥ 
4”
For s ymptomatic patients with WPS > 3 and ≤ 7 at baseline), pain increase is 
defined as an increase of 2 or more points in the average (i.e., average of 7 -day 
assessments) “worst pain in 24 hours” score from baseline observed at 2 
consecutive evaluations ≥ 4weeks apart .
An increase in pain manageme nt is defined as follows:
For patients not on opioids at the applicable baseline, initiation of short or long -acting 
opioid use for pain will constitute an increase in pain management.  For patients being 
treated with ≤ 600 OME (oral morphine equivalents) of opioids at the applicable 
baseline, an increase b y 1point in the daily  AQA score and increase ≥ 50% in daily  
OMEs will constitute an increase in pain management.  For patient sbeing treated at 
the highest AQA level (> 600 OME/d ay) at the applicable baseline, an increase ≥50% 
in daily  OMEs from that baseline will constitute an increase in pain management.
The time to pain progression is defined for each applicable baseline for applicable 
subjects as the time (in day s) from the respective baseline until occurrence of the first 
post-baseline pain progression event.  Subjects without pain progression as of the last

applicable post-baseline assessment, whether or not surviving, will be censored at the 
last applicable post-baseline assessment.  Subjects with insufficient applicable 
baseline assessment(s) or without adequate post -baseline assessment(s) will be 
censored at the applicable baseline date. Additional censoring and other details will 
be described in the SAP .

a.Once a subject switches from active safety follow -up with clinical visits to active safety follow -up wit hout clinical visits, the subject will not be 
allowed to switch back.  A subject with a possible SSE may, and is encouraged to, return to the clinic at any time to assess for the 
presence of a nSSE.
b.Once a separate, extended safety follow -up protocol, f or the inclusion of subjects who received radium -223 dichloride in the course of Bayer 
sponsored clinical studies, has been implemented, the study subjects surviving after the end of the 2 years of active follow -up will be 
transitioned to this separate, ex tended safety follow -up protocol and the current study will be terminated at the time the last study subject 
is transitioned.
c.The maximum period for rescreening screen failed subjects is 35 days (14 days screening + 7 -day window + 14 days for rescreenin g) from 
signing the ICF to randomization.  Rescreening of a subject requires prior approval of the Bayer -designated medical representative (see 
Section 5.1).  Eligibility should be confirmed within 14 ± 7 day s of randomization.
d.The subject should return to the clinic in advance of the scheduled dose visit such that results of the laboratory assessment are available 
within 72 hours prior to dosing (each dose period is 28 ± 7 day s after the prior dose of radium -223 dichloride).

e.Subjects who can no longe r travel to the clinical site or who receive further anticancer therapy will only be followed up by telephone (active 
follow -up without clinic visits).  Sy mptomatic skeletal events will not be collected over the phone.
f.The study record or subject’s clin ical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to any other study procedures being 
performed.  Eligibility should be confirmed during the screening period and reconfirmed prior to dosing at Dose 1, Day 1.
g.Reconfirmation of eligibility and registration in the IVRS / IW RS: hematology results obtained within 72 hours of Dose 1, Day 1 should be 
reviewed and it should be confirmed that the values are still within the treatment ranges (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet 
count ≥100x109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL).  
h.Body weight should be obtained without shoes, using a calibrated electronic physician (column) scale with digital display, me asurement 
units 0.1 kg.  The same scale should be used for a given subject throughout the study.  At all sites (in US and outside US), weight is to be 
taken only once for each dose.  For non -US sites and US sites not using the central PRD depot, the weight should be performed within 72 
hours prior to dosing.  For US sites using the central PRD depot ONLY, subject weight for the dose day should be obtained at the site 
within 3 to 5 days prior to the dose visit.  This weight must be reported to the country PRD depot to allow adequate time for PRD 
preparation and delivery (approximately 2 days).  All efforts should be made to measure wei ght at the same visit with the pre-dose 
laborator y assessments in order to avoid 2 pre- dose clinic visits.  Please note this is applicable to all dosing visits.
i. Randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by the use of prior chemotherapy ( ≤ 1 regim en versus > 1 regimen ) and by total alkaline 
phosphatase (< 220U/L versus ≥220U/L).  This assessment will occur when the second call is made to the IVRS / IW RS to order drug: ≥
10 to 14 day s prior to study treatment administration.
j.Pain will be asses sed daily during the screening period for the 7 days prior to Dose 1, Day 1 and then daily for 7 days prior to each 
scheduled treatment visit through the end of Week 48.  Subjects will complete the daily pain assessment.  The daily PRO pain input 
results s hould be reviewed at the visit to check for completeness.
k.For Treatment Arms A and B only atWeeks 36 and 48 only.
l.When a subject is determined to be eligible, the subject will be trained on daily PRO pain data collection.  The subject will then comp lete the 
pain assessment daily for the 7 days prior to Dose 1, Day 1.
m. The BPI -SF questionnaire will be completed at each clinic visit from Dose 1, Day 1 until the W eek 48 visit.  For further details, see
Section 14.7.
n.Analgesic use will be collected and it will be assessed by the treating physician .
o.Systolic / diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and heart rate will be measured after the subject ha s rested for at 
least 5 minutes.
p.After a complete physical examination at screening, subsequent physical examinations may  be 'brief,' but should include any systems w ith 
symptoms.  All physical examinations will be performed by a phy sician according to the standard of care.
q.Complete blood coun t, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, platelet count, and differential blood count reported as a bsolute count 
or percentage for neutrophils, ly mphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils will be collected.  Chemistry panel including s erum 
creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, bilirubin, total alkaline phosphatase, aspartate tr ansaminase,

alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase (screening only ), and albumin (screening only).
r. Laborator y assessments should be performed within 72 hours of the visit and the results assessed and documented prior to dosi ng.
s. The PSA result for each dosing visit may be assessed post -dose.
t. Radiological / progression (according to PCW G2 criteria) will be assessed by means of whole body technetium -99 bone scan, chest X -ray 
(in the presence of suspicious lesion[s], a chest CT scan will be perform ed to confirm and characterize the lesion[s]), and MRI /CT scan 
of the abdomen and pelvis.  Baseline tumor assessment should be performed within 14 (± 7) days of randomization.  If standard of care 
bone scan and / or MRI / CT scan of the abdomen and pelvi s and chest X -ray within 8 weeks of randomization are available, they do not 
need to be repeated at baseline.  If they are not available, they should be performed within 14 days ± 7 days of randomizatio n (i.e., during 
the screening period).  Subsequent tum or assessment should be performed ever y 12 weeks during treatment, within 7 days prior to the 
EOT visit, and every 12 weeks during the active follow -up period with clinic visits for 2 years after the subject’s last dose of radium -223 
dichloride or until ra diological progression (according to PCW G2 criteria or RECIST guidelines), or death, whichever comes first.  All 
images should be obtained with the same technique (e.g., CT or MRI) as those obtained at screening.  Schedule deviations of ± 2 weeks 
for imaging / tumor evaluations are allowed.
u.Imaging is not required at the EOT visit if the subject discontinued due to radiological progression or the last tumor evalua tion is not older 
than 4 weeks.
v. Bone imaging should be within 8 weeks of randomization.  If no prior documentation is available, a whole body technetium -99 bone scan will 
be obtained at screening (within 14 ± 7 days of randomization).
w.The IVRS / I WRS will be used to register subject eligibility and request / confirm study drug doses.  Once the subject eligibility is approved 
and registered in the IVRS / I WRS, the initial shipment will be triggered .  Subsequent doses should be ordered as soon as the current 
visit's dose is registered in the IVRS / IW RS.  The planned date for the next dose mus t be specified, when the dose is requested in the 
IVRS / IW RS.  The order date for the next dose cannot be earlier than the pre -defined country lead time.
x.The subject should be encouraged to arrive at the clinic well -hydrated on each dosing day and to d rink ad libitum after each dose of 
radium -223 dichloride.  The subject should avoid drinking or eating within 1 hour before and after administration of the study drug.
y. The subject contact card is to be provided at each dosing visit for the subject to ca rry with him until the next visit.
z. Subject and family  instructions should be reviewed with the subject during screening through Dose 1, Day 1.
aa. Subjects identified with possible SSEs will be asked to come to the clinic for a nSSE evaluation.  A nSSE risk questionnaire will be 
developed.  Sy mptomatic skeletal events will not be identified over the telephone.
bb. If a subject has an SSE in the active safety follow -up period, he will continue the2-year active safety follow -up period .  At Weeks 28, 32, 
40, and 44, subjects in Treatment Arms A and B will receive telephone contacts assessing for possible SSE risks.  Subjects exh ibiting 
symptoms indicative of possible SSEs will be encouraged to visit the clinic early to assess SSE status.  Sy mptomatic skelet al events will 
not be determined over the phone.
cc.Limitedconcomitant medication, including narcotic pain medication, will be recorded during the active follow -up with clinic visits period.  
Contrast agents will only be captured as concomitant medication if there is an AE or SAE related to administration of contrast media.
dd. Subjects who receive further anticancer therapy during the active follow -up period will have an end of active follow -up with clinic visits and

will enter the active follow -up witho ut clinic visits (telephone follow -up).
ee. All AEs and SAEs will be assessed and recorded from the time the ICF is signed until 30 days after the last dose of study med ication.  All 
AEs should be assessed and documented prior to each dose of radium -223 di chloride.
ff. Any AEs and SAEs occurring beyond 30 days after the last treatment must be documented and reported if considered to be relate d to study 
medication or if related to a nSSE.  However, all occurrences of leukemia, m yelodysplastic syndrome, aplas tic anemia, and primary bone 
cancer or any other new primary  malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time and regardless of the investigator’s causalit y 
assessment.
gg. Any SAEs must be documented and reported if considered to be related to study medication.  However, all occurrences of leukemia, 
myelody splastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary  malignanc y must be reported as SA Es at 
any time and regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.

a.Once a subject switches from active follow-up with clinical visits to active follow -up without clinical visits, the subject will not be allowed to switch back.  A subject 
with a possible SSE may, and is encouraged to, return to the clinic at any time to assess for the presence of an SSE.
b.Once a separate, extended safety follow -up protocol, for the inclusion of subjects who r eceived radium -223 dichloride in the course of Bayer sponsored clinical 
studies, has been implemented, the study subjects surviving after the end of the 2 years of active follow -up will be transitioned to this separate, extended 
safety follow -up protocol and the current study will be terminated at the time the last study subject is transitioned.
c. The maximum period for rescreening screen failed subjects is 35 days (14 days screening + 7 -day window + 14 days for rescreening) from signing the ICF to 
randomi zation.  Rescreening of a subject requires prior approval of the Bayer -designated medical representative (see Section 5.1).  Eligibility should be 
confirmed within 14 ± 7 days of randomization.
d.The subject should return to the clinic in advance of the scheduled dose visit such that results of the laboratory assessment are available within 72 hours prior 
to dosing (each dose period is 28 ± 7 days after the prior dose of radium-223 dichloride).
e.Subjects who can no longer travel to the clinical site or w ho receive further anticancer therapy will only be followed up by telephone (active follow -up without 
clinic visits).  Symptomatic skeletal events will not be collected over the phone.
f.The study record or subject’s clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained prior to any other study procedures being performed.  
Eligibility should be confirmed during the screening period and reconfirmed prior to dosing at Dose 1, Day 1.
g.Reconfirmation of eligibility and registration in the IVRS / IWRS: hematology results obtained within 72 hours of Dose 1, Day 1 should be reviewed and it should 
be confirmed that the values are still within the treatment ranges (absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelet count ≥100x109/L, and hemoglobin
≥9.0g/dL).

h.Body weight should be obtained without shoes, using a calibrated electronic physician (column) scale with digital display, me asurement units 0.1 kg.  The same 
scale should be used for a given subject throughout the study.  At all sites (in US and outside US), weight is to be taken only once for each dose.  For non -
US sites and US sites not using the central PRD depot, the weight should be performed within 72 hours prior to dosing.  For U S sites using the central PRD 
depot ONLY, subject weig ht for the dose day should be obtained at the site within 3 to 5 days prior to the dose visit.  This weight must be reported to the 
country PRD depot to allow adequate time for PRD preparation and delivery (approximately 2 days).  All efforts should be mad e to measure weight at the 
same visit with the pre -dose laboratory assessments in order to avoid 2 pre-dose clinic visits.  Please note this is applicable to all dosing visits.
i.When a subject is determined to be eligible, the subject will be trained on daily PRO pain data collection using a handheld device.  The subject will then 
complete the pain assessment daily for 4 days prior to randomization and then for the 7 days prior to Dose 1, Day 1. 
j.Pain will be assessed during the screening period daily for 4 days prior to randomization and for the 7 days prior to Dose 1, Day 1, then daily for 7 days prior to 
each scheduled treatment visit through the end of Week 48.  Subjects will complete the daily pain assessment using a handheld device.  The daily PRO pain 
input results should be reviewed at the visit to check for completeness.
k.For Treatment Arms A and B only, pain data will be collected daily using the handheld device for 7 days prior to W eeks 36 and 48 visits, and daily for 7 days 
prior to each te lephone contact at W eeks 28, 32, 40 and 44.  For Treatment Arms A and B only the BPI-SF and the NCCN FACT -P Symptom Index -17 
(NCCN-FACT FPSI -17) questionnaires will be completed on the day of the Week 36 and 48 visits and on the day of each telephone conta ct at Weeks 28, 32, 
40 and 44.  Twenty -four (24) hour analgesic use will be collected by the study investigator at W eek 36 and 48 Visits and at each telephone conta ct (in Arms 
A and B) at W eeks 28 (±7 days ), 32 (±7 days), 40 (±7days), and 44 (±7 days). 
l.The randomization will be permuted -block, stratified by the use of prior chemotherapy ( ≤ 1 regimen versus > 1 regimen), by total alkaline phosphatase 
(<220U/L versus ≥220U/L), and by average W PS of the BPI -SF ( WPS ≤4 versus WPS >4).   This assessment will occur when the second call is made to 
the IVRS / I WRS to order drug: ≥ 10 to 14 days prior to study treatment administration. 
m. The BPI -SF questionnaire will be completed at each clinic visit from Dose 1, Day 1 until the W eek 48 visit and for Treatm ent Arms A and B only, on the day of 
each telephone contact at W eeks 28, 32, 40 and 44.   For further details, see Section 14.7. 
n. Prior to randomization, the subject will use the hand-held device to complete selected questions from the BPI-SF questionnai re, Question 3, worst pain in the 
last 24 hours will be completed for at least 4 days during a period of no more than 1 week prior to randomization.  The avera ge of the 4 days will be used as 
the randomization stratification value. 
o.Twenty -four (24) -hour analgesic use will be collected and it will be assessed by the study investigator until the W eek 48 visit.  Twenty -four (24) -hour analgesic 
use will also be collected by the study investigator at each telephone contact (in Arms A and B) or visit at Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44.

p.Systolic / diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and heart rate will be measured after the subject ha s rested for at least 5 minutes.
q.After a complete physical examination at screening, subsequent physical examinations may be 'brief,' but should include any systems with symptoms.  All 
physical examinations will be performed by a physician according to the standard of care.
r.Complete blood count, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell co unt, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, platelet count, and differential blood count reported as absolute count or percentage for neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, monocytes, eos inophils, and basophils will be collected.  Chemistry panel including serum creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium,
phosphorous, magnesium, total bilirubin, total alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydro genase (screening only), 
and albumin (screening only).
s. Laboratory assessments should be performed within 72 hours of the visit and the results assessed and documented prior to dosing.
t. The PSA result for each dosing visit may be assessed post -dose.
u.Radiological / progression (according to PC WG2 criteria) will be assessed by means of whole body technetium-99 bone scan, chest X-ray (in the presence of 
suspicious lesion[s], a chest CT scan will be performed to confirm and characterize the lesion[s]), a nd MRI /CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  Baseline 
tumor assessment should be performed within 14 (± 7) days of randomization.  If standard of care bone scan and / or MRI / CT scan of the abdomen and 
pelvis and chest X -ray within 8 weeks of randomizatio n are available, they do not need to be repeated at baseline.  If they are not available, they should be 
performed within 14 days ± 7 days of randomization (i.e., during the screening period).  Subsequent tumor assessment should b e performed at Week 8, 
Week 16, Week 24 and every 12 weeks thereafter for up to 2 years after the subject’s last dose of radium -223 dichloride or until radiological progression 
(according to PC WG2 criteria or RECIST guidelines), or death, whichever comes first.  If progression is d etected by bone scan, a confirmatory bone scan is 
required at least 6 weeks later.   All images should be obtained with the same technique (e.g., CT or MRI) as those obtained at screening.  Schedule 
deviations of ± 2 weeks for imaging / tumor evaluations ar e allowed.
v.Imaging is not required at the EOT visit if the subject discontinued due to radiological progression or the last tumor evalua tion is not older than 4 weeks.
w. Bone imaging should be within 8 weeks of randomization.  If no prior documentation is available, a whole body technetium-99 bone scan will be obtained at 
screening (within 14 ± 7 days of randomization).
x.The IVRS / IW RS will be used to register requests for eligibility / study drug doses.  Once the subject eligibility is approv ed and registered in the IVRS / IW RS, 
including entry of required demographic and stratification information, the initial drug shipment may be prepared.  Additiona l IVRS / IW RS transactions for 
dose orders may be required; follow the country-specific guidance in the IVRS / IW RS manual.  The latest order date for the next dose is no later than the 
pre-defined lead time (number of days from order received to delivery to site in the country) prior to the planned dosing date.  The planned date for the next 
dose must b e specified, when the dose is requested in the IVRS / IW RS.  At Doses 1 through 5, the site should order the next dose in the IVRS / IW RS, as 
soon as the current visit’s dose is registered in the IVRS / IW RS.  The latest order date for the next dose is no later than the pre -defined lead time (number of 
days from order received to delivery to site in the country) prior to the planned dosing date.  For subject visit registratio ns in the IVRS / IW RS, see the IVRS / 
IWRS manual.
y.The subject should be encouraged to arrive at the clinic well-hydrated on each dosing day and to drink ad libitum after each dose of radium-223 dichloride.  The 
subject should avoid drinking or eating within 1 hour before and after administration of the study drug.
z. The subject con tact card is to be provided at each dosing visit for the subject to carry with him until the next visit.
aa. Subject and family instructions should be reviewed with the subject during screening through Dose 1, Day 1.
bb. Subjects identified with possible SSEs will be asked to come to the clinic for an SSE evaluation.  An SSE risk questionnaire will be developed.  Symptomatic 
skeletal events will not be identified over the telephone.
cc. If a subject has an SSE in the active follow -up period, he will continu e active follow -up for 2 years following last study treatment .  At Weeks 28, 32, 40, and 44, 
subjects in Treatment Arms A and B will receive telephone contacts assessing for possible SSE risks.  Subjects exhibiting sym ptoms indicative of possible 
SSEs will be encouraged to visit the clinic early to assess SSE
status.  Symptomatic skeletal events will not be determined over the phone. 
dd.Except for complete analgesic use information recorded through W eek 48, limited concomitant medication, including narcotic pain medication, will be recorded

during the active follow -up with clinic visits period.  Contrast agents will only be captured as concomitant medication if there is an AE or SAE relat ed to 
administration of cont rast media. 
ee. Subjects who receive further anticancer therapy during the active follow -up period will have an end of active follow -up with clinic visits and will enter the active 
follow -up without clinic visits (telephone follow -up).  Subjects who recei ve further anticancer therapy after 2 years from last study treatment will enter long -
term follow -up. 
ff. All AEs and SAEs will be assessed and recorded from the time the ICF is signed until 30 days after the last dose of study med ication.  All AEs should be 
assessed and documented prior to each dose of radium -223 dichloride.
gg. Any AEs and SAEs occurring beyond 30 days after the last treatment must be documented and reported if considered to be relate d to study medication or if 
related to an SSE.  Howeve r, all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary 
malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time and regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment.
hh. Any SAEs must be documented and reported if considered to be related to study medication.  However, all occurrences of leukemia, myelodysplastic 
syndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary bone cancer or any other new primary malignancy must be reported as SAEs at any time a nd rega rdless of the 
investigator’s causality assessment.

12. Reference list
Rationale:   The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity  in Xofigo®is based on the primary  
standardization perf ormed by  the US NI ST.  The NI ST Standard Reference Material is used 
to calibrate the instruments in production and quality  control of both the drug substance and 
drug product.  Additionally , the calibrated in struments in production at the IFE, Norway are 
used to prepare the NI ST traceable radium -
223 reference material, which are then sent to the 
treatment sites (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory  physicians or technicians) for dial-setting of 
their dose c alibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  A reassessment of the primary  
standardization was initiated by  the NIST.  A discrepancy  of approximately  10% between the 
published NI ST primary  standardization ( NIST 2010 [31]) and current measurements was 
confirmed and a revised NI ST primary  reference standard has been issued (NIST update
[32]).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an adaption of the numerical 
description of patient dose and the description of radioactive concentration of the drug 
product solution becomes necessary .  This concerns Xofigo®for commercial use and product 
used in clinical trials.  
After the implementation of the new standard (NIST update [32]) the numerical description 
of the patient dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55
kBq/kg, and the numerical 
description of the radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL  to 1,100 
kBq/mL .  A respective variation application and substantial amendment to our clinical trial 
agreement s have been initiated.   The current standard (NI ST 2010 [31]), dial setting and 
dose will remain in effect until a unique implementation date in Q2 2016 as agreed with FDA 
and European Medicines Agency .  All clinical sites using radium- 223 dichloride will be 
notified in writing about the exact date of implemen tation prior to the effective date.
Justification for changing the dose to 55 kBq/kg body weight:
A systematic approximately  10% error in the radium -223 NI ST standardization (NI ST 2010
[31]) means that the current patient dose and the dose documented as safe and efficacious 
throughout development is  55 kBq/kg bod y weight and not 50 kBq/kg body  weight as 
declared during clinica l trials and in the marketing authorization application / new drug 
application.  However, as this is a sy stematic error, the actual dose has been the same all the 
time.  I n order to keep the actual dose for patients identical to what has been documented an d 
administered so far, also when implementing the new official standard, the nominal value of 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 88 -8223 / 16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 208of 291
the patient dose will be changed to 55kBq/kg body weight (NIST update [32]). This change 
keeps the same accuracy  in the nominal value of the dose.  Thus, there will be no actual 
change in the patient dose (amount of radioactivity), it will be onl y a change in the dose 
nominal value when corrected according to the new official radium -223 NIST standard.  All 
sites will continue to use the current dial setting (NI ST 2010 [31]) for the activity  
measurements u ntil the implementation date in Q2 2016.
Justification for changing the description of the radioactivity in the vial to 
1,100 kBq/mL:
A systematic approximately  10% error in the radium -223 NI ST standard (NI ST 2010 [31
]) 
means that the Xofigo®solution for injection with a radioactivity  concentration claim of 
1,000 kBq/mL , which has been tested in pivotal clinical trials and is currently  marketed, 
actually has a concentration of 1,100 kBq/mL. If the drug product concentration is adjuste d to 
1,100 kBq/mL , the total activity  in the vial (6 mL) must be changed from 6,000 kBq/vial to 
6,600 kBq/vial (changed from 6.0 MBq/vial to 6.6 MBq/vial in many  countries). Xofigo®
solution for injection produced according to the new NIST standardization (NI ST update
[32
]), is the same product as before.   NOTE:   All product received by  sites will be labelled 
with the current standard activity  of 1000 kBq/mL until the implementation date in Q2 2016.  
Now that the new radium -223 standard has been published, Bay er has applied for labeling 
and packaging changes, in a ccordance with the new standards, with each Health Authority  for 
which Bay er holds a marketing application for radium -223 dichloride.  Once all approvals 
have been received, the updated standard will be applied to all active protocols that include 
radium -
223 dichloride, including this one, and the verification of the patient dose in treatment 
sites  has to be performed using up -dated dial -settings of dose calibrators.  
The change in the NIST radium
-223 standard has no impact on subjects; subjects are 
recei ving, and will continue to receive, the same actual dose that was studied in AL SYMPCA 
and is associated with the proven safety  and efficacy  of radium -223 dichloride, though the 
stated nominal radiation dose received is being updated to reflect the new stan dard.  Subjects 
who are on -treatment at the time the new NIST calibration standard goes into effect will be 
notified of this change and will be required to sign a Patient I nformation Sheet to 
acknowledge that they  have received information on the updated N IST standard calibration.  
All subjects randomized after the new calibration standard in effect will sign a revised 
Informed Consent Form that contains the updated NI ST standard calibration.
Note: throughout this document the dose of radium -223 dichloride is given as 50 kBq/kg, 
which is based on the original NIST standardization (NI ST 2010 [31]); however, when NIST 
issues the updated radium-223 dichlor ide standardization, the dose administered will actuall y 
be 55 kBq/kg (based on a change to the reference standard (NI ST update [32]) only ), though 
the volume of radium- 223 dichloride given to each subject will remain the same.

This equation of 4 variables (serum creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicit y) is 
recommended b y the National Kidney  Foundation for use in individuals 18 y ears 
or older.  The formula is as follows:
GFR (mL / min / 1.73 m2) = k x 186 x [serum creatinine]- 1.154 x [age] -0.203
Where k = 1 (men) or 0.742 (women), GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate, 
and serum creatinine is measured in mg/dL.
Subjects with a screening GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated b y this method 
will not be al lowed to participate in the study .
New text:
Baseline kidney  function will be assessed using the glomerular filtration rate as 
calculated using either the Chronic Kidney  Disease Epidemiology  Collaboration 
(CKD -EPI) creatinine equation, or, when this method is not available, the 
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. 
The MDRD calculation is an established method of estimating GFR based on 4 
variables: serum creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicity .  This method has 
historically  been the Nat ional Kidney  Foundation’s recommended method of 
estimating the GFR in individuals 18 y ears or older.  
The MDRD Study  Equation:
GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = k x 186 x [serum creatinine]- 1.154 x [age] -0.203
Where k = 1 (men) or 0.742 (women), serum creatinine is m easured in mg/dL . 
In an effort to improve upon the MDRD equation, the Chronic Kidney  Disease 
Epidemiology  Collaboration developed an updated calculation, the CKD- EPI 
creatinine equation, using the same variables as the MDRD equation. This new 
calculation has been validated and is considered to be more accurate than the 
MDRD equation.  The National Kidney  Foundation now recommends using the 
CKD -EPI Creatinine Equation for estimating GFR.
The CKD -EPI calculation is based on a serum creatinine value that was obtained 
through use of isotope dilution mass spectrometry  (IDMS), a standardized serum 
creatinine assay . Therefore, the CKD -EPI equation is only  valid if the laboratory  
used a calibration method for serum creatinine that is traceable to IDMS.  The 
IDMS has been adopted by  laboratories globall y and is widely available.  If it is 
not clear whether your laboratory  uses this serum creatinine reference method, 
please contact the laboratory  for confirmation.

CKD -EPI Equation
• Conventional Units (creatinine as mg/dL; age in years):
GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine) -1.154 x (Age)- 0.203 x (0.742 
if female) x (1.212 if African American)
• International S ystem of Units (SI)Units (creatinine as µmol/L ; age in years):
GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x (seru m creatinine/88.4) -1.154 x (Age)- 0.203 x 
(0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African American)
The standard MDRD calculation should be used for an y serum creatinine values 
that are not based on the IDMS assay .

28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 223of 291
Subjects who discontinue study  treatment and who did not have an SSE will enter 
an active follow -up period with clinic visits. These subjects will be evaluated
every  12 weeks (± 7 day s) for pain endpoints, radiological progression, SSEs, 
survival, treatment-related AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), and the 
initiation of other anti -cancer therapies. In addition, subjects who receive 
cytotoxic chemotherapy  will be followed up for the development of febrile 
neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy treatment and for up to 6 
months at a frequency  based on local clinical practice. During this period, all 
occurrences of leukemia, my elodysplastic s yndrome, aplastic anemia, and primary  
bone cancer or an y other new primary malignancy must be reported as SAEs, 
regardless of the investigator’s causality  assessment.
The active follow-up period with clinic visits extends from the discontinuation of 
the treatment period until the subject experiences an SSE, can no longer travel to 
the clinic, receives further treatment with cy totoxic chemotherap y for prostate 
cancer, ot her s ystemic radioisotopes, hemibody  EBRT, or other investigational 
drugs, dies, is lost to follow -up, or withdraws informed consent and actively  
objects to collection of further data. 
Active follow-up period without clinic visits:
Subjects from the treat ment period or the active follow -up period with clinic visits 
who can no longer travel to the clinical site will be followed for survival, 
treatment -related AEs and SAEs, SSEs, pain endpoints, and the initiation of other 
anti-cancer therapies with a phone call every  12 weeks (± 7 day s). In addition, 
subjects who receive cy totoxic chemotherapy  will be followed up for the 
development of febrile neutropenia and hemorrhage during their chemotherapy

7.3.5.5.1 Increase in analgesic use rate
Increase in analgesic use rate is defined for each applicable baseline as the number 
of subjects with an increase in analgesic use from that baseline, divided by  the 
number of subjects evaluable for analgesic use at that baseline .
7.3.5 .5.2 Time to Increase in analgesic use
Time to increase in analgesic use is defined for each applicable baseline for 
applicable subjects as the time (in day s) from the respective baseline until 
occurrence of the first post-baseline increase in analgesic use pain progression 
event.  Subjects without increase in analgesic use asof the last applicable 
post-baseline assessment, whether or not surviving, will be censored at the last 
applicable post -baseline assessment.  Subjects with insufficient applicable 
baseline assessment(s) or without adequate post -baseline assessment(s) will be 
censored at the applicable baseline date.  Additional censoring and other details 
will be described in the SAP.
7.3.5.5.3 Pain improvement rate without increase in analgesic use 
Pain improvement without increase in analgesic use is defined for each ba seline in 
subjects evaluable for both pain improvement and increase in analgesic use at that 
baseline, as defined in Section 7.3.4.4.1 and Section 7.3.5.5.1  respectivel y, at the 
applicable baseline assessment.  Pain improvement without increase in analges ic 
use is defined in each applicable evaluable subject at each applicable post -baseline 
assessment time point with respect to each baseline, as a 30% and 2 -point 
decrease in WPS over 2 consecutive measurements conducted at least 4 weeks 
apart, without an i ncrease in analgesic use. 
Pain improvement without increase in analgesic use rate is defined for each

analgesic use in the last 24 hours CRF data. 
For each subject, each analgesic medication from analgesic use in the last 24 
hour’s data taken at applicable clinic visits (and in Arms A and B, at telephone 
contacts) will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary  and OMEs will be 
calculated from the coded data. 
For each subject and applicable visit or telephone contact, analgesic use in the last 
24 hours will be scored using the AQA (see Section 14.9 ) based on the coded 
medications and corresponding OME quantities. 
Details on coding and scoring will described in the SAP. 
For each subject, for each applicable baseline a nd post -baseline time point, the

Section 6.4.1 Dose calibration
3rdParagraph:
Added text:
As of Amendment 2, NIST has established an updated standardization for 
radium -223 dichloride, which indicates that an approximately  10% difference 
existed between activity  values obtained using the current standard and the 
updated standardization.  The current NIST standard for radium- 223 dichloride 
(NIST 2010 [31]) will remain in effect for this protocol until al l Health 
Authorities for which Bayer holds a marketing application for radium -223 
dichloride have approved the regulatory  variations for Xofigo®, anticipated Q 2 
2016. All sites will be notified by  Bayer when regulatory  approvals are in place 
and the update d NIST standardization is to be implemented.  Upon notification, 
and prior to the implementation, all sites will need to add a new dial -setting to 
their dose calibrators for the new NIST standardization for radium -223 dichloride 
(NIST update [32]), which s hould be documented on the appropriate study  forms.  
This step will be performed so that all sites will have the new dial setting (NI ST 
update [32]) in place at the time of implementation.  The current dial setting 
(NIST 2010 [31]) will be used until the w orldwide global implem entation date 
anticipated for Q 2 2016.
The change in the NIST radium-223 standard has no impact on subjects; subjects 
are receiving, and will continue to receive, the same actual dose and volume that 
was studied in AL SYMPCA and is ass ociated with the proven safet y and efficacy 
of radium -223 dichloride, though the stated nominal radiation dose received is 
being updated to reflect the new standard.  Subjects who are on -treatment at the 
time the new NIST reference standard goes into effec t will be notified of this 
change and will be required to sign a Patient Information Sheet to acknowledge 
that they  have received information on the updated NI ST standard calibration.  All 
patients randomized after the new reference standard is in effect w ill sign a 
revised Informed Consent Form that contains the updated NIST standardization.
The formula for the calculation of the volume to be administered has to be 
changed respectively .  See Section 6.4.3.

13.3 Amendmen t 3 
Description of the amendment
Amendment 3 is an amendment to the integrated protocol version 3.0 dated 13 AUG 2015.  
Changes to the protocol include:
Updated the protocol to reflect the recent Bay er AG legal entity  name change .
Updated procedures for l ong-term follow -up.
Added an option for the study  site to obtain information directly from the subject’s 
primary  health care professional or caregiver .
Updated the stud y Global Clinical L eader and study  medical expert name s
.
Updated analy sis for Comparison 2 from 24 weeks to the 6th dose.
Revised the definition for consistency  across the radium -223 program.
Deleted text for central reviewer as responsible party to determine baseline values and 
assess radiological progression.
13.3.1 Overview of changes
Change 1:
Updated the protocol to reflect the recent Bay er AG legal entity  name change
Sections affected:
Headers
Title Page:  Sponsor
Rationale:   Bayer HealthCare AG merged with Bay er AG, an affiliated company  within the 
Bayer Group, effective as of 1st July  2016. Thereby , Bay er Healthcare AG ceased to exist 
and Bay er AG became its legal successor and automatically  took over all of the Bay er 
HealthCare AG’s rights, obligations, and liabilities by  law. As a result of the above 
mentioned merger, Bay er AG assumes the r ole of the sponsor for these trials. Bay er 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 88 -8223 / 16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 253of 291
HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. is and has at an y time been the sponsor for the US territory 
for this trial as set forth in FDA IND form 1571.
Change 2:
Updated procedures for long- term follow -up
Sections affected :
Synopsis- Methodology
4.1 Design overview
5.1 Withdrawal
6.8 Post -study  therapy
7.1.1 Tabulated overview
7.1.2.8.1 End of active follow- up with clinic visits
7.1.2.8.2 End of active follow- up without scheduled clinic visits
7.1.2.9 L ong-term follow -up to 7 years following last dose
7.1.2.9.1 L ong-term follow -up (via telephone follow -up)
10 Premature termination of the study
Rationale :  Updated long -term assessments specified in this protocol, to be consistent with 
current version of the long- term follow -upStudy  16996 protocol.
Change 3: 
Added an option for the study  site to obtain information directly  from the subject’s primary  
health care professional
Section affected:
Synopsis- Methodology
4.1 Design overview
6.8 Post -study  therapy
7.1.1 Tabulated overview
7.1.2.7.1 Active follow -up with clinic visits
7.1.2.7.2 Active follow -up without scheduled clinic visits
7.1.2.8.1 End of active follow- up with clinic visits
7.1.2.8.2 End of active follow- up without scheduled clinic visits
7.1.2.9 L ong-term follow -up to 7 y ears following last dose
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 88 -8223 / 16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 254of 291
7.1.2.9.1 L ong-term follow -up (via telephone follow -up)
10 Premature termination of the study
Rationale:   Provides the option for sites to collect study  data directl y from subject’s health 
care professionals or caregiver in ca se the subject or his/her care provider is unable to provide 
information or to obtain cleaner data.
Change 4:
Updated the stud y Global Clinical L eader and study  medical expert names
Sections affected:
Title page
Signature of the sponsor’s medically  responsible person
3. Investigators and other study  personnel
Rationale : Change reflects the current medical expert and protocol signatory .
Change 
5:
Updated analy sis for Comparison 2 from 24 weeks to 6th dose date
Sections affected included:
Synopsis- Study  objectives
Synopsis- Plan for statistical anal ysis
2.0 Study  objectives
4.4 End of study
7.3.2 Definition of efficacy  variables
7.3.5.6 Additional pain and health related quality  of life endpoints
8.2 Analy sis sets
8.4.1 Primary  efficacy  anal ysis
8.4.2.2 Analy ses of standar d dosing and extended dosing from the 6th dose date
8.6 Determination of sample size
Rationale : The ‘Week 24 baseline value’ is defined as the last non -missing value on or 
before the date of the 6thinjection. I deall y, this visit would be the date of the 7thinjection for 
Arm C subjects and expected 7thinjection date for Arm A subjects. However, the end of 
treatment visit (30±7 days from last dose) for Arm A subjects could be missing due to 
consent withdrawal or happen out of visit window. Hence, there is no comparable visit for 
Arm A subjects that could be used as the expected 7thinjection date. To account for this and 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 88 -8223 / 16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 255of 291
achieve comparability  between the two arms, the 6thinjection date is used as t he reference 
date for Comparison 2 subjects.
Change 6:
Updated text for consistency
Sections affected included:
7.3.5.2 Time to increase in phy sical s ymptoms of disease based on FPSI -DRS -
P
7.3.5.3.1 Total alkaline phosphatase response rate
7.3.5.3.2 Time to total alkaline phosphatase progression
7.3.5.4.1 Prostate specific antigen response rate
7.3.5.4.2 Time to prostate specific antigen progression
Rationale :  Revised the definition for consistency  across the radium -223 program.
Change 7:
Deleted text for central reviewer as responsible party  to determine baseline values and assess 
radiological progression.
Sections affected included:
7.3.4.3 Radiological progression endpoints
Rationale :  Re-baselining after 6 injections was considered at stud y start; hence the sentence 
regarding the central reviewer’s responsibility  to determine the applicable baseline was 
included in the protocol. As re- baselining was never implemented in the study  and was never 
included in the Central Review Charter, the sentence was removed from the protocol.

Description of the amendment
Amendment 4 is an amendment to t he integrated protocol version 4.0 dated 16 MAY 2017 .  
Changes to the protocol include:
Addition that radium- 223 dichloride should not be given with abiraterone plus 
prednisone/prednisolone.
New request that bone fractures and bone associated events ( e.g., osteoporosis) need 
to be reported as (S)AEs, including during long

14.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1
Section modified by Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
Soft tissue response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using a modified version 
of the modified RECI ST guidelines version 1.1.
Modification to RECI ST:
Only lymph nodes with sh ort axis ≥ 1.5 cm can be selected as target lesions.
Disease progression at first assessment needs to be confirmed b y a second scan 6 or more 
weeks later as required per the PCWG2 guidance.( 1)  In case of unequivocal progression, 
a confirmatory  scan is not mandatory  and it will be performed at the investigator’s 
discretion.
Bone lesions will not be recorded as non -target lesions or assessed per modifie d 
RECI ST.  
Radiological progression of bone lesions will be determined according to PCWG2 criteria 
based on whole bod y technetium -99 bone scans.
Measurable Disease: Note: Subjects are excluded if they  have visceral metastases as 
assessed b yabdominal and p elvic MRI  / CT scan or chest X -ray.
Malignant l ymph nodes: To be considered pathologically  enlarged and mea surable, a l ymph 
node must be ≥ 1.5 cm in short axis when assessed by  CT s
can.  At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured an d followed.
Malignant l ymph nodes situated in a previousl y irradiated area are not considered measurable 
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.
Non-Measurable Disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(pathological ly mph no des with short axis ≥ 1 cm to < 1.5cm) are considered 
non-measurable disease.  L eptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusions, and 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung are all non- measurable.
Target Lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions in total, representative 
of all involved regions should be identified as target lesions and be recorded and measured at 
baseline.  These 5 lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions w ith the 
longest short axis), and should be suitable for reproducible repeated measurements.  A sum of 
nodal short axes of target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize an y 
objective tumor regression of the measurable dimension of the disease.  If there are 
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 88 -8223 / 16507
28 MAR 2018 Version 5.0 Page: 280of 291
> 5measurable lesions, those not selected as target lesions will be considered together with 
non-measurable disease as non -target lesions.
Non-target Lesions: All non
-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any  measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 listed as target lesions.  Measurements are not required but these 
lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as “present,” “ab sent,” or in rare 
cases “unequivocal progression.”
Best Response
All subjects will have their best response on stud y classified as outlined below:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all clinical and radiological evidence of tumor 
(both target and non-target).  Any  pathological l ymph nodes (whether target or non -target) 
must have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions 
taking as reference the baseline sum, no uneq uivocal progression of existing non -target 
lesions and no appearance of new lesions.
Stable Disease: Stead y state of disease.  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify  for PD; no unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions and no appearance of new lesions.
Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study ).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions will also constitute PD.

Methods of Measurement
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.
Chest X -ray -In the presence of suspicious lesion(s), a chest CT scan will be p erformed to 
confirm and characterize the lesion(s).  However, a chest CT scan is preferable.
CT / MRI  -CT scan is the best currently  available and reproducible method to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment.  When CT scans are used, spiral CT scans should be

used in this study .  The minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness.  An MRI  is also acceptable.  This applies to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Ultrasound - Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as 
method of measurement.  If new lesions are identified by  ultrasound in the course of the 
study , confirmation by  CT or MRI  is advised.
Endoscopy  / Laparoscopy  -The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor e valuation 
is not advised.
Cytology  / Histology  -These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases.

14.6 Calculation for glomerular filtration rate
Section modified as of Amendment 2 (Section 13.2).
Baseline kidney  function will be assessed using the GFR as calculated using either the 
Chronic Kidney  Disease Epidemiology  Collaboration creatinine equation, or, when this 
method is not available, the Mo dification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation.
The MDRD calculation is an established method of estimating GFR based on 4 variables: 
serum creatinine level, age, sex, and ethnicity .  This method has historically  been the 
National Kidney  Foundation’s recommended method of estimating the GFR in individuals 18 
years or older.  
The MDRD Study Equation:
GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = k x 186 x [serum creatinine]-1.154x [age]-0.203
Where k = 1 (men) or 0.742 (women), serum creatinine is measured in mg/dL . 
In an effort to improve upon the MDRD equation, the Chronic Kidney  Disease Epidemiology  
Collaboration developed an updated calculation, the CKD -EPI creatinine equation, using the 
same variables as the MDRD equation. This new calculation has been validated and is 
considered to be more accurate than the MDRD equation.  The National Kidney  Foundation 
now recommends using the CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation for estimating GFR.
The CKD -EPI calculation is based on a serum crea tinine value that was obtained through use 
of isotope dilution mass spectrometry  (IDMS), a standardized serum creatinine assay . 
Therefore, the CKD -EPI equation is only  valid if the laboratory  used a calibration method for 
serum creatinine that is traceable to IDMS.  The IDMS has been adopted by laboratories 
globall y and is widel y available.  If it is not clear whether your laboratory uses this serum 
creatinine reference method, please contact the laboratory  for confirmation.

CKD -EPI Equation
Conventional Units (creatinine as mg/dL; age in years):
 GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine)-1.154x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if 
female) x (1.212 if African American)
SI Units (creatinine as µmol/L ; age in y ears):
 GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine /88.4)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 
if female) x (1.212 if African American)
The standard MDRD calculation should be used for an y serum creatinine values that are not 
based on the IDMS assay.

14.7 Brief Pain Inventory -Short Form
Section modified as of Amendment 1 (Section 13.1).
The severit y of pain and its impact on daily  functions will be self -assessed by  the study  
subjects using the BPI -SF (29) measure.
The BPI -SF allows subjects to rate the severit y of their pain and the degree to which their 
pain interferes with common dimensions of feeling and function (e.g., general activity , 
walking, work, mood, enjoy ment of life, relations with others, and sleep).  The BPI -SF is an 
11-item, self -administered, clinically  valid, reliable, and responsive measure developed to 
assess pain related to cancer.  The instrument is available in validated multilingual versions; 
on average, it requires less than 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.
All BPI  items are scored using rating scales.  Four items measure pain intensity  (pain now, 
average pain, worst pain, and least pain) using 0 (no pain) to 1 0 (pain as bad as y ou can 
imagine) numeric rating scales, and 7 items measure the level of interference with function 
caused b y pain (general activity , mood, walking ability , normal work, relations with other 
people, sleep, and enjo yment of life) using 0 ( no interference) to 10 (complete interference) 
rating scales.  It has a 24 -hour recall period .  Assessment of the worst pain score (WPS) via 
Question 3 and average pain score via Question 5 on the BPI -SF will occur daily  for 4 day s 
immediately  prior to ran domization and for 7 days prior to each scheduled visit from the 
Dose 1, Day  1 visit through the Week 48 visit.  The data will be collected and checked for 
completeness at each visit.  In Treatment Arms A and B only, pain will also be assessed daily  
for 7 days prior to each  telephone contact at Weeks 28, 32, 40 and 44 and the daily  PRO pain 
input data will be reviewed for completeness atthe telephone contact.

The BPI -SF will be self -administered b y the subject at Dose 1, Day 1 (before the start of 
study  treatment) through the Week 48 visit.  In Treatment Arms A and B only the BPI -SF 
questionnaire will also be completed on the day of each telephone contact at Weeks 28, 32, 
40 and 44 and checked for completion 
atthe telephone contact.
At the beginning of each scheduled visit, before meeting with the investigator, subjects will 
be asked to complete the BPI -SF, with the exception of Question 2 (locating areas of pain on 
a diagram) and Question 7 (regarding use of pain medication).  Subjects will not be asked to 
answer Question 2 because the information will not be used for the score.  Subjects will not 
be asked to answer Question 7 because pain medication used is captured elsewhere in the 
eCRF.  The items are aggregated into 2dimensions: (1) Pain Severity In dex, using the sum of 
the 4 items on pain intensity
 and (2 )Function Interference Index , using the sum of the 7 pain 
interference items.  The Function Interference Index is scored as the mean of the item scores 
multiplied by  7, given that more than 50% (or 4 of 7), of the items have been completed.
The BPI -SF should be self -administered b y the subject alone during his scheduled visit at the 
site.  The instrument should be administered at the start of the visit, before the subject sees 
the phy sician so that any interaction between the subject and ph ysician will not influence the 
subject’s responses to the questionnaire.  The questionnaire should also be administered 
before the subject is asked about AEs and concurrent illnesses, again so that any  discussions 
of health problems do not influence the subject’s responses.
A quiet place should be provided for the subject to complete the BPI -SF.  It is important that 
the subject completes the BPI -SF alone, without any  advice from family  members or friends 
who may  accompany him.
How should the Questionnaire and daily PRO pain collection be introduced?
A sample script for introducing the questionnaire and daily  PRO pain collection is given 
below.
“Your doctor would like to better understand how you feel, how well you are able to do your 
usual activities, and how y ou rate y our health.  To help us better understand these things 
about y ou, we will ask you to answer 2 
questions related to the worst pai n in the last 24 hours
and the average level of pain, for 7 days prior to each scheduled treatment visit and at the end 
of treatment visit. We will ask y ou to complete this questionnaire about y our health at each of 
these visits. Depending on which treatm ent you are assigned, you may  also be requested to 
answer these 2 questions during the first 6 months of t he follow up period, for 7 days prior to 
the visits or telephone contacts and to complete the BPI-SF questionnaire on the day  of the 
visits or on the day  of the telephone contacts.
You will be provided with written instructions on how to do this. You should read each 
question and then tick the appropriate number that matches your answer.  Remember that this 
is not a test and there are no right or wron g answers.  Choose the answer that best describes 
the way  you feel.  I will quickly  review the questionnaire when you are done to make sure 
that all the questions have been answered.  You should answer these questions by  yourself.

Your spouse or other fam ily members should not help y ou when y ou answer the 
questionnaire.  I will be nearby  in case y ou want to ask me any  questions.  Please let me 
know when you have finished the questionnaire.”
What to do if the subject asks for clarification?
Some subjects ma y ask the meaning of specific questions.  If this happens, the staff member 
can assist the subject b y re-reading the question for them verbatim.  If the subject asks what 
something means, do not try  to explain what the question means, but tactfully  suggest that the 
subject use his own interpretation of the question.  All subjects should answer the questions 
based on what they  think the questions mean, or the study  results may  be biased.
Questionnaire completion and review of worst pain score over the previo us 7 days
At the beginning of each visit or ateach telephone contact ( Treatment Arms A and B onl y), 
please check that the subject has answered the questions related to the WPS and the average 
pain score, in the 7 days prior to the visit.  Thank the subjec t once you have reviewed the 
responses.
When the subject has completed the questionnaire, check that all of the questions have been 
answered.  If the questionnaire is not complete, point out to the subject that some of the 
questions were not answered.  If the subject does not quickly  volunteer to answer these items, 
ask him whether he had any  difficulty  completing the questionnaire.  If the subject say s that 
he had trouble understanding a question, ask him why  he had difficulty  with that item.  Re -
read the question for him verbatim, but do not attempt to explain or reword the question, as 
explained before.  If the subject is still unable to answer the question, accept the 
questionnaire as is.
Some subjects may  be confused by  the response choices.  They  may  want to respond with “I 
don’t know” or some other response choice that is not available.  If this happens, try  to help 
the subject choose one of the response categories by  saying something like: “I  know that it 
may be difficult for you to choose an answer, but which of these answers do y ou think comes 
closest to the way  that y ou are thinking or feeling?”  If the subject still cannot select an 
answer, accept the questionnaire as is.
Occasionall y, subjects may not report having difficulty with a question or t he response 
choices, but still may  hesitate or refuse to answer an item or items.  If this happens, accept the 
questionnaire as is.
If a subject asks for interpretation of his responses or asks for his scores on the questionnaire, 
tell him that y ou are not trained to score or interpret the questionnaire.  Emphasize that their 
answers will be kept confidential.
Thank the subject once he has completed the questionnaires and y ou have checked them for 
completeness.

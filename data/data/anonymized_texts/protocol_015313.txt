CONFIDENTIAL  7 11/30/20 1. STUDY  SUMMARY  
Study Number  OPI-NYXP-201 
Clinical Phase  Phase 2 
Type of Study  Randomized, placebo -controlled, double -masked study of the 
safety and efficacy of Nyxol® Eye Drops  (0.75% Phentolamine 
Ophthalmic Solution  [POS] ) with Low -Dose (0.4%) Pilocarpine 
Ophthalmic Solution (LDP) in subjects  with presbyopia  
Name of Investigational 
Product  Nyxol Eye Drops – 0.75% P OS (Treatment 1)  
0.4%  LDP (Treatment 2)  
Duration of Study  Approximately 5 to 9 days, including Visit 1  (Screening/Baseline) , 
Visit 2  (Treatment) , and Visit 3 (Safety Follow -Up Call ) 
Rationale  Presbyopia is an age -related condition typically starting at around  
40 years of age . It is caused by the inability of the aging lens to 
dynamically change shape, curvature, and dioptric power in an 
effort to focus images of nearby objects onto the retina . Presbyopia 
has a significantly negative impact on quality of life, interfering 
with reading , use of computers or hand -held devices, and seeing 
the dashboard of a car. There are no current pharmacological 
therapies approved , but there is some evidence that decreasing 
pupil diameter  (PD) , especially to a size of 1.6 to 2 mm to create a 
“pinhole” effect, can improve visual acuity  (VA)  by incr easing the 
depth of focus.  
The combination of Nyxol ( 0.75% POS ) and 0.4% LDP  (Nyxol + 
LDP) could be a potential treatment option for presbyopia . 
Specifically, Nyxol would be  dosed once  daily  at or near bedtime 
and LDP dosed in the morning . Nyxol + LDP dosing can 
potentially reduce PD to ≤ 2.0 mm, which has the potential to 
improve near VA due to a “pinhole” effect.  
Phentolamine is a non -selective alpha -1 and alpha -2 adrenergic 
receptor antagonist that inhibits contraction of the  iris dilat or 
muscle , resulting in a smaller pupil size.  
Pilocarpine hydrochloride is a cholinergic , parasympathomimetic 
agent which acts through stimulation of muscarinic receptors on 
smooth muscle s such as the iris and secretory glands. Pilocarpine 
reduces pupil si ze through stimulating contraction of the iris 
sphincter muscle.  
In a Phase 2 trial , a statistically significant number of  presbyopic  
subjects treated with Nyxol demonstrated ≥ 1 line of improvement 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  8 11/30/20 in distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA ) compared to 
Placebo -treated subjects , with a trend for a 2-line improvement at 
all timepoints . In these studies, Nyxol was generally well  tolerated 
in the eye (most common complaint was mild -to-moderate ocular 
hyperemia) and there were no clinically meaningful systemic 
effects , as measured by heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP).  
Study Objectives  The objectives of this study  are: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
DCNVA  compared to Placebo alone  in subjects with 
presbyopia  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to prevent < 1 
line of loss of BCDVA  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
DCNVA compared to  Nyxol alone or  LDP  alone    
• To evaluate the ability of Nyxol + LDP to produce  the 
“pinhole” pupil size (approximately 1.6 -2 mm)  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve 
BCIVA and BCDVA  
• To evaluate the effect of iris color on  the efficacy of Nyxol 
+ LDP  
• To evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of Nyxol + LDP  
and each component individually  
The Sponsor intends to use this Phase 2 study  to evaluate Nyxol  + 
LDP for the  chronic  indication  of “temporary treatment of 
presbyopia .” 
Design  This is a p lacebo -controlled, double -masked , multiple -dose, Phase 
2 study in approximately 152 randomized subjects with presbyopia 
(approx imately  140 evaluable for efficacy ), evaluat ed for  safety 
and efficacy following  administration of masked Nyxol  or Placebo  
(Treatment 1)  at or near bedtime for 3 to 4 days,  with 
administration of LDP  or No Treatment (Treatment 2) at the next 
visit (Visit  2) in the morning . Measurements  will be made at 
multiple visits and timepoints , and analysis will consist of 
comparison across 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone ) 
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 into the above groups.  
Randomization  will be str atified 1:1 by iris color .

CONFIDENTIAL  9 11/30/20 After randomization, masked  Treatment 1 study medications 
(Nyxol or Placebo ) will be dispensed.  Treatment 1 study 
medication will be taken by the subject at or near bedtime 
(approximately 8PM -10PM) . The treatment will start the night of 
Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) or at the appropriate evening  in order 
for Treatment 1 to be taken daily for 3  to 4 consecutive days 
immediately prior to Visit 2 .

CONFIDENTIAL  12 11/30/20 The start of Screening includes  an explanation of the study, a 
medical and ophthalmic history, and demographics .  
 
 
 This shall be followed by a urine pregnancy test for 
females of childbearing potential  (Exclusion Criterion # 20), and 
HR/BP (Exclusion Criteria # 21-22).  
The subject will then  undergo several VA measurements, 
including photopic BCDVA as well as  
DCNVA  (  In addition , subjects will 
undergo measurement of photopic best -corrected interme diate 
visual acuity (BCIVA)  and mesopic BCDVA . 
The screening assessment will also include an ophthalmic 
examination that includes assessment of PD, biomicroscopy, dry 
eye examination with tear break -up time testing and corneal 
fluorescein staining  ( ), intraocular pressure 
(IOP) measurement (using a Tono -Pen), and direct or indirect 
ophthalmoscopy without dilation .  
In addition, c onjunctival hyperemia  will be assessed visually with 
a 4-point grading scale using images from the CCLRU   
).  
If all eligibility criteria  are met , the subject will be randomized 
into the study.  
After randomization , masked Treatment 1  study medications 
(Nyxol or Placebo ) will be dispensed .  
All treatments and assessments will be administered OU.

Number of 
Investigational Sites  Approximately  20 sites 
Estimated Total 
Sample Size  Approximately 152 randomized subjects, with approximately 140 
subjects  evaluable for efficacy  
Sample Size 
Justification  A sample size of approximately  140 subjects (40 for Nyxol + LDP 
and Placebo alone  arms and 30 for each of the other 2 arms) who 
are evaluable for efficacy  is needed for the study. The primary 
treatment comparison will be Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo 
alone . Using α = 0.05 significance and a two -tailed test, 76 total 
subjects ( 38 subjects each in the Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  
arms)  
 
 
 
  
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 to Nyxol + LDP , Nyxol + No 
Treatment 2 (Nyxol alone) , Placebo  + LDP , and Placebo + No 
Treatment 2 (Placebo alone) , respectively . 
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  7% drop -out 
between Visit 1 and end of Visit 2. To account for this drop -out, a 
total of approximately 152 subjects will be randomized into the 
study.

All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall and by 
at all timepoints. Subjects will also be analyzed by 
study eye, fellow  eye, and binocular . 
All of the efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed by Modified 
Intention -to-Treat (mITT) and Per Protocol (PP)  population s. 
Safety Endpoints  The primary safety measures are conjunctival hyperemia, 
subjective ocular tolerability  (Visit 2), and A Es.  
Analysis for conjunctival hyperemia includes  change from 
Baseline  (Visit  1) in the conjunctival hyperemia grading scale 
(CCLRU images)  at each visit, for study eye and fellow  eye. Any 
increase of 2 units in conjunctival hyperemia between consecutive 
visits  is considered an AE.  
Other safety measures include IOP , biomicroscopy, 
ophthalmoscopy,  and systemic safety as measured by HR and BP. 
Urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential will be 
conducted.  
Measurements:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  will b e assessed visually with  a 
grading scale (0 -3) using images from the CCLRU  
• Subjective ocular tolerability will be measured on a 4 -
point scale (0 -3) 
• IOP will be  measured with the Tono -Pen

CONFIDENTIAL  20 11/30/20 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Investigational  Products  
The combination of Nyxol (0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution [ POS]) and Low-Dose 
(0.4%) Pilocarpine Ophthalmic Solution  (LDP ) is to be studied for the indication of “ temporary 
treatment of presbyopi a.” Specifically, Nyxol would be dosed once daily at or near bedtime and 
LDP dosed in the morning . Nyxol + LDP dosing can potentially reduce pupil diameter (PD)  size 
to ≤ 2.0 mm, which has the potential to improve near visual acuity (VA) due to a “pinhole” 
effect. In this trial, Nyxol  and Placebo  are referred to as Treatment 1, and LDP  and No Treatment  
are referred to as Treatment 2.  
Treatment 1  (Masked)  
The test product is Nyxol® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution (Nyxol), a 
non-selective alph a-1 and alpha -2 adrenergic receptor antagonist  that inhibits contraction of the 
iris dilator muscle, resulting in a smaller pupil size . Note that the concentration of 0.75% refers 
to phentolamine free base and is the same —and used in place of —1% phentolamine mesylate 
drug substance, which was how Nyxol had been described in  all prior studies.  
Placebo control is Nyxol vehicle alone.  
One drop of Nyxol  or Placebo  will be administered  in each eye daily  at or near bedtime  
(approximately  8PM -10PM)  starting  the night  of Visit  1 (Screening/Baseline)  or at the appropriate  
evening  in order  for Treatment  1 to be taken  daily  for 3 to 4 consecutive  days immediately  prior  to 
Visit  2.  
Subjects  will be given  enough  Nyxol  or Placebo  for 4 doses . 
Treatment 2  (Unmasked)  
Low-Dose (0.4%) Pilocarpine Ophthalmic Solution (LDP)  is a direct -acting cholinergic , 
parasympathomimetic agent which acts through direct stimulation of muscarinic receptors and 
smooth muscle such as the iris and secretory glands.  Pilocarpine reduces pupil size through 
stimulating contraction of the iris sphincter muscle.  
For those who receive LDP, one drop of LDP will be administered in each eye by Site Staff  at 
Time 0 minutes  during Visit 2. 
For those who receive No Treatment, no drop of LDP  will be administered  by Site Staff  at Time 
0 minutes  during  Visit  2. 
2.2. Findings  From  Nonclinical  and Clinical  Studies  
Nyxol  
Detailed findings from nonclinical and clinical studies and potential risk are prov ided in the 
Investigators’ Brochure (IB ) (2020).  
Nyxol has been assessed in 7 Investigator -initiated and sponsored Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical 
trials. Across all trials, 168 of 232 adult subjects were exposed to at least one dose of 
Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution . The data presented below are from Nyxol alone.  
In prior clinical trials, Nyxol  has demonstrate d a consistent ability to decrease PD by 
approximately 20% (~1 -1.5 mm) in both mesopic and photopic conditions . Nyxol has been 
found to be efficacious for more than 24 hours with an onset of action of approximately 30 to 60 
minutes. Key PD data are summari zed below ( Table  1).

Nyxol was observed to be well  tolerated at single doses up to and including 1.0% daily in each 
eye. This includes 59 subjects who received multiple doses of up to 1% Nyxol for at least 
14 days. Safety of the subjects in these trials was evaluated by adverse event ( AE) monitoring, 
physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, no healthy volunteers or 
subjects reported a treatment -emergent serious adverse event ( SAE ). No deaths occurred in any 
of the trials. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital 
signs, including blood pressure  (BP)  and heart rate  (HR) . AEs reported were mild to moderate in 
intensity with the most common being transient conjunctival hyperem ia and ocular irritation; 
however, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime was observed to mitigate or minimize these side 
effects during the daytime.  
Phase 2  Trial in a Glaucomatous and Presbyopic Population  (ORION -1, NYXG -201):  
ORION -1 (NYXG -201) was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, multi -center trial 
of 1% Nyxol compared with placebo ophthalmic solution for 14 days in subjects  with open -angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After screening was performed based on  inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, a total of 39 elderly subjects  (median age of 63) were randomized into the trial 
(Nyxol arm, n = 19; placebo arm, n = 20). These subjects  were either treatment -naïve or were 
previously taking intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering medication and were washed out for 30 
days prior to dosing. Subjects  took their study medication (Nyxol or placebo) in both eyes  (OU)  
between 8PM and 10PM every evening for 14 days. Assessments were made on Day 1, Day 8, 
Day 15, and Day 16. The prim ary efficacy endpoint was change  from baseline  in mean diurnal 
IOP at Day 15. Mean diurnal IOP is the mean of the IOP measurements at 3 timepoints (8AM, 
10AM, 4PM). Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in PD, change in distance -corrected 
near visua l acuity (DCNVA), and change in best -corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), as 
well as additional IOP analyses. Safety assessments included measurements of conjunctival 
hyperemia  (using the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit [CCLRU ] grading 4 -point s cale 
[0-3]), AE s, HR, BP, concomitant medications, and pregnancy . 
In summary , Nyxol  had statistically  significant  reductions  in PD under  photopic  and mesopic  
conditions  that were  sustained  for 36 hours  post-dosing  (Table  1). A statistically  significant  
number  of subjects  treated  with Nyxol  compared  to placebo  demonstrated  ≥ 1 line of 
improvement  in DCNVA  (63.2%  with Nyxol  vs 20.0%  with placebo) , with a trend  for a 2-line 
improvement  at all timepoints.  There  was no statistical  difference  in conjunctival  hyperemia  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  22 11/30/20 compared  to place bo. In summary,  daily  evening  dosing  of Nyxol  was found  to be well tolerated  
with no daytime  conjunctival  redness  and demonstrated  improvement  in DCNVA  with sustained  
PD reduction  in a glaucomatous  and presbyopic  population.  Smaller  pupil  size can have  
beneficial  effects  in improving  near VA in presbyopic  subject s, which  is relevant  to the VEGA -1 
trial. 
Regarding safety, Nyxol 1% was well tolerated and there were no major ocular or systemic 
safety issues. An evening dose regimen minimized eye redness during  the daytime while 
benefiting near VA in an elderly population. The  incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs ) was higher in the Nyxol arm compared with the placebo arm (31.6% v ersus 5.0%) but 
all TEAEs were mild in severity, with no serious TEAEs or TEAEs leading to withdrawal or 
study medication discontinuation. Most TEAEs were considered related to study medication , 
with the most frequent being conjunctival hyperemia and burning on instillation ( each seen in 
16% of subject s treated with Nyxol) . Although conjunctival redness scores increased in the 
Nyxol arm at Day 8, Day 15, and Day 16, the scores in the Nyxol arm at any post -baseline 
timepoint did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference from scores in the placebo 
arm. Mean systolic and diastolic BPs and HRs were relatively unchanged and remained within 
normal range throughout the duration of the trial and were similar between arms. Neither 
biomicroscopic nor ophthalmoscopic examination showed any clinically significant  
abnormalities at Screening or at Day 15. There was no worsening of distance VA, near VA, or 
IOP.  
Phase 2  Trial in Patients With Severe NVD (NYX -SNV):  
NYX -SNV was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, single -dose trial assessing the 
tolerability and effect of a single topical drop of 1.0% solution of phentolamine mesylate in 
Tears Naturale II in each eye or Tears Naturale II (placebo) on PD, c ontrast sensitivity (CS), VA, 
and wavefront aberrometry. A total of 24 patients (median age of 39) with severe night vision 
(SNV) complaints were randomly assigned 2:1 to treatment groups (active treatment, n = 16; 
placebo control, n = 8). Each group was t reated with one drop of test article in each eye. The 
primary endpoint was a statistically significant improvement in the mean change in monocular 
CS scores under mesopic conditions at each of 5 spatial frequencies. Key secondary endpoints 
included measure ments of low-contrast visual acuity ( LCVA ) under mesopic and photopic 
conditions, change in PD, and percent of subjects with an improvement in CS (at multiple 
frequencies), which were recorded at baseline (prior to treatment administration) and 
approximate ly 2 hours after administration.  
 
In summary, in NYX -SNV, 1% Nyxol demonstrated  statistically significant reductions in PD and 
improvement in LCVA under photopic and mesopic lighting conditions, as well as individual CS 
frequency improvements. Treatment wi th 1% Nyxol further exhibited a statistically significant 
reduction in aberration errors (errors that affect light transmission in specific PD sizes). 
Additionally, mean PD decreased an average of 1.3  mm (p < 0.0001), or ~20%, for phentolamine 
mesylate –treated patients, whereas mean PD of placebo -treated patients did not significantly 
change between pre -treatment and post -treatment. The difference in mean PD change between 
treatment groups was also statistically significant (1.1 mm ; p < 0.0001) ( Table  1). 
 
No SAEs  or other AEs were reported during the trial. Overall, study treatment appeared to be 
well tolerated. No meaningful differences in mean HR or mean systolic and diastolic BP between 
treatment groups were observed. Treatment with phentolamine mesylate caused a statistically 
significant elevation in mean change from baseline in conjunctival hyperemia  between the 2 
treatment groups (+38.6 mm versus +12.1 mm for placebo; p  < 0.0004; range,  0 mm  [no redness ] 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  23 11/30/20 – 100 mm [maximal redness ]). The mean change in IOP of phentolamine mesylate –treated eyes 
from screening to 2  to 3 hours post -treatment ( -1.8 mmHg) was statistically significant (p < 
0.0004).  
 
It is important to note that similar results  were found in NYX -01a2, which was a 15 -day, double -
masked, randomized, placebo -controlled trial in patients with severe dim light vision 
disturbances ( DLD ). The NYX -01a2 trial demonstrated a dose response favoring 1% Nyxol. 
Further, statistically significant reductions in PD, trends in improvement in LCVA under bright 
and dim lighting conditions were shown. Durability of effect on PD was observed 24 hours later 
for Nyxol with daily morning doses.  
Pilocarpine  
A detailed report of piloc arpine, its product label, properties, and potential risk are provided in 
the IB (2020) . 
Pilocarpine  hydrochloride  has not been  studied  in prior  clinical  trials  by Ocuphire.  However,  
there  is extensive  literature  on its ability,  at various  concentrations,  to reduce  PD. These pupil -
constricting  effects  are counteracted  by a dose-dependent  side effect  profile , notably  browache  
and stinging  in the eye upon  topical  application  of the drug.   
In an effort  to better  characterize  an efficacious  dose of pilocarpine  that would have  minimal  side 
effects,  Ocuphire  conducted  an expansive  review  of the medical  literature  concerning  
experiment s of various  doses  of pilocarpine  and their effects  on PD and side effect  profile . 
Leavitt  et al. found  that normal  pupils constrict  to dilute  concentrations  of 0.25% or 0.125%  
pilocarpine  (1.7 and 0.6 mm, respectively)  but constrict  insignificantly  at concentrations  of 
0.0313%  or 0.0625%  (4). These  decreases  in PD were  found  to occur  within  15 minutes  of 
dosing  and peak  pupil  size reduction  occurred  at 30 to 60 minutes  (4). On the other  hand,  2% 
pilocarpine , although  efficacious  in decreasing  PD by upwards  of 3 mm, caused  significant  side 
effects  including  worsened  visual  field and acuity  (5). 
When  considering  the effects  on PD and the potential  side effects  of higher  doses  of pilocarpine,  
Ocuphire  found  that a range  of 0.3%  to 0.6%  pilocarpine  may provide  moderate  efficacy  with 
potentially  limited  side effects . Moreover,  based on these  data,  Ocuphire  hypothesizes  that the 
combination  of 0.4%  pilocarpine,  when  added  to phentolamine  mesylate,  can have  an additive  or 
synergistic  effect  to produce  a long duration  of pupil  reduction  in an optimal  range  of PD for 
treating  presbyopia  without  causing  undue  adverse  side effects  due to eye redness , eye stinging,  
or browache . 
2.3. Design  Justification  
Presbyopia is an age -related condition with onset most common in people over 40 years old (6). 
Patients  experience blurred near vision , difficulty seeing in dim light, and eye strain. In young 
healthy eyes, lenses are able to focus light from objects at different distances by a process called 
accommodation. During accommodation, muscles surrounding the lens contract, causing the lens 
to change shape , thus  increasing the focusing power of the eye. This allows for dynamic, clear 
vision at both near and far distances. With increasing age, the lens becomes stiffer , which l imits 
the eye’s ability to adjust its focus for reading or for other ta sks that require clear vision at near 
distances.  
Presbyopia has a significantly negative impact on quality of life  (7), interfering with daily 
activities such as reading, use of computers or hand -held devices,  and seeing the dashboard of a 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  24 11/30/20 car. It is estimated that 100 million Americans have presbyopia and this number is expected to 
grow as the population above the age of 4 0 increases  (8). 
Limitations of Existing Treatments for Presbyopia  
Despite ongoing research, there are currently no noninvasive, pharmacological treatments for 
presbyopia that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ). The 
available  treatments for presbyopia include reading glasses, bifocals, gradients, bifocal contact 
lenses, and multifocal intraocular lenses  (IOLs) . Reading glasses can be inconvenient and must 
be taken off and put on frequently throughout the day to see objects at far and near distances, 
respectively. Many patients express frustration with losing or forgetting their reading glasses.  
Moreover , some patients find glasses unflattering , and c ontact lenses for presbyopia have their 
own set of  drawbacks  regarding eye strain and limitation of use.  
A small portion of patients elect surgical intervention, including laser treatment to achieve 
monovision and insertion of KAMRA Inlays , a plastic implant into the cornea of the non -
dominant eye to increase its d epth of field. The risks of such interventions are those associated 
with all ocular surgeries, such as a potential decrease in CS and the creation or worsening of 
DLD .  
Nyxol Opportunity in Presbyopia  
PD management for the pharmacological treatment of presbyopia is a promising strategy and an 
intense area of focus by several other pharma ceutical  companies. Nyxol alone has shown in 
multiple Phase 2 trials the ability to reduce PD size by 15 % to 20% and imp rove near VA by 1 
line for at least 24 hours after a single application. Other pharmacological and device approaches 
have consistently demonstrated that reducing pupil size to a diameter of 1.6 to 2 mm range 
(“pinhole”) will lead to significant improvement  in presbyopia symptoms by increasing depth of 
focus (9-11). The creation of a pinhole -sized pupil can allow the eye to focus on near objects 
with less dependence on reading adds or lenses.  To achieve the pinhole, Ocuphire plans to 
evaluate the efficacy of a kit combination of Nyxol (dosed in the evening  offering a 20% 
reduction in PD) and LDP  (dosed in the daytime  with an expected additional 20% reduction in 
PD).  
2.4. Route  of Administration,  Dosage  Regimen,  and Treatment  Period  
As the intended route of administration for Nyxol , Placebo , and pilocarpine is topical 
ophthalmic , this is the route to be used in this study.  
The dose for one drop of Nyxol selected for this study, 0.75%, was based upon : 1) preclinical 
safety studies , 2) the results of the previous ophthalmic clinical studies  described above  and in 
the IB, and 3) cl inical studies conducted with varying doses of drugs in the same class  (12). 
Note that 0.75% P OS, which expresses the phentolamine mesylate concentration as the  free base, 
is the new nomenclature being used in place of 1% Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution, 
which was how Nyxol had been described in prior studies , including ORION -1. 
The dose for one drop of pilocarpine selected for this study  is 0.4% . 
All treatments will be administered OU. 
2.5. Compliance  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice  (GCP) , the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki , and with 
the US Code of Federal  Regulations  (CFR) .

of “temporary treatment of presbyopia .” 
 
4. STUDY  DESIGN  
This is a placebo -controlled, double -masked, multiple -dose, Phase 2 study in approximately 152 
randomized subjects with presbyopia ( appro ximately 140 evaluable for efficacy), evaluat ed for  
safety and efficacy following administration of masked  Nyxol or Placebo (Treatment 1)  at or 
near bedtime for 3 to 4 days, with administration of LDP or No Treatment (Treatment 2) at the 
next visit (Visit 2) in the morning. Measurements will be made at multiple visits and timepoints, 
and analysis will consist of comparison across 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone)  
Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 into the above groups.  
After randomization, masked Treatment 1 study medicat ions (Nyxol or Placebo ) will be 
dispensed. Treatment 1 study medication will be taken by the subject at or near bedtime 
(approximately 8PM -10PM) starting the night of Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) or at the 
appropriate evening in order for Treatment 1 to be  taken daily for 3 to 4 consecutive days 
immediately prior to Visit 2 . 
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) is unmasked and will be administered  at Visit 2  by a 
designated, unmasked, Site Staff member, distinct from the Site Staff member recording 
measurement s/assessments.  
Treatment 1 (Nyxol or Placebo) will be administered to both eyes (OU) by the subject.  
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) will be administered OU by the Site Staff.  
The study eye is defined as the eye with worse Baseline DCNVA. In the case where both eyes 
have the same Baseline DCNVA, the study eye will be the right eye (OD). The non -study eye 
will be the fellow eye. The study eye and fellow eye will both be evaluated at all assessments . 
4.1.Primary  and Secondary  Endpoints  
Efficacy:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in 
photopic binocular DCNVA on Visit 2 at 1 hour with Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . 
The improvement in binocular DCNVA for each subject is relative to the su bject’s own Baseline 
value (Visit  1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints ( for the study eye, the fellow eye, and binocular ) will include:

CAS registry number  54-71-7 – parent 92 -13-7 
Chemical class  A cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent, 
pilocarpine predominantly binds to muscarinic 
receptors, thereby inducing exocrine gland 
secretion and stimulating smooth muscle in the 
bronchi, urinary tract, biliary tract, and intestinal 
tract. When applied topic ally to the eye, this agent 
stimulates the sphincter pupillae to contract, 
resulting in miosis; stimulates the ciliary muscle 
to contract, resulting in spasm of accommodation; 
and may cause a transitory rise in IOP followed by 
a more persistent fall due to  opening of the 
trabecular meshwork and an increase in the 
outflow of aqueous humor.

CONFIDENTIAL  35 11/30/20 4.6.Randomization  and Procedure  for Breaking  the Code  
At Visit 1, a randomization code for allocating subjects to Treatment 1 will be prepared by a 
masked biostatistician not  connected with the study.  Subjects will be then randomized 4:3:3:4  
into 1  of 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone ) 
Randomization will be stratified 1:1 by iris color (light/dark irides) . 
At the initiation of study -related procedures, every subject  who is screened is assigned a subject 
number within numerical  order within each site . Once a subject  is qualified for the study , the 
subject  is assigned a randomization number  in the order provided by the biostatistician.  
The Treatment 1  study medication s will be masked to Investigator s, Site Staff , study subject s, 
the clinical research organization (CRO), and Ocuphire . Only in case of medical emergency or 
occurrence of SAE s will the randomization code be unmasked by the Medical Monitor  and made 
available to the Investigator, Ocuphire, and/or other personne l involved in the monitoring or 
conduct of this study.  
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) is unmasked  and will be administered on Visit 2 by a 
designated, unmasked, Site Staff  member, distinct from the Site Staff  member recording 
measurements /assessments .  
Randomization for both Treatments  will occur at Visit 1.  
4.7.Collection  of Data  
Study -specific data that ha ve been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database by individual(s) designated by the Investigator. Data are verified electronically using a 
series of online programmed edit checks that have been created by the Clinical Data Manager 
and programmed by the Clinical Data Programmer or designee. Data discrepancies will be 
brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by the Study Monitor  and Site Staff . 
Study Monitors  will review and verify all data collected in the elect ronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ) against  any applicable  source documentation during remote review or scheduled 
monitoring visits. The Study Monitor  will work closely with the Site Staff  to address any 
discrepancies that have been found so that proper resoluti ons can be made and documented in the 
clinical database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  
4.8.Completed  Subject  
A completed subject  is defined as one who completes all planned procedures through the end of 
Visit 2. 
4.9.Non-completing  Subject  
A non -completing subject  is defined as one who exits the study by their own volition or at the 
discretion of the Investigator and/or the Medical Moni tor prior to completing all of the study 
procedures required in this protocol . Any subject  may decide to voluntarily withdraw from the 
study at any time without prejudice.

• Adverse Events: AEs includ e clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and 
intercurrent diseases reported by the subject  or observed by the Investigator with 
documentation on the eCRF . 
• Death:  If a subjec t dies, the AE(s) that caused the death should be documented on the 
eCRF and be noted as serious and fatal . 
• Disallowed concurrent medication: Any medication not allowed by the protocol would 
be a protocol violation . 
• Lack of efficacy:  A subject  may elect to discontinue participation in the study for a 
perceived lack of efficacy . 
• Investigator  decision:  A subject  may be discontinued for reasons other than those 
bulleted previously if the Investigator thinks it is not in the best interest of the subject  to 
continue . 
• Pregnancy :  A subject may be discontinued from study medication if pregnancy occurs 
while on study.  
• Other:  If there  is any other  reason  for subject  discontinuation , such as pregnancy,  this 
should  be noted  on the eCRF . 
The reason for premature study medication discontinuation should be entered onto the 
appropriate eCRF.   
4.9.2.  Reasons  for Withdrawal  From  Study  
• Subject  withdraws consent . 
• Subject  is lost to follow -up. 
• Subject  withdraws for other reason .

CONFIDENTIAL  39 11/30/20 6. TREATMENT  OF SUBJECT S 
A sample size of approximately 140 subjects (40 for Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  arms and 
30 for each of the other 2 arms ) who are evaluable for efficacy  is needed for the study.  
Eligible subjects randomized into 1  of 4 treatment arms:  
• Nyxol  + LDP  
• Nyxol  + No Treatment  2 (Nyxol  alone)  
• Placebo  + LDP  
• Placebo  + No Treatment  2 (Placebo  alone)  
Subjects  will be randomized 4:3:3:4 into the above groups.  Randomiz ation will be stratified by 
iris color (light/dark irides) . 
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  7% drop -out between Visit 1 and end of Visit 2 . 
To account for this drop -out, a total of approximately 152  subjects will be randomized into the 
study .  
6.1.Treatment  Adherence  
All subjects will be instructed on the importance of following the once -daily dosing regimen for 
Treatment 1. Beginning the day of Visit 1  (Screening/ Baseline ), subjects will instill one drop of 
Treatment 1 study medication in each eye at  or near bedtime ( approximately 8PM -10PM ) and 
repeat this procedure daily up to 3 additional  times , for a total of up to 4 doses.  
Effort should be made to schedule Visit 2 when the patient is onsite for Visit 1 , and, if possible, 
Visit 2 should be scheduled within 3 or 4 days of Visit 1. If Visit 2 will be greater than 4 days 
after Visit 1, the subject should not start their medication until  3 or 4 days prior to Visit 2 and 
shoul d take their medication for those consecutive days immediately prior to Visit 2.  
Subjects are to bring unused bottles into the study site on Visit  2. Adherence to Treatment 1 will 
be measured by counting the dropper bottles at the start of the study and those remaining at each 
study visit.  
Treatment 2 study medi cation will be administered by a designated Site Staff  member, distinct 
from the Site Staff  member recording measurem ents/assessments , at Visit 2. 
6.2.Concomitant  Medications  
As noted in the exclusion criteria ( Section  5.2), use of any topical prescription or OTC 
ophthalmic medications of any kind within 7 days of Screening, with the exception of lid scrubs 
with OTC products ( e.g., OCuSOFT® lid scrub, SteriLid®, baby shampoo, etc.)  is prohibited .  
Additionally, initiation of treatment with or any changes to the current dosage, drug , or regimen 
of any systemic adrenergic or cholinergic drugs (Appendix 3) within 7 days prior to Screening , 
or during the study , is prohi bited . However , a su bject can be treated with a systemic 
adrenoceptor antagonist , for example,  as long as the particular agent and its dose and regimen 
had been consistent for the 7 days prior to Screening, and there was no reason to believe that 
alteration would be necessary  at some point later during the study.  
If there is any question about whether a medication is acceptable, the Medical Monitor  should 
be consulted before proceeding . 
Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Investigators are 
encouraged to contact the Medical Monitor  for any questions regarding allowed medications.

OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  40 11/30/20 Judgment of continued study participation  by the subject , and inclusion of thi s subject ’s 
subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by Ocuphire.  
All medications that the subject  has taken within 30 days  prior to the Screening Visit and  during 
the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The name of the drug, dose , route of administration, 
duration of treatment , and indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination  and 
products ( e.g., Contac®, Cosopt®) and non -combination products , the generic  name is desired . 
The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents ( e.g., fluorescein and local 
anesthetic) will be allowed and should be documented . Any change in dosing parameters should 
also be recorded in the eCRF.  
7. ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  
7.1.Specification  of the Efficacy  Parameters  
The pri mary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters  of improvement in 
photopic binocular  DCNVA  on Visit 2 at 1 hour with Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . 
The improvement in binocular  DCNVA for each subject is relative to the subject’s own Baseline  
value (Visit  1). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints , which will be assessed for the study eye, the fellow  eye, and 
binocular  can be found in Section 4.1.  
All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall and by light/dark irides at all timepoints.  
All of the efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed by mITT  and PP  population s. 
7.2.Assessing , Recording,  and Analyzing  of Efficacy  Parameters  
VA and PD assessments will be measured at Visit 1  (Screening/Baseline)  and Visit 2  
(Treatment) , as described in Section 4.1 . 
The photopic lighting

 The luminance  
 
. Subject s will be allowed to acclimate t o these lighting conditions (with 
the eyes open normally for a  to the  set of  PD, DCNVA, BC DVA , 
and BC IVA). Subject s will sit in the exam chair facing directly  at the illuminated  chart  during 
the acclimation period and for all assessments.  
Room lights may be turned on for the scheduled remaining safety assessments (e.g. , conjunctival 
hyperemia, AEs, subject questionnaire, etc.). The subject should  be in the same room for all 
assessment s, and every effort will be made to have the same person perform the measurements at 
all visits . 
7.2.1. Visit  1 (Screening /Baseline ) – Day 1 
Individuals who are potential subjects are identified by the study center to schedule the 
Screening Visit. The Screening Visit shall occur the same day as the Baseline Visit.  

Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  41 11/30/20 Once a subject arrives at the study center, a member of the Site Staff will inte rview the 
individual as to their qualifications for participation in the study, and if the subject wishes to 
continue, the informed consent form is signed, and a subject  number is assigned.  
The start of Screening includes an explanation of the study, a medical and ophthalmic history, 
and demographics .  
This shall be 
followed by a urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential (  
), and HR/BP (   
The subject will then undergo several VA measurements, including photopic BCDVA  as well as 
mesopic and photopic DCNVA (  In addition, subjects will undergo 
measurement of photopic best -corrected intermediate visual acuity (BCIVA) and mesopic 
BCDVA.  
The screening assessment will also include an ophthalmic exami nation that includes assessment 
of PD, biomicroscopy, dry eye examination with tear break -up time testing and corneal 
fluorescein staining  ( ), intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement (using a 
Tono -Pen), and direct or indirect ophthalmo scopy without dilation.  
In addition, conjunctival hyperemia will be assessed visually with a 4-point grading scale using 
images from the CCLRU  ( ).  
If all eligibility criteria are met, the subject will be randomized into the study.  
After randomization , masked Treatment 1 study medications (Nyxol or Placebo ) will be 
dispensed.  
All treatments and assessments will be administered OU.  
Please see Table  2 for details on measurements expected at Visit 1. 
All treatments and assessments will be administered OU. 
7.2.2.  Visit 2 (Treatment  2) – Day 4 
Visit 2 may occur 3 to 5  days after Visit 1. On the morning of Visit 2, subjects will undergo 
certain assessments immediately prior  to receiving Treatment 2 at 0 minute s: 
• Urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential  
• HR/BP  
• Concomitant  medications   
•  
  
 
Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment) is unmasked and will be administered on Visit 2 by a 
designated, unmasked, Site Staff member, distinct from the Site Staff member recording 
measurements/as sessments.  
After instillation of Treatment 2 (LDP or No Treatment), subjects will undergo certain 
assessments at multiple timepoints after Time 0 (from 30 minutes to 6 hours):  
• PD 

Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  42 11/30/20 • DCNVA (mesopic and photopic), BCDVA (mesopic and photopic), BCIVA (photopic) – 
monocular and binocular  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  
• Adverse events (A Es) 
• Subjective ocular tolerability  
Biomicroscopy, IOP, and ophthalmoscopy will be performed at the 6 -hour timepoint.  
There is a window of  for every timepoint to com plete measurement of the primary 
endpoint of photopic DCNVA. Sites should start pupil diameter measurements approximately 5 
minutes prior to each timepoint in order to allow sufficient time to perform the primary endpoint of 
photopic DCNVA at the target ti mepoint . 
7.2.3. Visit  3 (Safety  Follow -Up Call) – Day 5  
For Visit 3, which will occur 1 to 3 days after Visit 2, subjects  will receive a safety follow -up 
call to review concomitant medications  and AEs. 
7.2.4.  Unscheduled  Visits  
An unscheduled visit may be any visit to the Investigator other than the specific visits requested 
in the protocol as possibly required for the subject ’s ophthalmic condition. The Investigator will 
perform all procedures necessary to evaluate the study participant at thes e visits and record any 
AEs in the eCRF . 
As noted  in Section 4.9.4 , every possible effort should be made by Investigators to assure that 
subject s who discontinue early from the study have  a telephone follow -up that includes 
assessments of AEs, concomitant med ications , and subject -evaluated conjunctival hyperemia . 
7.2.5.  Visit  Variation  
Visit  2 may occur 3 to 5 days after Visit 1. Visit 3 occur s 1 to 3 days (any time) after Visit 2.  
8. ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
8.1.Specification  of Safety  Parameters  
The primary safety measures are conjunctival hyperemia, subject -evaluated  ocular tolerability, 
and AEs. Other safety measures include biomicroscopy, IOP (as measured with the Tono -Pen), 
and systemic safety  (as measured by HR and BP ). Urine pregnancy tests for females of 
childbearing potential will be conducted.  
The assessment of safety will be evaluated by:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  measured with CCLRU images  using a 4-point scale  (0-3) 
(Appendix 4). 
o None (0) = Normal . Appears white with a small number of con junctival blood 
vessel s easily observed  
o Mild (+1) = Prominent , pinkish -red color of both the bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva  
o Moderate (+2) = Bright, scarlet red color of the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva  
o Severe (+3) = Beefy red with petechiae, dark red bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva 
with evidence of subconjunctival  hemorrhage

• Biomicroscopy  of the anterior  segment  includes  evaluation  of lids, lashes,  cornea,  
conjunctiva,  iris, lens, and anterior  chamber.  Fluorescein  staining  will be used for tear 
break -up time and/or  corneal  fluorescein  staining  assessments.  
• Ophthalmoscopy  (direct  or indirect)  without  PD to evaluate  the vitreous  and posterior  
pole.  
• IOP is measured with the Tono -Pen. 
• HR and BP (as per the site’s normal equipment and procedure s). 
• AEs 
8.2. Assessing , Recording,  and Analyzing  Safety  Parameters  
The timing for recording safety parameters may be found in Table 2 . 
8.3.Adverse  Events  and Serious  Adverse  Events  
All AEs and SAEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit should be collected 
and recorde d on the AE or SAE eCRF page . Only TEAEs will be summarized  (Section  8.3.1 ). 
All AEs/adverse reactions occurring during the study (i .e., once the subject  has signed the 
informed consent ) must be documented, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, on 
the respective eCRF. All  TEAEs/treatment -emergent adverse reactions must be documented 
from the time the subject  receives the study medication until the subject ’s participation in the 
study has been completed. If a subject  has ongoing AEs/adverse reactions at the time of study 
completion  or discontinuation from the study , the ongoing AEs/adverse reactions must  be 
followed  up and provided appropriate medical care until the signs and symptoms have remitted 
or stabilized or until medical assessments  have returned to acceptable or pre -study limits.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and end date, severit y, relationship 
to study medications , action(s) taken, seriousness , and outcome.  
8.3.1.  Adverse  Event  Definitions  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
Adverse event . An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a study 
medication  in humans, whether or not  it is considered drug related . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease 
temporari ly associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study 
medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the 
comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given or administered during any p hase of the 
study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  44 11/30/20 constitute AEs only if they induce clinical sig ns or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by open -ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic assessment /visit, study personnel should ask the follo wing 
question: “Have you had any problems since your last assessment /visit?” AEs also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through study 
assessments.  
Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening suspect ed adverse reaction . An AE or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Ocuphire , its occurrence places the subject  or subject  at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse 
reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocuphire,  it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  AE 
• Inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• Persistent  or significant  incapacit y or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  
life functions   
• Congenital  anomaly/birth  defect   
• Other  medically  important  serious  event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition  that is 
unrel ated to the medication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE.  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigati onal New Drug ( IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, whic h means any AE caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also 
refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
The study medication relationship  for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by the 
Investigator using these explana tions:  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  45 11/30/20 • Not related  
• Unlikely related  
• Possibly related  
• Probably related  
• Definitely related  
• Unknown  
Unless the relationship is considered to be “Not related” or “Unlikely related” and there is any 
valid reason, even if undetermined , for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“related .”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by 
Ocuphire  to be anything other than “Not related ” or “Unlikely related ,” the event will be 
considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory 
reporting.  
Severity  of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an AE as is 
determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject . The assessment of severity  
is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: Present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity  
• 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A ch ange in severity for a reported AE will require a n end date for the previous severity and a 
new start and end date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild 
to severe  or from severe to moderate. In either case the start or  end times/ dates should be 
recorded.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an event/reaction; the event/reaction itself 
may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache) . This is not the same 
as a “ serious” AE, which is based on a subject/event outcome  or action criteria usually associated 
with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital functions. “Seriousness ” (NOT 
severity) serves as a guide f or defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form and emailed 
to , as well as in the eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as 
an AE unless there is a suspic ion that an investigational product may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study . 
Action  taken in response to an AE is coded as:  
• Dose  increased : An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by addition;  
either  by changing  the frequency,  strength , or amount.  

Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  46 11/30/20 • Dose  not changed:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was maintained.  
• Dose  reduced:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by subtraction,  
either  by changing  the frequency,  strength , or amount.  
• Dose  interrupted:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  by temporarily  
terminating  a prescribed  regimen  of medication.  
• Drug  withdrawn:  An indication  that a medication  schedule  was modified  through  
termination  of a prescribed  regimen  of medication.  
• Not applicable:  Determination  of a value  is not relevant  in the current  context . 
• Unknown:  Not known,  not observed,  not recorded,  or refused . 
Additional other action taken : 
• Concomitant  medication  
• Hospitalization  
Outcome  of an AE is coded a s: 
• Fatal : The termination  of life as a result  of an AE. 
• Not recovered/not  resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  
that the event  has not improved  or the subject  has not recuperated . 
• Recovered/resolved : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that the 
event  has improved  or the subject  has recuperated . 
• Recovered/ resolved  with sequelae : One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  where  
the subject  recuperated  but retained  pathological  conditions  resulting  from  the prior  
disease  or injury . 
• Recovering/resolving:  One of the possible  results  of an AE outcome  that indicates  that 
the event  is improving . 
• Unknown:  Not known,  not observed,  not recorded,  or refused . 
In previous clinical studies of Nyxol , the most frequently reported AE was conjunctival 
hyperemia.  
In the present study,  any increase of 2 units in conjunctival hyperemia between consecutive 
timepoints is considered an AE.  
Investigators are cautioned to use the appropriate verbatim term on the AE form to describe this 
observation:  
• Redness related to instillation that is transient (i .e., is no longer present 2  hours after 
instillation) = “conjunctival erythema upon instillati on.” 
• Redness that is NOT transient (i .e., is present 2 hours after instillation) = “conjunctival 
hyperemia .” 
Expedited reporting of serious and unexpected adverse  events : All SAEs (related and 
unrelated) will be recorded following subject signature of the informed consent and until the 
Safety Follow -Up Call (Visit 3/Day 5) . Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study 
medication  and discovered by the Investigator at any time after  the study must  be reported.  
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  47 11/30/20 Any SAE that occurs must be reported to the CRO  within 24 hours of its occurrence or within 
24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the 
initial SAE must be reported to the CRO  as follow -up to the origina l episode within 24 hours of 
the Investigator receiving the information.  Information about all SAEs will be collected and 
recorded on the SAE eCRF . All pertinent medical records and information collected during the 
treatment and follow -up of the subject  should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed 
to VEGA1 _Safety @Oculoscr.com . The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and 
complete the SAE eCRF . The CRO  may request additional information. Follow -up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject ’s chart and a copy will be emailed  to 
VEGA1 _Safety @Oculoscr.com . In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the AE eCRF page 
with the serious question  marked “Yes .” 
It is the Investigator’s responsibilit y to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis 
as instructed by Ocuphire  following Ocuphire ’s determination of causality. All subjects  who 
experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate diagnostic 
evaluations until  stabilization or resolution of the event. Ocuphire  will report all SAEs to the 
FDA on the appropriate schedule depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, 
expected, or unexpected (based on the available information in the I B). 
Any death oc curring during the study and follow -up period must  be reported as an SAE. For any 
death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study 
medication , the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to the CRO . A death occurring after 
completion of the study including the Safety Follow -Up Call, that is not reasonably associated 
with study medication administration, does not require completion of the SA E form.  
8.3.2.  Follow -Up of Subjects  After  Adverse  Events  
If an AE/adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as 
deemed appropriate. All SAEs  ongoing  at the time of the last visit or discontinuation from the 
study will be f ollowed up  until the AE/adverse reaction is resolved or stabilized, the subject is 
lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.  
 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1.Sample  Size 
A sample size of approximately  140 subjects ( 40 for Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  arms and 
30 for each of the other 2 arms ) who are evaluable for efficacy  is needed for the study. The 
primary treatment comparison will be Nyxol + LDP compared to Placebo alone . Using α = 0.05 
significance  and a two-tailed test, 76 total subjects ( 38 subjects each in the Nyxol + LDP and

Subjects will be randomized 4:3:3:4 to Nyxol + LDP , Nyxol + No Treatment 2 (Nyxol alone ), 
Placebo + LDP , and Placebo + No Treatment 2 (Placebo alone ), respectively . 
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  7% drop -out between Visit 1 and end of Visit 2 . 
To account for this drop -out, a total of approximately 152  subjects will be randomized into the 
study. 
A diagram outli ning treatment arms can be found in Appendix 5.

CONFIDENTIAL  48 11/30/20 9.2.Analysis  Populations  
Modified Intention -to-Treat: The mITT population will include all randomized subject s who 
received at least one drop of Treatment 1 and  were administered Treatment 2  (LDP or No 
Treatment) . The mITT population will be used  to analyze efficacy endpoints.  
Per Protocol Population:  The PP population included all subjects in the mITT who received 
one drop of Treatment 1 the day prior to Visit 2 and were  administered Treatment 2 at Visit 2, 
had binocular DCNVA and BCDVA in photopic conditions at Baseline (V isit 1) and at Visit 2 
time 1 hour , and had  no major protocol deviations. The PP population will be used for the 
primary endpoint analy sis and to analyze  efficacy endpoints .  
All Randomized Population (AR P): The AR P will include all randomized subject s. This 
population is also known as the Intent ion-to-Treat (ITT) population . The AR P will be used in 
confirmatory efficacy analyses . 
Safety Population  (SP): The SP will include all randomized  subject s who have received at least 
one drop of study treatment  (Treatment 1 or Treatment  2). The SP will be used to summarize 
safety variables.  
9.3.Statistical  Methods   
9.3.1.  General  Considerations  
All continuous variables will  be summarized by treatment and timepoint (as applicable) using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All 
categorical variables will  be summarized by treatment and tim epoint (as applicable) using 
frequency counts and percentages.  
All study data will be listed by treatment, subject , and timepoint (as applicable).  
All statistical tests will be performed using a  significance level of 5% (two -tailed). The p-values 
for the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be considered descriptive.  
9.3.2.  Demographic  and Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics , such as age, race, and sex, will be summarized by 
treatment arm using the mITT population , PP population , the AR P, and the SP . These data will 
also be provided in by -subject  listings . 
9.3.3.  Subject  Disposition  
Subject  disposition, including randomization, and completion  and withdrawal from the study will 
be summarized using the AR P. These data will also be provided in by -subject  listings . 
9.3.4.  Medical  History  and Prior/ Concomitant  Medications  
Medical history will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regula tory 
Activities (MedDRA , Version 23.1 ) and will be summarized by treatment arm using the mITT 
population .  
Prior medications (medications with an end date prior to the date of randomization) and 
concomitant medications (medications with a start or end date after the date of randomization) 
will be coded using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary ( WHODrug , Sept 2020 ) and 
will both be summarized by treatment arm using the  SP. 
Medical history  and prior and concomitant medications wil l also be provided in by-subject  
listings .

CONFIDENTIAL  49 11/30/20 9.3.5.  Analysis  of Efficacy  
Efficacy will be assessed using the mITT and PP  populations  with subject s included in the 
treatment arm in which they were randomized . For the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, 
appropriate imputation techniques will be performed for missing observations if applicable; 
details will be provided in the study Statistical Analysis Plan . The primary comparison of interest 
is Nyxol + LDP and Placebo alone  for the PP population . Confirmatory analyses may be 
performed using the AR P, with imputation performed for missing data. For the analysis of the 
secondary effica cy endpoints, only observed case data will be used. If warranted, confirmatory 
analyses using the AR P with imputation for missing data will also be performed for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
For all efficacy endpoints, Baseline values are defined as t he screening assessment values on 
Visit 1 . 
All efficacy data will be summarized by treatment group, study day , and timepoint ( Baseline  and 
Visit  2), as appropriate.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 ETDRS letters  of 
improve ment in photopic  binocular  DCNVA on Visit 2 at 1 hour with Nyxol + LDP compared to 
Placebo alone . The improvement in binocular  DCNVA for each subject is relative to the 
subject’s own Baseline  value (Visit  1). The primary efficacy endp oint will be analyzed using a 
logistic regression model with  
The percentage of subjects in each treatment arm meeting the criteria, the odds ratio (OR) with 
95% confidence interval  (CI) and p -value will be provided.  The analysis  will be performed using 
the mITT and PP  populations , with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of 
the treatment they actually received. A sensitivity analysis will be completed for the primary 
efficacy endpoint using the same model but excluding the . 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  are indicated  in Section 4.1.  
Each of the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints  will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA)  with change from Baseline  as the dependent variable, treatment , and 
light/dark irides as factors, and the respective Baseline  value included as the covariate . Each 
ANCOVA will be performed using the mITT and PP populations with subjects included in their 
randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received. The output from each 
ANCOVA will include the least-squares mean ( LSM ) and standard err or for all treatment groups, 
along with the placebo -corrected LSM  for each treatment difference , its 95% CI , and associated 
p-value.  
All continuous secondary endpoints derived from VA assessments , such as change in DCNVA , 
BCIVA , and BCDVA, will be analyze d using ETDRS  letters  correctly read .  
For each of the secondary endpoints related to percent of subjects achieving certain criteria, the 
analysis will be performed using a logistic regression model with treatment, light/dark irides,  and 
the respective Baseline  as a covariate . For each analysis, the percentage of subjects in each 
treatment arm meeting the criteria, the OR with 95% CI and p -value will be provided. For these 
endpoints, the mITT and PP  populations will be used with subjects included in their randomized 
treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received.  
In addition, each secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed by using the 
same model indicated above but without irides as a factor, as appropriate . Other subgroups , such 
as age, sex, and race, may be analyzed as well.

CONFIDENTIAL  50 11/30/20 9.3.6.  Analysis  of Safety  
Safety will be assessed using the SP with subject s included in the treatment arm they actually 
received, regardless of their randomized treatment . Observed case data will b e used; no 
imputation will be performed for missing safety data.  A statistical analysis of conjunctival 
hyperemia will be conducted as described below; otherwise, no statistical analysis of safety data 
will be performed.  
For HR and BP, Baseline  is defined as the Screening  value. HR and BP values  and change from 
Baseline  in the values  will be summarized by treatment arm and timepoint  (Visit 1 and Visit 2 ).  
Observed values and c hange from Baseline  (Visit 1) in conjunctival hyperemia at each timep oint 
(Visit 1 at 0 and 1 hour, and Visit 2 at 0 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 
and 6 hours ), will be summarized for the study eye and fellow ey e. Treatments will be compared 
using the same ANCOVA model proposed for the continuous s econdary efficacy endpoints . 
For IOP, Baseline  is defined as the Screening value. Observed values  and change from Baseline  
in IOP at each timepoint ( Visit 1 and Visit 2 ) will be summarized for the study eye  and the 
fellow  eye. 
Ocular tolerability values will be summarized by treatment arm at each timepoint (Visit 1  and 
Visit 2).  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using  MedDRA.  Only TEAEs  (those  that occur after 
the first dose of study medication or increasing in severity  after initiation of study medication ) 
will be summarized . TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized  by treatment group, by system organ 
class (SOC) , severity, and relationship to study medication. Deaths, withdrawal from study 
medication due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each by summarized by 
treatment group. Note that in MedDRA, ocular events are coded to the SOC of “special senses .” 
Thus , using SOC in the summaries will provide a separation of ocular and non -ocular AEs. 
All safety data will be provided in by -subject  listings.   
9.4. Procedure  for Accounting  for Missing,  Unused,  or Spurious  Data  
For the summarization and analysis of  efficacy data, the focus will be on observed case data 
only. As appropriate, confirmatory efficacy analyses will be performed using imputation for 
missing data; details of the imputation , if performed,  will be included in the study Statistical 
Analysis Pl an. For the summarization of safety data, observed case data only will be used . 
9.5.Procedure  for Reporting  Deviations  From  the Statistical  Plan  
Any deviations from the statistical plan will be described and a justification given in the final 
Clinical Study Re port.

the approval of IRBs , the Helsinki Declaration, US FDA law, International Council for 
Harmonisation  (ICH) GCP guidelines, obtaining prospective informed consent, monitoring of the 
conduct of the study and the completeness of the eCRFs  by Ocuphire or its designee(s), and 
appropriate record retention by the Investigato r.  
12.2. Institutional  Review  Board   
This protocol, materials used to recruit subject s, and materials used to document consent must be 
approved by the IRB prior to initiation of the study. Written IRB approval must adequately 
identify the protocol and informed consent. In addition to approving the protocol, the IRB must 
also approve the subject  information and consent  form, as well as any advertising tools that will 
be used for the study. Copies of all approved materials, all correspondence with the IRB and 
written approval from the IRB must be made available to Ocuphire, prior  to the start  of subject  
enrollment into the study.  
12.3. Protocol  Deviations/Violations  
The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior written 
approval of the Medical Monitor or Sponsor , except in the event of a medical emergency.  
A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the protocol that involves 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, rights or welfare, or has the potential to affect 
the integrity of t he data. Examples of major protocol deviations  include study enrollment  by 
ineligible subject , loss of key data such as equipment  malfunction  (e.g., pupillometer), and/or use  
of a prohibited medication during the study .  
All protocol deviations will be rep orted by entering the event in the appropriate eCRF page. 
Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB -specific guidelines. If 
there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Ocuphire or designee and the IRB 
should be contacted.  
All changes to the protocol will be made by the Sponsor or designee as an approved amendment 
to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  
Changes implemented without prior approval will be consi dered protocol violations.  
12.4.  Informed  Consent  Requirements  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject . A copy of the signed and dated 
consent document will be given to each subject . The original signed and dated informed consent 
document must be maintained in the study files at the Investigator’s site.   
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that no  subject  is subject to any study -related 
examination or activity before that subject  has given informed consent. The subject  must give 
Ocuphire  Pharma,  Inc.  Clinical  Protocol  
OPI-NYXP -201  VEGA -1 
CONFIDENTIAL  52 11/30/20 written consent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanation will cover all the 
elements specified i n the written information provided for the subject . 
It should be emphasized that the subject  is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any 
time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject  is otherwise entitled. Subject s who 
refuse t o give or who withdraw written informed consent may not be included or continued in 
this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The Investigator will inform the subject  of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits , and potential 
hazards o f the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject  must be given every 
opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and , if necessary, ask for more 
information. At the end of the interview, the subject  may be given time to ref lect if this is 
required, or if the subject  requests more time.  Subject s will be required to sign and date the 
informed consent form.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent document will be given to each subject . The original 
signed and dated informed con sent document must be maintained in the study files at the 
Investigator’s site. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to the conductance of any 
study procedures.  
 
13. DATA  HANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing 
practices meeting ICH and US FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical 
trials.  
13.1. Data  Entry  
Study -specific data that ha ve been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the c linical 
database by individual(s) designated by the Investigator.  
13.2. Data  Quality  Control  and Reporting  
Data are verified electronically using a series of programmed edit checks that have been created 
by the Clinical Data Manager and programmed by the Clinic al Data Programmer or designee. 
Data discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by the 
clinical research associate ( CRA ) and Site Staff . CRAs will review and verify all data collected 
in the eCRF against source doc umentation during scheduled monitoring visits. The CRA will 
work closely with the Site Staff  to address any discrepancies that have been found so that proper 
resolutions can be made and documented in the clinical database. An audit trail within the system 
will track all changes made to the data.  
13.3. Archiving  of Data 
Archived versions of the database will be saved by Ocuphire consistent with ICH GCP 
guidelines, complying with whichever of the requirements is longer. Ocuphire will notify the 
Investigator when documents should be returned.

CONFIDENTIAL  53 11/30/20 13.5. Amendments  to the Protocol  
Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by approved protocol amendments and 
with the agreement of all responsible persons. The procedure for approval of a protocol 
amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol. The IRB must be informed of all 
protocol ame ndments and should be asked for its opinion as to whether a full re -evaluation of the 
ethical aspects of the study is necessary by the committee. This should be fully documented.  
The Investigator must not implement any deviation from or change to the proto col, without 
discussion with, and agreement by Ocuphire and prior review and documented 
approval/favorable opinion of the amendment from the relevant ethics committee, except where 
it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subject s, or wher e the change(s) 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor, change of 
telephone number ). 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by the 
applicable regulatory requirem ent(s).

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 4 of 48STUDY SUMMARY
Title: A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Sham-Controlled Study to Determine 
the Safety and Efficacy of NT-501 in Macular Telangiectasia Type 2
Rationale: Preliminary findings suggest that empl oying NT-501 in participants with 
macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) has the potential to provide benefit 
with an acceptable risk profile.
Target Population: Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of MacTel
Number of Participants: Approximately 112 participants
Objectives: The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
NT-501 for the treatment of MacTel.
Primary objective:
xTo determine the rate of change in the ellipsoid zone (EZ; inner 
segment/outer segment [IS/OS]) area loss over 24 months, as measured 
by study eye spectral-domain opti cal coherence tomography (SD- OCT) 
in participants with MacTel
Secondary objective:
xTo evaluate the safety of NT-501 in participants with MacTel
Study Design: Phase 3, prospective, multicenter,  masked, sham-controlled study
Inclusion Criteria: To participate in this study, the potential participant and at least 1 of their 
eyes must meet all of the following criteria:
1. Participant must have at least 1 study eye with a positive diagnosis of 
MacTel with evidence of fluorescein leakage typical of MacTel and at 
least one of the other features that include hyperpigmentation that is 
outside of a 500 micron radius from the center of the fovea, retinal 
opacification, crystalline deposits, right-angle vessels, or inner/outer 
lamellar cavities
2. Participant must have an IS/OS PR break and EZ (area of IS/OS loss) as 
measured by SD-OCT between 0.16 and 2.00 mm2
3.Participant’s best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 54- letter score or 
better (20/80 or better) as measured by the Early Treatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart at screening
4. Participant must have steady fixation in the foveal or parafoveal area and 
sufficiently clear media for good quality photographs
5.Participant must be greater than 21 years of age or less than 80 years of 
age at screening
6.Participant must be able to provide  written informed consent to 
participate in the study, in accordance with the International Conference 
on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practices guidelines, and local 
regulations, before initiating any study-related proceduresB1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

factor (VEGF) therapy in the study eye OR has, within the past 3 
months, received intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy in the fellow eye at randomization
4. Participant has evidence of ocular dis ease other than MacTel that, in the 
judgment of the examining physician, may confound the diagnosis, 
procedures, or outcome of the study (eg, glaucoma, severe nonproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy, uveitis)
5.Participant has a chronic requirement (eg, ≥ 4 weeks at a time) for ocular 
medications and/or has a diagnosed dis ease that, in the judgment of the 
examining physician, may be vision threatening or may affect the 
primary outcome (artificial tears are permitted)

neovascularization (SRNV) , as evidenced by hemorrhage, hard exudate, 
subretinal fluid or intraretinal fluid in either eye
7.Participant has evidence of central serous chorio- retinopathy in either 
eye
8.Participant has evidence of pathologic myopia in either eye

standard 3, posterior subcapsular op acity > standard 2, or a nuclear 
opacity > standard 3 as measured on the Age- Related Eye Disease Study 
(AREDS) clinical lens grading system
12.Participant has undergone lens removal in the previous 3 months or YAG 
laser within 4 weeks
13. Participant was a participant in any other clinical trial of an intervention
(drug or device) within the last 6 months
14.Participant is on chemotherapy
15.Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding
16. Participant has a history of malignancy that would compromise the 24-
month study survival

condition that would increase the risk of participation in the study or may 
interfere with the study procedure s, evaluations, and outcome 
assessments
19. Participant has evidence of intraretinal hyperreflectivity by OCT
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: xThe rate of change in the EZ (IS/ OS) area loss from the Baseline V isit 
through the Month-24 Visit, as assessed in the study eye of participants 
with MacTel using SD-OCT 
Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoints:xMean change in aggregate sensitivity of microperimetry within the EZ 
line break area from the Baseline Visit through the Month-24 Visit
xMean change in reading speed from the Baseline Visit through the 
Month-24 Visit
xMean change in the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) near  activities subscale score 
from the 
Baseline Visit through the Month-24 Visit 
Secondary Safety Endpoint: xNumber and proportion of participants with a loss in BCVA of 15 or 
more letters from baseline in the study eye using the ETDRS distance 
chart
xNumber and proportion of participants with at least 1 treatment- emergent 
serious adverse event
Measures of Interest: MacTel is a progressive disease. The n atural history of MacTel suggests that 
patients will deteriorate markedly in near visual function and visual acuity
over time and that this progression of the disease is evidenced by the 
increased loss of photoreceptors reflected in  the increasing size of the area of 
EZ break.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

NTMT-03-B –NT-501 MacTel Phase 3 Study Confidential
Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 13 of 481. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE
1.1 BACKGROUND
Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neuro/vascular/glial degenerative condition of 
unknown etiology with characteristic neurosensory atrophy an d perifoveal telangiectatic vessels that leak on 
fluorescein angiography1. Other characteristic lesions include loss of retinal transparency, crystalline deposits, 
a decrease or absence of macular pigment, and hyperplas ia of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the 
macular area. Spectral-domain optic al coherence tomography (SD-OCT) as sessments show disruption of the 
photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction line (IS/OS line) or ellipsoid zone (EZ)2,a n d  
hyporeflective cavities in both the inner and outer retina.
The natural course of MacTel is a gradual bilateral loss of vision with the progression of EZ loss, occasionally 
accompanied by subretinal neovascularization (SRNV), leading to severe vision loss1. Functional impairment 
may be mild with no impairment or only a slight reduction in binocular best-corrected  visual acuity (BCVA) in 
the early stages of MacTel. However, loss of visual acuity  in at least 1 eye is a frequently reported complaint3, 
4. Notably, even in the presence of deep paracentral scotomata and reduced reading ability, distance visual 
acuity may be relatively preserved5, 6. However, a decrease in visual acuity may eventually occur with disease 
progression. There appear to be essentially 2 different  factors contributing to the decline of visual acuity7, 8.
Initially, there may be a slow drop in visual acuity, usually not below 20/50, which may be due to structural 
foveal changes, eg, a low-grade chronic vascular leakage or degenerative hypore ﬂective cavities in the inner 
retina. The second and more important factor for a decline in visual acuity is atrophy of the foveal 
photoreceptors, which may result in eccentric ﬁxation and a visual acuity of around 20/200. Such photoreceptor 
dropout initially occurs temporal to the foveola causing the characteristic deep paracentral scotomata and may 
later spread centrally. If a relatively faster drop in visu al acuity is observed, an associated macular hole, the 
development of a retinal pigment epithelial hypert rophy, or neovascular complex may be suspected. Visual 
acuity below 20/200 is rarely observed but there may be  marked functional impairment in very late disease 
stages, with large central areas of photoreceptor atrophy or due to the de velopment of a larger neovascular 
complex4, 9.
There is a large body of evidence to support the use of  ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) as a potential therapy
for retinal degenerative diseases10, 11. Histopathologic studies in naturally occurring and genetically engineered 
animal models of photoreceptor dysfunction and death t hat phenotypically model retinitis pigmentosa (RP), 
have indicated the promise of CNTF as an effective th erapeutic agent for reducing photoreceptor loss associated 
with degeneration of the cells of the outer retina. CNTF is one of several neurotr ophic factors that are produced 
endogenously by neurons or Müller cells. CNTF has been demonstrated to be highly effective in retarding 
photoreceptor neuron loss in animal models of retinal de generation of various forms, including environmental 
light stress. In 2 preclinical animal studies condu cted by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CNTF-producing 
cells have been shown to have a protective effect on the photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). A rat 
model of RP suggested that CNTF-producing cells delivered as an intravitreal injection had a protective effect 
on the photoreceptors in the ONL; the treated eyes had 5 to 6 layers of photoreceptors in the ONL compared 
with 1 to 2 layers in the untreated eyes. In a dog model of RP, the NT-501 device was also observed to have a 
protective effect on the photoreceptors ; the treated eyes had 5 to 6 layer s in the ONL compared with 2 to 3 
layers in the untreated eyes12.
Although CNTF is an attractive therapeutic candidate for  neurodegenerative diseases, it is significantly 
handicapped by its extremely short half-life. Neurot ech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed the NT-501 device
to treat retinal degenerative diseases. Human safety data is available from studies in  participants with MacTel, 
RP, atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma. The NT-501 devices are implanted into B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 14 of 48the vitreous cavity with a simple surgical procedure performed under local anesthetic. These devices consist of 
a sealed semipermeable hollow fiber membrane (H FM) capsule surrounding a scaffold of 6 strands of 
polyethylene terephthalate yarn, which have been loaded with CNTF-secreting NTC-201.6A cells.
Safety data from approximately 250 participants implan ted with the NT-501 device (nominal dose 20 ng/24 
hours) suggest that adverse events (AEs ) are generally limited to those r elated to the implant procedure. A 
number of participants have reported miosis, which is believed to be directly related to CNTF. During early 
development, a number of participants developed inf lammation following implantation. This was subsequently 
related to impurities in the membrane . Trace to mild inflammation is seen postoperatively in a minority of 
participants and typically clears by 3 months. In the Phase 2 study, one episode of delayed inflammation (grade 
3) was noted at 6 months and resolved by 12 months.Studies of NT-501 in RP and AMD did not demonstrate any potential benefit. However, in the NTMT-02 study 
of 67 participants (99 eyes randomized 1:1) with MacTel, the re was a statistically significant reduction in the 
rate of progression of MacTel in the eyes implanted with NT-501 as compared with the eyes that underwent the 
sham procedure. The mean (standard error [SE]) area of EZ break increased by 0.218 (0.049) mm
2in the 
implanted eyes and by 0.270 (0.050) mm2in the sham eyes. The difference between groups in the increase of 
the MacTel lesion (0.052 mm2) was statistically significant (p = 0.039, 1-sided). The mean change in retinal 
sensitivity as measured by microperime try was not different between the tr eated and sham eyes. However, when 
the aggregate retinal sensitivity (dB) was compared  with the corresponding area affected by MacTel, a 
difference between treated and sham eyes was detected. This difference was consistent with the slower growth of the MacTel lesion in the treated ey es. There was a significant difference between treatment groups in reading 
speed at 24 months (13.5 words read per minute, p = 0.016). Specifically, the implanted eyes had not deteriorated 
from baseline (0.03 words read per minute), but the sh am eyes showed impairment in reading speed relative to 
baseline (-13.5 words read per minute).  The mean (SE) macular thickness was significantly increased in the 
treated population when compared with the sham group (NT-501: +5.45 [3.02] μ; sham: -4.97 [2.85] μ;
p = 0.007). The mean (SE) pupil size was also significantly re duced in the implanted eyes as compared with the 
sham eyes (difference between groups: 0.922 [0.13] mm, p < 0.0001).
As of September 2019, a total of 64 participants (94 study ey es) were consented in the Phase 2 Extension Study, 
and of those, 92 study eyes had EZ break grading at 36 mo nths and 86 had EZ break grading at 48 months.  The 
mean (standard error [SE]) area of EZ break at 36 months was 0.149 (0.035) mm
2in the implanted eyes and 
0.241 (0.032) mm2in the sham eyes. The difference between groups in the increase of the MacTel lesion 
(0.092 mm2) was statistically significant (p = 0.022, 1-sided). The mean (standard error [SE]) area of EZ break 
at 48 months was 0.211 (0.059) mm2in the implanted eyes and 0.208 (0.056) mm2in the sham eyes. The 
difference between groups in the increase of the MacTel lesion (0.077 mm2) did not meet statistical significance
(p = 0.488, 1-sided). There was not a statistically signific ant difference between treatment groups in reading 
speed at 36 months (10.6 words read per minute, p = 0.093), or 48 months (5.4 words read per minute, 
p = 0.202). The mean (SE) pupil size for all NTMT-02 Extensi on Study participants was reduced in the 
implanted eyes as compared with the sham eyes at 36 months (difference between groups: 0.805 [0.14] mm, 
p < 0.0001) and 48 months (difference between groups: 0.844 [0.15] mm, p < 0.0001).
Consistent with the experience of the NT-501 device in  studies of RP and dry AMD, the device was generally 
well tolerated in the Phase 2 study. No participant had the implant removed during the course of the study. The 
AEs considered related to the device could be grouped into  those resulting from the procedure and those related 
to the parasympathetic agonistic effect of CNTF. On e participant (2 eyes) reported an ophthalmic serious 
adverse event (SAE) of an extended hospital stay (1 da y) because of blurred vision immediately following the 
procedure. This event resolved without sequelae.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

NTMT-03-B –NT-501 MacTel Phase 3 Study Confidential
Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 15 of 48In the current study, participants with a confirmed diagnosis of MacTel and an EZ break area of at least 
0.16 mm2and no greater than 2.00 mm2will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups: implantation of 
the NT-501 device or sham surgery with no implant. A single device will be inserted into the study eye for the 
24 to 48-month duration of the study.
The study will be conducted in full compliance with the pr inciples of the Declaration of Helsinki (as amended 
in Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), the gui delines set forth by the International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH), current Good Clinical Practice (G CP), and in compliance with local regulatory 
requirements and all of the applicable United States (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 21 CFR parts 50 
and 312.
1.2 STUDY RATIONALE
Historically, MacTel has been considered a vascular diso rder of the retina. This concept was largely based on 
clinical observation and limited histopat hology. With the initiation of a natu ral history study including over 700 
participants followed for more than 5 years, it has become  apparent that MacTel may, in fact, not be primarily a 
retinal vascular disease but, rather, one involving photoreceptor and glial cell abnormalities as well. The primary objectives of the MacTel natura l history study are to enroll partic ipants with MacTel and to document 
structural and functional changes over time using multiple real-time imaging modalities and functional 
assessments.
The most common group of patients with MacTel has leakag e that occurs during fluorescein angiography with 
manifest retinal capillary dilatation but without retinal th ickening. These individuals ty pically are diagnosed in 
their fifth or sixth decade of life, although it is likely that there are clinical manifestations of the disease at much 
earlier times that are not detected because the patients  remain asymptomatic. Both sexes are affected. This 
disorder is characterized by minimal exudation, superficial retinal crystalline deposits, retinal opacification, and 
right-angle venules. As the disease progresses, intr aretinal pigment plaques and SRNV may develop.
As noted previously, the natural histo ry study of MacTel has demonstrated that  photoreceptor loss is intrinsic to 
this disorder. Although antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy reduced the vascular permeability, it didnot influence the progression of photore ceptor cell loss or fu nctional loss. A mouse model in which the very 
low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) has been knocked out (ie, Vldlr
-/-mice) mimics many of the 
characteristics of the human disease, including focal disruption of photoreceptors coincident with the abnormal 
outer retinal-penetrating vessels13. The new vessels observed in the human disease and the Vldlr-/-mouse 
exhibit relatively mild permeability defects and are acco mpanied by glial activation and disruption of the RPE. 
Thus, in the absence of clinically significant leakage or hemorrhage, neuronal cell death due to increased 
oxidative stress caused by proximity to the a bnormal vessels is observed. Using the Vldlr-/-mouse model, it has 
been demonstrated that targeted delivery of a neurot rophic factor, neurotrophin-4, to sites of abnormal 
neovascularization significantly reduced photoreceptor de generation and protected against visual dysfunction,
even in the face of persistent microvascular abnormalities in these mice14.
Two postmortem donor eyes from elderl y individuals with MacTel were analyzed histopathologically and 
immunohistochemically15, 16. Both eyes had extensive disruption of foveal anatomy and substantial reduction in 
Müller glial cell marker expression, as well as many other neural and glial abnormalities. Based on this observation, a knockout mouse was evaluated, in wh ich Müller glial cells were depleted leading to 
photoreceptor apoptosis, vascular telangiectasis, bl ood-retinal barrier breakdown and, later, intraretinal 
neovascularization
17. In the mature retina, Müller glia are a major  source of CNTF. Intravitreal CNTF had no 
effect on wildtype retinas, but significantly reduced both the area of cone outer segment loss and the number of 
apoptotic cells in the ONL between 7 and 10 days afte r tamoxifen-induced Müller ce ll ablation in transgenic 
mice. Functional rescue after CNTF administration was not assessed in this study.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

NTMT-03-B –NT-501 MacTel Phase 3 Study Confidential
Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 16 of 48Imaging using SD-OCT has recently demonstrated a ne urodegenerative process in MacTel, with photoreceptor 
damage mapped to loss of vision. Similarly, adaptive  optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) reveals 
unique dark regions in the cone mosaic and decreased c one density associated with decreased vision, even in 
areas with normal vasculature, which suggests that this  feature represents early neuronal changes involved in 
the pathogenesis of MacTel18. These studies, taken together with th e clinical observations of MacTel, support 
the concept that delivery of neurotrophic molecules, such  as CNTF, may prevent photoreceptor degeneration in 
diseases with outer retinal vascular  abnormalities such as MacTel. Thus, we  believe we have an established 
rationale for using CNTF delivered by NT-501 to treat MacTel.
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics
CNTF is not detectable in the serum of participants with an intravitreal NT -501 device in situ. Pharmacokinetic 
sampling of the vitreous is invasive and potentially harmful to participants.
1.2.2 Preclinical Pharmacology
The half-life of CNTF is extremel y short and is measured in minutes19.
1.2.3 Potential for Drug-Drug Interactions
None.
1.2.4 Clinical Adverse Event Profile
Most AEs in the clinical studies of NT-501 have been re lated to the implantation procedure and were generally 
mild and well tolerated. The majority of these events  resolve within a few days. A small proportion of 
participants have reported miosis. No discontinuations due  to this event have been reported in the MacTel 
clinical studies.
1.2.5 Elevations in Liver Function Tests
No changes in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminot ransferase, or serum bilirubin were seen in early 
studies of NT-501 in RP or atrophic AMD.
1.2.6 Potential Risk of Testicular Injury
There is no evidence from previous clinical trials or from preclinical toxicology studies to suggest a risk of 
testicular injury.
1.2.7 Potential Risk to Fetal Development
No embryo-fetal/teratogenicity studies have been conducted for the development of NT-501. Studies to support the systemic use of human CNTF from the treatment of am yotrophic lateral sclerosis were performed in rats and 
rabbits (Syntex Discovery Research, Palo Alto, USA). At doses up to 300 μg/kg/day , no effects were seen on 
fertility in male and female rats. At doses up to 1000 μg/kg/day in rats and 10 μg/kg/day in rabbits , there was no 
evidence of fetal abnormality. The risk of these events in this trial is considered to be low given the fact that the 
CNTF produced by the NTC-201-6A cell line is of human origin. There is no detectable CNTF in patient 
plasma. CNTF has been extensively studied in animal and human neurological models and is considered a 
neuroprotectant.
1.2.8 Dosing Regimen
A single device is implanted once and remains in situ for the duration of the study. Only one configuration of the NT-501 device will be used in this study that  delivers a nominal dose of CNTF 20 ng/device/day.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

4. STUDY PLAN
4.1 STUDY DESIGN
This is a Phase 3, prospective, multicenter, mask ed, sham-controlled study of approximately 112 study 
participants with MacTel. 
All participants are to be followed through the 24-Month Vis it, where 1 month is define d as 30 days. Originally 
the subset of participants enrolled early into the study were to be followed through a 36-Month Visit and/or a

Page 18 of 48visits does not provide sufficient statistical power to demonstrate a treatment effect for these secondary 
endpoints. The Sponsor decision to terminate this study earl y is not related to any safety or any adverse event 
related to the study treatment or surgical procedures related to the implantation.
With the current protocol amendment, the changes to  the study visit schedule include the following:   
(1) Subjects who will complete the Month-24 visit after 01 December 2021 will not complete their scheduled 
Month-36 and/or their Month-48 study visits. These study participants will exit the study when they complete 
the Month-24 visit.  
(2) Subjects who have completed the Month-24 visit a nd have Month 36 and/or Month 48 visits scheduled 
before or on 01 December 2021 will exit from th e study after completing these scheduled visits. 
(3) Subjects who have completed the Month-24 visit and ha ve Month 36 and/or Month 48 visits scheduled after 
01 December 2021 will not complete these visits but will  complete a safety check-in call and exit the study by 
01 December 2021.
With the current study design, all participants will have a sc reening period of up to 30 days. During that time, a 
single baseline image of the EZ lesion will be taken to establish eligibilit y and the study baseline. The EZ line 
break area for eligibility will be determined by the reading center. Images will be reviewed for quality and may 
be repeated if necessary and obtained within the scr eening period (30 days). Two independent masked readers 
will determine lesion area from a single acceptable image . If the 2 estimates of area are within 10% and at least 
1 measure is ≥0.16 and ≤2.0 mm2, the MacTel lesion will be deemed eligib le. If the 2 readings differ by more 
than 10%, an arbitrating reader will estimate the area. If the third reading is within 10% of either of the first 2 
estimates, then the third and selected primary readings will be used to establish eligibility. Baseline EZ area will 
be the mean of the 2 qualifying estimates.The implant surgery/sham procedure in the study eye should be completed within 30 days of randomization 
and/or up to 58 days from screening. Only 1 study-elig ible eye of each participant will be designated as the 
study eye. Participants will be ra ndomized (1:1) to receive the NT-501 implant or to undergo the sham 
procedure in the study-eligible eye. The implant surgery/sham procedure will occur on Day 0. Participants will 
be assessed on Day 1, Week 1 (± 2 days), Month 1 (± 7 days), Month 3 (± 14 days), Month 6 (± 30 days), Month 12 (± 30 days), Month 16 (± 30 days), Month 20 (± 30 days), and Month 24 (± 30 days). Note that, in regions other than France, a telephone contact will be made at Month 1 (± 7 days) and Month 3 (± 14 days)
instead of a clinic visit. A subset of participants, based on the date of the surgical procedure, will be assessed at 
Month 36 (± 30 days and Month 48 (± 30 days). Upon completion of the 24, 36, or 48-month observation, all participants will be followed for sa fety and disease progression in a nested substudy of the existing Natural 
History and Observation and Registry St udy of Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 (NHOR)
20.
4.1.1 Efficacy Variables
The efficacy variables in this study include EZ area  (ie, area of IS/OS loss) measured by SD-OCT, retinal 
sensitivity measured by Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA) microperimetry, reading speed using the International Reading Speed Texts (IReST) Worksheets developed by the IReST Study Group 
21, and 
participant responses to the NEI-VFQ-25.
4.1.2 Safety Variables 
Safety will be evaluated by monitoring AEs and SAEs, re sults of ophthalmic examinations (including slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy and dilated fundus parameters, as well as  measurements of BCVA and intraocular pressure

The incidence of reported AEs will be compared between  the treated and sham participants, particularly with 
respect to ocular AEs. An attempt will be made to differentiate between tr eatment-related AEs and AEs 
considered to be part of the normal progression of th e disease. In addition, for tr eatment-related AEs, an attempt 
will be made to differentiate those that the investigator b elieves are due to the device itself, to CNTF, or to the
implant/sham procedure.
4.1.3 Study Schematic
* The implant surgery/sham procedure in the study eye should be completed within 4 weeks of randomization and/or up to 58 days fr om screening.
** In regions other than France, a telephone  contact will be made at Month 1 (± 1 we ek) and Month 3 (± 2 weeks). In France, at these time points, participants will be 
assessed at clinic visits.
***A subset of participants, based on the date of the surgical procedur e, will be assessed at Month 36 (± 4 weeks) and Month 48  (± 4 weeks).

5.4 PARTICIPANT SCREENING
Potential participants will be consented prior to init iation of any screening procedures. All screening procedures 
may be completed in 1 visit or may take place on more  than 1 day if convenient for the participant or clinical 
site. All screening procedures should be completed within 30 days.
5.5 DEVIATION FROM INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA
No deviations from the stated inclusi on/exclusion criteria will be allowed.
5.6 MASKING 
There are different levels of masking within the st udy. The participant is masked to treatment assignment 
throughout the study. The refractionist, visual acuity examiner, and photographers/imagers must be masked to 
treatment assignment (implant or sham procedure) for all follow-up vi sits. The ophthalmologist, surgeon, and 
clinic coordinator will be unmasked to treatment assignment. To ensure th at the participant remains masked to 
the randomized assignment, the ophthalmologist, surgeon, and clinic coordinator are to not discuss the 
treatment received with the participant. All personnel at the image reading center  will be masked to whether the 
participant received the implant or sham in the study eye.
6. STUDY CONDUCT
All participants will have a screening period of up to 30 days. The implant surgery/sham procedure in the study 
eye should be completed within 30 days of randomization and/or up to 58 days from screening. Only 1 study-
eligible eye per participant will be allowed in this study. Participants with 1 study eye that meets the inclusion 
criteria will be randomized (1:1) to receive the NT-501 im plant or sham procedure in the study-eligible eye. If 
both eyes qualify for the study, the study eye will be c hosen as part of the centralized randomization process.
The eye will be deemed eligible only after the re ading center has reviewed all baseline images.
6.1 STUDY PROCEDURES BY TIME POINT
Study eyes will receive the NT-501 implant or undergo the sham procedure on Day 0 and will be assessed on 
Day 1, Week 1 (± 2 days), Month 1 (± 7 days), Month 3 (±14 days), Month 6 (± 30 days), Month 12 (± 30 days), Month 16 (± 30 days), Month 20 (± 30 days), and Month 24 (± 30 days). Note that, in regions other than France, a telephone contact will be made at Month 1 (± 7 days) and Month 3 (± 7 days) instead of a clinic visit. A subset of participants, based on the date of their surgical procedure, will be assessed at Month 36 (± 30 days)and Month 48 (± 30 days). Participants who will reach the Month 36 and/or Month 48 timepoint will be required 
to provide informed consent at the start of their next visit. At baseline, SD-OCT and fluorescein angiography will 
be performed to confirm diagnosis and to exclude SRNV . Participants will be followed at regular intervals in 
the first and second years of follow-up, where 1 month is defined as 30 days. All SD-OCT, microperimetry, fluorescein angiogram, autofluorescen ce and fundus photographic images will be read centrally at the reading 
center by masked, trained readers.
Beginning in February 2020 in European and Australian sites and March 2020 in U.S. sites, planned assessment 
visits were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  To  account for such delays, sites were instructed to 
perform the assessments at the earliest  availability following the scheduled timepoint.  For visits impacted by 
COVID-19, the acceptable time windows we re adjusted for select visits as follows: Month 12 (-30 days / +119 
days), Month 16 (+119 days), Month 20 (+119 days), Month 24 (+119 days).B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 23 of 487.2 STUDY VISIT PROCEDURES
7.2.1 Screening/Baseline Procedures (Visit -1)
Screening procedures may be completed over more than 1 visit to accommodate schedules and to lessen 
participant burden. All screening evaluations should be complet ed within 30 days of the initial screening visit in 
order to be used to establish eligibility.
In the event that a participant is rescreened and the resc reening occurs within 6 months of the initial screening, 
fluorescein angiography, fundus autofluorescence imaging, and color fundus photography will not be repeated; 
the participant’s initial screening re sults for each of these assessments will be used as their baseline.
Once the individual has indicated interest in particip ation, the principal investigator or appropriate designee
must obtain the participant ’s written consent. Once the consent is obtained, the participant may initiate 
screening assessments. The results of all screening ev aluations must be reviewed and the participant must be 
found eligible prior to randomization. Once a participant is determined to be eligible for the study, surgery 
should be completed within 4 weeks of rando mization and/or up to 58 days from screening.
The screening examinations and imaging must include the following:
xMedical evaluation, standard for any surgical procedure or anesthesia (the specific tests to be ordered 
will be site-specific), may be performed on the day of surgery
xDemographics; medical and ophthalmic history
xConcomitant medications
xNEI-VFQ-25

If the participant meets all study criteria, including thos e determined by the reading center, and continues to 
agree to participate in the study, then the implant surgery/sham procedure date may be confirmed. The implant 
surgery/sham procedure in the study eye should be completed within 30 days of randomization and/or up to 
58 days from screening. The study ’s electronic data capture (EDC) system will assign the randomization 
assignment. The participant study ey e will be randomized using the ED C system prior to the implant 
surgery/sham procedure. The study eye will be rando mized (1:1) to receive the NT-501 implant or to undergo 
the sham procedure. Only 1 eye per participant will be ra ndomized. If both eyes qualify for the study, the study 
eye will be selected using the centralized randomization process.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
8.1 DESCRIPTION
8.1.1 Formulation
The study device is the NT-501 implant, NT501.6A.02 encapsulated cell therapy (ECT), delivering a nominal 
CNTF dose of 20 ng/device/day.
8.1.2 Storage
Storage of the shipping container is at room temperat ure, which is not to exceed 55°C (131°F) or fall below 
−20°C (− 4°F) and must be used within the “use by ”date. Storage of the box at temperatures outside this range 
could result in the internal temper ature of the box and the implant exceeding the allowable range of 16°Ct o  
37°C. If a planned implant surgical procedure is delayed such that the shipped investigational product will be in 
the shipping container for a period beyond the identified “use by ”date, then Neurotech Pharmaceuticals Inc.
must be notified and an alternate/rep lacement shipment will be provided.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 29 of 488.2 PACKAGING AND SHIPMENT
The NT-501 device is contained with in the primary packaging, which is comprised of a sealed clear plastic 
container that contains the transport medium. The NT-501 device is suspended within the transport medium by 
a titanium clamp which, in turn, is held in position by a luer  cap that is twisted onto the flange of the primary 
packaging. The inner surfaces of the primary packag ing, the transport medium, and all other component 
surfaces are sterile. In addition, as long as the secondary  packaging remains sealed, the exterior of the primary 
packaging within the secondary packaging is maintain ed sterile. Product labeling is located on the exterior, 
nonsterile side of the secondary packaging seal. This c ontainer is protected in an insulated transport carton.
8.3 DOSE AND ADMINISTRATION
The study device is the NT-501 implant, NT501.6A.02 ECT (delivering a nominal CNTF dose of 
20 ng/device/day), which will be implanted per randomizati on and will remain in situ for the duration of the 
study. There are no plans to remove the device, except in  the case of participant intolerance or complications 
such as infection or inflammation.
8.4 ACCOUNTABILITY
All investigational product and suppli es provided by the sponsor and used during this study must be maintained 
in a secure location. The investigator has overall re sponsibility for ensuring that the investigational product is 
stored in a safe, limited-access location under the specified appropriate storage conditions. Limited 
responsibility may be delegated to an unmasked nominated representative, but this delegation must be documented.
The investigator agrees not to supply any NT-501 devi ce to any person not enrolled in this study or to any 
person not delegated to perform investigational product handling.
The investigator/recipient will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, indicating shipment content 
and condition. A record of the TempTale®readings must be kept for each shipment. Damaged supplies will be 
reported to the sponsor. Accurate records will be ke pt for all investigational products supplied and received. The 
date of implantation will be recorded.Investigational product will not be returned to the sponsor except in an instance of device inspection failure 
where the sponsor requests that the failed device or a portion thereof should be returned for investigation.
All investigational product not implante d per protocol into enrolled study participants must be destroyed on site 
as dictated by the appropriate biohazardous was te standard operating or study specific procedure at the 
participating institution (if appropriate). Investigational p roducts should only be destroyed after investigational 
product accountability has been performed and all investig ational products are accounted for. Duplicate devices 
provided at the time of surgery that are not required for implantation should be marked in large letters “NOT 
FOR HUMAN USE ”following successful implantation of the origin al device until the time of destruction.
9. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS
Any concomitant medications a participant is receiving at the start of the study or given for any reason during 
the study (except for routine medications given for ocular  procedures required by the protocol, such as a topical 
anesthetic), including over the count er, supplements and herbal formulas , must be recorded in the source 
document, including start and stop dates, dosing, route of  administration, and indic ation information. Recording 
of concomitant medications on the case report forms (CRF s) must be done according to the instructions B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

surgery and procedures) must also be recorded in the source document, including start and stop dates. 
Recording of procedures on the CRFs must be done acc ording to the instructions provided in the study 
regulatory binder.
9.1 PROHIBITED CONCOMITANT THERAPY
Ocular administration of subconjunctival or intravit real antibiotics is proh ibited unless treating a 
sight-threatening condition. The ocular administration of gentamicin or other aminoglyc osides topically, peri-
ocularly, or by injection is prohibited unless trea ting a sight-threatening condition for which no other 
alternatives are appropriate. Systemic administration of aminoglycosides should also be avoided. 
Aminoglycosides are known to be toxic to RPE cells a nd ocular administration could harm the cells in the NT-
501 device.
10. ADVERSE EVENTS
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in humans,  whether or not considered  treatment- or procedure-
related, which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in clinical status, ophthalmological 
assessments, etc., that is considered clinically significant by the study investigator an d requires intervention is 
considered an AE. Medical conditions or diseases pr esent before a participant starts study treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after the participant starts study treatment (temporal association).
A suspected adverse reaction (related AE) is any event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
treatment caused the AE. A reasonable pos sibility implies that there is evid ence that the treatment caused the 
event.
10.1 DOCUMENTING ADVERSE EVENTS
All AEs, either observed by the investigator or their medical collaborators, or reported by the participant
spontaneously, or in response to direct questioning, will  be reported. Any AE regardless of severity or potential 
association with the NT-501 device, CNTF, or the study procedures must be documented in study records by 
the investigator and appropriately reported.All AEs will be reported within the participant ’s records and in the EDC system. All AEs should be entered into 
the data system as soon as possible after identification by the site personnel. All AEs will be recorded from the 
time of surgery until the last study visit.
10.2 ASSESSMENT OF INTENSITY
Guidelines for Assessing Intensity of an Adverse EventThe investigator should use the following defi nitions when assessing intensity of an AE:
xMILD: Transient (< 48 hours) or mild discomforts, no or  minimal medical therapy or intervention required, 
hospitalization not necessary, no or little limitation in normal activities
xMODERATE: Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some  assistance may be needed; possibly none but 
usually minimal intervention/therapy required; hospitalization possible
xSEVERE: Marked limitation in activity, some assistan ce usually required; medical intervention/therapy 
required; hospitalizati on possible or likelyB1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

xFATAL: Death
10.3 ASSESSMENT OF CAUSALITY
Guidelines for Determining Causality of an Adverse Event
The investigator will answer the following question wh en assessing causality of an AE to study treatment: “Is 
there a reasonable possibility th at the treatment caused the event? ”A reasonable possibility implies there is 
evidence that the specific event was caused by the study tr eatment. An affirmative answer designates the event 
as a suspected adverse reaction, and the AE is therefore considered “ related. ”If the answer is no, then the AE is 
considered “unrelated. ”For every related AE, the investigator will determine the causality in relation to the 
surgical procedure, to the device itself, and to CNTF.Regarding relatedness of AEs, there are 3 possibilities. These include the following:
xRelated to surgical procedure:
Ocular events that occur immediately following the surgica l procedure or later if they are directly related to 
the procedure
xRelated to the device itself:
These would include malposition of the device with impingement of the participant’s visual field, 
inflammation of the vitreous, or visible deteriorati on of the device on inspection via the ophthalmoscope
xRelated to CNTF:
The known events related to CNTF release in the eye are clearly listed in the reference safety information of 
the investigator’s brochure
10.4 ADVERSE EVENT FOLLOW-UP
Until the participant reaches the final scheduled follow-up visit, any new AEs, as well as follow-up information 
for ongoing AEs, must be recorded. For participants w ho withdraw prematurely, AEs should be followed until 
30 days after last study visit. 
10.5 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE. A confirmed pregnancy in a participant (by urine or blood 
test) should be reported to the CRO as soon as the investigator has been made aware of the pregnancy. The decision on whether to remove the implant and withdraw the participant from the study will be made by the investigator and the participant following consultation with the sponsor. The investigator  will use his/her expert 
judgment, based on an assessment of the potential benefit/risk  to the participant, to determine if it is in the 
participant’ s best interest to continue participation in the study.
A pregnancy in the partner of a participant should also be reported to the investigator who will in turn notify the 
CRO as soon as possible.
The pregnancy should be followed until birth. The ou tcome of all such pregnancies (ie, spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or c ongenital abnormality) must be documented and followed-B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

including any premature termination, must  be reported to the CRO. All liv e births must be followed for a 
minimum of 30 days or to the first well-baby visit. All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous abortions/miscarriages should be reported as an SAE for this study. Elective abortion procedures, without complications, should not be considered as AEs.
11. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
11.1 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:
xDeath
xLife-threatening
xInpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
xPersistent or significant disability/incapacity
xCongenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received NT-501
xOther: Important medical events that may not result in  death, be life-threateni ng, or require hospitalization, 
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropri ate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: An AE is life-threatening if the participan t is at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred; ie, it does not include a r eaction that if it had occu rred in a more serious form might have caused 
death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolv ed without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal.
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization for elective surgery 
or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of  an AE (eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition 
that has not worsened) need not be reported as AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the
procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either serious or nonserious  according to the usual 
criteria.In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an 
overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for obser vation and/or treatment th at would not have been 
appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitalization’ 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.
Disability/incapacity: An AE is disa bling or incapacitating if the experien ce results in a substantial and/or 
permanent disruption of the participant’s ability to carry out normal life functions.
11.2 REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS
The investigators will report data on all SAEs within 24 hours of site awareness of the event. If there are 
technical difficulties when entering the event into the EDC system, the SAE will be reported to the contract B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 33 of 48research organization (CRO) via fax communication or sa fety group email; the fax numbers and email address 
will be provided in the regulatory binder. All informati on reported by fax or email will need to be entered in the 
data system when it is available. All SAEs should be  reported to local IRBs/independent ethics committees 
(IECs) per local IRB/IEC requirements.
The medical monitor will review each SAE report and w ill determine whether the SAE must be reported to the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/regulatory authorities on an expedited basis. The final decision for 
disposition regarding reporting to the FDA and other regu latory authorities rests with the sponsor or their 
designee. The IND sponsor or their designee is res ponsible for submitting the SAE reports to FDA/regulatory 
authorities. The sponsor will ensure that the data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC; see Section 14.3)
receives any safety report submitted to FDA/regulator y authorities. The CRO will maintain copies of any SAE 
reports submitted to FDA/regulatory authorities by the sponsor.
The CRO will provide expedited reports to the principal inve stigator at each individu al site to submit to their 
respective IRB/IEC. Events that are serious, related to therapy, and unexpected (serious unexpected suspected 
adverse reaction [SUSAR]) will be reported to FDA/regul atory authorities within 15 days or within 7 days for 
deaths and for events deemed life-threaten ing by the investig ator (per 21 CFR 312.32).
All SAEs will be followed until resolution or until stabilit y is reached. In rare instances, this may include 
following the participant after completion of the study. Ever y attempt must be made by the investigator to 
follow SAEs that are not resolved or med ically stable within 30 days of the last study visit until they become 
resolved or medically stable.
11.3 NOTIFYING FDA/REGULATORY AUTHORITIES
After the SAE has been reported by the principal investigator and assessed by the IND sponsor, the IND 
sponsor or their designee must report the event to the appropriate regulatory authorities using 1 of these 2
options:
xStandard reporting (report in the annual report). This opt ion applies if the AE is classified as one of the 
following:
Serious, expected, suspected adverse re action (serious, expected, and related)
Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction (serious and not related)
xExpedited reporting. This option applies if the AE is classified as SUSAR (serious, unexpected, and 
related).
The sponsor must report an AE as a suspected adverse reaction (related AE) only if there is evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE, such as:
xA single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with study treatment
xOne or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with study treatment, but is otherwise 
uncommon in the population expos ed to the study treatment
xAggregate analysis of specific SAEs observed in a cli nical trial (such as known consequences of the 
underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonl y occur in the study 
population independent of study treatment) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the studytreatment group than in a concurrent or historical control groupB1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

aspects of the overall conduct of the trial
11.4 REPORTING SAES TO THE DSMC
The CRO will provide the DSMC with the data for all SAEs on an ongoing basis as described in the charter.
The investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of all AE information, including expedited reports and 
DSMC safety reviews, to the IRB and IEC in accordance with applicable local regulations and guidelines.
12. STATISTICS
12.1 GENERAL PROCEDURES
This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NT-501 comp ared with the sham procedure for the 
treatment of MacTel.
One eligible study eye from each participant wil l be randomized in a 1:1 ratio as follows:
xSurgery to receive 1 NT-501 device implant deliv ering a nominal CNTF dose of 20 ng/device/day
xSham surgery
Randomization: Two treatment assignments with a 1:  1 (NT-501 surgery: sham procedure) allocation scheme 
for each of the 2 protocols (Protocol A and Protoc ol B). The actual treatment assignment (NT-501 surgery or 
sham procedure) will be shown within Advantage eCli nical. Randomization is unrestricted. One randomization 
list per protocol will be generated. There wi ll be no stratification for prognostic factors.
The biostatistician will prepare detailed statistical procedur es, listings, table shells and figures in a separate 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The following key components will be considered, and a detailed description 
will be documented in the SAP:
xDescriptions of primary and secondary endpoints and how they will be measured
xStatistical methods and any applicable alternative met hods (eg, model nonconvergence) used to analyze the 
endpoints
xJustifications for sample size calculations
xMultiple testing approaches
xApproaches to account for missing data
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as ag reed with the sponsor acco rding to the SAP. Any 
additional or supplemental data analyses performed independ ently by an investigator shall be submitted to the 
sponsor for review.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 35 of 48Analysis Populations:
The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population will  consist of all randomized participants who received 
surgery (NT-501 or sham surgery), all of whom will be  analyzed in the treatment group to which they were 
assigned regardless of complian ce or other protocol deviations.
The per-protocol (PP) population will be a subset of the mITT population and will include all available data 
from participants who follow the protocol without maj or protocol deviation. The PP population will be used for 
analyses of primary and key secondary efficacy variables. Participants will be analyzed according to the randomized treatment. The de termination of all protocol violations a nd any data excluded from the efficacy 
analysis will be made prior to locking the final database.
The safety population will include th e data from all randomized participants who receive any treatment and 
have at least 1 safety measuremen t. Participants will be analyzed in the group according to the treatment 
received, and no subjects (or data) will be excluded from this dataset because of protocol violations that occur 
during the study.The efficacy analysis will be conducted on the mITT popu lation and on the PP population. Safety analyses will 
be performed using the safety population. The handling of pa rticipants with missed visits or visits occurring 
outside the specified windows will be considered in the SAP.If both eyes of a participant qualify for the study, the study eye will be selected using the centralized 
randomization process.Continuous variables will be summarized using descri ptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, 
minimum, and maximum), and categorical variables will be  summarized using the count and percentage of 
participants in each category.Significance Level:
A significance level, α, of 0.05 will be used for statistical testin g of the primary and secondary endpoints.
A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied to secondary efficacy analyses to control the overall type I error rate. In 
the case that the primary efficacy analysis is statistically signif icant at a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, the secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be tested at a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05 in the order listed belo w.  If any of the secondary 
endpoints are found to be not statistically significant at the 2- sided 0.05 level, the hypothes is testing will stop.  Later 
endpoint(s) after a non-statistically significant result will be summarized descriptively and p-va lues may be produced for 
descriptive purposes only.

Accounting for Missing Data:
Every attempt will be made to collect data per the protocol and to avoid missing data. As such, dropouts and 
missing data are expected to be minimal, but can inev itably occur. For cases with unavoidable missing data, no 
imputation will occur.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 36 of 48As the efficacy endpoints in this study are longitudina l, measured over the course of multiple observations over 
time, the minimum requirement for co mpletion of the study is to have measurements at Baseline and Month 24, 
plus at least one interim visit for the primary eff icacy endpoint. Imputation methods may be implemented for 
sensitivity assessments of primary and secondary efficacy  analyses should the dropout rate and proportion of 
missing values be higher than expected or should there be  missing data due to an identifiable cause unrelated to 
study procedures or treat ments (e.g. delayed visits due to COVID-19).
Covariates and Subgroups:
There are no plans to adjust the primary efficacy anal ysis for baseline characteristics and disease status. 
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the potential contribution of a number of baseline disease 
characteristics as well as study site on the likelihood of a response to treatment.Exploratory analyses will be performed to  assess the potential im pact of various prognost ic factors on efficacy. 
Appropriate statistical models will be fit with these factor s as covariates and the effect of treatment will be 
assessed after adjusting for other signif icant risk factors. Risk factors will include, but are not limited to age, 
race, sex, and baseline EZ area.
12.2 SAMPLE SIZE
Sample size calculation is based on the comparison of the 2 groups over 24 months incorporating a longitudinal
mixed effects model. The number of participants, N, in each of the 2 groups
22is calculated as follows: We 
assume that, in the NT-501 group, the respons e of change in EZ area is as follows:
ܻ௜௝=ߚ଴ே்ିହ଴ଵ +ߚଵே்ିହ଴ଵݔ௜௝+ߝ௜௝,݆=1 ,…,݊;݅=1 ,…,݉
For the sham group the sham equation holds as follows:

Both groups have the same number of participants (m), ݔ௜௝=ݔ௝represents the duration between the first and

respectively, and each person is measured at the same time points, and each participant has n repeated 
observations of EZ area at baseline, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months  (where months will be converted to years).
The number of participants, m, in each of the 2 groups 22is calculated as follows:
݉=2൫ݖఈ+ݖఉ൯ଶߪଶ(1−ߩ)

where ݀=ߚଵௌ௛௔௠−ߚଵே்ିହ଴ଵ andݏ௫ଶis the within-subject variance of ݔ௝.
Using the above equation with a Type 1 error rate of 0.05 (2-sided); ߪଶ= 0.0256; ߩ =0.6; ݏ௫ଶ= 0.47 and n = 5 
(baseline and 12, 16, 20 and 24 months) we have 80% power with a sample size of 50 participants per treatment 
group to detect a difference in rate of change 0.037 mm2/year in the EZ area in the NT-501 group versus the 
sham group. The sample size will be increased to 56 participants per treatment group (112 total participants) to 
provide adequate power in the analysis of the population evaluable for efficacy.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 37 of 48The statistical model will be a random intercept model as follows:
ܻ௜௝=(ߚ଴+ܾ଴)+ߚଵ∗ܴܶܶ+ ߚଶ∗ܧܯܫܶ+ ߚଷ∗ܴܶܶ∗ܧܯܫܶ+ ߝ௜௝
where Y ijis the efficacy endpoint (EZ ar ea) measurement for participant i= 1,2, …, n at time point j= 1, …, K. 
TRT is an indicator of the participant i’s treatment group (ie, TRT = 1 for NT-501; TRT = 0 for sham) and 
TIME is the annualized time. To compare the rate of change from baseline in EZ area between the 2 treatment 
groups the primary hypothesis is as follows:
ܪ௢:ߚଷ=0ܪݏݑݏݎ݁ݒ ଵ:ߚଷ≠0
12.3 STATISTICAL METHODS
12.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary hypothesis is that NT-501 will slow the r ate of change in the EZ (IS/OS) area loss. The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the mITT popu lation (main analysis) but restricted to only those 
participants with at least 3 visits recorded. Baseli ne, Month 24, and at least one of Month 12, 16, or 20. A
similar analysis will also be conducted with the PP Population.
The primary efficacy variable will be the rate of change that will be determined by using values from the EZ 
area as measured by SD-OCT. EZ area will be defined as the mean of 2 independent  readings of the single 
eligible SD-OCT enface image taken at baseline and Months 12, 16, 20, and 24. A longitudinal mixed model 
will include EZ area as the dependent variable, a random  intercept term to account for  within subject variability, 
treatment group, time as a continuous variable, and the interaction between treatmen t and time.  Time will be 
captured as the relative study day (defined as days si nce date of surgery) of the respective efficacy assessment 
and will include the days corresponding to the Baseli ne, Month 12, 16, 20, and 24 visits. The difference in the 
rate of change in EZ area over 24 months (to be co mputed by including baseline and Months 12, 16, 20, and 24 
EZ measurements will be compared us ing a random intercept model a nd the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval (CI), SE, test statistic, and p-value of the diff erence between treatment group parameters by computing 
the parameter estimate for the treatment by time interaction term. An Unstructur ed covariance structure will be 
implemented as with continuous time there will be a single parameter each for between and within participant 
variability.
12.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the mITT population and the PP population to test forsuperiority of NT-501 over sham. The secondary endpoints are listed below:
xMean change in aggregate sensitivity of microperimetry within the EZ line break area through 24 months
xMean change in reading speed from baseline through 24 months
xMean change in the NEI-VFQ-25 near activities subscale score from baseline through 24 months
Continuous secondary outcomes will be analyzed us ing a longitudinal mixed effects model and the 
corresponding 95% CI, SE, test statistic, and p-value of th e difference between treatment group means at the 24-
month time point will be computed. For the mixed effects model, fixed effects will include the treatment group 
(between-participant factor) and the visit (within-pa rticipant factor). The unstructured covariance matrix is
preferred for this analysis.  If the model does not converge, the “best”covariance structure will be chosen based 
on Akaike ’s Information Criteria

NTMT-03-B –NT-501 MacTel Phase 3 Study Confidential
Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 38 of 4812.3.3 Analysis of Safety
Safety analyses will be performed on all partici pants who underwent either implant surgery or the sham
procedure. The assessment of safety will be based on the summary of ocular and nonocular treatment-emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) and ophthalmic examinations. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
nomenclature will be used to code AEs.
The TEAEs will be presented by treatment group (NT-501 versus sham). Summaries for TEAEs include the 
following: all TEAEs regardless of causality, treatment-related TEAEs, ocular TEAEs, treatment-related ocular TEAEs, TEAEs by intensity, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.
The number and proportion of participants with a loss in BCVA of 15 or more letters from baseline in the study 
eye will be tabulated and presented by treatment group.
Detailed methods for the analysis of all endpoints will be outlined in the SAP.
12.3.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Participant demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT analysis population. The 
comparability of groups used in comparison analyses will be characterized in tables of demographic data. Summary tables will be supported with individual participant data listings.
12.4 INTERIM ANALYSIS
No interim analysis for efficacy is planned for this study.
Prior to the completion of th e study and database lock, summaries of the distribution of timing of efficacy visits 
(excluding any efficacy variables themselves) will be compared between treatment arms to d etermine if the pattern of visit 
attendance is comparable between treatment arms.  
In addition, masked summaries of the overall results will be analyzed to determine appropriate parameterization of time as 
a continuous or categorical variable for the primary efficacy analysis.  The determinatio n of non-linearity will be 
concluded if the observed pattern of EZ area loss response over time follows a distinctly non-linear trend.  Assessment 
will be made through an overall linear regression goodness-o f-fit analysis, including review of a residual plot from a 
simple linear regression.
The analysis will be limited in scope and will not reveal unmasked results.  No type I error adjustment will be made.
13. STUDY RISKS
Studies of intravitreal CNTF delivered by ECT have be en performed in human participants with RP, atrophic 
AMD, and MacTel. A total of 180 human participants have  been exposed to the 20 ng/day dose in randomized 
clinical studies. This is the same dose that will be tes ted in the proposed Phase 3 trial. A further 59 participants 
were exposed to a lower dose and in this group, miosis  and change in dark adaptation were not reported.
Miosis: In the controlled clinical studies of AMD, RP, and MacTel (Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies), 40 of 180 
(22.2%) participants reported miosis as an AE. These ev ents were reported by participants. The prevalence of 
these findings was confirmed by the DSMC in their review of the data. The DSMC in their review of these data 
confirmed that the potential benefit out weighed the risk of this event.
The intracellular mechanisms through which the trophic factor CNTF regulates cholinergic development were 
examined in sympathetic neuron cultures 24. Treatment with CNTF increased lev els of choline acetyltransferase 
activity significantly, thus confirming the parasy mpathetic agonist effect of CNTF. Stimulation of the 
parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) results in constriction of the pupillary mu scles. Constriction of the B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 39 of 48pupil occurs when the circular muscle, controlled by the PSNS,  contracts. This is the most likely mechanism for 
CNTF causing miosis. At lower doses in the Phase 2 studies of RP, this effect was not observed.
In addition, in the Phase 2 study of MacTel, pupil size was measured routinely throughout the duration of the 
study in all participants. The majority of eyes that received  the implant had a reduction in the size of the pupil of 
approximately 1 mm. This effect was not seen in sham eyes but was present in over 90% of all treated eyes. The 
reason that only approximately 20% of the participants comp lained about the miosis is possibly related to the 
lack of any clinical symptoms and of noticeable effect fo r the participants. Certainly, no participant asked to 
have the device removed as a result of  noting this well-described drug effect.
Delayed Dark Adaptation: This AE has only been reported in study participants with MacTel with 11 cases 
out of the 55 (22%) implanted eyes in the Phase 1 and 2 studies. In the studies of participants with RP and 
atrophic AMD, this AE was not reported. The cause of the delayed dark adaptation is not well understood, but a 
plausible explanation is that it is related to either miosis and/or the observed effect on photoreceptors following 
treatment with CNTF 10. CNTF treatment results in a change in rod photoreceptor nucleus phenotype, featuring 
an increase in euchromatin and an increase in nuclear  size. Chronic stimulation of retinal cells with CNTF has 
been shown to affect gene expression in photoreceptors including reduction of phototransduction genes such as 
rhodopsin in animal models25. As rod photoreceptors are more light sensitive than cone cells and are almost 
entirely responsible for night vision, it is possible that the CNTF-mediated changes in the rod photoreceptors 
may affect the partici pant’s ability to adapt to the dark. The reason why this AE is limited to a small 
subpopulation of the participants wi th MacTel is not well understood.
An increase in retinal thickness is observed in the majority of all eyes treated with CNTF at the dose proposed for study in Phase 3. Taken together, the preclinical data in dogs and the fact that macular thickening is seen only in the treated eyes, suggest that the AE of delayed  dark adaptation may well be a direct consequence of 
CNTF treatment.
There are risks associated with the diagnostic procedures required for participants in this study. However, these 
are standard procedures that are performed as part of a normal eye and medical examination. Some of the discomforts associated with the ocular  examination include the following:
xDilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can  cause an allergic reaction, or if contaminated, can 
cause an infection, but neither of th ese problems is very likely to occur.
xDilating drops can also cause a sudden increase of pre ssure (acute glaucoma) in eyes that are already 
predisposed to develop this condition. Th ere is little risk of glaucoma being triggered in this way, but if it is, 
treatment is available.
xIn rare instances, the cornea may be abraded during measurement of IOP or the use of a contact lens (used 
for examination purpose only and not a con tact lens used to correct a participants ’refractive error).
There are risks associated with the procedures required for participants in this study. The fluorescein angiogram 
requires injection of dye in the participant ’s arm. Local subcutaneous infilt ration of dye may create discomfort 
and temporary staining of the skin (< 5% risk). There is a chance of fainting, ecchymosis at the site of injection,
and a remote possibility of cellulitis from the needle tr ack. After the dye injection, some participants (< 5%) 
may experience nausea that usually passes after a few seconds, and rarely, participants vomit.
Allergic reactions to fluorescein are uncommon; reactions may cause hives and itching. These reactions are 
usually treated with oral or injectable antihistamines as needed. Anaphylaxis from fluorescein is extremely rare 
and may be life-threatening. Fluorescein dye routinely causes a yellowing/orange color to the skin and urine 
that generally passes in 24 hours.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 40 of 48Imaging using OCT is an FDA-approved techni que, which is not associated with any AEs.
Fundus photography and autofluorescence are not assoc iated with any AEs, although some participants may 
experience mild discomfort due to the bright lights.
There are also risks associated with the operations to implant and explant the device and with the sham 
procedure. In general, the risks of intraocular surgery ar e very small. Some side effects could occur locally in 
the eye and could affect the participant’ s vision. There may be pain or i nfection, a small amount of bleeding, 
miosis, retinal detachment, cataract, vitritis, and/or mild  astigmatism. In many cases, topical antibiotics and 
topical steroids can treat minor degrees of inflammation or infection. More serious infection or inflammation 
may require further surgery on the eye, likely with removal of the implant. The sham procedure of 
subconjunctival injection of lidocaine and inserting a fin al suture in the conjunctiva may be accompanied by 
subconjunctival bleeding, pain, or infectio n, all of which can be readily treated without any functional changes 
or any other permanent structural changes.
The risks of the sham procedure include: the risk of pre- operative sedation, the risk of the local anesthetic, and 
the risk of the superficial c onjunctival incision and suture.
A possible complication of the explant surgery to remove the NT-501 device is retinal detachment. The 
probability of retinal detachment in the normal population is  less than 1%. These other side effects are also 
possible (each with a probability of less than 1%):
xBleeding in the eye
xCataract
xInfection
xInflammation inside the eye
Surgery to remove the NT-501 device may result in pa in, loss of vision, or blindness  in rare cases. Some of 
these side effects can be treated with medication either by mouth or injecti ons in or around the eye. Some side 
effects may require treatment with a laser or surgery on th e eye. A small sample (about 0.1 mL) of the vitreous 
along with the device may be collected and shipped back to the sponsor for analysis.
14. ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Although disease progression of MacTel appears to be slow when assessed with standard methods, some 
participants report worsening visual  function despite stable visual acuity measures. Functional evaluation of 
participants with MacTel using fundus-controlled perimet ry (microperimetry) reveals c haracteristic small, deep,
paracentral scotomata; these do not necessarily aff ect performance on single optotype visual acuity testing,5but 
may affect reading and other visual tasks that require an intact paracentral visual ﬁeld. Indeed, more pronounced 
reading disability than would be expected from distance visual acuity testing alone correlate with such paracentral focal loss of  macular sensitivity
6. Moreover, longitudinal data f rom a recent interventional study 
showed progressive paracentral visual function loss in  a subset of participants while visual acuity remained 
stable7, 26.
Currently there is no known therapy for MacTel. Previ ous clinical experience with the NT-501 device in human 
participants suggests that the device is generally w ell tolerated. Importantly, the device can be readily removed 
with a simple procedure. Data from a significant num ber of human participants also suggest that the risks 
associated with NT-501 are limited to those expected wi th the surgical procedure. Th e use of a sham procedure B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Page 41 of 48in the control participants is justified by the fact that potential bias of the placebo effect could invalidate the 
study results if a sham arm was not used.
While the placebo impact on the primary endpoint is minimized  by the central masked reading of the area of the 
EZ break, the lack of a sham procedure could very we ll impact the outcome of the subjective endpoints of 
visual acuity, reading speed, and vision-related quality of life. The risks of the sham procedure are considered 
minimal and are clearly outlined in  the informed consent form (ICF).

NTMT-03-B –NT-501 MacTel Phase 3 Study Confidential
Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 44 of 4815.5 SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
All data relating to study procedures will be entered by trained site personnel into the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) around the time of study assessment collecti on. The eCRF exists within an EDC system with 
controlled access managed by the sponsor or its de signee for this study. Study personnel will be appropriately 
trained in the use of eCRFs before the start of the study and prior to being given access to the EDC system. 
Original data and any changes to data will be recorded using the EDC system, with all changes tracked by the system and recorded in an electronic audit trail.
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained examining personnel, or the study coordinator as 
appropriate.The investigator will attest that th e information contained in the eCRFs is true by providing electronic signature 
within the EDC system prior to database lock. After data base lock, the investigator will receive a copy of the 
participant data for archiving at the site. At all times, th e investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy 
and authenticity of all clinical data.The CRAs will perform ongoing site visits to confirm that cr itical protocol data (ie, s ource data) entered into the 
eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.
Source documents are where participant data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but 
are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and off ice charts, memoranda, evaluation checklists, recorded data 
from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and 
complete, photographic negatives, magnetic media, and medico-technical departments involved in the clinical 
trial.
To facilitate monitoring, the investigator(s) and instit ution(s) must provide the sponsor direct access to 
applicable source documents and report s for trial-related monitoring, sponsor audits and IRB/IEC review. The 
site must also allow inspection by applicable regulatory authorities.
When clinical observations are entered directly into the site’s computerized medical record system (ie, in lieu of 
original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been 
validated in accordance with FDA requirements pertaining to  computerized systems used in clinical research. 
An acceptable computerized data collection system (for clinical research purposes) would be one that (1) allows 
data entry only by authorized individuals, (2) prevents the deletion or alteration of previously entered data and 
provides an audit trail for such data changes (eg, modifica tions of file), (3) protects the database from tampering 
and (4) ensures data preservation.
If a site’s computerized medical record syste m is not adequately validated for the purposes of clinical research 
(as opposed to general clinical practice), applicable hardc opy source documents must be maintained to ensure 
that critical protocol data entered in to the eCRFs can be verified.
15.6 STUDY FILES AND RECORD RETENTION
The US FDA regulations (21 CFR §312.62[c]) and ICH Guid eline for GCP (see Section 4.9 of the guideline) 
require that records and documents pe rtaining to the conduct of this study, including eCRFs and ICFs, must be 
retained by the principal investigator for 2 years after the last marketing application approval in an ICH region 
or after at least 2 years have elapsed since formal discont inuation of clinical development of the investigational 
product. All state and local laws for retention of records also apply.B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 45 of 48No records should be disposed of without the wr itten approval of the sponsor. Written notification should be 
provided to the sponsor for transfer of any records to  another party or moving them to another location.
For studies conducted outside the US under a US IND/IDE,  the principal investigator must comply with the 
record retention requirements set forth in the US FDA IN D/IDE regulations and the relevant national and local 
health authorities.
16. AMENDMENTS
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study participants, may only be made 
by the sponsor. A protocol change intended to eliminate an  apparent immediate hazard to participants may be 
implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled  as a protocol amendment. The written amendment must 
be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes. The 
sponsor or their designee will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for 
approval.
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or the sponsor, the amendment to the protocol 
substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the participants, and/or has an impact on the participants ’involvement in the trial, the currently approved written ICF will require similar 
modification. In such cases, informed consent will be rene wed for participants enrolled in the study and the new 
ICF signed before continued participation.
17. STUDY REPORT AND PUBLICATIONS
The sponsor or their designee is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities 
with clinical study reports according to the applicab le regulatory requirements. The publication policy of the 
sponsor is discussed in the investigator ’s clinical research agreement.
18. STUDY DISCONTINUATION 
Both the sponsor and the principal investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at the investigator ’s site 
at any time. Should this be necessary, the sponsor or a specified designee will inform the appropriate regulatory 
authorities of the termination of the study and the reasons  for its termination, and the principal investigator will 
inform the IRB/IEC of the same. If the decision is made to terminate the study, the sponsor and the principal 
investigator will assure that adequate considerat ion is given to the protection of the participants ’interests.
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study if warranted. The investigator and the sponsor 
may also request the withdrawal of a participant becau se of noncompliance (eg, missed visits), administrative 
reasons, or any other valid and ethical reasons.
Reasons for participant discontinuation may include, but are not limited to, the following:
xInvestigator determination that it is not in the be st interest of the particip ant to continue participation
xIntercurrent illness
xAE that is serious and unexpected
xWorsening condition
xAny other safety concernsB1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

Protocol Version 7.0 (31 August 2021)
Page 46 of 48If a participant withdraws or is discontinued from the study before the Month-24 Visit, they should return for an 
exit visit. The schedule of assessments for this visit is the same as that for the 24 month.
18.1 PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION
Premature discontinuation is not anticipated to be a frequent event based on the history of previous clinical 
trials with this device. The investigator may discontinue  a participant from the study if warranted and only after 
discussion with the medical monitor. If the participant discontinues study participation before completing the 
defined 24, 36 or 48 months of follow-up, the principal investigator and study coordinator of the study site for 
the NHOR will be notified to ensure long-term follow-up.
If a participant requests explanta tion and withdrawal from the study, this can be readily arranged. The 
investigator should contact the sponsor’s medical monitor to  discuss the reasons for the request and discuss the 
procedure for explantation. If a participant discontinue s from the study they will not be replaced once 
recruitment is complete.If a participant requests explantation but does not wish to withdraw from the study, this is also acceptable. The 
participant would continue in the study with all planne d follow-up visits and assessments. For COVID-related 
out of window visits conducted less than 119 days beyond the protocol specified visit, an estimated value for 
the scheduled visit will be computed from the raw data and time using the actual out of window visit date, computed as month from surgery.
19. CONFIDENTIALITY
All information generated in this study is considered  highly confidential and must not be disclosed to any 
person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written consent is gained from the sponsor. 
However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB/IEC pe rsonnel, and the sponsor and its authorized representatives 
are allowed full access to the records.
The participants ’names will not appear on any of the data form s reported to the CRO. Participants will be 
identified by a study number. The date of birth, or year of birth where applicable, of each participant will be 
collected in the data system. B1707B3URWRFRO%BY_9970)_

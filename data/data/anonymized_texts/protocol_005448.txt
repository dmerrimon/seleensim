Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 2 of 76 SUMMARY OF AMENDED PROTOCOL CHANGES  
The final protocol LOXO- RET -18022 V ersion 1 , dated 15 October 2018, was amended for the 
following: 
•To add the term End of Treatment (EOT) and define it as the time of clinic check -out.
Where ap
plicable, subject study restrictions were updated so the duration is through EOT
or Early Termination (ET), rather than End of Study (EOS).
•To clarify that “Study Completion” applies to the clinical conduct of the study overall
(last subj
ect’s Follow -up phone call) and that “End of Study” applies to each subject for
their individual Follow -up phone call (including for ET subjects), and to update instances
where one of these terms was incorrectly used. Similarly, instances of “during the study”
and “throughout the study” were upda ted to the appropriate term.
•To update inclusion criterion 5 regarding contraception, so that subjects must use a male
condom with s
permicide and a secondary method, instead of a male condom with
spermicide or another listed method.
•To add an exclusion criterion prohibiting drugs that may prolong QT/QTc interval within
14 days prio
r to dose administration and through EOT or ET.
•To clarify exclusion criteria regarding abnormal laboratory values.
•To clarify exclusion criteria 13 and 14, and the concomitant medications and concomitant
therapies sect
ions, regarding medication restrictions and prohibited
medications/substances with potential to interact or interfere with the study drug.  As part
of these changes, exclusion criterion 13 was split into separate rest rictions for healthy
subjects and hepatically impaired subjects, and the exclusion criteria were shifted and
renumbered accordingly.
•To update exclusion criterion 39 regarding the restriction period for paracentesis from56 days prior t
o Check- in (Day  -1) to 30 days prior to Screening.
•To clarify restrictions on consumption of fruit juices such that juices other than grapefruit
and orange
 are not allowed within 72 hours prior to dose administration and through EOT
or ET.
•To clarify that there are no restric tions around w ater consumption during the study.
•To clarify when adverse events (AEs) should be classified as medical history or as AEs.
•To clarify that AEs occurring in a subject between EOT or ET a nd EOS  should only be
reported if the event is a serious adverse event or is considered related to study drug.
•To clarify the timing of the follow-up phone call to subjects from approximately 7 days
after Clinic 
Discharge  to 7 days (± 2  days ) after EOT or ET.

Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 3 of 76 •To clarify that for subjects who terminate early and do not have a follow-up call, the AE
reporting period ends at ET.
•To clarify that a withdrawn subject with an ongoing AE at ET will continue to be
followed only i
f the AE is considered related to study drug.
•To clarify the timing requirements for reporting  pregnancy in subjects or in the female
partner of a subject.
•To update the timing window of the predose blood sample for unbound plasma
concentrat
ions of LOXO-292 so that it may be collected within 30 minutes prior to
dosing, rather than within 15 minutes.
•To update the referenced version of the Investigator’s Brochure to the current version.
The version 
number, date, and other minor typographical or formatting errors were also  update d 
or corrected but do not affect the proposed conduct of the study.

event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the 
Investigator [or designee] ) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to 
study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the 
Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 
through End of Treatment [EOT] or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS , only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are 
to be repo rted. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the

subjects will be surgically sterile for at lea st 90 days prior to Check-in (Day -1). If 
documentation is not available, male subjects must follow one of the contraception methods below: 
o Male condom with spermicide, or  
o For a 
female partner of male study participant:  
- Intrauterine device (IUD) (hormonal IUD; eg, Mirena®). Copper 
IUDs are acceptable (eg, ParaGard®); 
- Established use of oral, implanted, transdermal, or hormonal method of cont
raception associated with inhibition of ovulation; or 
- Bilateral tubal ligation.  
Males who 
practice true abstinence because of a lifestyle choice (ie, do not become 
abstinent
 just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from contraceptive 
requirements. Periodic abstinence by a female partner (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and wi thdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. If a male subject is abstinent at the time of signing the ICF but becomes sexually active during the study, he must agree to use contraception as described above.  
For male subjects, sexual intercourse with fema
 le partners who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding should be avoided unless condoms with spermicide are used from the time 
of the study drug administration until 6 months after administration of study drug. Male 
subjects are required to refrain from donation of sperm from Check- in (Day  -1) until 
6 months after administration of study drug.

Title of study:  Open -label, Nonrandom ized, Single -dose, Parallel -group, Safety, Tolerance, and 
Pharmacokinetic Study of LOXO-292 Administered to Fasted Hepatically Impaired Male and 
Female Subjects and Fasted Matched -control Healthy Subjects  
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired 
hepatic function compared to matched-control healthy subjects;  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired hepatic function 
and matched -control healthy subjects.  
Study design : 
This study will be an open -label, nonrandom ized, multi-center, single-dose, parallel -group, safety, 
tolerability, and PK study of LOXO -292 administered at  a dose of 160 mg in fasted 
matched -control healthy males and females with normal hepatic function compared to fasted, 
hepatically impaired subjects.  
Subjects will be recruited in this study so that up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment ( up to 8 
subject
s within each of the  mild, m oderate, and severe imp airment groups , per Child -Pugh [CP] 
classification – assessed at Screening and Check -in [Day -1]), and  approximately 8 to 16 subjects 
with normal hepatic function are enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their CP score at Screening and assuming no change in underlying hepatic status at Check -
in (Day -1) as judged by the Investigator  (or designee), the Covance  Medical Monitor , and the 
Sponsor:  
• Group 1: Matched-control healthy subjects with normal hepatic function;  
• Group 2: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6);  
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9);  
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, score of 10 to 1 5). 
A parallel design str ategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups, with interim review s 
of safety data after the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 
4 subjects from Group  3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) , and the first 2 subjects from 
Group 4 ( severe hepatic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have completed all study -related 
assessments including the Follow -up phone call . Enrollment and dosing for remaining subjects in 
any group may occur after the interim data for that group are reviewed  and the Covance Medical 
Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with dosing. If available, PK data and matched-control healthy subject data may also be used during the interim review.  
Each matched -control 
 healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by age 
(± 10 years), body mass index (BMI; ± 20%), and sex to the enrolled  hepatic impairment subject(s). 
Should another hepatic impairment subject be identified with whom an already enrolled healthy 
subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also be matched with that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different hepatic impairment group. Each subject with normal hepatic function may be matched with up to 1 subject within each hepatic impairment 
group.  
To assess their eligibility to enter the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days (Days -29 to -2)
 and be admitted to the clinical site on Day -1 (Check -in). Replacement su bjects 
may be enrolled only if deemed necessary by the Sponsor.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 27 of 76 Subjects will be confined at the clinical site from the time of Check -in (Day  -1) until EOT  on 
Day 11 upon completion of all PK and safety assessments or ET if the subject discontinues . A 
Follow -up phone call will occur  7 days  (± 2 days)  after EOT or ET. 
On the morning of Day 1, after at least a 2 -hour fast, an oral dose of 160 mg LOXO-292 
administered as two 80 -mg capsules will be given with 240  mL water. No food will be allowed for 
up to 1 h our postdose. Glucose tablets may be administered as needed for treatment of 
hypoglycemia.  
In this study, physical examinations (PEs), 12 -lead electro cardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, How Do 
You Feel? inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation paramet ers, complete blood count  (CBC), 
and urinalysis  (UA;  Appendix 2) will be performed at Screening and at specified times during the 
study  (for spe
cific timepoints and details on each study variable, refer to  Appendix  5). Adverse 
event
s (AEs)
 and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected beginning at informed consent. 
AEs will be reported throughout the study (ie, from signing of the Informed Consent Form [ICF] 
until End of Study [EOS], or until Early Termination [ET] if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on 
Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee] ) or as AEs 
(if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is 
assessed as related t o study procedures by the Investigator [or designee], or if the event occurs after 
study drug administration on Day 1 through End of Treatment [EOT] or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related t o study 
drug by the Investigator (or designee) are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow -up call) are to be reported.  
Study Completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s Follow -up phone call.  
Interim review:  
Interim reviews of safety data will be conducted for each group when the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects)  are enrolled and have completed the study , when the 
first 4 subjects from Group  3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects)  are enrolled and have 
completed the study, and  when  the first 2 subjects from Group 4 ( severe hepatic impairment 
subjects) are enrolled and have completed the study . These safety  data will include AEs and SAEs, 
vital signs, PEs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. If available, PK data and matched -control 
healthy subject data may also be used during the review. Enrollment and dosing for  remaining 
subjects in any group may occur after the interim data for that group are reviewed  and if the 
Covance  Medical Monitor, Investigator  (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with 
dosing.  
Following the interim review of safety data for each group, the dose level may be decreased for the remaining subjects in any group pending discussion and agreement between the C ovance  Medical 
Monitor, Investigator  (or designee), and/or Sponsor. If dos e is decreased, it will also be decreased 
for the  impaired subjects’ respective matched -control healthy subjects.  
Number of subjects:  
A total of up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 subjects with m ild impairment, up to 8 
subjects with m oderate impairment, and up to 8 subjects  with s evere impairment, per CP 
classification) and approximately 8 to 16 matched-control healthy subjects with normal hepatic function will be enrolled in the study with the goal of having at least 6 subjects from each hepatic impairment group and at least 6 subjects with normal hepatic function complete the study. Subjects 
who withdraw or drop out of the study may be replaced if deemed necessary by the Sponsor.  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 28 of 76 Male subjects and female subjects of nonchildbearing poten tial, between 18 and 65 years of age, 
inclusive, at Screening, and within BMI range 18.5 to 40.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Subjects will be in 
good general health, except for additional specific inclusion criteria related to subjects with hepatic 
impairment, based  on medical history, PE findings, vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests at 
Screening and Check -in (Day -1), as determined by the Investigator  (or designee) . 
Investigational product s, dose , and mode of administration:  
LOXO-292 will be supplied by  Loxo Oncology as 80 -mg and 20- mg capsules for oral 
administration.  
Subjects will receive a single dose of LOXO-292, given orally as two 80-mg capsules. If dosing is decreased following the interim review of safety data, subjects will be given appropriate doses 
using a combination of 80 -mg and 20 -mg capsules . 
Duration of subject participation  in the study : 
Planned Enrollment/Screening Duration: up to 28 days (Day -29 to Day -2). 
Length of Confinement: a total of 12 days (11 ni ghts), from the time of Check-in (Day -1) through 
the 240- hour PK blood draw and end of study assessments.  
Follow -up Phone Call: 7 days (± 2 d ays) after EOT or ET. 
Planned Study Conduct Duration: approximately 4 7 days.  
Criteria for evaluation : 
Pharmaco kinetics:  
Serial PK blood samples for the analysis of plasma LOXO-292 concentration levels will be collecte
d from predose through 240 hours postdose.  
The following PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma concentrat
ions of LOXO-292: maximum observed concentration (C max), time to maximum observed 
concentration ( tmax), area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) from Hour 0 to the last 
measurable concentration ( AUC 0-t), AUC extrapolated to infinity ( AUC 0-∞), percentage 
extrapolation for AUC (%AUC extrap), apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ z), apparent 
terminal elimination half -life ( t1/2), apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of 
distribution during the terminal phase (V d/F), and mean residence time (MRT).  
In addition, a single blood sample will be collected predose to determine the fraction unbound (f u) 
of LOXO-292 in plasma and, whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be calculated 
for unbound LOXO -292 using f u: unbound Cmax (C max,u), unbound AUC 0-t (AUC 0-t,u), unbound 
AUC 0-∞ (AUC 0-∞,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V d/F (V d/F,u).  
Safety: 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs, performing PEs and clinical laboratory 
tests (including  creatine kinase  [CK]), measuring vital signs, and recording ECGs.  
Sample size:  
The sample size chosen for this study was based upon precedent set by other PK studies of similar 
nature and was not based on power calculations to detect statistically significant differences among 
groups.  At least 6 subjects each per hepatic function group are planned to complete the study. This 
is considered a sufficient sample size to evaluate the PK of LOXO- 292 under various degrees of 
hepatic function.  If necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, subjects who fail to complete the 
treatment or have insufficient PK data may be replaced.  
Statistical methods:  
Pharmacokinetics:   
All subjects who have received a dose of LOXO-292, have at least 1  quantifiable plasma 
concentration, and for whom at least 1 PK parameter can be computed will be included in the PK 
Population. Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized by hepatic function

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 29 of 76 using descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviat ion, coefficient of variation 
[CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). In addition, 
summary statistics for protein binding will be tabulated by hepatic function group.  
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO-292 after a single dose in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. The following statistical methodology will be used, based on 1 to 1 matching:  
The 90% confidence interva l of C
max and AUCs for the ratio between each level of impaired hepatic 
function versus the control group will be presented. Furthermore, i f an individual healthy subject is 
matched to 1 subject from any or all hepatic impairment groups, then the primary P K parameters, 
Cmax and AUCs, will be analyzed using the paired t -test to assess the difference between each 
impaired group and the healthy group. The p-value assessing the difference between each impaired group and the healthy group will be presented. For cases where 1 to 1 matching between the healthy 
and hepatic impaired groups are not achieved, an analysis of variance will be conducted. The specific procedures will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Safety:  
All subjects who receive a dose of LOXO-292 and have at least 1 postdose safety assessment will 
be included in the safety analyses. All safety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital signs measurements, clinical laboratory (including CK) results, PE results, concomitant medications, an d 
ECG interpretations, will be tabulated and summarized where possible, using descriptive methodology by hepatic function group and, as needed, by timepoint. No formal statistical analyses are planned for the safety data. Interim reviews of safety data are planned for the first 4 subjects 
from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate 
hepatic impairment subjects), and the first 2 subjects from Group 4 ( severe hepatic impairment 
subjects).

Refer to the  current  Inves tigator’s Brochure (IB )1 for detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) 
profile of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) . 
1.1. Background 
LOXO- 292 i
s a small molecule and selective  inhibitor of the rearranged during transfection 
(RET) receptor tyrosine kinase designed to competitively block the adenosine triphosphate binding site of the kinase. LOXO- 292 was at least 250 -fold more selective for RET than for 98% 
of 329 other kinases tested in a large in vitro screen. Consistent with such a high degree of selectivity, LOXO -292 caused significant cytotoxicity  in human cancer cell lines that harbored 
endogenous, clinically relevant RET gene alterations but was much less cytotoxic against human 
cancer cell lines without RET alterations. Potent and selective inhibition of RET may provide clinical benefit to subjects with malignancies due to oncogenic alterations in RET or with other mechanisms of increased RET activity.  
1.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies  
Cardi
ac safety of LOXO -292 was eval uated in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro assay 
for human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) activity, in a GLP in vivo study in conscious telemetry -instrumented minipigs, and in a GLP 28- day repeat -dose toxicology study (with 
electrocardiogram [ECG] monitoring) in minipigs. LOXO-292 had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
50) value of 1.1 μM in the GLP hERG assay, which is approximately 14- and 
6-fold higher than the predicted maximum unbound concentration at the dose of 80 mg and 160 mg respectively twice daily (BID). There were no LOXO -292- related changes in any 
cardiovascular endpoints including QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) at doses up to 12 mg/kg in the safety pharmacology cardiovascular study in conscious minipigs. Furthermore, there were no LOXO-292- related ECG changes in the 28 -day repeat -dose toxicity study in 
minipigs at the high dose of 12 mg/kg. Together, these data indicate that LO XO-292 has a low 
risk of inducing delayed ventricular repolarization, prolongation of the QTc interval, and unstable arrhythmias. 
Administration of LOXO -292 at single dos
 es up to 45 mg/kg in male rats had no effect on 
respiratory function. Potential effect s of LOXO -
 292 on the central nervous system were evaluated as part of the 
GLP  28-day repeat-dose study in rats, in functional observational battery tests and locomotor 
activity assessments. Findings were limited to animals receiving the high dose on W eek 4 of the 
dosing phase, and were attributed to poor general body condition and weight changes associated 
with LOXO -292 administration rather than specific neurological effects. Additionally, no 
microscopic abnormalities in neuronal tissues were found. 
In toxicology studies of LOXO-292 that were conducted in the rat and minipig, the primary 
pathologic fi
ndings for both species were in the tongue, pancreas, bone marrow and lymphoid 
tissues; while the gastrointestinal tract and ovaries were target tissues in min ipig. Other target 
tissues identified in the rat included: multi- tissue mineralization, physeal cartilage, incisor teeth,

Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 36 of 76 lung, Brunner’s gland, and possibly liver. Assessment of doses associated with 
moribundity/death revealed a steep dose response curve for both species. LOXO-292 was not mutagenic in the GLP bacterial mutation assay. When evaluated in two in vitro assays, LOXO-292 was not genotoxic. LOXO-292 was not found to be phototoxic when evaluated in an in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay.  
In repeated dose toxicity studies in Sprague -Dawley Rat
 s, minor changes suggestive of hepatic 
effects were higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in males (≥ 20 mg/kg/day) and females (≥ 50 mg/kg/day), higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in those receiving the high-dose (both sexes), and a higher cholesterol concentration in males (≥ 20 mg/kg/day). Reversible, LOXO-292- related decreases in liver and thymus weights 
occurred in males at 75 and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively. None of these minor changes were correlated to any liver findings microscopically, suggesting minor functional alterations of the liver rather than overt hepatocellular injury. ALP levels were also increased in Göttingen minipigs administe red 5 or 12 mg/kg/day in repeated dose toxicity studies; however, this change 
had no associated clinical or microscopic findings and was considered not adverse.  
Based on preclinical pharmacology experiments with human cancer cells in vitro and in murine xenograft model
s, meaningful inhibition of RET in tumors is expected to be achievable with oral 
dosing regimens ≥ 40 mg/day. 
Based on the nonclinical profile, including results from animal toxicology studies, theoretical 
risks of human e
xposure to LOXO-292 include the following: loss of appetite, decrease in body 
weight, increase in total white blood cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, decrease in albumin, increase in globulin, decreased albumin:globulin ratio, decrease in total protein, increased body temperature, lethargy, increase in cholesterol and triglycerides, increase in phosphorus, changes in taste sensation and/or development of xerostomia, gastrointestinal symptoms/signs: nausea, vomiting, loose stools, abdominal discomfort, decreases in red cell mass (red blood cell, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit) and reticulocytes, decrease in platelets, increases in liver function tests 
(ALP , AST , and ALT ). 
LOXO-292 has been given orally and intravenously to mice, rats, dogs, and minipigs . Oral PK 
h
as also been determined  in the monkey. LOXO-292 was absorbed and bioavailable in all 
species tested. Solubility studies and pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the pharmacokinetic exposure of LOXO-292 may be reduced by proton pump inhibitors and other antacids. LOXO- 292 appears  to be metabolized primarily by cytochrome p450 (CYP)3A4, but at 
therapeutically relevant exposures, it is not anticipated to inhibit or induce drug-metabolizing enzymes. LOXO -292 is also a substrate for the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein.

1.3. Summary of Clinical Studies  
LOXO-292 is c
urrently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/2 study (Study 
LOXO- RET -17001) in pa
tients with advanced solid tumors including RET  fusion-positive 
NSCLC, RET-mutant medullary thyroid carcinoma, and other tumors with increased RET 
activity. The starting dose of LOXO-292 was 20 mg once daily. As of July 19, 2018 data cut- off 
Page 43 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 37 of 76 date, safety data was available from 153 patients with 240 mg BID as the highest dose 
administered. As of this date, two  dose -limiting toxicities of tumor lysis syndrome and Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia at the 240 mg BID dose level have been reported. The most frequently reported treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs; > 10% of patients), were dry mouth 
(20.3%; 14.4% related), diarrhea (15.7%; 7.2% related), fatigue (15.7%; 11.8% related), constipation (12.4%; 2.6% related), headache (11.1%; 3.3% related), and hypertension (10.5%; 3.9% related). Regarding TEAEs ≥Grade 3, eight patients experienced  Grade 3 TEAEs that were 
judged by the Investigator as related to study drug. Three patients have died within 28 days of their last dose of study drug, no deaths have been attributed to study drug. A small number of patients have experienced Grade 3 or higher liver function test (LFT) abnormalities, considered 
related to study drug, occurring between 20 to  56 days after star ting LOXO-292. These changes 
were asymptomatic and resolved with dose interruption, with LOXO-292 resumed at a lower dose following normalization of the LFTs. 
As of August 24, 2018, PK data were available from 141 patients (from the global Phase 1/2 
study) . LOXO-292 i
s absorbed after oral administration with a median time to maximum 
concentration (t max) of approximately 2 hours. Although the PK sampling of LOXO-292 was not 
long enough to adequately characterize AUC 0-∞, the half- life appears to be approximately 
20 hours. Low concentrations of LOXO-292 were recovered as unchanged drug in urine indicating that the kidney contributes to overall clearance.  
As of September 14, 2018, Loxo Oncology has initiated 16 single patient protocols, Special Access Scheme, 
or Temporary Authorization Use cases to provide access to LOXO-292 for 
patients with clinical need not meeting eligibility criteria for the ongoing global Phase 1/2 study. To date, no TEAEs have been attributed to study drug for these patients. 
Preliminary P K data avail
 able from ongoing studies (LOXO- RET -18014 and 
LOXO- RET -18015) being conducted in healthy subjects indicate that LOXO-292 has an 
estimated apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2) of approximately 24 hours after a single 
dose. Refer to the  current  IB
1 for detailed  and updated background clinical study information on 
LOXO-292. 
1.4. Study Rationale  
Liver dise
ase can cause alterations in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics ( PK). Such 
alterat
ions can reduce the clearance of drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary 
excretion and affect plasma protein binding, which in turn could influence the processes of 
absorption, distribution, and elimination. Refer to the IB1 for detailed background information on 
LOXO-292. Results fr om this study will provide information on the safety, tolerability, and 
exposure of LOXO- 292 in participants with hepatic impairment and participants with normal 
hepatic function.  
This study is being conducted to provide information to develop dosing recommendations for 
LOXO-292 in subje
cts with hepatic impairment. The current study will be carried out in subjects

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 38 of 76 with hepatic impairment according to 3 different Child -Pugh (CP) categories2,3 (mild, moderate, 
and s evere impairment ) and also in matched -control healthy subje cts. 
There are several  methods u sed to categorize the severity of hepatic impairment. Despite its 
imperfections, the CP classification is the most widely used and is an acceptable method 
supported by regulatory agencies (including the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA ] and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency [EMA]). The FDA and EMA Guidelines 
recommend that the “number of subjects enrolled should be sufficient to detect clinically relevant PK differences.” In the current study, up to 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, up 
to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, up to 8 subjects with severe hepatic impairment, 
and approximately 8 to 16 healthy subjects with normal hepatic function will be enrolled. The PK and safety profiles between each hepatic impairment group and their matching (age, sex, and 
body mass index [BMI]) healthy subjects will be compared. 
1.5. Benefit -risk Assessm
 ent 
Subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment of 
their medic
al status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are primarily those 
associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures.  More information about 
the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with LOXO-292 may be found in the current  IB.

2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1. Objective s
 
The obj
ectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the PK profile of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired hepatic function compared t
o matched -control healthy subjects;  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO -292 in subjec ts with impaired hepatic 
function and matched -control healthy subjects.  
2.2. Endpoints  
The fo
llowing PK parameters will be calculated whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrati
ons of LOXO-292: maximum observed concentration (C max), (t max, area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC) from Hour 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), 
AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), percentage extrapolation for AUC (%AUC extrap), 
apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λ z), apparent terminal elimination  half- life (t1/2), 
apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (V
d/F), and mean residence time (MRT).  
In addition, a single blood sample will be collected predose to determine the fraction unbound (f
u) of LOXO-292 in plasma and, whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be

unbound AUC 0-∞ (AUC 0-∞,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V d/F (V d/F,u). 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs, performing physical examinations 
(PEs) and cl
inical laboratory tests  (including creatine kinase [CK]), measuring vital signs, and 
recording ECGs. 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall 
Study Design and Plan 
This study i
s an open- label, nonrandom i zed, multi -center, single-dose, parallel- group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of LOXO-292 administered orally at a dose of  160 mg 
to fasted adult  males and females with mild, moderate, or s evere impaired  hepatic function and 
healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function will be classified based on the 
CP classification of hepatic impairmen t2,3 (Table 1). 
Subjects will be recruited in this study so that up to  24 subjects wi th hepatic impairment ( up to 8 
subjects with mild impairment, up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 subjects 
with severe impairment, per CP classification – assessed at Screening and verified at Check -in 
[Day -1]) and approximately 8 to 16 subjects with normal hepatic function are enrolled, with the 
goal of having at least 6 subjects from each hepatic impairment group and at  least 6 subjects with 
normal hepatic function complete the study. Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups based on their CP score at Screening and Check- in (Day -1) as judged by the Investigator 
(or designee), Covance Medical Monitor , and Sponsor: 
• Group 1: Matched -control hea
 lthy subjects with normal hepatic function;  
• Group 2: Subjects with m ild hepatic  impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6);  
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9);  
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairmen t (CP Class C, score of 10 to 15 ); 
A parallel design strategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups . An interim review 
of the safety data will be conducted as detailed in Section 8.2.  
Each matched -control hea lthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by age 
(± 10 years), BMI (± 20  %), and sex to the completed hepatic impairment subject(s). Should 
another hepatic impairment subject be identified with whom an already enrolled healthy subject is demographically matched, the healthy subject may also be matched with that impaired subject as long as the impaired subject is in a different h epatic impairment group. Each subject with 
normal hepatic function may be matched with up to 1 subject within each hepatic impairment group. 
The schematic of the study design is displayed in  Figure 1. The start of the study is defined as the 
date the fi
rst subject who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note 
that enrolled subjects are defined as those subjects who are assigned a dose of study drug; this 
definition excludes screen failure subjects.

collected beginning at informed consent. AEs will be rep orted throughout the study (ie, from 
signing of the ICF until End of Study [EOS], or until Early Termination [ET] if the subject 
discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow- up call), either as subject medical 
history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the ICF or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee] ) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but prior to 
study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee] , or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 
through End of Treatment [EOT] or ET regardless of relationship to study drug). From EOT or ET through EOS , only AEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) are 
to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow- up call) are to be reported.  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained through 240 hours postdose. A study flow chart is presented  in Appendix 5

  Ascites detectable by palpitation and by ultrasound investigation, if performed;  
• Severe: 
 Necessity of paracentesis; does not respond to medication treatment.  
c A subject with hepatic encephalopathy of Grade 2 or above would not be admitted into the study.  
3.3. Discussion of Study Design  
A single-dose, parallel design is the standard design to investigate the PK of a drug in subjects 
with hepat
ic impairment. A parallel design is required to include subjects with hepatic 
impairment and matched -control healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. A single dose 
level  of LOXO-292 will be used because it has linear PK. The study will be open label because 
study endpoints are objective rather than subjective. 
Based on the PK data from previous studies in healthy subjects, LOXO-292 has an estimated t 1/2 
of approximately 24 hours after a single dose (based on current ongoing studies: 
LOXO- RET -18014 and LOXO -RET -18015). Matched -control healthy subjects with normal 
hepatic function will be enrolled in this study to serve as a reference group for interpretation of the results. Patients with a  range of hepatic impairment will be included to enhance the ability to 
detect and characterize the effects of hepatic function on the PK of LOXO -292. Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data, and the known PK profile of the compound, the duration of the treatmen t period is considered adequate to achieve the study objectives.
1 Oral doses were chosen 
because this is the intended clinical route of administration.  
Preclinical and clinical data suggest that LOXO -292 is likel y to be well tolerated in healthy 
human subjects and may have an acceptable safety margin. However, studies in animals suggest 
Page 48 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 42 of 76 that the liver may be a potential target of toxicity for this drug. Liver disease can cause 
alterations in drug disposition, reducing the clearance of drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism 
or biliary excretion and affect plasma protein binding, which in turn could influence the processes of distribution and elimination. Therefore, in this study, a cautious approach will be adopted, where the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 
4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) , and the first 2 subjects from 
Group 4 (s evere hepatic impairment subjects)  may be dosed concurrently, followed by an interim 
review of the safety data – and possibly PK data – before dosing is resumed for the remaining 
subjects in any (all) group(s) (see Section  8.2).  
3.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
An oral 
dose has been selected for this study because this is the intended clinical route of 
administra
tion. The dose of 160 mg of LOXO- 292 was selected based on clinical study results 
and its observed PK profile. The 160- mg dose is expected to ensure suff icient quantifiable 
plasma concentrations of LOXO-292 for determination of systemic PK exposure . In a Phase 1 /2 
clinical study  in cancer patients (LOXO -RET -17001), 160 mg of LOXO-292 dosed BID has 
been evaluated  and has been selected for further testing in  a larger number of cancer patients to 
evaluate its safety and efficacy . Current FDA guidance4 stipulates that a single -dose study may 
be satisfacto ry where prior evidence indicates that multiple -dose PK is accurately predicted by 
single-dose data for both parent drug and active metabolites (eg, when the drug and active metabolites exhibit linear and time -independent PK at the concentrations anticipat ed in the 
patients to be studied). Thus, the current study will assess the PK of a single dose of 160 mg LOXO-292 in healthy and hepatically impaired subjects.  
4.  SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
Up to 
8 subjects will be enrolled into each hepatic impairment treatment group to have at least 
6 subjects fr
om each group complete the study. Up to 16 subjects will be enrolled into the 
matched -control healthy subject group to have at least 6 healthy subjects matched to each hepatic 
impairment treatment group complete  the study. Healthy control subjects will be matched  
demographic ally to hepatically impaired subjects  as noted in Section  3.1.

methods of contraception from the time of the dose admi nistration  through 6 months  after 
dose administration : 
• Male sterilization, with documented confirmation of surgical success. Male 
subjects will be surgically sterile for at least 90 days prior to Check -in (Day -1). If 
documentation is not available, male subjects must follow one of the contraception methods below: 
o Male condom with spermicide, and 
o For a
 female partner of male study participant:  
- Intrauterine device (IUD) (hormonal IUD; eg, Mirena®). Copper 
IUDs are acceptable (eg, ParaGard®); 
- Established use of oral, implanted, transdermal, or hormonal method of cont
raception associated with inhibition of ovulation; or 
- Bilateral tubal ligation.  
Males who 
practice true abstinence because of a lifestyle choice (ie, do not become 
abstinent
 just for the purpose of study participation) are exempt from contraceptive 
requirements. Periodic abstinence by a female partner (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. If a male subject is abst inent at the time of signing the ICF but becomes 
sexually active through EOS , he must agree to use contraception as described above.  
For male subjects, sexual intercourse with female partners who are pregnant or 
breastfe
eding should be avoided unless condoms with spermicide are used  from the time 
of the study drug administration until 6 months after  administration  of study drug. Male 
subjects are required to refrain from donation of sperm from Check- in (Day -1) until 
6 months after administration  of study drug. 
For subjects who are exclusively in same- sex relatio nships, contraceptive requirements 
do not apply.

a Hepatic function determined using the Child- Pugh assessment (Section  3.2). 
4.6. Removal of Subjects from Study Participation  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. The I
nvestigator (or designee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue the study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following: change in compliance with inclusion/exclusion criterion that is clinically relevant and affects subject safety, occurrence of AEs, occurrence of pregnancy, intake of nonpermitted concomitant medication that might affect subject safety or study assessments/objectives, etc. Notification of withdrawal will immediately be made to the Study Monitor. In case of withdrawal, efforts will be made to perform all final study day assessments (Appendix 5) . The date the subject is withdrawn from the study and the 
reason for 
withdrawal will be recorded on the subject’s electronic Case Report Form (e CRF). All 
withdrawn subjects with AEs that are assessed as related to study drug and which are ongoing at 
ET may continue to be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by the I nvestigator (or designee)  and confirmed by the Sponsor.  
The entire study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee), Sponsor, or Covance 
Medical Monitor based on the occurrence of the following: 
• Adverse events unknown to date with respect to their nature, severity, and/or duration; 
• Increas
ed frequency and/or severity and/or duration of known AEs; 
• Medical
 or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study; 
• Difficultie
s in the recruitment of subjects;  
• Cancell
ation of drug development. 
In the ev
ent that the study is terminated early, the Sponsor or its designee will provide specific 
guidance to t
he investigational site s regarding the end of study procedures.

Forma Capsule  
Strength  20 mgb and 80 mg  
Supplier  Loxo Oncology, Inc.  
Manufacturer  Avista Pharma Solutions, Inc.  
aSpecific ingredients/purity will be identified in the Certificate of Analysis (or equivalent) that is supplied with the study drug.  
bThe 20-mg dose will only be used if dosing is decreased following the interim review of safety data ( Section 8.2). 
The IMP (capsule containing 20 mg [if applicable following interim analysis] or 80 mg  
LOXO-292) will be supplied by the Sponsor (or designee) , along with the batch /lot numbers and 
Certificate of Analysis.  It will be provided in high density polyethylene bottles and stored 
according to the instructions on the label. 
Study drugs will be store d at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access.  
The bulk drug container and unit dose containers will be labeled in accordance with nation al 
laws and regulations. The study drug will be stored in accordance with the labeling. The study 
drugs will be transferred from bulk supplies into the subject’s dose container by qualified clinical site employees. Each unit dose container will be appropriately labeled. 
5.2. Study Treatment Administration  
Subjects w
ill receive a single dose of LOXO-292, given ora lly as two 80- mg capsules ( 160 mg 
total dose) orally in the mornin g on Day 1. The dose of LOXO-292 will be given within 
15 minutes following predose blood sample collection. If dosing is decreased  in hepatic subjects 
following the interim review of safety data (Section 8.2) , healthy matched -control sub jects will 
be dosed at the lower dose in order to provide appropriate matches to hepatically impaired 
subjects. 
Each unit dose will be prepared by qualified clinical staff. Each unit dose container will be 
appropriatel
y labeled.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 53 of 76 Appropriate unit dose(s), as described above, will be administered to consecutively numbered 
subjects. Although the timing of events requires that each subject will be consistently administered the appropriate dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of consecutive subjects may be staggered to obviate the need to have all subjects on precisely the same study schedule. For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed into the eCRF.  
Each dose of LOXO -292 will be
  administered orally with approximately 240 mL of room  
temperature water. Doses will be preceded by a fast of at least 2 hours from food (not including water) and will be followed by a fast from food (not including water) for at least 1 hour postdose. During Clinic confinement in the CRU (Day -1 through EOT or ET), Matched -control healthy 
subjects may consume water ad libitum and hepatically impaired subjects may consume water in a manner consistent with their medical condition.  
Subjects will not lay supine for 1 hour following dose administration , except 
 as necessitated by 
the occurrence of an AE(s) and/or study procedure(s).  
5.3. Randomization 
This is 
a nonrandomized study. The study has a fixed treatment sequence.  
5.4. Blinding  
T
his is 
an open -label s tudy. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance  
The follow
ing measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance:  
• All doses will be administered under the supervision of suitably qualified study site staff. 
• I
mmediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will be 
perform
ed for each subject . 
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of LOXO-292 will b e 
performed. 
5.6. Drug Accountability  
The Inv
estigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of LOXO-292 
capsul
es received. In addition, an accurate drug disposit ion record will be kept, specifying the 
amount dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensing. This drug accountability record will 
be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug 
accountability record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon satisfa
ctory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures. Any unused assembled 
unit doses will be retained until completion of the study.

Subjects will refrain from strenuous exercise from 5 days prior to Che ck-in (Day -1) and during 
the period of confinement at the clinical site and will otherwise maintain their normal level of 
physical activity through EO T or ET (ie, will not begin a new exercise program or participate in 
any unusually strenuous physical exertion). 
While confined at the clinical site, subjects will receive a standardized diet at scheduled times 
that do not confl
ict with other study- related activities.  
Doses of LOXO -292 will be pre ceded by a fast of at least 2 hours from food (not including 
water) and will be followed by a fast from food (not including water) for at least 1  hour postdose. 
Glucose tablets may be administered as needed for treatment o f hypoglycemia. S ubjects may 
consume water ad libitum . 
7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
7.1. Pharmaco
kinetic Assessments  
7.1.1. Pharmaco
kine tic Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples for PK analysis of LOXO-292 plasma levels and  protein binding and potential 
analysis of metabolites  will be collected at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 5.  The exact 
time of the s
tudy drug administration and the actual time of blood sampling for PK analysis and 
protein binding will be recorded on the e CRF.  
Processing, storage, and shipping instructions for these PK blood and protein binding samples will be provi
ded in a  separate Laboratory Manual . The number of blood s amples and total blood 
volume required for PK testing and protein binding is presented in Appendix 3. 
7.1.2. Analytical Methodology 
Concentrations of LOXO-292 in plasma will be determined using a validated bioan alytical 
method. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document. The 
concentrations of total and unbound LOXO-292 will be determined in a sample of predose plasma fortified with a known concentration of LOXO-292. The unbound fraction will be calculated based on total and unbound LOXO- 292 levels. Samples of plasma may be analyzed

Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 56 of 76 for exploratory analyses of metabolites. If such analyses are conducte d, the results will be 
reported separately by the Sponsor. 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
Safety eva
luations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee), Covance 
Medical Mo
nitor, or Sponsor.  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal tim
e, giving considerations to appropriate posture conditions, practical restrictions, and 
any other procedures to be performed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for scheduling procedures around a timepoint is (in descending order of priority): 
• Dosing; 
• Pharmac
okinetic blood sampling; 
• Vital s
igns assessments;  
• Electrocar
diograms;  
• Blood and urine
 samples for clinical laboratories; 
• Physical
 examination. 
7.2.1. Adverse Ev
ent s 
Adverse event definitions; assignment of severity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and procedures for
 reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1.  
Subjects will be asked a nonleading HDYF? question such as “Have there been any changes in your healt
h status since Screening/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 5 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed], at Check -in (Day -1), at  each postdose 
vital signs assessment, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will also be encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time through the EOS. 
AEs, whether volunteered, identified by the subject’s responses to HDYF? inquiries, or noted on 
PE, ECG, vita
l signs assessments, or laboratory tests, will be recorded throughout the study (ie, 
from signing of the ICF until EOS [or ET if t he subject discontinues from the study and does not 
complete a follow-up call] ), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as 
beginning prior to signing of the ICF  or if the event occurs prior to study drug administration on 
Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures by the Investigator [or designee] ) or as 
AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF  but prior to study drug administration on Day 1 
and is assessed as related to study procedures by the Investigator [or de signee] , or if the event 
occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 through EOT or ET regardless of relationship to 
study drug). F rom EOT or ET through EOS, only AEs assessed as related to study drug  by the 
Investigator (or designee)  are to be reported. All SAEs that develop from the time of ICF signing 
until EOS (or ET, if the subject discontinues from the study and does not complete a follow up 
call) are to be reported.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 57 of 76 Unless a subject withdraws consent or is withdrawn from the study  and does not complete the 
follow-up call, all subjects must be followed until EOS. Subjects with AEs that are assessed as 
related to study drug by the Investigator (or designee) which are ongoing at EOS may continue to 
be followed until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by 
the Investigator or designee and confirmed by the Sponsor. The Investigator (or designee) should use appropriate judgment in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the resolution of events. The Spons or may request that additional safety tests be performed.  
Subjects will receive a Safety Foll
 ow-up phone call 7 days  (± 2 days) after EOT or ET to 
determine if any AE has occurred since the EOT or ET visit.   
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at the clinical site  for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee).  
Any event that meets the criteria of a Suspected Unexpected S erious A dverse Reactions 
(SUSAR) will be reported to the IRB /IEC according to site policy by the Investigator (or 
designee) and to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Reference Safety Information in the current IB for LOXO- 292 for expe cted adverse reactions.
 
7.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry panel [fasted at least 8  hours], coagulat ion 
parameters, CBC, thyroid-stimulating hormone, hemoglobin A1c [hepatic subjects only], and 
UA) will be c ollected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 5. 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening. A drug 
screen for selected drugs of abuse will be performed at Screening and repeated at Check -in 
(Day -1; including an alcohol breath test for all subjects and, for matched-control healthy 
subjects only, including cotinine). A serum qualitative pregnancy test (females only) and a follicle -stimu lating hormone test (postmenopausal females only) will be performed at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 5.  
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory evaluations is presente
d in Appendix 3. A list of the specific evaluation is in Appendix 2.  
7.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital 
signs (including oral temperature, respiratory rate, and supine BP and HR) will be obtained 
at the timep
oints specified in  Appendix 5. 
Blood pressure and HR measurements should be performed using the same arm for each reading and measurem
ents should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at 
least 5  minutes.  
When vital signs assessments are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be obta
ined at the scheduled timepoint, and the vital signs will be obtained prior to and as 
close as possible to the scheduled blood draw.

Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 58 of 76 7.2.4. 12-L ead E lectrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG (including PR, RR, QRS, and QT interval parameters) will be obtained after the 
subject 
has been resting for at least 10  minutes in the supine position at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 5.  The QT interval will be corrected for HR by Fridericia’s (QTcF  = QT/[RR]1/3) 
formulae. 
When 12- lead ECGs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws will be 
obtained at
 the scheduled timepoint, and the 12- lead ECG s will be obtained prior to and as close 
as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.5. Physical E xamination  
A complete or abbreviated PE will be performed at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 5. 
Complete P
Es will evaluate general appearance and the following body systems/organs: 
dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular; 
abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. Weight and height will be reported (height only reported  during Screening). 
The PE at Screening will include hepatic encephalopathy and ascites evaluations for the CP 
assessment.  
Abbre
viated PEs will evaluate general appearance and the following body systems/organs: 
dermatologi
cal; pulmonary; cardiovascular; abdominal; and neurological.  
8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS  
8.1. Determin
ation of Sample Size  
The sample 
size chosen for this study was based upon precedent set by other PK studies of 
similar nat
ure and was not based on power calculations to detect statistically significant 
differences among groups. Six subjects each per hepatic function group are planned to complete the study. This is considered a sufficient sample size to evaluate the PK of LOXO -292 under 
various degrees of hepatic function. 
8.2. Interim Analysis  
Interim r
eviews of safety data will be conducted for each group when the first 4 subjects from 
Group 2 (mild hepa
tic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have completed the study, when the 
first 4 s ubjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have 
completed the study, and when the first 2 subjects from Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment 
subjects), are enrolled and have completed the study. These safety data will includ e AEs and 
serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, PEs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. If available, PK data and matched -control healthy subject data may also be used during the review. Enrollment and 
dosing for remaining subjects in any group may occur afte r the interim data for that group are 
reviewed and the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with dosing.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 59 of 76 Each interim review will be a teleconference between the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), and/or Sponsor to discuss safety data.  
Following the interim review of safety data  for a group, t he dose level may be decreased for the 
remaining subjects in any group pending discussion and agreement between the Covance 
Medical Monitor, In vestigator (or designee), and/or Sponsor. If dosing is decreased, it will also 
be decreased for the impaired subjects’ respective matched -control healthy subjects. 
8.3. Analysis Populations  
8.3.1. Study Popul
ati ons 
The PK Population will consist of all subjects who have received a dose of LOXO -292, have at  
least 1  quantifiable plasma concentration, and for whom at least 1 PK parameter can be 
computed. 
The Safety Population  will cons ist of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
have at least 1 pos tdose safety assessment.  
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Whenever poss
ible, the following PK parameters will be calculated for each subject, based on 
the plasma c
oncentrations of LOXO-292, and according to the model independent approach:5  
Cmax maximum observed concentration  
tmax time to maximum observed concentration 
AUC 0-t area under the concentration- time curve (AUC) from Hour 0 to the 
last measurable co ncentration, calculated using the linear 
trapezoidal rule for increasing and decreasing concentrations  
AUC 0-∞ AUC extrapolated to infinity, calculated using the formula: 
  
AUC 0-∞ = AUC 0-t + 
zt
λC 
  
where C t is the last measurable concentration and λZ is the 
apparent terminal elimination rate constant  
%AUC extrap percentage extrapolation for AUC 
λZ apparent terminal elimination rate constant, where λZ is the 
magnitude of the slope of the linear regression of the log 
concentration versus- time profile during the terminal phase  
t1/2 apparent terminal elimination half -life (whenever possible), where 
t1/2 = natural log (ln)(2)/ λZ

Additionally, the number of points used to estimate λ Z will be presented in a listing.  
The f u value determined for each subject will be used to calculate the f ollowing unbound 
LOXO-292 PK parameters for each individual subject:  
Cmax,u Unbound C max, calculated as C max*fu 
AUC 0-t,u Unbound AUC 0-t, calculated as AUC 0-t*fu 
AUC 0-∞,u Unbound AUC 0-∞, calculated as AUC 0-∞*fu 
CL/F ,u Unbound CL/F, calculated as Dose/ AUC 0-∞,u 
Vd/F,u Unbound V d/F, calculated as CL/F ,u/λZ 
Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using commercial software such as Phoenix™ 
WinNonlin® Version 6.4 or higher (Certara USA Inc.). 
Other parameters may be added as appropriate. Final PK parameters reported will be detailed in 
the Statistic
al Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Pharmacokinetic analysis will use actual times as recorded on the eCRF. Other  data handling 
procedures will be detailed in the SAP. 
8.5. Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data  
Plasma con
centrations and PK parameters will be summarized by hepatic function with 
descript
ive statistics (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation 
[CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). In addition, 
summary statistics for protein binding will be tabulated by hepatic function group. 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO-292 after a single 
dose in subjec
ts with mild, moderate, or s evere hepatic impairment, compared to subjects with 
normal hepatic function. The following statistical methodology will be used, based on 1 to 1 matching: 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the ln transformed AUC
0-t, AUC 0-∞, 
and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical factor of population for subjects with 
varied degree hepatic impairment (severe, moderate, and mild) and healthy matched control 
subjects, a categorical covariate (sex), and continuous covariates (age and BMI). Ratios of least squares means (LSM) and 90% CIs will be calculated using the exponentiation of the difference 
between renal function cohort LSM from the ANCOVA analyses on t he ln transformed AUC
0-t, 
AUC 0-∞, and C max. The specific procedures will be documented in the SAP . 
All statistical calculations will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or greater.

Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO- RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 61 of 76 8.6. Statistical Analyses of Safety Data  
All subjects who received a dose of LOXO- 292 and h ave at least 1 postdose safety assessment 
will be included in the safety analyses. All safety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital 
signs measurements, clinical laboratory (including CK) re sults, PE results, concomitant 
medications, and ECG interpretations, will be tabulated and summarized where possible, using descriptive methodology by hepatic function group and, as needed, by timepoint. Unless otherwise specified, baseline value is defined as the last nonmissing measurement before administration of the study drug. No formal statistical analyses are planned for the safety data. 
The incidence of AEs for each hepatic function will be presented by severity (matched control 
healthy subje
cts, mild, moderate, and severe) and by relationship to study drug as determined by 
the Investigator (see Appendix 1 for AE reporting). All treatmen t-emergent AEs will be 
summarized by system organ class and preferred term, with a breakdown by hepatic function, using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activi ties. 
8.7. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
Any changes to information in the trial progress notes and other source documents will be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a clinical site staff member authorized to make the change. Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data and clearly entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If the reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written adjacent to the change by the clinic ian. 
The Data Management Plan will be approved by the Sponsor. 
Data will be validated during data entry by the clinical site and verified by the Study Monitor. 
Data will
 then be reviewed by the data management group to resolve any outstanding issues. 
Listings will be generated after the database is cleaned by data management and will be reviewed by the Covance scientific team. The eCRF and ancillary data will be converted into final SAS
® 
datasets following Study Data Tabulation Model or client-provided spec ifications. The final 
datasets structure will be verified using Web Submission Data Manager®, while the dataset 
content will be peer reviewed by an independent programmer. 
The tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) will be programmed per the final SAP. All TFLs will be 
peer review
ed by an independent programmer. In addition, draft TFLs will be reviewed by the 
Covance scientific team during the dry run and data review meetings.  
The peer review will be performed by independent programmers following the quality control process and p
rogramming checklists.  
8.8. Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
Quality con
trol and quality assurance will be performed according to Covance standard operating 
procedures o
r per client request and as applicable, according to the contract between Covance 
and the Sponsor.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO -RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 65 of 76 Appendix  1: Adverse Event Reporting  
1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse ev
ent (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
experienc
ed by a patient or healthy subject, whether or not considered drug related by the 
Investigator (or designee). A treatment- emergent AE is an AE that is reported  after a dose of 
study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition; 
• Subject
ive or objective signs/symptoms; 
• Concom
itant diseases or accidents;  
• Clini
cally relevant adverse changes in laboratory parameters observed in a subject during 
a clin
ical study.  
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective 
disease 
symptoms (including laboratory abnormalities that are deemed clinically significant by 
the Investigator or designee ), and accidents observed in the context of a clinical trial, irrespective 
of a possible causal relationship with the administration of the trial substance.  
1.2 Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severi
ty of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Co mmon 
Termin
ology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows:  
• Grade 1 Mild : Asympto matic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2 Moderate : Minima l, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening : 
Hospital
ization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL**  
• Grade 4 Life- threateni ng consequences: Urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5 Death related to AE  
Note: Not all grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, et
c.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO -RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 66 of 76 The Investigator (or designee) will make a determination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2-category system according to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) is 
suspected;  
• RELATED = The time course between administration of investigational product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and no other 
cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) can be identified. 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the experience m
ay have been caused by the drug. 
 
1.3 Pregnancy 
As inform
ation is available, a pregnancy (including pregnancy in female partners of male 
subjects)
 diagnosed through EOS or ET (if the subject discontinues from the study and does not 
complete a follow up call)  and for up to 90 days after study drug administration should be 
reported by the Investigator (or designee) via eFax to the Sponsor’s clinical safety representative 
within 24 hours of being notified. The Sponsor’s safety representative will then forward the 
Pregnancy F orm to the Investigator for completion.  
eFax: +1 (203) 643-2013 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study and early te
rmination study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be 
followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor’s clinical safety 
representative. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome 
of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification 
as a serious AE (SAE ; ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover their sexual p
artner is pregnant. In this instance, the partner must provide written consent before 
pregnancy information can be collected. When a site becomes aware that the female partner of a 
male subject is pregnant, they are to contact the Covance Medical Monitor immediately (within 
24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying the Sponsor’s 
safety representative via eFax.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO -RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 67 of 76 All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE electronic Case Report Form, in addition to 
completion of the required pregnancy forms. If the Investigator suspects that a pregnancy was 
the result of an intera ction between the study treatment and the contraceptive method, in addition 
to the pregnancy the drug interaction should also be captured as a separate AE.  
1.4 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE (by
 Food and Drug Administration [FDA] definition) is any adverse drug experience 
occurring at
 any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -t
hreatening adverse drug experience (ie, one that places the subject, in the view of 
the Inv
estigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death);  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
• A persi
stent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• A congenit
al anomaly/birth defect; 
• An im
portant medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the above
 outcomes. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitaliz
ation may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
1.5 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or sus
pected adverse drug reaction is considered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed in 
the Referen
ce Safety Information section of  the IB or if it is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational medicinal product. 
1.6 Reporting 
Food and Drug Ad
ministration- reportabl e AEs are AEs that are associated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that  are assessed as serious , related,  and unexpected. Food and Drug 
Administration -reportable AEs will be reported by the clinical site to the Sponsor, the Covance 
Medical Monitor, and the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Final determination of 
whether an event represents a SUSAR will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
Within 24 hours of when an AE that is potentially FDA-reportable is first recognized or reported, 
and within 24 hour
s of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is assessed as related or 
unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, the Sponsor’s clinical safety

following eFax number or emai l: 
eFax: +1 (203) 643-2013 
email: safety@loxooncology.com 
To report the SAE , the com pleted report form should be sent by eFax to the Sponsor’s clinical 
safety representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are reviewed during normal 
business hours. Additional reporting instructions and the SAE Report Form are provided in the 
Study Manual.  
The IRB will be notified of any FDA- reportable  AE within the timeframe required by the IRB. 
The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be completed and 
submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 72 of 76 Subjects will be given an opportunity to ask questions about the study prior to providing consent 
for participation.  
Following discussion of the study with clinical site  personnel,  subjects will sign 2 copies of the 
ICF in the presence of a suitably trained member of staff to indicate that they are freely giving their informed consent. One copy will be given to the subject, and the other will be maintained in the subject’s records.  
Subjects must be re -consente
 d to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation 
in the study. 
Subject Data Prote ction 
Subject
s will be assigned a unique identifier and will not be identified by name in eCRFs, 
study-rela
ted forms, study reports, or any related publications. Subject and Investigator personal 
data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the event the study 
protocol, study report, or study data are included in a public registry, all identifiable information from individual subjects or Investigators will be redacted according to applicable laws and regulations.  
The subject must be informed that his/her personal study-related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in acc
ordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject. The subject must also be informed that his/her study- related data may 
be examined by Sponsor or Contract Research Organization (CRO  [ie, Covance] ) auditors or 
other authorized personnel appointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Disclosure  
All information provided regarding the study, as well as  all infor
 mation collected and/or 
documented during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator (or designee) agrees not to disclose such information in any way without prior written permission from the Sponsor. 
Data Quality  Assurance 
T
he following data quality steps will be implemented: 
• All relevant subject data relating to the study will be recorded on eCRFs unless directly 
transmitted
 to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
Investigator is resp onsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
electronically signing the eCRF.  
• The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the 
informat
ion entered in the eCRF.  
Page 79 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol Reference: LOXO -RET -18022 
Protocol Final, 19 December 2018  Page 73 of 76 • The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB  review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• Covance is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking 
of the data
. Predefined agreed risks, monitoring thresholds, quality tolerance thresholds, 
controls, and mitigation plans will be documented in a risk management register. 
Additional details of quality checking to be performed on the data may be included in a Data Management Plan.  
• A Study Monitor will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered i
nto the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable 
from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be re
tained by the Investigator in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62(c) unless local 
regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Investigator Documentation Responsibilities  
All individual, subject- specific 
 study data will also be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant 
electronic data capture (EDC) system on an eCRF in a timely fashion.  
All data generated from external sources (eg, laboratory and bioanalytical data), and transmitted to Covan
ce electronically, will be integrated with the subject’s eCRF data in accordance with the 
Data Management Plan.  
An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject who undergoes any screening procedures, according t
o the eCRF completion instructions. The Sponsor, or CRO, will review the supporting 
source documentation against the data entered into t he eCRFs to verify the accuracy of the 
electronic data. The Investigator will ensure that corrections are made to the eCRFs and that data queries are resolved in a timely fashion by the study staff. 
The Investigator will sign and date the eCRF via the EDC system’s electronic signature 
procedure. The
se signatures will indicate that the Investigator reviewed and approved the data on 
the eCRF, data queries, and site notifications. 
Publications  
If on completion of the study the data warrant publication, the Investigator may publish the 
results in
 recognized (refereed) scientific journals subject to the provisions of the clinical study 
agreement (CSA). Unless otherwise specified in the CSA, the following process will occur:

d A complete physical examination (PE) will be performed at Screening and EOT (or ET). An abbreviated PE will be performed at Check-in (Day -1) and 1 hour postdose on Day 1.  
e Electrocardiograms will be collected after the subject has rested in the supine position for at least 10 minutes, and will be obtained prior to  and as close as possible to the scheduled blood 
draws.  
f Vital signs measurements (oral temperature, respiratory rate, and supine blood pressure and heart rate [HR]) will be obtained at Screening and Check -in (Day -1), predose, at 2 hours 
(± 10 minutes) and 4 hours (±  10 minutes) postdose, and at each Study Day through EOT  (or ET). Vital signs measurements should be carried out prior to and as close as  possible to having 
blood drawn. Blood pressure and HR will be measured using the same arm for each reading after the subject has been supine for at least 5  minutes. 
g An HDYF? inquiry performed at Screening (after the Informed Consent Form is signed), at Check-in  (Day -1), at each postdose vital signs assessment, and at an appropriate time for all other 
days.  
h AEs and SAEs will be collected  beginning at informed consent.   AEs will be recorded  throughout the study (ie, from signing of the Informed Consent Form [ICF] until EOS, or until ET if the 
subject discontinues from the study  and does not complete a follow -up call), either as subject medical history (if the event is reported as beginning prior to signing of the  ICF or if the event 
occurs prior to study drug administration on Day 1 and is assessed as not related to study procedures  by the Investigator [or designee]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after signing of the ICF but 
prior to study drug administration on Day 1  and is assessed by the Investigator [or designee ]) as related to study procedures, or if the event occurs after study drug administration on Day 1 
through EOT  or ET  regardless of relationship to study drug).   From EOT  or ET through EOS, only AEs asse ssed as related to study drug are to  be recorded.  All SAE s that develop from the 
time of ICF signing until EOS (or ET if the subject discontinues from the study  and does not complete a follow-up call) are to be reported. 
i Dose administration is to be given during the morning of Day  1.

Title of study: Open-label, Nonrandomized, Single-dose, Parallel-group, Safety, Tolerance, and 
Pharmacokinetic Study of LOXO-292 Administered to Fasted Hepatically Impaired Male and 
Female Subjects and Fasted Matched-control Healthy Subjects  
Objectives:  
The objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired 
hepatic function compared to matc hed-control healthy subjects;  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired hepatic function 
and matched-control healthy subjects.
Study design: 
This study will be an open-label, nonrandomized, multi-center, single-dose, parallel-group, safety, 
tolerability, and PK study of LOXO-292 administered at a dose of 160 mg in fasted matched-control healthy males and females with  normal hepatic function compared to fasted, 
hepatically impaired subjects. 
Subjects will be recruited in this study so that up  to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 
subjects within each of the mild, moderate, a nd severe impairment groups, per Child-Pugh [CP] 
classification – assessed at Screening and Check-in [Day -1]), and approximately 8 to 16 subjects 
with normal hepatic function are enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled within the following groups 
based on their CP score at Screening and assuming no change in underlying he patic status at Check-
in (Day -1) as judged by the Investigator (or designee), the Covance Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor: 
• Group 1: Matched-control healthy subj ects with normal hepatic function; 
• Group 2: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6); 
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9); 
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, score of 10 to 15). 
A parallel design strategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups , with interim reviews 
of safety data after the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 
4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impair ment subjects), and the first 2 subjects from 
Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have completed all study-related 
assessments including the Follow-up phone call. En rollment and dosing for remaining subjects in 
any group may occur after the interim data for that group are reviewed and the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed with dosing. If available, PK data and matched- control healthy subject data may also be used during the interim 
review. 
Each matched-control healthy subject (Group 1) will be demographically matched (1:1) by age 
(± 10 years), body mass index (BMI; ± 20%), and sex to the enrolled hepatic impairment subject(s). 
Should another hepatic impairment  subject be identified with whom an already enrolled healthy 
subject is demographically matched, the healthy su bject may also be matched with that impaired 
subject as long as the impaired subject is in a diffe rent hepatic impairment group. Each subject with 
normal hepatic function may be matched with up to 1 subject within each hepatic impairment 
group. 
To assess their eligibility to ente r the study, potential subjects will be screened within 28 days 
(Days -29 to -2) and be admitted to the clinical site on Day -1 (Check-in). Replacement subjects 
may be enrolled only if deem ed necessary by the Sponsor.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 7 of 55 Subjects will be confined at the clinical site from the time of Check-in (Day -1) until Clinic 
Discharge on Day 11 upon comple tion of all PK and safety assessments. A Follow-up phone call 
will occur approximately 7 days after Clinic Discharge. 
On the morning of Day 1, after at least a 2-hour fast, an oral dose of 160 mg LOXO-292 
administered as two 80-mg capsules will be given with 240 mL water. No food will be allowed for 
up to 1 hour postdose. Glucose tablets may be  administered as needed for treatment of 
hypoglycemia. 
In this study design, physical examinations (PEs ), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, 
How Do You Feel? inquiries, clinical chemistry panel, coagulation para meters, complete blood 
count, and urinalysis will be performed at Screen ing and at specified times during the study. All 
adverse events (AEs) will be recorded throughout  the study (ie, from signing of the Informed

occurring prior to signing of the Informed Consent Form [ICF]) or as AEs (if the event occurs after 
administration of LOXO-292). Between the time of ICF signing to administration of LOXO-292 only AEs assessed as related to study procedures should be reported. All SAEs that develop from he 
time of ICF signing until Study Completion are to be reported. 
Study Completion is defined as the time of the last subject’s Follow-up phone call. 
Interim review: 
Interim reviews of safety data will be conducte d for each group when the first 4 subjects from 
Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have completed the study, when the 
first 4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects) are enrolled and have 
completed the study, and when the first 2 s ubjects from Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment 
subjects) are enrolled and have completed the stud y. These safety data will include AEs and serious 
AEs (SAEs), vital signs, PEs, ECGs, and clinical  laboratory tests. If available, PK data and 
matched-control healthy subject data may also be used during the review. Enrollment and dosing 
for remaining subjects in any group may occur after the interim data for that group are reviewed and 
if the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor agree it is safe to proceed 
with dosing. 
Following the interim review of safety data for each  group, the dose level may be decreased for the 
remaining subjects in any group pending discussi on and agreement between the Covance Medical 
Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and/or Sponso r. If dose is decreased, it will also be decreased 
for the impaired subjects’ respectiv e matched-control healthy subjects. 
Number of subjects: 
A total of up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 subjects with mild impairment, up to 8 
subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 subjects with severe impairment, per CP 
classification) and approximately 8 to 16 matche d-control healthy subjects with normal hepatic 
function will be enrolled in the study with the goal of having at least 6 subjects from each hepatic impairment group and at least 6 subjects with norma l hepatic function complete the study. Subjects 
who withdraw or drop out of the study may be replaced if deemed necessary by the Sponsor. 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
Male subjects and female subjects of nonchildb earing potential, between 18 and 65 years of age, 
inclusive, at Screening, and within BMI range 18.5 to 40.0 kg/m2, inclusive. Subjects will be in 
good general health, except for additional specific in clusion criteria related to subjects with hepatic 
impairment, based on medical history, PE findings, vital signs, ECG, and clin ical laboratory tests at 
Screening and Check-in (Day -1), as determ ined by the Investigator (or designee). 
Investigational products, dose, and mode of administration: LOXO-292 will be supplied by Loxo Oncology as 80-mg and 20-mg capsules for oral 
administration.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 8 of 55 Subjects will receive a single dose of LOXO-292, given orally as two 80-mg capsules. If dosing is 
decreased following the interim review of safety data, subjects will be given appropriate doses 
using a combination of 80-mg and 20-mg capsules. 
Duration of subject participation in the study: Planned Enrollment/Screening Duration: up to 28 days (Day -29 to Day -2). 
Length of Confinement: a total of 12 days (11 nigh ts), from the time of Check-in (Day -1) through 
the 240-hour PK blood draw and end of study assessments. Follow-up Phone Call: approximately 7 days after Clinic Discharge. Planned Study Conduct Durati on: approximately 47 days. 
Criteria for evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics: 
Serial PK blood samples for the analysis of plasma LOXO-292 concentration levels will be 
collected from predose through 240 hours postdose.  
The following PK parameters will be calcula ted whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO-292: maximum observed concentration (C max), time to maximum observed 
concentration (t max), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from Hour 0 to the last 
measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), percentage 
extrapolation for AUC (%AUC extrap), apparent terminal elim ination rate constant ( λz), apparent 
terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of 
distribution during the terminal phase (V d/F), and mean residence time (MRT).  
In addition, a single blood sample will be coll ected predose to determine the fraction unbound (f u) 
of LOXO-292 in plasma and, whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be calculated 
for unbound LOXO-292 using f u: unbound C max (C max,u), unbound AUC 0-t (AUC 0-t,u), unbound 
AUC 0-∞ (AUC 0-∞,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V d/F (V d/F,u).  
Safety: Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monito ring AEs, performing PEs and clinical laboratory 
tests (including creatine kinase [CK]), measuring vital signs, and recording ECGs. 
Sample size: The sample size chosen for this study was based  upon precedent set by other PK studies of similar 
nature and was not based on power calculations to detect statistically significant differences among groups.  At least 6 subjects each per hepatic function group are planned to complete the study. This 
is considered a sufficient sample size to eval uate the PK of LOXO-292 under various degrees of 
hepatic function. If necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, subjects who fail to complete the 
treatment or have insufficient PK data may be replaced. 
Statistical methods: Pharmacokinetics:   
All subjects who have received a dose of LOXO-292, have at least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration, and for whom at least 1 PK parame ter can be computed will be included in the PK 
Population. Plasma concentrations and PK pa rameters will be summari zed by hepatic function 
using descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic mean , standard deviation, coefficient of variation 
[CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). In addition, summary statistics for protein binding will be tabulated by hepatic function group. 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of LOXO-292 after a single dose 
in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, compared to subjects with normal 
hepatic function. The following statistical met hodology will be used, based on 1 to 1 matching: 
The 90% confidence interval of C
max and AUCs for the ratio between each level of impaired hepatic

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 9 of 55 function versus the control group will be presented. Furthermore, if an individual healthy subject is 
matched to 1 subject from any or all hepatic impa irment groups, then the primary PK parameters, 
Cmax and AUCs, will be analyzed using the paired  t-test to assess the di fference between each 
impaired group and the healthy group. The p-valu e assessing the difference be tween each impaired 
group and the healthy group will be presented. Fo r cases where 1 to 1 matching between the healthy 
and hepatic impaired groups are not achieved, an analysis of variance will be conducted. The 
specific procedures will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Safety:  
All subjects who receive a dose of LOXO-292 and have at least 1 postdose safety assessment will 
be included in the safety analyses. All safety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital signs 
measurements, clinical laboratory (including CK) results, PE results, concomitant medications, and 
ECG interpretations, will be tabulated and summarized where possible, using descriptive 
methodology by hepatic function group and, as needed, by timepoint. No formal statistical analyses are planned for the safety data. Interim reviews of safety data are planned for the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impairment subjects), and the first 2 subjects from Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment 
subjects).

Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB)1 for detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism,  clinical studies, an d adverse event (AE) 
profile of the investigati onal medicinal product (IMP). 
1.1. Background 
LOXO-292 is a small molecule and selective in hibitor of the rearranged during transfection 
(RET) receptor tyrosine kinase designed to competitively block the adenosine triphosphate 
binding site of the kinase. LOXO-292 was at leas t 250-fold more selective for RET than for 98% 
of 329 other kinases tested in a large in vitro screen. Consistent with such a high degree of 
selectivity, LOXO-292 caused significant cytoto xicity in human cancer cell lines that harbored 
endogenous, clinically relevant R ET gene alterations but was much  less cytotoxic against human 
cancer cell lines without RET alte rations. Potent and selective inhibition of RET may provide 
clinical benefit to subjects with malignancies du e to oncogenic alterations in RET or with other 
mechanisms of increased RET activity. 
1.2. Summary of Nonclinical Studies 
Cardiac safety of LOXO-292 was evaluated in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vitro assay 
for human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) activity, in a GL P in vivo study in conscious 
telemetry-instrumented minipigs, and in a GLP 28-day repeat-dose toxicology study (with 
electrocardiogram [ECG] monitoring) in minipigs. LOXO-292 had a 50% inhibitory 
concentration (IC 50) value of 1.1 μM in the GLP hERG assay, which is approximately 14- and 
6-fold higher than the predicted maximum unbou nd concentration at the dose of 80 mg and 
160 mg respectively twice daily (BID). Ther e were no LOXO-292-related changes in any 
cardiovascular endpoints including QT interval co rrected for heart rate (QTc) at doses up to 
12 mg/kg in the safety pharmacology cardiovascu lar study in conscious minipigs. Furthermore, 
there were no LOXO-292-related ECG changes in  the 28-day repeat-dos e toxicity study in 
minipigs at the high dose of 12 mg/kg. Together , these data indicate that LOXO-292 has a low 
risk of inducing delayed ventricular repolar ization, prolongation of the QTc interval, and 
unstable arrhythmias. 
Administration of LOXO-292 at single doses up to 45 mg/kg in male rats had no effect on 
respiratory function. Potential effects of LOXO-292 on the central nervous system were evaluated as part of the 
GLP 28-day repeat-dose study in rats, in functio nal observational batter y tests and locomotor 
activity assessments. Findings were limited to animals receiving the high dose on Week 4 of the dosing phase, and were attributed  to poor general body condition a nd weight changes associated 
with LOXO-292 administration rather than sp ecific neurological effects. Additionally, no 
microscopic abnormalities in neuronal tissues were found. 
In toxicology studies of L OXO-292 that were conducted in th e rat and minipig, the primary 
pathologic findings for both species were in  the tongue, pancreas, bone marrow and lymphoid 
tissues; while the gastrointestinal tract and ovaries  were target tissues in minipig. Other target 
tissues identified in the rat included: multi-ti ssue mineralization, physeal cartilage, incisor teeth,

Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 16 of 55 lung, Brunner’s gland, and possibly liver. Assessment of doses associated with 
moribundity/death revealed a steep dose respons e curve for both species. LOXO-292 was not 
mutagenic in the GLP bacterial mutation assa y. When evaluated in two in vitro assays, 
LOXO-292 was not genotoxic. LOXO- 292 was not found to be phototoxic when evaluated in an 
in vitro neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay. 
In repeated dose toxicity studi es in Sprague-Dawley Rats, minor  changes suggestive of hepatic 
effects were higher alanine aminotransferase (A LT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in 
males ( ≥ 20 mg/kg/day) and females ( ≥ 50 mg/kg/day), higher aspart ate aminotransferase (AST) 
levels in those receiving the high-dose (both se xes), and a higher choles terol concentration in 
males ( ≥ 20 mg/kg/day). Reversible, LOXO-292-related decreases in liver and thymus weights 
occurred in males at 75 and 45 mg/kg/day, respectively. None of these minor changes were 
correlated to any liver findings microscopically, suggesting minor functional alterations of the 
liver rather than overt hepatocellular injury. ALP levels were also increased in Göttingen 
minipigs administered 5 or 12 mg /kg/day in repeated dose toxicity studies; however, this change 
had no associated clinical or microscopic findings and was considered not adverse. 
Based on preclinical pharmacology experiments with  human cancer cells in vitro and in murine 
xenograft models, meaningful inhibition of RET in tu mors is expected to be achievable with oral 
dosing regimens ≥  40 mg/day. 
Based on the nonclinical profile, including results from animal toxicology studies, theoretical 
risks of human exposure to LOXO-292 include th e following: loss of appetite, decrease in body 
weight, increase in total white blood cells, neut rophils, and monocytes, decrease in albumin, 
increase in globulin, decreased albumin:globulin ratio, decrease in tota l protein, increased body 
temperature, lethargy, increase in  cholesterol and trig lycerides, increase in phosphorus, changes 
in taste sensation and/or development of xerost omia, gastrointestinal symptoms/signs: nausea, 
vomiting, loose stools, abdominal discomfort, decreases in red cell mass (red blood cell, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit) and reticulocytes, decrease in platelets, increases in liver function tests 
(ALP, AST, and ALT). 
LOXO-292 has been given orally an d intravenously to mice, rats, dogs, and minipigs. Oral PK 
has also been determined in the monkey. LOXO-292 was absorbed and bioavailable in all 
species tested. Solubility studi es and pharmacokinetic studies s uggest that the pharmacokinetic 
exposure of LOXO-292 may be reduced by proton pump inhibitors and other antacids. LOXO-292 appears to be metabolized primar ily by cytochrome p450 (CYP)3A4, but at 
therapeutically relevant exposures , it is not anticipated to i nhibit or induce drug-metabolizing 
enzymes. LOXO-292 is also a substrate for the Breast Cancer Resistance Protein. 
Refer to the current IB
1 for detailed background information on LOXO-292. 
1.3. Summary of Clinical Studies 
LOXO-292 is currently being studied in an ongoing global Phase 1/2 study (Study 
LOXO-RET-17001) in patients with a dvanced solid tumors including RET  fusion-positive 
NSCLC, RET-mutant medullary thyroid carcinoma, and other tumors with increased RET 
activity. The starting dose of LOXO-292 was 20 mg once daily. As of July 19, 2018 data cut-off 
Page 105 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 17 of 55 date, safety data was available from 153 pa tients with 240 mg BID as the highest dose 
administered. As of this date, two dose-limiting toxicities of tumor lysis syndrome and Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia at the 240 mg BID dose level have been reported. The most frequently 
reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; > 10% of patients), were dry mouth 
(20.3%; 14.4% related), diarrhea (15.7%; 7.2%  related), fatigue (15.7%; 11.8% related), 
constipation (12.4%; 2.6% related), headache (1 1.1%; 3.3% related), an d hypertension (10.5%; 
3.9% related). Regarding TEAEs ≥Grade 3, eight patients experienced Grade 3 TEAEs that were 
judged by the Investigator as related to study dru g. Three patients have died within 28 days of 
their last dose of study drug, no deaths have b een attributed to study drug. A small number of 
patients have experienced Grade 3 or higher liver function test (LFT) abnormalities, considered 
related to study drug, occurring between 20 to 56  days after starting LOXO-292. These changes 
were asymptomatic and resolved with dose interruption, with LOXO-292 resumed at a lower 
dose following normalization of the LFTs. 
As of August 24, 2018, PK data were available from 141 patients (from the global Phase 1/2 
study). LOXO-292 is absorbed after oral administration with a median time to maximum concentration (t
max) of approximately 2 hours. Although the PK sampling of LOXO-292 was not 
long enough to adequately characterize AUC 0-∞, the half-life appears to be approximately 
20 hours. Low concentrations of LOXO-292 we re recovered as unchanged drug in urine 
indicating that the kidney cont ributes to overall clearance. 
As of September 14, 2018, Loxo Oncology has initi ated 16 single patient protocols, Special 
Access Scheme, or Temporary Authorization Us e cases to provide access to LOXO-292 for 
patients with clinical need not meeting eligibil ity criteria for the ongoing global Phase 1/2 study. 
To date, no TEAEs have been attributed to study drug for these patients. 
Preliminary PK data available from ongoing studies (LOXO-RET-18014 and 
LOXO-RET-18015) being conducted in healthy subjects indicate that LOXO-292 has an 
estimated apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) of approximately 24 hours after a single 
dose. Refer to the current IB
1 for detailed and updated background clinical study information on 
LOXO-292. 
1.4. Study Rationale 
Liver disease can cause alterations in drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PK). Such 
alterations can reduce the clea rance of drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary 
excretion and affect plasma protein binding, whic h in turn could influence the processes of 
absorption, distribution, and elimination. Refer to the IB1 for detailed background information on 
LOXO-292. Results from this study will provide information on the safety, tolerability, and 
exposure of LOXO-292 in participan ts with hepatic impairment and participants with normal 
hepatic function.  
This study is being conducted to provide info rmation to develop dosing recommendations for 
LOXO-292 in subjects with hepatic impairment. The current study will be carried out in subjects

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 18 of 55 with hepatic impairment according to 3 different Child-Pugh (CP) categories2,3 (mild, moderate, 
and severe impairment) and also in  matched-control healthy subjects. 
There are several methods used to categorize th e severity of hepatic impairment. Despite its 
imperfections, the CP classification is the most  widely used and is an acceptable method 
supported by regulatory agencies  (including the United States  Food and Drug Administration 
[FDA] and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency [EMA]). The FDA and EMA Guidelines 
recommend that the “number of subjects enrolled  should be sufficient to detect clinically 
relevant PK differences.” In the current study, up  to 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, up 
to 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, up to 8 subjects with severe hepatic impairment, 
and approximately 8 to 16 healthy subjects with  normal hepatic function will be enrolled. The 
PK and safety profiles between each hepatic impairment group and their matching (age, sex, and 
body mass index [BMI]) healthy subjects will be compared. 
1.5. Benefit-risk Assessment 
Subjects in the current study will not  receive any health benefit (b eyond that of an assessment of 
their medical status) from participating in the st udy. The risks of particip ation are primarily those 
associated with adverse reactions to the st udy treatments, although there may also be some 
discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. Mo re information about 
the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated AEs associated with 
LOXO-292 may be found in the current IB.1  
2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 
2.1. Objectives 
The objectives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the PK profile of LOXO-292 in  subjects with impaired hepatic function 
compared to matched-control healthy subjects; 
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of LOXO-292 in subjects with impaired hepatic 
function and matched-cont rol healthy subjects. 
2.2. Endpoints 
The following PK parameters will be calculate d whenever possible, based on the plasma 
concentrations of LOXO-292: maximum observed concentration (C max), (t max, area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) from Hour 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC 0-t), 
AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), percentage extrapolation for AUC (%AUC extrap), 
apparent terminal elimination rate constant ( λz), apparent terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), 
apparent systemic clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribu tion during the terminal phase 
(Vd/F), and mean residence time (MRT).  
In addition, a single blood sample will be collected predose to determine the fraction unbound (f
u) of LOXO-292 in plasma and, whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be

unbound AUC 0-∞ (AUC 0-∞,u), unbound CL/F (CL/F, u), and unbound V d/F (V d/F,u). 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring AEs, performing physical examinations 
(PEs) and clinical laboratory tests (including creatine kinase [CK]), measuring vital signs, and recording ECGs. 
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This study is an open-label, nonrandomized, mu lti-center, single-dose, parallel-group study to 
determine the PK, safety, and tolerability of L OXO-292 administered orally at a dose of 160 mg 
to fasted adult males and females with mild, mo derate, or severe impaired hepatic function and 
healthy subjects with normal hepatic function. Hepatic function will be classified based on the 
CP classification of  hepatic impairment
2,3 (Table 1 ). 
Subjects will be recruited in this  study so that up to 24 subjects with hepatic impairment (up to 8 
subjects with mild impairment, up to 8 subjects with moderate impairment, and up to 8 subjects 
with severe impairment, per CP classification – assessed at Screening and verified at Check-in 
[Day -1]) and approximately 8 to 16 subjects with normal hepatic function are enrolled, with the goal of having at least 6 subjects  from each hepatic impairment group and at least 6 subjects with 
normal hepatic function complete the study. Subj ects will be enrolled within the following 
groups based on their CP score at Screening and Check-in (Day -1) as judged by the Investigator 
(or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, and Sponsor: 
• Group 1: Matched-control healthy subjects with normal hepatic function;  
• Group 2: Subjects with mild hepatic impairment  (CP Class A, score of 5 or 6);  
• Group 3: Subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (CP Class B, score of 7 to 9);  
• Group 4: Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (CP Class C, sc ore of 10 to 15);  
A parallel design strategy will be adopted for the hepatic impairment groups. An interim review of the safety data will be conducted as detailed in Section 8.2. 
Each matched-control healthy subject (Group 1)  will be demographically matched (1:1) by age 
(± 10 years), BMI (± 20 %), and sex to the completed hepatic impairment subject(s). Should another hepatic impairment subject be identified with whom an already enrolled healthy subject 
is demographically matched, the healthy subject ma y also be matched with that impaired subject 
as long as the impaired subject is in a different hepatic impa irment group. Each subject with 
normal hepatic function may be matched with up to  1 subject within each hepatic impairment 
group. 
The schematic of the study design is displayed in  Figure 1 . The start of the study is defined as the 
date the first subject who is enrolled in the study signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Note 
that enrolled subjects are defined as those s ubjects who are assigned a dose of study drug; this 
definition excludes screen failure subjects.

3.3. Discussion of Study Design 
A single-dose, parallel design is th e standard design to investigate the PK of a drug in subjects 
with hepatic impairment. A parallel design is required to include subjects with hepatic 
impairment and matched-control healthy subjec ts with normal hepatic function. A single dose 
level of LOXO-292 will be used because it has linear PK. The study will be open label because 
study endpoints are objective rather than subjective. 
Based on the PK data from previous studies in  healthy subjects, LOXO-292 has an estimated t 1/2 
of approximately 24 hours after a sing le dose (based on current ongoing studies: 
LOXO-RET-18014 and LOXO-RET-18015). Matched-control healthy subj ects with normal 
hepatic function will be enrolled in this study to serve as a refe rence group for interpretation of 
the results. Patients with a range of hepatic impair ment will be included to enhance the ability to 
detect and characterize the effects of hepa tic function on the PK of LOXO-292. Based on 
nonclinical and clinical data, and the known PK profile of th e compound, the duration of the 
treatment period is considered adequa te to achieve the study objectives.1 Oral doses were chosen 
because this is the intended c linical route of administration. 
Preclinical and clinical data suggest that L OXO-292 is likely to be well tolerated in healthy 
human subjects and may have an acceptable safety  margin. However, studies in animals suggest 
that the liver may be a potenti al target of toxicity for this drug. Liver disease can cause 
alterations in drug disposition, reducing the clearance of drugs e liminated by hepatic metabolism 
or biliary excretion and affect plasma protein binding, which in turn could influence the 
processes of distribution and elimination. Theref ore, in this study, a cautious approach will be 
adopted, where the first 4 subjects from Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects), the first 
4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic impair ment subjects), and the first 2 subjects from 
Page 110 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 22 of 55 Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment subjects) may be dosed concurrently, followed by an interim 
review of the safety data – and possibly PK data – before dosing is resumed for the remaining 
subjects in any (all) group(s) (see Section 8.2 ). 
3.4. Selection of Doses in the Study 
An oral dose has been selected for this study because this is the intend ed clinical route of 
administration. The dose of 160 mg of LOXO-292 was selected based on clinical study results 
and its observed PK profile. The 160-mg dose is expected to ensure sufficient quantifiable 
plasma concentrations of LOXO-292 for determina tion of systemic PK exposure. In a Phase 1/2 
clinical study in cancer pa tients (LOXO-RET-17001), 160 mg  of LOXO-292 dosed BID has 
been evaluated and has been selected for further testing in a larger numbe r of cancer patients to 
evaluate its safety and efficacy. Current FDA guidance4 stipulates that a single-dose study may 
be satisfactory where prior evidence indicates that multiple-dose PK is accurately predicted by single-dose data for both parent  drug and active metabolites (e g, when the drug and active 
metabolites exhibit linear and time-independent PK  at the concentrations anticipated in the 
patients to be studied). Thus, the current st udy will assess the PK of a single dose of 160 mg 
LOXO-292 in healthy and hepati cally impaired subjects.  
4.  SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
Up to 8 subjects will be enrolled into each hepa tic impairment treatment group to have at least 
6 subjects from each group complete the study. Up to 16 subjects will be enrolled into the 
matched-control healthy subject group to have at least 6 healthy subjects matched to each hepatic 
impairment treatment group complete the study. Healthy control subjects will be matched 
demographically to hepatically im paired subjects as noted in Section 3.1.

4.5. Subject Number and Identification 
Subjects will be assigned into groups ba sed on their level of hepatic function (Table 2 ) and will 
be assigned a number by clinical  site staff based on the assigned group. Assignment of numbers 
within each group will be in ascending order and no numbers will be omitted. Subject number 
will consist of 6 digits in which the first set of 3 digits will iden tify the site and the second set of 
3 digits will identify the subject (eg, 001-101) . Subject numbers will be used on all study 
documentation. For subjects who are withdrawn by the Investigator (or designee) or who 
voluntarily withdraw prematurely from the study, replacement subjects will be enrolled only if 
deemed necessary by the Sponsor. If necessary, as determined by the Sponsor, subjects who fail 
to complete the treatment or have insufficient PK data may be replaced. Replacement subjects 
will be assigned a subject number by adding 400 to the last 3 digits of the subject number for the subject they are replacing (eg, Subject Number  001-501 replaces Subject Number 001-101-105).

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 31 of 55 4.6. Removal of Subjects from  Study Participation 
Subjects will be informed that they are free to  withdraw from the study at any time and for any 
reason. The Investigator (or de signee) may remove a subject from the study if, in the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) opini on, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue the 
study. Subjects may be withdrawn because of the following: change in compliance with 
inclusion/exclusion criter ion that is clinically relevant and affects subj ect safety, occurrence of 
AEs, occurrence of pregnancy, intake of nonperm itted concomitant medication that might affect 
subject safety or study assessments/objectives, et c. Notification of wit hdrawal will immediately 
be made to the Study Monitor. In case of withdr awal, efforts will be made to perform all final 
study day assessments ( Appendix 5). The date the subject is withdrawn from the study and the 
reason for withdrawal will be r ecorded on the subject’s electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). All 
withdrawn subjects will be followe d until resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs 
are judged by the Investigator (or designee) to have stabilized. 
The entire study may be discontinued at the discre tion of the Investigator (or designee), Sponsor, 
or Covance Medical Monitor based on the occurrence of the following: 
• Adverse events unknown to date with respect to  their nature, severity, and/or duration; 
• Increased frequency and/or severity  and/or duration of known AEs; 
• Medical or ethical reasons affecting th e continued performance of the study; 
• Difficulties in the recruitment of subjects; 
• Cancellation of drug development. 
In the event that the study is terminated early, the Sponsor or its designee will provide specific 
guidance to the investigational sites regarding the end of study procedures. 
4.7. Matching Process 
A matched-control healthy subject will be matched to hepatically impaired subjects (age 
[± 10 years], BMI [± 20%], and sex). An indivi dual matched-control healthy subject may be 
matched with up to 1 subject within each hepa tic impairment group (ie, to a maximum of 
3 hepatically impaired subjects across the study [1  mild, 1 moderate, and 1 severe], but to no 
more than 1 subject in each impairment group). A listing of the matched subjects will be included in the Clinical Study Report. 
5. STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1. Description, Storage, Packaging, and Labeling 
The Sponsor (or designee) will provide the Investig ator (or designee) with adequate quantities of 
the study drug (Table 3 ).

aSpecific ingredients/purity will be identified in the Certificate of Analysis (or equivalent) that is supplied with the study d rug. 
bThe 20-mg dose will only be used if dosing is decrea sed following the interim review of safety data ( Section 8.2). 
The IMP (capsule containing 20 mg [if applicable following interim analysis] or 80 mg 
LOXO-292) will be supplied by the Sponsor (or de signee), along with the batch/lot numbers and 
Certificate of Analysis.  It will be provided in high density polyethylene bottles and stored 
according to the instructions on the label. 
Study drugs will be stored at the study site in a location that is locked with restricted access. 
The bulk drug container and unit dose containers  will be labeled in accordance with national 
laws and regulations. The study drug will be st ored in accordance with the labeling. The study 
drugs will be transferred from bulk supplies into the subject’s dose container by qualified clinical 
site employees. Each unit dose containe r will be appropr iately labeled. 
5.2. Study Treatment Administration 
Subjects will receive a single dose of LOXO-292, given orally as two 80-mg capsules (160 mg 
total dose) orally in the morning on Day 1. The dose of LOXO-292 will be given within 
15 minutes following predose blood sample collection. If dosing is decreased in hepatic subjects 
following the interim review of safety data (Section 8.2 ), healthy matched-control subjects will 
be dosed at the lower dose in order to provide  appropriate matches to hepatically impaired 
subjects. Each unit dose will be prepared by qualified c linical staff. Each unit dose container will be 
appropriately labeled. Appropriate unit dose(s), as desc ribed above, will be administered to consecutively numbered 
subjects. Although the timing of events requires that each subject will be consistently 
administered the appropriate dose at a specific time, the exact dose time of consecutive subjects 
may be staggered to obviate the need to have all subjects on precisely the same study schedule. 
For each dose, the subject’s actual dose time w ill be recorded in the source documents and 
transcribed into the eCRF. Each dose of LOXO-292 will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL of room 
temperature water. Doses will be preceded by a fast of at least 2 hours from food (not including water) and will be followed by a fast from food (not  including water) for at least 1 hour postdose. 
Subjects will restrict their consum ption of water for 1 hour prior to  dose; at all other times during 
the study, matched-control healthy subjects may consume water ad libitum and hepatically 
impaired subjects may consume water in a manne r consistent with their medical condition.

the occurrence of an AE(s) and/or study procedure(s). 
5.3. Randomization 
This is a nonrandomized study. The st udy has a fixed treatment sequence.  
5.4. Blinding 
This is an open-label study. 
5.5. Treatment Compliance 
The following measures will be employed to ensure treatment compliance: 
• All doses will be administered under the superv ision of suitably qualifi ed study site staff. 
• Immediately after dose administration, visual inspection of the mouth and hands will be 
performed for each subject. 
• At each dosing occasion, a predose and postdose inventory of LOXO-292 will be 
performed. 
5.6. Drug Accountability 
The Investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate reco rd of the receipt of LOXO-292 
capsules received. In addition, an accurate drug disposition record  will be kept, specifying the 
amount dispensed to each subject and the date of  dispensing. This drug accountability record will 
be available for inspection at any time. At the completion of the study, the original drug 
accountability record will be available for review by the Sponsor upon request. 
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon satisfactory completion of the compliance and ac countability procedures. Any unused assembled 
unit doses will be retained until completion of the study. 
At the completion of the study, all unused LOXO- 292 capsules will be return ed to the Sponsor or 
disposed of by the study site, per the Sponsor’s written instructions. 
6. CONCOMITANT THERAPIES AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS 
6.1. Concomitant Therapies 
Subjects will refrain from participation in any other investigational st udy drug trial in which 
receipt of any investigational dr ug occurs within 5 half -lives (if known) or 30 days, whichever is 
longer, prior to dose administration (Day 1). 
All prescription and over-the-counter medicatio ns (including proton pum p inhibitors, herbal 
products, natural or herbal suppl ements) are prohibited for 14 days prior to dose administration 
(Day 1) and throughout the study, unless deemed acceptable by the Covance Medical Monitor,

stabilize the subject’ s underlying medical condition (or concurrent baseline conditions) as 
described below. Moderate or strong CYP3A4 an d/or CYP3A5 inhibitors or inducers and strong 
P-gp inhibitors are prohibited for 14 days prio r to dose administration (Day 1) and throughout 
the study. 
For hepatically impaired subjects, the use of prescription and nonprescription medications that 
are needed to stabilize the subject’s underlying medical condi tion (or concurrent baseline 
conditions) and deemed acceptable by the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee) 
and Sponsor are allowed, provided that the subject has been on a stable dose for a minimum of 
30 days prior to study drug administration. Hepati cally impaired subjects must be able to 
withhold the use of these medications for 2 hours predose and 4 hours postdose on the day of 
study drug administration, unless approved by the C ovance Medical Monitor,  Investigator (or 
designee), and Sponsor. Short-term medication ad justments may be made  upon consultation with 
the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and Sponsor per the Medical 
Responsibility Plan. The use of additional medicati ons is to be avoided from 14 days prior to 
study drug administration until study completion unle ss required to treat an AE. All concomitant 
medications will be reviewed by the Covance Medi cal Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and 
Sponsor prior to subject approval. 
Any medication taken by a subjec t during the course of the study, including details of its dosage, 
administration, and the reason for its use, will be documented in the eCRF. The administration of any concomitant medicatio n during the study is proh ibited without prior 
approval of the Covance Medical Monitor, Investigator (or desi gnee), and Sponsor, unless its use 
is deemed necessary in a medical emergency. In this case, the use of th e concomitant medication 
will be reported as s oon as is practical. 
6.2. Diet, Fluid, and Activity Control 
Matched-control healthy subjects are required to  refrain from use of tobacco, smoking cessation 
products, and nicotine-containing products within 3 months prior to Screening and during the 
entire study. Hepatically impaired  subjects are required to refrain from the use of tobacco- and 
nicotine-containing products  within 2 hours prior to dos ing and for 4 hours postdose. 
Consumption of grapefruit, grap efruit juice, or Seville orange s from 14 days prior to dose 
administration (Day 1) and throughout the st udy will not be allowed unless deemed acceptable 
by the Covance Medical M onitor, Investigator (o r designee), and Sponsor. 
Subjects are required to abstain from consuming alcohol-, citric  acid-, and caffeine-containing 
foods and beverages for 48 hours prior to Check-in (Day -1) and throughout the study, unless 
deemed acceptable by the Investigator.  
Subjects will refrain from strenuous exercise from 5 days prior to Check-in (Day -1) and during 
the period of confinement at the clinical site and will otherwise maintain their normal level of 
physical activity throughout the entire study (ie,  will not begin a new exercise program or 
participate in any unusually strenuous physic al exertion).

7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
7.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
7.1.1. Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection and Processing 
Blood samples for PK analysis of LOXO-292 plas ma levels and protein binding and potential 
analysis of metabolites will be collected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 5. The exact 
time of the study drug administration and the actual time of blood sampling for PK analysis and 
protein binding will be recorded on the eCRF. 
Processing, storage, and shipping instructions for these PK bl ood and protein binding samples 
will be provided in a separate Laboratory Manual. The number of blood samples and total blood 
volume required for PK testing and protein binding is presented in Appendix 3. 
7.1.2. Analytical Methodology 
Concentrations of LOXO-292 in plasma will be determined using a validated bioanalytical 
method. Specifics of the bioanalytical methods will be provided in a separate document. The 
concentrations of total a nd unbound LOXO-292 will be determined in a sample of predose 
plasma fortified with a known concentr ation of LOXO-292. The unbound fraction will be 
calculated based on total and unbound LOXO-292 leve ls. Samples of plasma may be analyzed 
for exploratory analyses of me tabolites. If such analyses are conducted, the results will be 
reported separately by the Sponsor. 
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments 
Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator (or designee), Covance 
Medical Monitor, or Sponsor.  
Every effort will be made to schedule and perform the procedures in accordance with the 
nominal time, giving considerations to appropriate postu re conditions, practical  restrictions, and 
any other procedures to be perf ormed at the same timepoint. The order of priority for scheduling 
procedures around a timepoint is (i n descending order of priority): 
• Dosing; 
• Pharmacokinetic blood sampling; 
• Vital signs assessments; 
• Electrocardiograms; 
Page 124 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 36 of 55 • Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratories; 
• Physical examination. 
7.2.1. Adverse Events 
Adverse event definitions; assignment of seve rity, causality, action taken, and outcome; and 
procedures for reporting SAEs are detailed in Appendix 1. 
Subjects will be asked a nonleadi ng HDYF? question such as “Hav e there been any changes in 
your health status since Screen ing/since you were last asked?” at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix 5 (ie, at Screening [after the ICF is signed ], at Check-in (Day -1), at each postdose 
vital signs assessment, and at an appropriate time for all other days). Subjects will also be 
encouraged to voluntarily report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. 
All AEs, whether volunteered, identified by the s ubject’s responses to HDYF? inquiries, or noted 
on PE, ECG, vital signs assessments, or laborat ory tests, will be reco rded throughout the study 
(ie, from signing of the ICF until Study Completion), either as subject medical history (if the 
event is present  prior to signing of the Informed Consent) or as  AEs (if the event occurs after 
administration of LOXO-292). Between the time of ICF signing to administration of LOXO-292 
only AEs assessed as related to study procedures should be repor ted.  All SAEs that develop 
from the time of ICF signing until Study Completion are to be reported.   Following Clinic 
Discharge, only AEs or SAEs assessed as related to study drug  should be reported. 
All AEs (nonserious and serious) should be followed until resolution, return to baseline, 
assessment as stable by the Inves tigator (or designee), or until the subject withdraws consent or 
is lost to follow-up. 
Subjects will receive a Safety Follow-up phone call approximately 7 days after they are 
discharged from the clinical site to determine if  any AE has occurred sin ce the last study visit. 
At all times, a subject may be required to remain at  the clinical site for longer at the discretion of 
the Investigator (or designee). Any event that meets the criteria of a Susp ected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(SUSAR) will be reported to the IRB/IEC accord ing to site policy by the Investigator (or 
designee) and to regulatory authorities by th e Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to 
regulatory authority requirements. Refer to Refere nce Safety Information in the current IB for 
LOXO-292 for expected adverse reactions.
 
7.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemis try panel [fasted at l east 8 hours], coagulation 
parameters, CBC, thyroid-stimulating hormone, he moglobin A1c [hepatic subjects only], and 
UA) will be collected at the timepoints specified in Appendix 5. 
Screens for HCV antibody, HBsAg, and HIV antibody will be performed at Screening. A drug 
screen for selected drugs of abuse will be performed at Screening and repeated at Check-in 
Page 125 of 163

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 37 of 55 (Day -1; including an alcohol br eath test for all subjects a nd, for matched-control healthy 
subjects only, including cotinine). A serum qualitative pregna ncy test (females only) and a 
follicle-stimulating hormone test (postmenopausal  females only) will be performed at the 
timepoints specified in Appendix 5.  
The number of blood samples and total blood volume required for clinical laboratory evaluations 
is presented in Appendix 3 . A list of the specific evaluation is in Appendix 2 . 
7.2.3. Vital Signs 
Vital signs (including oral temperature, respiratory rate, and supine BP and HR) will be obtained 
at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 5. 
Blood pressure and HR measuremen ts should be performed using the same arm for each reading 
and measurements should be taken after the subject has been resting in the supine position for at least 5 minutes.  
When vital signs assessments are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, the blood draws 
will be obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and th e vital signs will be obtained prior to and as 
close as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.4. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram 
A 12-lead ECG (including PR, RR, QRS, and QT in terval parameters) will be obtained after the 
subject has been resting for at le ast 10 minutes in the supine po sition at the timepoints specified 
in Appendix 5 . The QT interval will be corrected for HR by Fridericia’s (QTcF = QT/[RR]
1/3) 
formulae. 
When 12-lead ECGs are scheduled at the same  time as blood draws, the blood draws will be 
obtained at the scheduled timepoint, and the 12-lead  ECGs will be obtained prior to and as close 
as possible to the scheduled blood draw. 
7.2.5. Physical Examination 
A complete or abbreviated PE will be performed at the timepoints specified in Appendix 5. 
Complete PEs will evaluate general app earance and the following body systems/organs: 
dermatological; head and eyes; ears, nose, mouth, and throat; pulmonary; cardiovascular; 
abdominal; lymphatic; musculoskeletal/extremities; and neurological. Weight and height will be 
recorded (height only recorded during Screening). 
The PE at Screening will include  hepatic encephalopathy and as cites evaluations for the CP 
assessment. Abbreviated PEs will evaluate general appearance and the following body systems/organs: 
dermatological; pulmonary; cardiovasc ular; abdominal; and neurological.

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 38 of 55 8. SAMPLE SIZE AND DATA ANALYSIS 
8.1. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size chosen for this study was based upon precedent set by other PK studies of 
similar nature and was not based on power calcu lations to detect statistically significant 
differences among groups. Six subjects each per hepatic function group are planned to complete 
the study. This is considered a sufficient samp le size to evaluate the PK of LOXO-292 under 
various degrees of hepatic function. 
8.2. Interim Analysis 
Interim reviews of safety data will be conducted for each group when the first 4 subjects from 
Group 2 (mild hepatic impairment subjects) are enro lled and have completed the study, when the 
first 4 subjects from Group 3 (moderate hepatic  impairment subjects) are enrolled and have 
completed the study, and when the first 2 subjects from Group 4 (severe hepatic impairment subjects), are enrolled and have completed th e study. These safety data will include AEs and 
serious AEs (SAEs), vital signs, PEs,  ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. If available, PK data 
and matched-control healthy subject data may al so be used during the review. Enrollment and 
dosing for remaining subjects in any group may o ccur after the interim da ta for that group are 
reviewed and the Covance Medical  Monitor, Investigator (or de signee), and Sponsor agree it is 
safe to proceed with dosing. 
Each interim review will be a teleconfer ence between the Covance Medical Monitor, 
Investigator (or designee), and/or Sponsor to discuss safety data.  Following the interim review of safety data for a group, the dose level may be decreased for the 
remaining subjects in any group pending disc ussion and agreement between the Covance 
Medical Monitor, Investigator (or designee), and/ or Sponsor. If dosing is decreased, it will also 
be decreased for the impaired subjects’ re spective matched-control healthy subjects. 
8.3. Analysis Populations 
8.3.1. Study Populations 
The PK Population  will consist of all subjects who have  received a dose of LOXO-292, have at 
least 1 quantifiable plasma concentration, and for whom at least 1 PK parameter can be 
computed. The Safety Population  will consist of all subjects who rece ived at least 1 dose of study drug and 
have at least 1 postdos e safety assessment. 
8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Whenever possible, the following PK parameters will be calculated for each subject, based on 
the plasma concentrations of LOXO-292, and according to the model independent approach:

Plasma concentrations and PK parameters will be summarized by hepatic function with 
descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation 
[CV%], geometric mean, geometric CV%, median, minimum, and maximum). In addition, summary statistics for protein binding w ill be tabulated by hepatic function group. 
The primary analysis planned for this study is to evaluate the PK of  LOXO-292 after a single 
dose in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. The following statistica l methodology will be used, based on 1 to 1 
matching: 
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed on the ln transformed AUC
0-t, AUC 0-∞, 
and C max. The ANCOVA model will contain a categorical  factor of population for subjects with 
varied degree hepatic impairment (severe, m oderate, and mild) and healthy matched control 
subjects, a categorical covariate (sex), and conti nuous covariates (age and BMI). Ratios of least 
squares means (LSM) and 90% CIs will be calcul ated using the exponentiation of the difference 
between renal function cohort LSM from the ANCOVA analyses on the ln transformed AUC 0-t, 
AUC 0-∞, and C max. The specific procedures will  be documented in the SAP. 
All statistical calculations will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or greater. 
8.6. Statistical Analyses  of Safety Data 
All subjects who received a dose of LOXO-292 and have at least 1 postd ose safety assessment 
will be included in the safety analyses. All sa fety assessments, including AEs and SAEs, vital 
signs measurements, clinical laboratory (including CK) results, PE results, concomitant 
medications, and ECG interpretations, will be ta bulated and summarized where possible, using 
descriptive methodology by hepatic function group and, as needed, by timepoint. Unless otherwise specified, baseline va lue is defined as the last nonmissing measurement before 
administration of the study drug. No formal statis tical analyses are planned for the safety data. 
The incidence of AEs for each hepatic function w ill be presented by severity (matched control 
healthy subjects, mild, moderate, and severe) a nd by relationship to study drug as determined by 
the Investigator (see Appendix 1 for AE reporting). All treatment-emergent AEs will be 
summarized by system organ class and preferre d term, with a breakdown by hepatic function, 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. 
8.7. Data Handling and Record Keeping 
Any changes to information in the trial progress notes and other source documents will be 
initialed and dated on the day the change is made by a clinical site staff member authorized to 
make the change. Changes will be made by striking a single line through erroneous data and clearly entering the correct data (eg, wrong data right data). If th e reason for the change is not 
apparent, a brief explanation fo r the change will be written adjacent to the change by the 
clinician. 
The Data Management Plan will be approved by the Sponsor.

by the Covance scientific team. The eCRF and ancillary data will be converted into final SAS® 
datasets following Study Data Tabulation Model or client-provided spec ifications. The final 
datasets structure will be verified  using Web Submission Data Manager®, while the dataset 
content will be peer reviewed by an independent programmer. 
The tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) will be programmed per the final SAP. All TFLs will be peer reviewed by an independent programmer. In addition, draft TFLs will be reviewed by the Covance scientific team during the dry run and data review meetings. 
The peer review will be performed by indepe ndent programmers following the quality control 
process and programming checklists. 
8.8. Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
Quality control and quality assurance will be performed according to Covance standard operating 
procedures or per client request  and as applicable, according to  the contract between Covance 
and the Sponsor.

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 44 of 55 Appendix 1: Adverse Event Reporting 
1.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE; or adverse experience) is defined as any untow ard medical occurrence 
experienced by a patient or heal thy subject, whether or not co nsidered drug related by the 
Investigator (or designee). A treatm ent-emergent AE is an AE that  is reported after a dose of 
study drug. 
The following are all AEs: 
• Unfavorable changes in general condition; 
• Subjective or objective signs/symptoms; 
• Concomitant diseases or accidents; 
• Clinically relevant adverse changes in labor atory parameters observe d in a subject during 
a clinical study. 
Adverse events comprise all disturbances of general health status, subjective and objective 
disease symptoms (including laboratory abnormalit ies that are deemed c linically significant by 
the Investigator or designee), and accidents observed in the context of  a clinical trial, irrespective 
of a possible causal relationship with the administ ration of the trial substance. Events occurring 
in the framework of a clinical trial during drug-free and post-treatment periods, under placebo, or 
in a reference group receiving drug or nondrug ther apy are also to be designated as AEs. 
1.2 Categorization of Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be categorized based on the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Even ts (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as follows: 
• Grade 1 Mild : Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; cl inical or diagnostic observations 
only; interventi on not indicated 
• Grade 2 Moderate : Minimal, local or noninvasive in tervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental Activi ties of Daily Living (ADL)*  
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening : 
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care 
ADL**  
• Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences : Urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5 Death related to AE 
Note: Not all grades are appr opriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs ar e listed within the CTCAE with fewer than 
5 options for grade selection. Grade 5 (death) is not appr opriate for some AEs and therefore is not an option.  
* Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 45 of 55 **Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not 
bedridden. 
The Investigator (or designee) will make a dete rmination of the relationship of the AE to the 
study drug using a 2-category system acco rding to the following guidelines: 
• NOT RELATED = The time course between the ad ministration of investigational 
product and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and 
another cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, comorbidities) is 
suspected; 
• RELATED  = The time course between administra tion of investigational product and the 
occurrence or worsening of the AE is consis tent with a causal relationship and no other 
cause (eg, concomitant drugs, therapies, compli cations, comorbidities) can be identified. 
An AE is associated with the use of the drug if there is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience may have been caused by the drug. 
 
1.3 Pregnancy 
As information is available, a pregnancy (inc luding pregnancy in female partners of male 
subjects) diagnosed during the study and for up to 90 days after study drug administration should 
be reported by the Investigator (or designee) via eFax to the Sponsor’s clinical safety 
representative within 24 hours of  being notified. The Sponsor’s sa fety representative will then 
forward the Pregnancy Form to the Investigator for completion. 
eFax: +1 (203) 643-2013 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediately be withdrawn from the study 
and early termination study procedures will be performed. The subject or partner should be 
followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any 
reason before the anticipated date , the Investigator should notify the Sponsor’s clinical safety 
representative. At the completion of the pregna ncy, the Investigator will document the outcome 
of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnanc y meets the criteria fo r immediate classification 
as a serious AE (SAE; ie, postpartum complica tion, spontaneous aborti on, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), th e Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an 
SAE. 
Male subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator immediately if they discover their 
sexual partner is pregnant. In th is instance, the partner must provide written consent before 
pregnancy information can be collected. When a si te becomes aware that the female partner of a 
male subject is pregnant, they are to contact the Covance Medical Moni tor immediately (within 
24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the event) in addition to notifying the Sponsor’s 
safety representative via eFax.

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL 
Covance Study: 8393612 Protocol  Reference: LOXO-RET-18022 
Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 46 of 55 All pregnancies should be recorded on the AE  electronic Case Report Form, in addition to 
completion of the required pregnancy forms. If th e Investigator suspects that a pregnancy was 
the result of an intera ction between the study treatment and the contraceptive method, in addition 
to the pregnancy the drug interaction s hould also be captured as a separate AE. 
1.4 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE (by Food and Drug Administration [FDA] definition) is any adverse drug experience 
occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening adverse drug e xperience (ie, one that places the subject, in the view of 
the Investigator [or designee], at immediate risk of death); 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalization; 
• A persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity; 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the above outcomes. 
Important medical events that may not resu lt in death, be life th reatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
1.5 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An AE or suspected adverse drug reaction is consid ered ‘unexpected’ if the event is not listed in 
the Reference Safety Information section of the IB  or if it is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed for an unapproved investigational medicinal product. 
1.6 Reporting 
Food and Drug Administration-reporta ble AEs are AEs that are asso ciated with the use of the 
drug and represent events that are assessed as  serious, related, and unexpected. Food and Drug 
Administration-reportable AEs will be reported by the clinical site to the Sponsor, the Covance 
Medical Monitor, and the respons ible Institutional Review Board (IRB). Final determination of 
whether an event represents a SUSAR will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
Within 24 hours of when an AE that is potentiall y FDA-reportable is first recognized or reported, 
and within 24 hours of any SAE (regardless of whether the event is a ssessed as related or 
unrelated to study drug) being first recognized or reported, th e Sponsor’s clinical safety 
representative will be notified by the Investigator or designee in writing (eg, facsimile) using the 
following eFax number or email: 
Page 135 of 163
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol Final, 15 October 2018  Page 47 of 55 eFax: +1 (203) 643-2013 
email: safety@loxooncology.com 
To report the SAE, the completed report form should be sent by eF ax to the Sponsor’s clinical 
safety representative within 24 hours of awareness. Incoming reports are reviewed during normal 
business hours. Additional reporting instructions  and the SAE Report Form are provided in the 
Study Manual.  
The IRB will be notified of any FDA-reportable AE within the timeframe required by the IRB. 
The IRB Serious and Unexpected Adverse Experience Submission Form will be completed and 
submitted with the copy of the written confirmation or summary of the AE.

ICF in the presence of a suitably trained member of staff to indicate that they are freely giving 
their informed consent. One copy will be given to the subject, and the other will be maintained in 
the subject’s records. 
Subjects must be re-consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during thei r participation 
in the study. 
Subject Data Protection 
Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier and will not be identified by name in eCRFs, 
study-related forms, study reports, or any related publications. Subject and Investigator personal 
data will be treated in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. In the event the study 
protocol, study report, or study data are included in a public regist ry, all identifia ble information 
from individual subjects or Investigators will be redacted according to applicable laws and 
regulations.  
The subject must be informed that his/her pe rsonal study-related data  will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protecti on law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject. The subj ect must also be informed that his/her study-related data may 
be examined by Sponsor or Contract Research Organization (CRO [ie, Covance]) auditors or 
other authorized personnel a ppointed by the Sponsor, by appropriate IRB members, and by 
inspectors from regulatory authorities. 
Disclosure 
All information provided regarding the study, as  well as all information collected and/or 
documented during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential. The Investigator (or 
designee) agrees not to disclose  such information in any way without prior written permission 
from the Sponsor. 
Data Quality Assurance 
The following data quality steps will be implemented: 
• All relevant subject data rela ting to the study will be reco rded on eCRFs unless directly 
transmitted to the Sponsor or designee elec tronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
Investigator is responsible for verifying th at data entries are ac curate and correct by 
electronically signing the eCRF.  
• The Investigator must maintain accurate do cumentation (source data) that supports the 
information entered in the eCRF.  
• The Investigator must permit study-rela ted monitoring, audits, IRB review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.

destroyed during the retention period without  the written approval of the Sponsor. No 
records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the 
Sponsor.  
Investigator Documentation Responsibilities 
All individual, subject-specific study data will also be entered into a 21 CFR Part 11-compliant 
electronic data capture (EDC) system  on an eCRF in a timely fashion. 
All data generated from external sources (eg, laboratory and bioanalytical data), and transmitted 
to Covance electronically, will be integrated with the subject’s eCRF data in accordance with the 
Data Management Plan.  
An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject who undergoes any screening procedures, 
according to the eCRF completion instructions. The Sponsor, or CRO, will review the supporting 
source documentation against the data entered in to the eCRFs to verify the accuracy of the 
electronic data. The Investigator will ensure that corrections are made to the eCRFs and that data 
queries are resolved in a tim ely fashion by the study staff. 
The Investigator will sign and date the eCRF  via the EDC system’s electronic signature 
procedure. These signatures will indicate that th e Investigator reviewed and approved the data on 
the eCRF, data queries, and site notifications.

Desniption of Change s: 
The pmpose of this LOAC is to claiify that all subjects will have serology screening for 
hepat itis C vim s pe1fo1med as pa.it of Screening procedmes , and that the results of this screen 
must be negat ive for subjects to be eligible. 
Section 4.1, Screening Proc edures, #8, of the Protoco l will be revised as follows: 
Screens for hepati tis C v ims (HCV) antibody (fer health3/ st4jects oaly), hepatitis B smface 
antigen (HBsAg), and human immun odeficiency vims (HIV) antibody (Appendix 2); 
Section 4.4, Exclusion C riteria, Subsection All Subje cts, No. 4, co1Tect ly states that all subjec ts 
will have serology testing perfmmed :

 4. Positive serologic test for H BsAg, HCV, or HIV antibody at Screening. Subjects who are 
positive for hepatitis B virus, HCV, or HIV by antibody will re quire confirmation by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before enrollment to detect pre sence of active virus. 
Subjects who are PCR positive will not be eligible;  
 
Section 4.4, Exclusion Criteria , Subsection Additional exclusion criteria for matched-control 
healthy subjects , #30, of the protocol will be revised as follows:  
30. Positive serologic test for HCV antibody at Screening. 
Exclusion criteria No. 31 through No. 41 will be renumbered to No. 30 through No. 40, 
respectively, as a re sult of this update. 
 Reason for Changes: 
Hepatitis C virus screening is t o be performed for healthy subjects as well as hepatically 
impaired subjects. Instances in the text implying that hepatiti s C virus screening would only be 
performed for healthy subjects were removed.

The purpose of this LOAC is to allow re-screening of subjects who have failed an initial screen, 
and to allow the Spon sor to provide approva l of enro lled subjects by email. 
Section 4.2 cunently reads as follows: 
"The Covance Medical Monitor will review the medical histo1y and all screening evaluations for 
potential subjects p1ior to enrollment. Ptior to dosing , the Sponsor will provide written approval 
of subjects selected for enrol lment by the Investigator. 
Subjects who meet all the inclusion c1iteria and for whom none of the exclusion criteria apply 
will be eligible to be enrolled into the study. Safety evaluations may be repeated at the discretio n 
of the Investiga tor (or designee) , Covance Medical Monitor , or Sponsor."

 This LOA C revises Section  4.2 to read as follows :  
“The Covance Medical Monitor will review the medical history and all screening evaluations for 
potential subjects prior to enrollment. Prior to dosing, the Sponsor will provide written  approval 
of subjects selected for enrollment by the Investigator.  
Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and for whom none of the exclusion criteria apply 
will be eligible to be enrolled into the study. Safety evaluations may be repeated at the disc retion 
of the Investigator (or designee), Covance Medical Monitor, or Sponsor.  
Subjects who are determined to be screen failures are permitted to be re -screened if the PI (or 
designee), with agreement from the Covance Medical Monitor and the Sponsor, feels  that the 
subject may meet eligibility criteria upon re -screen. Re -screened patients will be provided a new 
subject number .” 
Reason for Changes:  
These  change s are being made  to allow re-screening of subjects that have failed their initial 
screen but are be lieved to be eligible for enrollment if a second screen is completed , and to allow 
approval of enrolled subjects by email .

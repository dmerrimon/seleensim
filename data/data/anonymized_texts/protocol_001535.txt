  INDIANA UNIVERSITY I NFORMED CONSENT STAT EMENT FOR  
 
Insomnia in HIV: Study I  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are infected with the Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), are 
under treatment for HIV, and may have insomnia  (lack of adequate sleep ). This study is supported by 
grants from Indiana University . The doctors in charge of this study are Dr. Samir K. Gupta and Dr. Jesse 
Stewart. Before you decide if you want to be a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 
This i s a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you about 
this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in 
this study, you will be asked to sign this cons ent form. You will get a copy to keep. 
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov , as required by U.S. 
Law. This web site will not include information that can identify you. At most, the web site will include a 
summary of the results. You can search this web site at any time.  
 
STUDY PURPOSE:  
 
People with HIV infection often have problems with sleep. The preferred method to treat insomnia  is not 
with medications, which can be addictive or lead to adverse interactions with other medications, but with a type of interactive therapy which gets to the root causes of insomnia and teaches patients how to get 
better sleep. Therefore, we wish to compare sleep i mprovement using a new interactive, internet -based 
therapy for insomnia with usual care as managed  by your primary HIV provider . This internet -based 
treatment is called SHUTi. SHUTi is effective in persons without HIV infection, but it is unknown if it 
works in persons with HIV infection. As part of this study, we will also assess how insomnia is related to 
mood, memory, attention, and physical functioning.  
 
STUDY PARTICIPANTS:  
 This trial will include patients who are at least 18 years old, have insomnia , and already are receiving 
antiretroviral therapy with viral loads (amount of HIV in the bloodstream) that are less than 75 copies  per 
milliliter, or less than 75 HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood .  
 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
 
If you agree to participate and are eligible for the s tudy, you will be one of up to 40 HIV -infected people 
here at the Indiana University or Eskenazi Health Medical Center s who will be included in the study.  
 PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:  
 
If you agree to be  in the study, you will be asked to participate in one Entry  Visit and another visit 10 
weeks later at the Infectious Diseases Research Clinic. If you are chosen to take part in the insomnia 
treatment program, then you will be a sked to complete an addition al six  sessions (one per week) to 
receive this treatment.  If you are chosen to receive usual care, then no other study related procedures or 
visits will take place until the Week 10 Visit.

 Entry  Visit  
 
The Entry Visit will take no longer than two hours  and will take place at the Infectious Diseases Research 
Clinic at the Fifth Third Office Building on the Eskenazi Health campus. At this visit, we will ask you 
about your medical and psychiatric history and the medications you take. We will also review yo ur 
medical records to document your diagnoses and laboratory results as obtained in the clinic. We will 
measure your height, weight, blood pressure, and heartrate . You will then be asked to complete a series of 
surveys related to your sleep, mood, physical  activity, fatigue, usual activities, alcohol use, tobacco use, 
and other substance use. You will also then complete tests of your memory and attention, strength, 
walking speed, and coordination.   
 
At this time, you will be randomly assigned (as if by the  roll of the dice) to one of two groups. The first 
group will receive the internet -based insomnia treatment during the next 10 weeks of the study. The 
second group will receive usual care from their primary HIV caregivers. Your primary HIV caregiver will 
be notified about the result of this randomization.  
 At the end of the Entry Visit, you will be given a sleep diary which you will complete over the next 3 
days and nights. This diary is to show how much sleep you are getting. We will call you to receive t he 
results of the sleep diary over the phone. You will also be provided a second sleep diary that we will ask 
you to complete for the 3 days after  returning for the Week 10 Visit. We will again call you to receive the 
results of the sleep diary over the ph one. 
 
The Insomnia  Treatment Used in This Study  
If you are assigned to receive the study insomnia  treatment  called SHUTi , you will have the opportunity 
to complete six 40- minute therapy sessions , one per week. These sessions will take place at Dr. Stewart’s 
office on the IUPUI campus, the Infectious Diseases Research C linic at Eskenazi Hospital , or a location 
selected by you where you can access a computer with internet, such as your home, your work, a family 
member’s/friend’s home, or a public library. Your preference will determine the location of the SHUTi 
sessions . The SHUTi sessions will be performed between the E ntry V isit and the Week 10 Visit.  
 
The insom nia treatment is an interactive computer program; therefore, you will not be meeting face -to-
face with a therapist. Through completing the sessions on a computer, you will learn techniques that have been shown to improve insomnia  in other types of patients. These techniques include learning what 
causes your lack of sleep, how to improve your chances of better sleep, and how to avoid those things that 
cause your poor sleep. Please note that this program may be  more effective in treating your insomnia  if 
you are able to complete more of these sessions. You will then be given homework  to complete before the 
next session ; homework  is to help you achieve better sleep.  
 
As part of the SHUTi program, you will be asked to enter information regarding your particular 
sleep problem. This will help SHUTi make an individual treatment plan for yo u. You will not 
enter any information that can identify yourself. You will only be known to the program by a 
unique identification number.  
 
Week 10 Visit  
 
You will then be asked to return to the Infectious Diseases Research Clinic in approximately 10  weeks 
after the Entry Visit. You will be asked to return the second sleep diary at this visit. We will review your 
medical records and medications again, especially if your doctor has started any new insomnia  treatments 
since your last visit. Your blood p ressure, temperature, and weight will also be measured again. We will

Consent Version , November 9 , 2018  
 also ask you to complete the same surveys regarding your sleep, mood, physical activity, fatigue , usual 
activities, alcohol use, tobacco use, and substance use . This visit will take no more than 1  hour.  
 
At this time your participation in the study will be completed.  
 
 
RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:  
 
Risks of possibly experiencing emotional discomfort when completing surveys  
The surveys will be given in pri vate settings. You may choose not to answer any questions that make you 
feel uncomfortable.  
 
The risks of possible loss of confidentiality   
We will not tell others other than your main HIV caregiver that you are taking part in this study. All of 
your information will be  identified with a coded number and without any personal identifying 
information. All test results will be locked in a cabinet and restricted.  
 
If you choose to undergo the SHUTi  insomnia  treatment sessions at the Dr. Stewart’s office o r the 
Infectious Diseases Research Clinic, you will be in a private location where others, besides the study team 
members, cannot see you. But please note that if you choose to undergo the SHUTi  treatment sessions in 
a public location, others around you ma y see that you are viewing an online insomnia  treatment program. 
We will give you ear bud headphones, if you do not already have headphones, if you choose to complete 
the treatment sessions at a public location.  
 
Risk of muscle soreness and falls  
There is a minor risk of muscle soreness and of falling when performing some of the tests of physical 
functioning. Our team is well -trained to minimize these risks.  
 
Suicidal thoughts  
Because this study may involve people who have depression , some participants may report thoughts of 
being better off dead or of hurting themselves. This could happen during a phone call or an in- person 
visit. IF this occurs, our protection plan will be used. You will first be asked a series of questions. If it is 
determined that immediate care is needed, the study team will contact Dr. Stewart and/or Dr. Gupta  to 
determine the right course of action. If we believe that you are in imminent danger of harm, we will have 
to report it, potentially to authorities, including the police, for your own protection. We may contact your 
primary doctor, your primary HIV caregiver, and your HIV social worker or care coordinator. We may 
also consult with Midtown Community Mental Health Center and escort you to the Crisis Intervention 
Unit at Eskenazi He alth Hospital.  
 
If you prematurely terminate a phone call after reporting suicidal thoughts, the study doctors will be 
notified to determine the right course of action. We will try to contact you back to obtain additional 
information. If it is determined that immediate care is needed and that you are in imminent danger of 
harm, we will have to report it, potentially to authorities, including the police, for your own protection. 
We may contact your primary doctor, your primary HIV caregiver, and your HIV social worker or care 
coordinator. We may also consult with Midtown Community Mental Health Center and refer you to the 
Crisis Intervention Unit at Eskenazi Health Hospital.  
 We may also then decide in this situation that is important for your own safety to end your participation in 
this trial.

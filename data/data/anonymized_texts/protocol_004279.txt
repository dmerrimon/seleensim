ImmuneSensor Therapeutics  Investigational Product:  
IMSA101  Developmental Phase:  
Phase I/IIA  
Title of Study:  Phase I/IIA Safety and Efficacy Study of IMSA101 in Patients with Advanced 
Treatment -Refractory Malignancies  
Protocol Number:  IMSA101 -101 
Study Center(s):  Approximately 5 sites for Phase I and 20 sites for Phase IIA in the United 
States (US)  
Indication:  Advanced treatment -refractory malignancies  
Study Population: Adult patients with advanced malignancies refractory to or ineligible for 
standard -of-care therapies  
Study Design: Open -label, dose  escalation (Phase I) and dose expansion (Phase IIA) study of 
patients receiving IMSA101 alone or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor 
(ICI)  (Phase I  and II ) 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• Establish safe recommended Phase II doses (RP2Ds) of IMSA101 administered as 
monotherapy  or in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)   
Secondary Objectives : 
• Characterize the safety and tolerability of IMSA101 administered to cancer patients via 
intratumoral injections as monotherapy  or in combination  
• Identify and characterize preliminary signals of anti -tumor activity including overall 
response rate (ORR), duration of treatment response (DOR), time -to-tumor progression 
(TTP), and progression -free survival time (PFS)  
• Characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of IMSA101 administered by intratumoral  
injection as monotherapy   
Exploratory Objective:  
• Assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) and biologic activity of IMSA101  
Methodology:  
All Patients:  
• Pre-treatment screening radiographic tumor assessments will be collected within 30  days 
prior to initial dose for all patients. Photographic assessments of skin lesions will be 
performed as detailed in a separate photography manual.  
• Treatment c ycles will be 28 days in duration  with lesions injected weekly on Day  1 for the 
first three weeks of Cycle 1 and then every 2 weeks during cycles 2  and beyond .

IMSA101  Developmental Phase:  
Phase I/IIA  
• A single pre -defined lesion/lesion site (longest diameter ≥ 10 mm and ≤ 50 mm) shall be 
injected throughout study duration, if possible. Where the original injection site is 
considered by the investigator  to become inaccessible, a second lesion/lesion site shall be 
selected as a replacement and this shall be used henceforth so long as it is considered 
accessible. Subsequent injection sites shall be replaced when they are considered 
inaccessible.  
• Where no remaining accessible lesions are present and where benefit of IMSA101 therapy 
is, in the opinion of the investigator , being derived by the patient, continued injections of 
IMSA101 into the vicinity of an inaccessible lesion or, in the case that a lesion can no 
longer be radiographically visualized, into the last known location of the non -visible lesion 
shall be allowed.  
• Patients will be admitted to the hospital for observation overnight following intratumoral  
injection with IMSA101 on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients will be followed throughout the 
study for drug tolerability and safety by collection of clinical and laboratory data, 
including information on adverse events (AEs) using Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v5.0 criteria, serious adverse events (SAEs), dose -limiting 
toxicities (DLTs), concomitant medications, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (EC Gs). 
• Patients will be assessed for anti -tumor efficacy based on radiographic  assessments and i f 
applicable, photographic tumor assessments,  and analysis of ORR, DOR, TTP, and PFS 
using  response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 criteria  at screening and 
at the end (≤ 7 days) of even numbered  cycles (Cycle  2, Cycle 4, etc.) after the first 
dosing .  
• RECIST v1.1 criteria do not mention including or excluding lesions that are being biopsied 
or injected. However, for the purposes of this protocol, the injected and biopsied lesions 
are to be captured as non -target lesions only  (Phase I only) , as follows:  
• Injected and biopsied lesion = non -target lesion #1  
• Non-injected and biopsied lesion = non -target lesion #2  (if applicable)  
• See Schedule of Assessments and Study Activities ( Table  1 and Table  2) for details.  
The Phase I dose escalation is detailed in Figure  8 for monotherapy and  Figure 9 and  
Figure  10 for combination therapy . 
Phase I Dose Escalation - Monotherapy:  
• Each dose escalation cohort will initially recruit at least 3 patients in a standard 3+3 
design. To proactively ensure at least 3 patients are considered evaluable, a fourth patient 
may be enrolled and treated in addition to the initial 3 patients in each cohort (the fourth 
patient may only be enrolled if they are identified at the time the third patient slot is being 
filled).

IMSA101  Developmental Phase:  
Phase I/IIA  
• Dose escalation design in which administered dose levels will be escalated stepwise in 
successive cohorts of 3  to 6 (NOTE: 7 if fourth slot is filled and a single DLT is identified 
among the first 4 patients) patients per dose group until the RP2D or maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) level is identified.  
• The first patient enrolled in each dose level must complete the first two weeks of Cycle 1 
prior to  enrolling the second and third (fourth  when applicable) patients . 
• Dose levels to be evaluated include (although not necessarily limited to) 100  µg 
(representing 1/60th of the pre -clinical highest non -severely toxic dose [HNSTD] dose), 
200 µg, 400  µg, 800  µg, and 1,200  µg. 
• IMSA101 will initially be administered by intratumoral  injections on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 
and 3 for Cycle 1 (i.e., weekly dosing 3 out of 4 weeks), and on Day  1 of Weeks 1 and 3 
(i.e., bi-weekly dosing) for all cycles thereafter.  
• No dose escalation decisions will be made until all patients in a dose level complete the 
first 28 days of treatment. NOTE: this includes a fourth additional patient when applicable. 
Dose -escalation/de -escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs during 
Cycle 1 of the evaluated dose level and the recommendation of the Cohort Review 
Committee (CRC).  
• If no DLTs are observed among the initial 3  (4 when applicable)  patients of an evaluated 
dose level, the dose will be escalated for the following 3 patients.  
• If a single DLT occurs among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) patients  of an evaluated 
dose level, 3  additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level.  
• If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 ( 4 when  applicable ) or 6 ( 7 when  applicable ) 
patients in an evaluated dose level, the dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic 
and escalation will be discontinued.  
• Subsequent to invalidation of a given cohort (e.g. , when ≥ 2/3 [4 when  applicable]  or 
≥ 2/6 [7 when  applicable] patients in an evaluated dose level  experience a DLT ), a new 
cohort (e.g. , dosing Cohort Xa) will be evaluated in which IMSA101 will be administered 
by intratumoral  injection at the same dose level but with the Day 1 dose (priming dose) 
reduced to the next lower dose level.  
• For dosing Cohort Xa , if ≥ 2/3 (4 when  applicable)  or ≥ 2/6 (7 when  applicable)  patients  
experience a DLT , the amended dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic and the 
next lower dose (DL-1) level shall be provisionally labeled the MTD.  
• If the amended dose level Xa is found to be safe, dose escalation shall proceed  with the 
exception of the priming dose (Cycle 1, dose 1) which shall be held constant and not 
escalated further . 
• No fewer than 6 total patients shall be evaluated at a given dose level prior to confirmation 
of the dose level as the MTD or RP2D.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 ) Confidential  Page 7 Phase I Dose Escalation  - Combination Therapy :  
• Combination therapy with IMSA101  + ICI  includes the  following IMSA101 dose levels:  
• 800 µg 
• 1,200  µg 
• 2,400  µg (with an initial “ priming ” dose of 1,200  µg) 
• 3,600  µg (with an initial  “priming ” dose of 2,400  µg) 
• 4,800  µg (with an initial  “priming dose ” of 3,600  µg) 
• Combination dosing of IMSA101 shall be evaluated in Phase I upon satisfaction of the 
following criteria:  
A. A given dose level ( combo dose level 1 ) has been confirmed as safe for monotherapy 
dosing (i.e. ,  2/6 [7 when  applicable] patient s experience Cycle 1 DLT).  
B. The next high er dose level ( combo dose level 2) has been confirmed as safe for 
monotherapy dosing (i.e. ,  2/6 [7 when applicable] patient s experience Cycle 1 DLT).  
C. The dose level (combo dose level 1) is found to demonstrate adequate IMSA101 PD 
activity based on exploratory endpoints.  
• Eligible patient s for Phase I combination dosing shall meet one of the following criteria:  
• have radiographically -confirmed  RECIST stable disease th rough ≥ 2 consecutive 
cycles of an approved PD-1/PD -L1-targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor ( ICI) 
administered as monotherapy  
• be clinically stable following a first (unconfirmed) follow -up radiographic scan 
demonstrating progression of disease  on ICI monotherapy  
• have progression through prior ICI therapy administered either as mono or combination 
therapy  
• have received no prior ICI therapy but otherwise be ineligible for all available 
standards of care  
• Phase I combo patients have experienced  no prior Grade ≥  3 CTCAE adverse events on 
ICI therapy that were considered by the investigator  to be  at least possibly  ICI drug-related  
• Phase I combo  patients  shall either receive de novo the combination of IMSA101 + an ICI 
of their investigator’s choosing or, in cases where they are already receiving ICI 
monotherapy, have IMSA101 added to their current therapy such that Day 1 of IMSA101 
shall represent Cycle 1, Day 1.  
• A radiographic tumor assessment shall have occurred within 30 prior days of adding 
IMSA101 to current therapy.  
• Phase I combination therapy IMSA101  doses of 800  µg and 1,200  µg will be administered 
by intratumoral injections each week for 3  weeks in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, and 15), and for

Phase I/IIA  
Cycle 2 and all other cycles thereafter, every other week on Days 1 and 15 . Additional  
combination therapy  IMSA101 doses of 2,400  µg, 3,600  µg, and 4,800  µg require  the 
following priming dose  on Day 1 of Cycle 1: 1,200  µg for the 2,400  µg dose group, 
2,400  µg for the 3,600  µg dose group, and 3,600  µg for the 4,800  µg group. After Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 , the full dose for these groups will be administered on  Day 1 of Weeks 2 and 3 of 
Cycle 1 (i.e., weekly dosing 3 out of 4 weeks), and on D ay 1 of Weeks 1 and 3  for all 
cycles thereafter  (i.e., bi-weekly dosing) . 
• Safety evaluations and dose escalation of IMSA101 administered in combination with 
current ICI therapy shall proceed in a manner consistent with monotherapy escalation , 
with the exception of allowed de -escalation,  and shall proceed independently of 
monotherapy dose escalation and evaluations.  
• De-escalation: If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 ( 4 when applicable ) or 6 ( 7 when 
applicable ) patients, de -escalation of IMSA101 is allowed for the combination therapy 
dose levels as follows:  
- 2,400  µg may be de -escalated to 1,800  µg (with a priming dose of 1,200  µg on Day 1 
of Cycle 1) 
- 3,600  µg may be de -escalated to 3,000  µg (with a priming dose of 2,400  µg on Day 1 
of Cycle 1) 
- 4,800  µg may be de -escalated to 4,200 µg (with a priming dose of 3,600  µg on Day 1 
of Cycle 1) 
If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) or 6 (7 when applicable) 
patients at a de -escalated dose level, the dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic 
and escalation will be discontinued.  
• Administration of combination drug will follow the labeled instructions for the product.  
• IMSA101 dose escalation shall proceed such that there will be generated separate RP2Ds 
for IMSA101 administered alone or in combination with other agents (although it is 
possible these will be the same).  
• No fewer than 6 total patients shall be evaluated at a given dose level prior to confirmation 
of the dose level as the MTD or RP2D.  
Phase IIA Dose Expansion:   
• This dose -expansion stage is intended to confirm the tolerability of the RP2D and identify 
provocative signals of IMSA101 anti -tumor activity.  
• It is anticipated that the monotherapy and combination RP2Ds will be evaluated in 
3 discrete arms  of 20  patients each with a single arm evaluating monotherapy ( Arm A) and 
2 arms  evaluating IMSA101 in combination with  immun o-oncology  (IO) therapies ( Arm B 
and Arm C). 
• Arm B  will be a combination of IMSA101 with PD -1/PD -L1-targeted ICIs. Dosing 
will be predicated by the combination RP2D identified in Phase I.

Phase I/IIA  
• Arm C  will be a combination of IMSA101 with non -PD-1/PD -L1-targeted  IO drugs 
approved by the  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ).  
• Administration of approved  drugs to be combined with IMSA101 will follow the labeled 
instructions for the product.  
• Combination arms  evaluating IMSA101 combinations shall include a safety run -in of 
5-10 patients to be conducted as follows:  
o If ≤ 1 of 5 initial safety evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1, 
enrollment shall proceed to Patient 6.  
o If ≤ 3 of 10 initial safety evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1, 
enrollment shall proceed to its entirety  (20 patients in that arm).  
o If ≥ 2 of 5 or ≥ 4 of 10 patients experience a DLT, dose de -escalation shall occur to the 
next lower dose level evaluated in Phase I and the run -in shall be repeated at the next 
lower dose.  
• Tumor types and corresponding treatment combinations to be evaluated will be identified 
prior to Phase IIA commencement with patients enrolled separately into tumor -specific 
arms  of 20  patients each. This change will be documented in a protocol amendment 
before it occurs .  
• The need for futility criteria to be evaluated in any of the arms  following enrollment of a 
pre-defined number of patients < 20 shall be determined at a later date depending on tumor 
types evaluated.  This change will be documented in a protocol amendment before it 
occurs . 
• For all potential patients, there will be up to a 30 -day screening and eligibility assessment 
period prior to enrollment.  
All patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment throughout the study until the 
occurrence of disease progression, death, or other unacceptable treatment -related toxicity, or 
until the study is closed by the sponsor .

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 ) Confidential  Page 15 Criteria for Evaluation:  
MTD/RP2D:  
• Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD):  The MTD is defined as the highest dose 
level of IMSA101 at which no more than 1 out of 6 (7 when applicable) patients 
experiences a DLT during the first cycle (28 days) of therapy.  
• Definition of Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D):  The RP2D is defined as the dose 
(either at MTD or below MTD) that is selected for evaluation in the Phase IIA component 
of the study.  
• The MTD/RP2D of IMSA101 will be determined by the sponsor  and the CRC.  
Safety:  
• Safety assessments will  include evaluation of TEAEs, DLTs, vital signs, 12 -lead ECG, 
physical examination, and laboratory safety assessments. Toxicities will be  graded using 
CTCAE  v5.0. Patients will be observed for 1 hour in the clinic following intratumoral  
injections. In addition, following intratumoral  injection on Day 1 of Cycle 1, patients will 
be admitted to the hospital for observation overnight.    
• Safety data will be listed by study site, patient number, and cycle. All TEAEs will be 
summarized by study phase and assigned dose. In addition, all SAEs, including deaths will 
be listed separately and summarized.  
• Grade 3 and 4 laboratory data will be summarized by study phase and assigned dose.  
• For patients who experience a DLT, data on AEs leading to treatment/study discontinuation 
will be listed.  
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) : DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any of the following 
events that is considered at least possibly related to IMSA101 in the first 28  days (first cycle) 
of treatment. The severity of AEs will be graded acc ording to CTCAE  v5.0.  
Hematologic AEs  
• ≥ Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for > 7 days  
• Febrile neutropenia (defined as ANC  < 1000/mm3 with a single temperature of 38.3ºC 
(101°F) or a sustained temperature of 38ºC (100.4°F) for > 1 h our) 
• ≥ Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with Grade  ≥ 2 
bleeding  
• ≥ Grade 4 anemia  
 
Non-hematologic AEs:  
• Elevation of ALT or AST by ≥ 3X ULN with concurrent elevation of serum total bilirubin 
≥ 2X ULN  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic AE of any duration will be considered a DLT with the 
following exceptions:

IMSA101  Developmental Phase:  
Phase I/IIA  
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea/vomiting/diarrhea that lasts ≤ 3 days is not a DLT.  
• Fatigue:  
• To be considered a DLT, ≥ Grade 3 fatigue must last > 7 days.  
• ≥ Grade 3 fatigue that lasts ≤ 7 days is not a DLT.  
Efficacy:  
Tumor Assessments  
• All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and re -assessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  
• Screening and subsequent tumor assessments must include CT scans (with IV contrast 
unless contraindicated and oral contrast as appropriate per institutional standards) or MRI 
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Photographic assessments of skin lesions will be 
performed through a photography vendor  as detailed in a separate photography manual.  
• If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography 
(PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -
contrast CT scan.  
• Brain imaging (either MRI or contrast -enhanced CT) is required at screening for all 
patients displaying clinical signs of possible CNS involvement.   
• Further investigations such as bone scans should also be performed if there is any clinical 
suspicion of disease at any site that may not be demonstrated by the minimum schedule of 
assessments listed above.  
• The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used 
throughout the study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans). Assessments should 
be performed by the same evaluator if possible to ensure internal consistency  across visits.  
• All findings will be assessed for response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria at the end 
(≤ 7 days) of every even numbered cycle ( Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc.).  
Pharmacokinetics (Phase I monotherapy only):  
Blood samples for PK will be collected at multiple  time points . Plasma concentrations at each 
time point will be listed and summarized by each dose level. Plasma concentrations versus 
time profiles (with concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be plotted for each 
patient; similar summary plots will be constructed for each dose level. PK parameters will be 
calculated by visit.  
Pharmacodynamics (Phase I only):  
Blood and tumor samples to be collected at multiple time points  for exploratory assessment of 
several biomarkers .

6 PK plasma  samples will be collected  from Phase I monotherapy patients only  at pre -dose, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after treatment, and 1, 2, and 4 hours after 
treatment on  Cycle 1 , Day 1. If concentrations of IMSA101 are detectable at any timepoint in Cycle 1, samples will be collected on Cycle 2, Day 15 
pre-dose, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after treatment and 1, 2, and 4 hour after treatment. Additional time points (6 and 24  hours after treatment ) will also be 
collected, if any concentrations of IMSA101 are detected at the Cycle 1, 4 hour measurement. The following time windows for pla sma PK sample collection 
are allowed: ≤ 24 hours for the pre -dose sample, ± 5 minutes for the 10 -, 20-, and 30 -minute post -dose samples, ± 10 minutes for the 1 -hour post -dose 
sample, ±15 minutes for the 2 -, 4-, and 6 -hour post -dose samples, and ±  2 hours for the 24 -hour post -dose sample. For detailed instructions, refer to 
laboratory manual.  
7 PD blood samples outlined  in Section 2.4.5  will be collected  on both b lood and tumor tissue  for all Phase I patients in Cycles 1, 2, and 3 . The allowable time 
windows for PD sample collections are described in Section 6.8.1 . Core b iopsies should be obtained ; if not appropriate, biopsies  via fine needle aspirate 
(FNA)  or excision are permitted . See laboratory manual for detailed instructions.  
8 All findings will be assessed for response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria  (Appendix  13.2). RECIST v1.1 criteria do not mention including or excluding 
lesions that are being biopsied or injected. However, for the purposes of this protocol, the injected and biopsied lesions ar e to be captured as non -target 
lesions only (Phase I only) , as follows:  injected  and biops ied lesion  = non -target lesion #1 ; non-injected  and biopsied lesion  = non -target lesion #2  (if 
applicable) . Disease assessment s will include radiographic assessments  and if applicable, photographic assessments of  skin lesions , prior to the end (≤ 7 
days) of every even numbered treatment cycle ( Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc.) , and EOT . Photographic assessments of  skin lesions  will be performed through a  
photography vendor at the same time points as the radiographic assessments. Detailed instructions for photography will be inc luded in a separate 
photography manual.  In certain circumstances , a patient experiencing RECIST progression of disease may be allowed to continue therapy on study where 
there is agreement between the investigator and sponsor that the patient is deriving clinical benefit.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 32 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 BACKGROUND  
The treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancies as well as many hematologic malignancies 
continues to be defined by high unmet medical need. In most settings, treatment with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy and targeted kinase inhibitors leads to the emergence of  drug-resistant tumor 
clones and subsequent tumor progression and metastasis.  
In recent years, notable success has been achieved through alternate approaches oriented  around 
activation of immune -mediated tumor destruction. The immune system plays a pivotal role in 
defending humans and animals against cancer. The anti -tumor effect is controlled by positive 
factors that activate anti -tumor immunity and negative factors that inhibit the immune system. 
Negative factors that inhi bit anti -tumor immunity include immune checkpoint proteins , such as 
cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated protein 4  (CTLA4), programmed cell death -1 (PD1), and 
programmed death -ligand 1 (PDL1). Immuno -oncology (IO) approaches, including antibodies 
against these checkpoint proteins, have shown remarkable efficacy in several types of human 
cancers.  
However, existing cancer immunotherapy through immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is 
effective for only a small fraction (on average 20 -30%) of cancer patients. The patients who are 
refractory to ICB often have tumors that are not inflamed, or so -called “cold” tumor cells, i.e., 
they lack tumor -infiltrating leukocytes (TILs), such as cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells 
or the tumor microenvironment suppresses t he functions of the TILs. A major thrust of ongoing 
cancer drug development research remains focused on transforming “cold” tumor cells into “hot” 
tumor cells in order to achieve better tumor control across a wider array of patients.  
The innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against pathogens and cancer cells, 
is important for turning the non -inflamed tumors (“cold”) into an inflamed (“hot”) 
microenviro nment. A  recently discovered innate immunity pathway, the Cyclic GMP -AMP 
Synthase (cGAS) - Stimulator of Interferon Genes ( STING ) pathway, plays a critical role in anti -
tumor immunity ( Figure  1). cGAS  is a DNA sensing enzyme that activates the type -I interferon 
pathway. Upon binding DNA, cGAS is activated to synthesize 2’3’ cyclic -GMP -AMP (2’3’ -
cGAMP), which then functions as a second ary messenger that binds to and activates the adaptor 
protein STING. STING then activates a signal transduction cascade leading to the production of 
type-I interferons, cytokines and other immune mediators.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 33 Figure  1 The cGAS -cGAMP -STING Pathway  
 
Cytosolic DNA binds to and activates the enzyme cGAS, which then catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP -AMP 
(cGAMP). cGAMP functions as a second messenger that binds to and activates the endoplasmic reticulum 
membrane protein STING, which in turn leads to t he production of type -I interferons and other immune stimulatory 
molecules. IMSA101 is an analogue of cGAMP and directly stimulates STING.  
When dying tumor cells are taken up and processed by dendritic cells (DCs), DNA from these 
tumor cells becomes a danger signal that triggers the cGAS –cGAMP -STING pathway to 
promote maturation of DCs and presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. Interferon  and 
cytokines produced by DCs and other innate immune cells cooperatively stimulate T cell 
infiltration and function, leading to cytotoxic killing of tumor cells ( Figure  2B) (Chen , 2016) . 
There is mounting evidence that the cGAS pathway is essential for generating anti -tumor 
immunity (Bose , 2017 : Wang 2017) .  
As expected , surviving tumor cells develop mechanisms to antagonize host immunity. For 
example, high expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as PDL1 on their cell surface 
bind PD1 on T cells to inhibit the latter’s function. PDL1 inhibitor therapy can reverse the 
inhibition of anti -tumor immunity and restore T cell function. However, in patients with very low 
anti-tumor immunity, the PDL1 inhibitor will have little benefit. Instead, a positive signal is 
needed to boost intrinsic immunity. Toward this  end, the administration of cGAMP directly 
stimulates STING and jump -starts antitumor immunity. This activity has demonstrated 
encouraging therapeutic efficacy in severa l mouse syngeneic tumor models (Li, 2016 : Wang 
2017) .

1.2 STUDY DRUG  
IMSA101 is a small molecule analogue of cGAMP. It contains a trifluoroethyl modification at 
the 3’ -OH of the ribose in the GMP moiety of 2’3’ -cGAMP . The chemical structure of the 
IMSA101 is shown in Figure  2A. Unlike the natural product 2’3’ -cGAMP, which is rapidly 
degraded by an enzyme called ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1), 
IMSA101 is resistant to this degradation, thus displaying superior stability. It is more potent than 
the naturally occurring cGAMP and has improved pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) 
properti es. Importantly, IMSA101 does not require the presence of cytosolic DNA for the 
activation of STING .  
The drug product (IMSA101 for Injection) is a sterile and nonpyrogenic solution containing 
10 mg of IMSA101 in 1.0  mL of sodium, potassium phosphate and saline buffer , which is used 
for intratumoral  injection.  
1.3 NONCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY STUDIES  
In ex vivo  cell culture experimen ts using human and mouse cells, IMSA101 induced production 
of IFN β, IL6, and IL12 in a dose -dependent manner in wild -type cells, but not in STINGgt/gt cells 
(Figure  3A, B, and C). As a control, IFN β production in response to Sendai virus, which 
activates the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG -I) dependent RNA -sensing pathway, was not 
affected ( Figure  3D).

IMSA101 also stimulated IFN and IL6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) from mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human with similar potency ( Figure  4).

When delivered intratumorally in mice bearing tumors, IMSA101 was highly effective in 
inhibiting tumor growth in several syngeneic tumor models, including B16F10 (melanoma), 
MC38 (colon), 4T1 (breast), LL2 (lung) and AG104 (fibrosarcoma). Note that several of these 
tumors such as B16F10, 4T1, LL2 and AG104 are known to be refractory to antibodies against 
PD1, PDL1, or CTLA4. In the B16F10 tumor model, twice weekly injection of IMSA101 for 
two weeks was efficacious in a dose -dependent manner in the range from 0.1  µg to 10  µg (0.005 -
0.5 mg/kg) ( Figure  5). The combination with anti -PDL1 antibody showed improved efficacy at 
each dose level ( Figure  5). Tumor growth was almost completely suppressed at the dose of 
0.05 mg/kg (1  g/mouse) of IMSA101 when combined with anti -PDL1 antibody ( Figure  5C).

An abscopal effect, which is an immune -mediated phenomenon wherein direct treatment of a 
primary tumor can lead to a response in a distant tumor, of IMSA101 was demonstrated in two 
studies using the B16 melanoma model. In one study, there was a decrease in  the sizes of non -
injected tumors and prolonged survival following the intratumoral  administration of IMSA101 
(Figure  6). In another study, intratumoral  administration of IMSA101 reduced lung metastases 
(Figure  7).

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 40 1.3.1  Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Animals  
The evaluations of the pharmacokinetics (PK), including the absorption, protein binding, and 
metabolic stability of IMSA101 in species that were used in the pharmacology and t oxicology 
studies (mouse, rat, and monkey) were conducted. These studies are described in detail in the 
Investigator Brochure, v 1.0, 2019.  
In summary, the PK parameters of IMSA101 were estimated following administration by 
intravenous, subcutaneous, or intratumoral  routes in mice at doses of 0.1 or 0.5  mg/kg. IMSA101 
concentrations in plasma were measured using a qualified LC -MS/MS method. The calculated, 
dose corrected area -under -the curves (AUC 0-t) were similar by each route. When administered at 
the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, the area -under -the-curve (AUC 0-inf) of the intravenous dose was 
494 ng·hr/mL as compared to the AUC 0-inf of 597  ng·hr/mL of the subcutaneous dose. The 
calculated bioavailability (F) of the subcutaneous dose was 1.21. The area -under -the-curve 
(AUC 0-inf) of the intratumoral  dose was 360  ng·hr/mL as compared to the AUC 0-inf of 
312 ng·hr/mL of the subcutaneous dose. The calculated relative bioavailability (F rel) of the 
intratumoral  dose was 1.12. The calculated half -life was approximately 10 -15 minutes. IMSA101 
showed maximal absorption at the first sampling point of 15 minutes following administration.  
The observed comparability of the subcutaneous and intratumoral  dose routes provided a 
rationale for using the subcutaneous route of administration in the toxicology studies to 
approximate the intratumoral  route that will be used in the clinical studies.  
1.3.2  Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions  
No pharmacodynamics drug interactions were evaluated.  
1.3.3  Toxicology Studies  
The toxicological evaluations of IMSA101 included studies in the rat and cynomolgus monkey 
(non-human primate [NHP]) and should be relevant to assessing potential human risk, as the 
STING pathway, the target of IMSA101, is conserved across species.  
The non -good laboratory practice (GLP) studies in the rat and NHP covered a broad range of 
doses and regimens. The objective of these studies was to evaluate the effects of IMSA101 
following multiple ascending doses, single doses, and multiple doses. The r esults of the studies 
provided guidance to the design of the subsequent GLP studies in the rat and NHP.  
The general findings in these studies were related to the mechanism of action (MOA) of 
IMSA101 and can be categorized as inflammatory responses characterized by dose -related 
increases in STING pathway factors including Type 1 Interferons (IFNs) and proinfl ammatory 
cytokines. The findings were similar in the rat and NHP. The most consistent dose relate d 
findings were increases in IFNα, TNFα, and IL6 in the rat and monkey; IL -8 in the rat; IL -1ra, 
IFNγ -inducible Protein 10 (IP -10), and Monocyte Chemoattractan t Protein 1 (MCP -1) in the 
monkey. The cytokine levels showed increases in the first 3 -6 hours with return to baseline in 
most cases by 6 -24 hours. The innate immune response is characterized by a self -
regulating/modulation of the production of these facto rs. At low doses, the findings would be

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 41 characterized as pharmacological changes related to the MOA of IMSA101. With increasing 
doses, the changes could be characterized as “exaggerated” pharmacology, which is expected 
changes related to the MOA of IMSA101, but greater than the responses needed to affect a 
therapeutic response. At the highest dose levels, the IMSA101 pharmacology and exaggerated 
pharmacology resulted in toxicity. Mortality was seen in the GLP rat study in the high doses 
group at 10 and 30  mg/kg. Test article -related increased inc idence or severity of minimal or 
slight white matter vacuolation in the brain (within the cerebellum) was noted in animals 
administered ≥1 mg/kg IMSA101 and necropsied at a scheduled or unscheduled interval. The 
observations were not dose -dependent. In recovery animals, white matter vacuolation was 
minimal in severity and the incidence was similar between control and high dose groups. There 
were no abnormal cl inical observations that correlated to the brain lesions.  Mortality was also 
seen at the 3.0 mg/kg dose level in the non -GLP NHP study. The deaths were attributed to 
pulmonary edema consistent with an IMSA101 mediated inflammatory response that was well 
beyond exaggerated pharmacology and caused the severe toxicity.  
The other common findings across species and across the dose ranges/regimens were dose -
related findings including a range of macroscopic, hematological, clinical chemistry, and 
microscopic findings. At the low doses, these changes were consistent with a de sired therapeutic 
effect; at the highest doses, there were severe toxicities and mortality. In studies with recovery 
animals, there was either full recovery or a trend to recovery in the parameters showing dose -
related changes.  
The toxicokinetic findings showed no sex related differences, dose proportionality, and no 
accumulation in the multiple dose studies.  
Moribundity and death were seen at the mid and high dose levels in the GLP rat study. Although 
there was no clear cause of death, the finding was consistent with a dose -related inflammatory 
response, due to exaggerated pharmacology of the MOA of IMSA101. T he 3000 to 10000 -fold 
safety margins at the 10 and 30  mg/kg dose levels in the GLP rat study should reduce safety 
concerns related to the deaths seen in that study.  
The highest non -severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of IMSA101 was determined as 0.3 mg/kg in the 
monkey GLP study. The first -in-human (FIH) dose was calculated from this dose as 100  µg. 
Using the minimum anticipated biological effects level (MABEL) based on mouse data, FIH 
dose at 100  µg was estimated.  
1.3.4  Safety Studies  
Two safety pharmacology studies were conducted with IMSA101 including an in vitro  human 
ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel assay and in vivo  study to evaluate cardiovascular 
function in monkeys. Both studies demonstrate that IMSA101 does not affect cardiovascular 
function in in vitro  system and monkeys.

Day 8 and weekly thereafter.  
To evaluate the potential effect of IMSA101 on the cardiovascular system, safety pharmacology 
endpoints of blood pressure and electrocardiogram were evaluated in the good laboratory 
practice (GLP ) monkey study (Covance study 8370304). There are no dose -related findings 
noted ( Table  3). 
The in vitro  effects of IMSA101 on the hERG potassium channel current (a surrogate for IKr, the 
rapidly activating, delayed rectifier cardiac potassium current) expressed in mammalian cells was 
evaluated at ambient temperature using the QPatch HT® (Sophion Bioscience A/S, Denmark), an 
automatic para llel patch clamp system (Effects of Two Test Articles on Ion Channels Expressed 
in Mammalian Cells, hERG assay, Study No. 170520.DPW). IMSA101 was evaluated at 0.1, 
1.0, 10.0 and 100.0  µM, with each concentration  tested in three cells (n  = 3). The duration of 
exposure to each concentration was at least 3 minutes. On average, no more than 8.7% of hERG 
current was inhibited at concentrations up to 100  µM; therefore, the IC50 values for IMSA101 
was greater than 100  µM, indicating a low potential for hERG activation.  
1.4 CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
IMSA101 has not been tested clinically.  
Clinical trials of similar STING agonists are in progress. These include MIW8 15 from 
Novartis/Aduro Biotech (Aduro Biotech Inc. 2016)  and MK -1454 from Merck  (Merck Sharp & 
Dohme Corp. 2017) . Early results of these studies demonstrate agonism of the STING pathway 
by cyclic dinucleotides similar to IMSA101. The dose -related findings are consistent with the 
findings seen in preclinical studies and related to the MOA of a CDN STING agonist.  
1.5 SUMMARY OF KNOWN RISKS AND BENEFITS  
Anticipated risks based on findings from pre -clinical studies are listed below.

IMSA101 Combinations : 
Some  patients in this study will be treated with a combination of IMSA101 and an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting either programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD -1) or 
programmed cell death -ligand 1 (PD -L1). Multiple drugs against PD -1 and PD -L1 are in 
development and have shown great promise across multiple cancer types. Nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab, both of which target PD -1, and atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab, all of 
which target PD -L1, have been approved in various cancer types including m elanoma, renal cell 
carcinoma, non -small cell and small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, urothelial cancer, 
Hodgkin lymphoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, as well as other solid tumors which demonstrate a 
high level of mutations (also known as microsatell ite instability -high or mismatch repair 
deficient tumors). ICIs are associated with a variety of side effects termed immune -related 
adverse events. Believed to arise from general immunologic enhancement, these side effects can 
include skin, gastrointestina l, liver, endocrine/hormonal, and other less common inflammatory 
events. Although extremely rare, fulminant and even fatal side effects can occur with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors and prompt recognition and management is essential. These immune 
related adv erse events are generally managed through interruption of the checkpoint inhibitor 
and temporary immunosuppression with corticosteroids and other drugs.  The prescribing 
information and specific risks associated with particular ICIs selected by investigator s will be 
discussed by investigators with their patients and referenced during informed consent.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 45 1.6 RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  
Cancer progression is frequently associated with genetic changes and abnormalities - including 
mutations in Wnt, p53, AKT, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) – 
which suppress transcription of critical cytokines, leading, in turn , to immunosuppressive tumor 
microenvironments. It is hypothesized here that administration of the cGAMP analog IMSA101 
(either as monotherapy or in combination) can bypass immunosuppressive factors through the 
direct stimulation of  dendritic cells  (DCs). Preliminary mouse experiments suggest that 
IMSA101 -mediated stimulation can super -activate residual DCs through the increased 
expression and secretion of CD86, interferon β, and cross -present antigens to CD8+ T cells. This 
approach is designed, in effect, to transform “cold” IO non -responding tumor cells into “hot” IO 
sensitive cells, addressing unmet medical need and achieving clinical benefit through intensified 
immuno -modulation of malignant cells.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 48 3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 STUDY D ESIGN OVERVIEW  
This is a n open -label, dose escalation (Phase I), and dose expansion (Phase  IIA) study designed 
to evaluate safety and efficacy of IMSA101 alone or in combination with an ICI (Phase I  and II ). 
Therefore, the study will be conducted in 2  phases. The dose of IMSA101 in Phase IIA will be 
based on the monotherapy and combination RP2D s from Phase I.  
The following methodology applies to all patients (unless otherwise indicated) : 
• Pre-treatment  screening  radiographic tumor assessments will be collected within 30  days 
prior to initial dose for all patients . Photographic assessments of skin  lesions will be 
performed as detailed in a separate  photography manual.   
• Treatment c ycles will be 28 days in duration with lesions injected weekly on Day  1 for the 
first three weeks of Cycle 1 and then every 2 weeks during Cycles 2 and beyond . 
• A single pre -defined lesion/lesion site (longest diameter ≥ 10 mm and ≤ 50 mm) shall be 
injected throughout study duration , if possible. Where the original injection site is considered 
by the investigator to become inaccessible, a second lesion/lesion site shall be selected as a 
replacement and this shall be used henceforth so long as it is considered accessible. 
Subsequent injection sites shall be replaced when they are considered inaccessible.  
• Where no remaining access ible lesions are present and where benefit of IMSA101 therapy is, 
in the opinion of the investigator, being  derived by the patient, continued injections of 
IMSA101 into the vicinity of an inaccessible lesion or, in the case that a lesion can no longer 
be radiographically visualized, into the last known location of the non -visible lesion shall be 
allowed.  
• Patients will be admitted to the hospital for observation overnight following intratumoral  
injection with IMSA101  on Day 1 of Cycle 1 . Patients will be followed throughout the study 
for drug tolerability and safety by collection of clinical and laboratory data, including 
information on adverse events (AEs) using CTCAE  v5.0 criteria, serious AEs (SAEs), DLTs, 
concomitant medications, vital signs, and ECGs . 
• Patients will be assessed  for anti -tumor efficacy based on radiographic assessments and if 
applicable, photographic  tumor assessments , and analysis of ORR, DOR, TTP, and PFS 
using RECIST  v1.1 criteria  (Appendix  13.2) at screening and  the end (≤ 7 days) of even 
numbered  cycles ( Cycle  2, Cycle 4, etc.) after the first dosing . 
RECIST v1.1 criteria do not mention including or excluding lesions that are being biopsied 
or injected. However, for the purposes of this protocol, the injected and biopsied lesions are 
to be captured as non -target lesions only (Phase I only) , as follows:  
• Injected  and biops ied lesion  = non -target lesion #1  
• Non-injected  and biopsied lesion  = non -target lesion #2  (if applicable)

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 49 3.1.1  Phase I – Dose Escalation Plan  
The Phase I dose escalation is illustrated in Figure  8 for monotherapy and Figure 9 and Figure  10 
 for combination therapy .  
Phase I Dose Escalation – Monotherapy:  
• Each dose escalation cohort will initially recruit at least 3 patients in a standard 3+3 design . 
To proactively ensure at least 3 patients are considered evaluable, a fourth patient may be 
enrolled and treated in addition to the initial 3 patients in each cohort  (the fourth  patient may 
only be enrolled if they are  identified at the time the third  patient slot is being filled) . 
• Dose escalation design in which administered  dose levels will be escalated stepwise in 
successive cohorts of 3  to 6 (NOTE: 7 if fourth slot is filled and a single DLT is identified 
among the first 4 patients)  patients per dose group  until the RP2D or MTD level is identified . 
• The first patient enrolled in each dose level must complete the first two weeks of Cycle 1 
prior to  enrolling the second and third (fourth  when applicable) patients . 
• Dose levels to be evaluated include (although not necessarily limited to) 100  µg (representing 
1/60th of the pre-clinical HNSTD dose), 200  µg, 400  µg, 800  µg, and 1,200  µg. 
• IMSA101 will initially be administered by intratumoral  injections on Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 
and 3 for Cycle 1 (i.e., weekly dosing 3 out of 4 weeks), and on Day  1 of Weeks 1 and 3 
(i.e., bi-weekly dosing) for all cycles thereafter.  
• No dose escalation decisions will be made until all patients in a dose level complete the first 
28 days of treatment. NOTE: this includes a fourth additional patient  when  applicable . 
Dose -escalation/de -escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs during 
Cycle 1 of the evaluated dose level and the recommendation of the Cohort Review 
Committee (CRC).  
• If no DLTs are observed among the initial 3  (4 when applicable) patients of an evaluated 
dose level, the dose will be escalated for the following 3 patients.  
• If a single DLT occurs among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) patients of an evaluated dose 
level, 3  additional patients will be enroll ed at the same dose level.  
• If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 ( 4 when applicable ) or 6 ( 7 when applicable ) patients 
in an evaluated dose level, the dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic and 
escalation will be discontinued . 
• Subsequent to invalidation of a given cohort (e.g. , when ≥ 2/3 [4 when applicable ] or 
≥ 2/6 [7 when applicable ] patients in an evaluated dose level  experience a DLT ), a new 
cohort (e.g. , dosing Cohort Xa) will be evaluated in which IMSA101 will be administered by 
intratumoral  injection at the same dose level but with the Day 1 dose (priming  dose) reduced 
to the next lower dose level.  
• For dosing Cohort Xa, if ≥ 2/3 (4 when  applicable)  or ≥ 2/6 (7 when  applicable)  patients  
experience a DLT , the amended dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic and the 
next lower dose (DL-1) level shall be provisionally labeled the MTD.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 50 • If the amended dose level Xa is found to be safe, dose escalation shall proceed with the 
exception of the priming dose (Cycle 1, dose 1) which shall be held constant and not 
escalated further.  
• No fewer than 6 total patients shall be evaluated at a given dose level prior to confirmation of 
the dose level as the MTD or RP2D.  
Phase I Dose Escalation - Combination Therapy:  
• Combination therapy with IMSA101  + ICI  includes the following IMSA101 dose levels:  
• 800 µg  
• 1,200  µg 
• 2,400  µg (with a n initial “ priming ” dose of 1,200  µg) 
• 3,600  µg (with a n initial “ priming ” dose of 2,400  µg) 
• 4,800  µg (with a n initial “ priming ” dose of 3,600  µg) 
• Combination dosing of IMSA101 shall be evaluated in Phase I upon satisfaction of the 
following criteria:  
A. A given dose level ( combo dose level 1 ) has been confirmed as safe for monotherapy 
dosing (i.e. ,  2/6 [7 when  applicable] patient s experience Cycle 1 DLT).  
B. The next higher dose level ( combo dose level 2 ) has been confirmed as safe for 
monotherapy dosing (i.e. ,  2/6 [7 when applicable] patient s experience Cycle 1 DLT).   
C. The dose level (combo dose level 1) is found to demonstrate adequate IMSA101 PD 
activity based on exploratory endpo ints. 
• Eligible patient s for Phase I combination dosing shall meet one of the following criteria:  
• have radiographically -confirmed  RECIST stable disease through ≥ 2 consecutive cycles 
of an approved PD-1/PD -L1-targeted  immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) administered as 
monotherapy  
• be clinically stable following a first (unconfirmed) follow -up radiographic scan 
demonstrating progression of disease  on ICI monotherapy  
• have progression through prior ICI therapy administered either as mono or combination

• have received no prior ICI therapy but otherwise be ineligible for all available standards 
of care  
• Phase I combo patients have experienced no prior G rade ≥  3 CTCAE adverse events on ICI 
therapy that were considered by the investigator  to be  at least possibly ICI  drug-related  
• Phase I combo patients  shall either receive de novo the combination of IMSA101 + an ICI of 
their investigator’s choosing or, in cases where they are already receiving ICI monotherapy,

Cycle 1, Day 1.  
• A radiographic tumor assessment shall have occurred within 30 prior days of adding 
IMSA101 to current  therapy.  
• Phase I combination therapy IMSA101  doses of 800  µg and 1,200  µg will be administered by 
intratumoral  injections each week for 3  weeks in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, and 15), and for Cycle 2 
and all other cycles thereafter, every other week on Days 1 and 15 . Additional  combination 
therapy  IMSA101 doses of 2,400  µg, 3,600  µg, and 4,800  µg require  the following priming 
dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1: 1,200  µg for the 2,400  µg dose group, 2,400  µg for the 3,600  µg 
dose group, and 3,600  µg for the 4,800  µg group. After Day 1 of Cycle 1 , the full dose for 
these groups will be administered on D ay 1 of Weeks 2 and 3 of C ycle 1 (i.e., weekly dosing 
3 out of 4 weeks), and on D ay 1 of Weeks 1 and 3 for all cycles thereafter  (i.e., bi-weekly 
dosing) . 
• Safety evaluations and dose escalation of IMSA 101 administered in combination with 
current ICI therapy  shall proceed in a manner consistent with monotherapy escalation , with 
the exception of allowed de -escalation,  and shall proceed independently of monotherapy dose 
escalation and evaluations.  
• De-escalation: If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) or 6 (7 when 
applicable) patients, de -escalation of IMSA101 is allowed for the combination therapy dose 
levels as follows:  
• 2,400 µg may be de -escalated to 1,800 µg (with a priming dose of 1,200 µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 ) 
• 3,600 µg may be de -escalated to 3,000 µg (with a priming dose of 2,400 µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 ) 
• 4,800 µg may be de -escalated to 4,200 µg (with a priming dose of 3,600 µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 ) 
If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) or 6 (7 when applicable) patients 
at a de -escalated dose level, the dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic and 
escalation will be discontinued.  
• Administration of combination drug will follow the labeled instructions for the product.  
• IMSA101 dose escalation shall proceed such that there will be generated separate RP2Ds for 
IMSA101 administered alone or  in combination with other agents  (although it is possible 
these will be the same) . 
• No fewer than 6 total patients shall be evaluated at a given dose level prior to confirmation of 
the dose level as the MTD or RP2D.

product instructions.  
2 Each cohort will initially recruit at least 3 patients in a standard 3+3 design. To proactively ensure at least 
3 patients are considered evaluable, a fourth patient may be enrolled and treated in addition to the initial 
3 patients in each cohort (the four th patient may only be enrolled if they are identified at the time the third 
patient slot is being filled). The first patient enrolled in each dose level must complete the first two weeks of 
Cycle 1 prior to enrolling the second and third (fourth when appl icable) patients.  
3 Combination dosing and escalation will lead to separate RP2Ds for IMSA101 administered alone or in 
combination with other agents (although it is possible these will be the same) .

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 55 • This dose -expansion stage is intended to confirm the tolerability of the RP2D and identify 
provocative signals of IMSA101 anti -tumor activity.  
• It is anticipated that the monotherapy and combination RP2Ds will be evaluated in 3 discrete 
arms  of 20  patients each with a single arm evaluating monotherapy (Arm A) and 2 arms  
evaluating IMSA101 in combination with IO therap ies (Arm B and Arm C). 
• Arm B  will be a c ombination of IMSA101 with PD -1/PD -L1-targeted ICIs. Dosing will 
be predicated by the combination RP2D identified in Phase I. 
• Arm C  will be a c ombination of IMSA101 with non-PD-1/PD -L1-targeted immun o-
oncology drugs approved by the  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ).  
• Administration of approved drugs to be combined with IMSA101 will follow the labeled 
instructions for the product.  
• Combination arms  evaluating IMSA101 combinations shall include a safety run -in of 5 -10 
patients to be conducted as follows:  
o If ≤ 1 of 5 initial safety evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1, enrollment 
shall proceed to Patient 6.  
o If ≤ 3 of 10 initial safety evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1, enrollment 
shall proceed to its entirety  (20 patients in that arm).  
o If ≥ 2 of 5 or ≥ 4 of 10 patients experience a DLT, dose de -escalation shall occur to the 
next lower dose level evaluated in Phase I and the run -in shall be repeated at the next 
lower dose.  
• Tumor types and corresponding treatment combinations to be evaluated will be identified 
prior to Phase  IIA commencement with patients enrolled separately into tumor -specific arms  
of 20  patients each. This change will be documented in a protocol amendment before it 
occurs.  
• The need for futility criteria to be  evaluated in any of the arms  following enr ollment of a 
pre-defined number of patients < 20 shall be determined at a later date depending on tumor 
types evaluated.  This change will be documented in a protocol amendment before it 
occurs.  
• For all potential patients, there will be up to a 30 -day screening and eligibility assessment 
period prior to enrollment.  
All patients will continue to receive their assigned treatment throughout the study until the 
occurrence of disease progression, death, or other unacceptable treatment -related toxicity, or 
until the study is closed by the sponsor .

A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any of the following hematologic or 
non-hematologic AE s that are considered definitely, probably, or possibly  related to IMSA101 in 
the first 28 days (first cycle) of treatment. The severity of AEs will be graded according to 
CTCAE  v5.0. For safety run -ins for Phase IIA combination arms, DLTs will be defined as 
DLT -qualifying events considered at least possibly related to the drug combination, including 
AEs already characterized for the partner drug.  
Hematologic AEs  
• ≥ Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for > 7 days  
• Febrile neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) < 1000/mm3 with a single 
temperature of 38.3ºC (101 ℉) or a sustained temperature of 38ºC (100.4 ℉) for >  1 h) 
• ≥ Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with Grade ≥ 2 
bleeding  
• ≥ Grade 4 anemia  
Non-hematologic AEs:  
• Elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT ) or aspartate transaminase (AST ) by ≥ 3X upper 
limit of normal (ULN ) with concurrent elevation of serum total bilirubin ≥  2X ULN  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic AE  of any duration  will be considered a DLT with the 
following except ions:  
• Nausea/vomiting/diarrhea:  
• To be considered a DLT, ≥ Grade 3 n ausea/vomiting/diarrhea  must be refractory to 
supportive care and last > 3 days.   
• ≥ Grade 3 nausea/ vomiting/diarrhea that lasts ≤ 3 days is not a DLT . 
• Fatigue:  
• To be considered a DLT,  ≥ Grade 3  fatigue must  last > 7 days. 
• ≥ Grade 3 fatigue that lasts ≤ 7 days is not a DLT.  
 
3.1.4  Maximum Tolerated Dose/Recommended Phase II Dose  
The MTD is defined as the highest dose level of IMSA101 at which no more than 1 out of 
6 (7 when applicable) patients experiences a DLT during the first cycle (28 days) of therapy.  
The MTD/RP2D of IMSA101 will be determined by the sponsor  and the CRC.

immunological responses.  
PD markers will be analyzed by a validated bioanalytical method from  a central laboratory . 
Further details and instructions will be provided in a separate laboratory manual.  
6.9 TUMOR ASSESSMENTS  
All known tumor sites will be documented at screening and re -assessed at each subsequent time 
point for tumor evaluation, using a single and consistent methodology throughout all evaluations.  
Assessments may include the following:  
• Screening  (if a recent scan within the past month is not available in the medical records)  and 
subsequent tumor assessments must include CT scans (with IV contrast unless 
contraindicated and oral contrast as appropriate per institutional standards) or MRI of the 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis  (or other appropriate assessment ). Photographic assessments of 
skin lesions will be performed through a photography vendor  as detailed in a separate  
photography m anual. At screening, p hotography assess ment can be performed  within 30  days 
prior to Day 1 . 
• If a CT scan is performed in a positron emission tomography/CT scanner, the CT acquisition 
must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast CT scan.  
• Brain imaging (by either MRI or contrast -enhanced CT ) is required at screening for all 
patients displaying clinical signs of possible central nervous system  involvement . 
• Further  investigations such as bone scans should be performed if there is any clinical 
suspicion of disease at any site that may not be observed using the methods above.  
IMSA101  ImmuneSensor Therapeutics  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMSA101 -101   
   
 
 
Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 72 • The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used 
throughout the study (e.g., the same contract protocol for CT scans ). Assessments should be 
performed by the same evaluator if possible to ensure internal consistency across visits.  
• All findings will be assessed for response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria as defined in 
(Appendix  13.2) and according to the Schedule of Assessments and Study Activities ( Table  1 
and Table  2). 
RECIST v1.1 criteria do not mention including or excluding lesions that are being biopsied or 
injected . However, f or the purpose s of this protocol, the injected and biopsied lesions are to be 
captured as non -target lesions only (Phase I only) , as follows:  
• Injected  and biops ied lesion  = non -target lesion #1  
• Non-injected  and biopsied lesion  = non -target lesion #2  (if applicable)  
 
• In certain circumstances a patient experiencing RECIST progression of disease may be 
allowed to continue therapy on study where there is agreement between the investigator and 
sponsor  that the patient is deriving clinical benefit.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 73 7 DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time without providing reason(s) for 
withdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment. The treatment of individual patient(s) may 
be stopped by the investigator under defined circumstances as outlined below.   
• Patient request  
• Use of non -permitted concurrent therapy  
• Non-compliance with the study drug or study schedule  
• Patient lost to follow -up 
• Occurrence of AEs not compatible with the continuation of patient part icipation in the study, 
in the investigator’s opinion, or unacceptable to the patient to continue  
• Investigator/ sponsor request  
• Intercurrent illness warranting removal by the investigator  
• Disease progression warranting removal by the investigator  
 
The reason(s) for withdrawal (by the patient or investigator) and date will be documented in the  
electronic case report form  (eCRF ).  
All patients who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE must be followed until the event 
is resolved or deemed stable. Any patient who withdraws consent as a result of an AE, regardless 
of intensity or investigator’s opinion, must be reported as a discontinuation due to AE. Patients 
withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the final evaluations as detailed for 
termination in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  1 and Table  2), particularly safety 
evaluations.  
If a patien t refuses to complete early termination procedures, this information will be recorded in 
the source documentation. A patient who prematurely discontinues from the study for any reason 
will not be allowed to re -enter the study.  
In certain circumstances , a patient experiencing RECIST progression of disease may be allowed 
to continue therapy on study where there is agreement between the investigator and sponsor  that 
the patient is deriving clinical benefit.  
7.2 EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY  
The sponsor  has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the IMSA101 or the company itself occur, making f urther treatment of 
patients impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study 
termination.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 76 8.1.2  Administration of IMSA101  
Phase I (dose escalation) : 
For monotherapy , IMSA101 will be administered at dose levels of (but not necessarily be limited 
to) 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,200 µg  (Table  5). One mL total volume will be administered each 
week for 3  weeks in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, and 15). For Cycle 2 and all other cycles thereafter, 
study drug will be given by intratumoral  injection every other week on Days 1 and 15.   
For combination therapy, IMSA 101 will be administered at dose levels of 800 and 1,200  µg. One 
mL total volume will be administered each week for 3  weeks in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, and 15). For 
Cycle 2 and all other cycles thereafter, study drug will be given by intratumoral injection every 
other week on Days 1 and 15. Additional combination therapy dose levels of 2,400, 3,600, and 
4,800  µg require the following  priming dose  on Day 1 of Cycle 1:  1,200  µg for the 2,400  µg 
dose, 2,400  µg for the 3,600  µg dose, and 3,600  µg for the 4,800  µg dose . After Day 1 of 
Cycle  1, the full dose for these groups will be administered on D ay 1 of Weeks 2 and 3 of 
Cycle 1 (i.e., weekly dosing 3 out of 4 weeks), and on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 3  for all cycles 
thereafter (i.e., bi-weekly dosing).  
IMSA101 is injected directly into the selected tumor. Patients will be observed for 1 h following 
each intratumoral  injection.  In addition, following intratumoral  injection on Day 1 of Cycle 1, 
patients will be admitted to the hospital for observation overnight.   
Injectable tumors shall be accessed by intralesional  (cutaneous) or percutaneous injection only , 
including those lesions that are visible, palpable, or detectable by standard radiographic or 
ultrasound methods. The administration technique and procedures for internal lesions (i.e., 
whether CT or ultrasound guided) will be per institutional policy and guidelines . Neither surgical 
procedures nor endoscopically -guided injections including those to endobronchial, endoluminal, 
or endosinusoidal spaces shall be allowed.  While no anatomic locations are required or 
disallowed, lesions selected for intratumora l injection must, in the opinion of the investigator : 
• Not be immediately adjacent to blood vasculature or other physiologic landmarks in such a 
way that will accrue undue safety risk to the patient  
• Have longest diameter ≥ 10 mm and ≤  50 mm 
• Be fully efficacy evaluable per RECIST v1.1 criteria ( Appendix  13.2)  
 
Where no remaining accessible lesions are present and where benefit of IMSA101 therapy is, in 
the opinion of the investigator, being derived by the patient, continued injections of IMSA101 
into the vicinity of an inaccessible lesion shall be allowed. In the case that a lesion can no longer 
be radiographically visualized, continued injections into the last known locati on of the non -
visible lesion shall be allowed.  
For those patients receiving a  combination regimen, the combination partner drug will be 
administered per product label .

Phase I (dose de-escalation  for combination therapy ): 
If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) or 6 (7 when applicable) patients, 
de-escalation of IMSA101 is allowed for the combination therapy dose levels as follows:  
• 2,400  µg may be de -escalated to 1,800  µg (with a priming dose of 1,200  µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1)  
• 3,600  µg may be de -escalated to 3,000  µg (with a priming dose of 2,400  µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1)  
• 4,800  µg may be de -escalated to 4,2 00 µg (with a priming dose of 3,600  µg on Day 1 of 
Cycle 1)  
If ≥ 2 DLTs occur among the initial 3 (4 when applicable) or 6 (7 when applicable) patients at a 
de-escalated dose level, the dose level shall be considered unacceptably toxic and escalation will 
be discontinued.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 79 9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 DEFINITIONS  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any undesired medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient receiving a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily ha ve a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable sign and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated 
with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the  study  drug.  AE reporting begins at the 
time of study drug administration and continues until 30 days after the last dose.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical event that occurs at any dose from  the time of study drug 
administration and continu ing until 30 days after the last dose  that: 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (patient is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)  1 
• requires inpatient hospitalization  (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or 
prolongation of existing hospitalization 2 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  3 
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event  4 
 
1 “Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
SAE; it does not refer to a SAE  that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
2 This means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay was required for 
the treatment of the AE, or that one or the other occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospitalizations for elective surgery or other medical procedures that are not related to a 
TEAE are not considered SAEs.  The planned overnight hospitalization on Day 1 of Cycle 1 is 
exempt from this definition and is not considered an SAE since it is a study procedure and not 
for treatment of an SAE, unless an AE occurs du ring the hospitalization that meets the criteria 
above . 
3 “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant and 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
4 Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical inter vention to 
IMSA101  ImmuneSensor Therapeutics  
Clinical Study Protocol: IMSA101 -101   
   
 
 
Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 80 prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in de ath or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above should also usually be considered serious.  
All other A Es are considered non -serious. All non -serious A Es will be followed to resolution, or 
until the study ends, and reported to the sponsor  as requested, to the Institutional Review Board s 
(IRBs )/Institutional Ethics Committees (I ECs) according to IRB/ IEC policies (to include annual 
Continuing Review Reports), to the  CRC  as required, and to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA ) as required for the annual report.  
AEs meeting the stopping criteria outlined in Section  7 of this pr otocol will be reported to the 
sponsor , the IRBs/ IECs, and the CRC following the SAE reporting guidelines.  
Management of all A Es including hypersensitivity or hyperimmune reactions will be managed 
by treating physicians in conjunction with relevant institutional guidelines and with the 
consultation of the sponsor ’s medical monitor.  
9.1.3  Adverse Event by Severity or Intensity  
The assessment of severity of an AE will be rated according to the criteria in Table  6.  
Table  6 Definitions of Adverse Events Severity  
Grade 1 (Mild)  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. The adverse event ( AE) does not interfere 
with routine activities. The patient may experience slight discomfort.  
Grade 2 (Moderate)  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; The AE 
interferes with routine activities. The patient may experience significant 
discomfort.  
Grade 3 (Severe)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated. The patient is 
unable to perform routine activities. The patient may experience intolerable 
discomfort or pain.  
Grade 4 (Life -Threatening)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5 (Fatal)  Death related to AE  
Based on the Common Terminology Criteria fo r Adverse Events v 5.0 (CTCAE) . 
 
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of 
relatively minor clinical significance ( e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as “serious”.

Clinical Study Protocol: IMSA101 -101   
   
 
 
Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 81 Seriousness of A Es is based on the outcome of an AE and usually associated with events that 
pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  
9.1.4  Relationship between Adverse Events and Study Drug  
Determination of the relationship (if any) between the AE and the study drug will be made using 
the guidelines presented in Table  7. 
Table  7 Guidelines for Determining the Relationship (if any) Between Adverse  Event and 
the Study Drug  
Definite ly Related : This causal relationship is assigned if the AE starts a reason able time after the 
administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is stopped, and could 
reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the study drug.  
Probably Related:  This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after the 
administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is stopped, and could 
not be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after the 
administration of study drug, but could be produced by the patient’s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
Unlikely Related  This causal relationship is assigned when the time association or the patient’s clinical 
state is such that the study drug was not likely to have had an association with the 
observed AE.  
Not Related:  This causal relationship is assigned when there is clearly no evidence of association 
with the study drug and the observed AE.  
Pregnancy or lactation are exclusion criteria for this study. Pregnancy per se is not considered an 
AE unless there is cause to believe that the investigational drug may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Refer to Section  4.4 for details.  
9.1.5  Adverse Event Follow -up 
All A Es occurring during the study are to be followed up in accordance with good medical 
practice until they are resolved, stabilized or judged no longer clinically significant or, if a 
chronic condition, until fully characterized. Any A Es that are considered dr ug-related (possibly 
related, probably related, or definitely related) must be followed until resolution or until 
stabilization.  
All unresolved A Es following the study should be followed by the investigator until the events 
are resolved, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the AE is otherwise explained. At the last 
scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct each patient to report any subsequent event(s) 
that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study.  
Prior to the conclusion of the study at the site, the investigator should notify the ImmuneSensor  
Therapeutics (ImmuneSensor) , Safety Associate, or designee of any death or AE occurring at 
any time after a patient has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 82 related to this study. After study conclusion, the investigator should notify ImmuneSensor of any 
death or AE they are aware of occurring at any time after a patient has discontinued or 
terminated stu dy participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
The investigator should notify ImmuneSensor or its designee, of any death or AE occurring at 
any time after a patient has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be 
related to this study.  
9.1.6  Overdose  
Any dosing errors should be immediately reported to the sponsor. The dosing error should be 
fully documented in the patient’s source documentation/ case report form ( CRF ) and where 
applicable , filed promptly with IRB and regulatory author ities.   
Subsequent dosing shall be discontinued until the investigator and sponsor have both determined 
it’s safe to resume treatment.  
9.1.7  Pregnancies  
No clinical data on the effects on pregnancy or lactation are available. Precautions relative to 
patients of reproductive potential are discussed in  Section  4.4. 
9.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
9.2.1  Reporting Requirements  
Any SAE made known to the investigator must be reported by the investigator if it occurs during 
the clin ical study, whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the IMSA101 treatment. 
An SAE report consists of the SAE form, the AE form, and the concomitant medication form.  
A copy of these forms must be forwarded within 24  h of awareness. Contact details will be 
provided in the study reference manual.  
The investigator should not wait to receive additional infor mation to document fully the event 
before notification of a n SAE, though additional information may be requested. Where 
applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospital case records, and autopsy 
reports should be obtained.  
Instances of dea th, congenital abnormality, or an event that is of such clinical concern as to 
influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the investigator at any 
time after cessation of study drug administration and linked by the investigat or to this study, 
should be reported to the medical monitor.  
Progression of disease by itself is not considered an AE but rather an expected outcome and a 
study endpoint and should not be reported as A Es or SAEs , unless it results in hospitalization or 
death . AEs associated with progressive disease (such as a pleural effusion or gastrointestinal  
obstruction) and associated ho spitalizations to treat the AE or SAE are reportable events .

A for mal detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be created prior to the analysis of any data.  
The purpose of the Phase  I dose escalation study is to determine the safety and tolerability of 
IMSA101 and to define the MTD/RP2D of the drug when administered by intratumoral  
injection. Groups of 3  to 6 patients will be treated at each dose level until the MTD is reached  as 
detailed in Section 3.1. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria and receiving at least 1 dose of 
IMSA101  will be evaluable for safety in the Safety Population.  
Phase IIA statistics will be mainly descriptive and informed by the ultimate selection of tumor 
types to be evaluated. Statistical methods including pre -defined criteria for signal detection and 
drug differentiation from standard -of-care benchmarks as well  as stage progression and futility 
assessment will be included in the final SAP . 
10.1.2  Disposition of Patients

11.8 COLLECTION, MONITORING AND AUDITING STUDY 
DOCUMENTATION  
11.8.1  Data Collection  
The sponsor  or the designee will utilize qualified monitors to review and evaluate activities 
conducted at investigator sites for Quality Assurance.  
Data for each patient will be recorded on an eCRF. Data collection must be completed for each 
patient who signs an ICF and is administered treatment.  
The data will be entered into the clinical study database and verified for accuracy, following 
procedures defined by the sponsor  (or designee). Data will be processed and analyzed following 
procedures defined by the sponsor  (or designee).  
The medical monitor will review any SAEs that occur during the study.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the study monitor will carry out source document 
verification at regular intervals to ensure that the data collected in the eCRF are accurate and 
reliable.  
Data that is not captured directly via an electronic device or instrument will be collected from 
source documents and entered into an eCRF within an electronic data capture  system. Electronic 
data capture  security features will include the requirement for a unique user identification and 
password for each individual who make entries, reviews , or makes changes to the data.  
The investigator will be responsible for ensuring data is electronically captured or that it is 
entered into the eCRF in a timely manner relative to the patient visit. The investigator will ensure 
the accuracy and completeness of all patient data specified in the protocol. Upon study 
completion, the data collected in the eCRF will be provided to each study center in portable 
document format (PDF).  
11.8.2  Study Monitoring  
A representative of the sponsor  or the designee will meet with the investigator and his/her staff 
prior to the entrance of the first patient to review study procedures and methods of recording 
study data.

for the monitor visit, ensuring that all source documents, completed eCRFs, signed consent 
forms, and other study -related documents are readily available for review. Source documents that 
will be reviewed include but are not limited to accuracy of CRFs, protocol compliance, accuracy 
of entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. Documentation of monitoring will be 
maintained along with other protocol -related docum ents and will be reviewed during internal 
audit.  
11.8.3  Auditing of Study Documentation  
Study centers and study documentation may be subject to a Quality Assurance audit at any time 
during or after the study. In addition, inspections may be conducted by regulatory authorities at 
their discretion.  
The investigator  must permit the monitor, the IRB/IEC, the sponsor ’s internal auditors, and 
representatives from regulatory authorities, direct access to all study -related documents and 
pertinent hospital or medical records for confirmation of data contained within the eCRFs.  
The study will be monitored and/or audited at intervals to ensure that the clinical study is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
study protocol; ICH E6 R2 consolidated guidelines; and other applicabl e regulations. The extent, 
nature, and frequency of monitoring and/or audits will be based on such considerations as the 
study objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose of the study, study design complexity, and 
enrollment rate. At the conclusion of a progr am, a compliance statement will be generated by the 
sponsor  (or designee) listing all audit activities performed during the clinical study.  
All data recordings and source documentation (including electronic health records) must be made 
available to the sponsor  (or designee), FDA, IRB/IEC, and any other regulatory agencies that 
request access to study records, including source documents, for inspection and copying, in 
keeping with federal and local regulations.  
11.9 RECORD RETENTION  
According to ICH guidelines, source documentation and other “essential documents” must be 
archived. Essential documents include those documents which individually and collectively 
permit the evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced (ICH 2016) . 
This may include observations and source data contained in medical records (certified copies or 
originals are acceptable for archiving purposes), data collection forms or eCRFs and research -
related records held in support departments. All hard copies of source documents must be 
retained. If electronic records of documents exist, these must be backed up and retained with the 
hard copies.  
Essential documents should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a 
marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed sinc e the formal discontinuation of

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 95 13.2 RECIST GUIDELINE (VERSION 1.1)  
All findings will be assessed for response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria  (Eisenhauer , 2009 ) 
at the end (≤ 7 days) of every even numbered cycle ( Cycle 2, Cycle 4, etc.) , and EOT . Refer to 
Section  6.9 for details.  
RECIST v1.1 criteria do not mention including or excluding lesions that are being biopsied or 
injected . However, f or the purpose s of this protocol, the injected and biopsied lesions are to be 
captured as non -target lesions only  (Phase I only) , as follows:  
• Injected  and biops ied lesion  = non -target lesion #1  
• Non-injected  and biopsied lesion  = non -target lesion #2  (if applicable)  
 
All patients will have their BEST RESPONSE on study classified as outlined below:  
Complete Response  (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) 
must have reduction in the short axis to < 10mm.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
Steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD.  
Progressive Disease  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the 
smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started. In addition to the relative increase 
of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one 
or more new lesions will also constitute progressive disease.  
Response Duration  
Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR (whichever is 
first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 96 Stable Disease Duration  
Stable disease duration will be measured from the time of start of therapy until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration” . Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

Amendment 9 FINAL  (13-JUN-2022 )  Confidential  Page 98 Method of Measurement  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  
Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g. , skin nodules, 
palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  
Chest X -ray 
Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.  
CT / MRI .  
CT and MRI might be the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target 
lesions selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with 
cuts of 10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should b e performed using a 5  mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Head & neck 
and extremities usually require specific protocols.  
Ultrasound  
When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound sho uld not be 
used to measure tumo r lesions that are clinically not easily accessible. It is a possible alternative 
to clinical measurements for superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. 
Ultrasound  might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions 
usually assessed by clinical examination.  
Cytology / Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases (for example, 
residual lesions in tumo r types such as germ cell tumo rs, w here known residual benign tumo rs can 
remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during tre atment when the measurable tumo r has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progress ive disease.

Creatinine clearance will be calculated using the Cockcroft -Gault formula (Cockcroft , 1976 ) as 
follows:  
Female s: 
For serum creatinine concentration in mg/dL:  
CrCl =  (140 –age in years) x weight in Kg x 0.85  
72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL  
 
Male s: 
For serum creatinine concentration in mg/dL:  
CrCl =  (140 – age in years) x weight in Kg x 1.00  
72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL

INTRODUCTION  
Abstract/Brief  Overview  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, potentially life -threatening complication in high -risk trauma  
patients. With emerging evidence demonstrating around 50% of trough serum anti -factor Xa (anti -Xa) 
concentrations are subtherapeutic and associated with increased VTE risk, the purpose of this pilot study  
is to evaluate the  safety  and efficacy  of a novel enoxaparin  dosing  strategy  based  on anti -Xa values.  
High-risk patients (e.g., risk assessment profile score ≥ 5) initiated on enoxaparin 30 mg q12h per current  
trauma team standard of care. Patients will be excluded for renal dysfunction (Cockcroft -Gault calculated  
creatinine  clearance  < 30 mL/min  or patients  on continuous  renal  replacement  therapy),  weight  < 50 kg or 
> 150 kg, nephrotic syndrome, platelet count < 50 x 103, allergy to heparin, patients on or requiring  
therapeutic anticoagulation at or  within 24 hours of admission, isolated intracranial hemorrhage, known  
hyperbilirubinemia, pregnancy, or incarceration.  Primary outcome is the comparison of antithrombin -III 
(AT-III), proportion of anti -Xa goal achievement at first, second, and all assessm ents, and time to goal  
anti-Xa. Patient outcomes include VTE events, bleeding outcomes, patients with bioaccumulation, and  
risk factors  for low anti-Xa. 
 
Purpose  of Study  
The purpose of this pilot study is to compare two enoxaparin dosing strategies: BID dosing and a dosing  
strategy based on anti -Xa values in high -risk trauma patients. Specific aims include: 1) to compare the  
extent of reduced AT -III activity between patien ts with anti -Xa ≥ 0.1 IU/mL and < 0.1 IU/mL upon initial  
assay and determine the proportion of patients who reach goal anti -Xa and time to goal anti -Xa between  
two dosing strategies: enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours (with consideration to increase to 50 mg every  
12 hours if recheck anti -Xa is not at goal; see section 6) and enoxaparin 30 mg every eight hours; 2) to  
compare anti -Xa adjusted enoxaparin -dosing strategies based on VTE, bleeding rates, transfusion  
requirements, drug discontinuation rate and bioac cumulation, and 3) to determine patient -specific factors  
that correlate to subtherapeutic anti -Xa such as serial AT -III activity, weight, body mass index, age,  
cumulative  fluid administration and  thromboelastography  (TEG).  
 
Background  
Background  and Signif icance  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common and potentially life -threatening complication in hospitalized  
patients.  VTE risk is highest in the subset of critically injured patients, with the estimated incidence of  
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmona ry embolism (PE) without prophylaxis ranging from 40 -80% and  
4-10%, respectively.1 Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) agents are the agent of choice for VTE  
prevention  in high-risk trauma  patients  (i.e., multiple orthopedic trauma;  injury  severity score  [ISS] > 9).2-9 
 
Enoxaparin is a LMWH that is FDA -approved for the treatment and prevention of VTE. Enoxaparin binds  
to and potentiates the action of anti -thrombin III (AT -III). AT -III is an endogenous anticoagulant that  
inhibits factors Xa and IIa (e.g., thrombin) to prevent clot formation. Conflicting evidence exists for the  
optimal enoxaparin dose in critically injured patients.  Trough serum anti -factor Xa (anti -Xa) 
concentrations between 0.1 – 0.2 IU/mL have been utili zed as a surrogate marker for LMWH prevention  
efficacy.10 A single -center, prospective, observational study of high -risk (ISS > 10) edematous (n = 10)  
and non -edematous (n = 11) trauma patients receiving enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours demonstrated  
proport ion of anti -Xa < 0.1 IU/mL at 4, 8, and 12 hours were 60%, 90%, and 100%, respectively, in  
edematous patients.  Even 64% and 81% of non -edematous patients were undetectable at 8 and 12  
hours.11 Calculated  mean enoxaparin  half-lives for edematous  and non -edematous  patients  were  0.83 ± 
0.51 hours and 1.85 ± 0.93 hours, respectively (p = 0.014), which suggests rapid elimination of  
enoxaparin.  Rutherford12 similarly evaluated anti -Xa values in seventeen critically ill surgery and trauma  
patients  receiving  enoxap arin 40 mg every  24 hours.  Mean  steady state  four-hour peak  anti-Xa was 0.19 
± 0.09  IU/mL while  the mean  trough was  0.04 ± 0.04  IU/mL.  Fifteen  (88%)  patients  had a trough  anti-Xa 
≥ 0.1 IU/mL with five (29%) patients having a trough anti -Xa of zero.  If anti -Xa provides a marker for  
efficacy, the above results suggest enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours and 40 mg every 24 hours will not  
provide adequate VTE prophylaxis.  Only one retrospective review has evaluated VTE events between  
enoxaparin 30 mg every 1 2 hours and 40 mg every 24 hours, which was not statistically significant (1.1%  
vs. 2.9%,  p = 0.118).13 
Robinson14 performed a prospective, randomized trial following serial anti -Xa levels at baseline, 4, 12, 16,  
and 24 hours for three days in me dical/surgical ICU patients receiving enoxaparin 40 mg once daily  
versus 30 mg twice daily, 40 mg twice daily, or 1 mg/kg once daily.  Majority of patients (88%) were  
admitted for medical, not surgical, diagnoses.  An anti -Xa between 0.1 – 0.4 IU/mL was main tained for  
33.3% in 40 mg daily group, 41.7% in 30 mg twice -daily group, 83% in 1 mg/kg daily group, and 91.7% in  
40 mg twice -daily group of the study period.  Mean steady -state peak anti -Xa levels were 0.13 IU/mL for  
40 mg daily, 0.15 IU/mL for 30 mg twice daily, 0.33 IU/mL for 40 mg twice daily, and 0.40 IU/mL for 1  
mg/kg daily. The authors concluded that enoxaparin 40 mg daily and 30 mg twice daily may provide  
insufficient  VTE prophylaxis,  but the ideal dose is  still unknown.  
 
Increased VTE rates have been seen in patients with subtherapeutic anti -Xa values.  Malinoski15 found  
that of 54 patients  on enoxaparin  30 mg every  12 hours,  27 (50%)  had subtherapeutic  anti-Xa troughs  
and a statistically significant  higher DVT  rate than those  with appropriate  levels  (37%  vs. 11%,  p = 0.026).  
Mean peak anti -Xa values were also lower in the subtherapeutic group (0.17 ± 0.1 IU/mL vs. 0.27 ± 0.1  
IU/mL,  p < 0.001);  however,  peak anti -Xa values  were  not different  in those  with and  without  DVT (0.23  ± 
0.12 IU/mL vs. 0.23 ± 0.1 IU/mL, p = NS).  A subsequent enoxaparin anti -Xa dose -adjusted protocol  
targeting peak anti -Xa levels between 0.2 – 0.4 IU/mL showed 18 (29.5%) of 61 patients on 30 mg twice - 
daily enoxaparin were at goal anti -Xa after the third dose.16Only 5 (8.2%) patients, all in the therapeutic  
peak anti -Xa group, had a trough anti -Xa > 0.1 IU/mL.  VTE events occurred in three patients in the entire  
study cohort (4.9%).  Of the 27 patients with dosage adjustments, 22 (81.5%) pa tients received  
enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily, four patients received 50 mg twice daily (14.8%), and 1 patient received 60  
mg twice daily (3.7%).  Of note, there were no major bleeding events, which is not surprising given the  
anti-Xa peak goal is much lower  when compared to standard therapeutic dosing goals (e.g., 0.5 – 1.1 
IU/mL).  Finally, a before -and-after study evaluated an anti -Xa adjusted dalteparin dosing strategy in high - 
risk (risk assessment profile [RAP] ≥ 5) trauma patients.17 High-risk patients were initiated on dalteparin  
5000  units  daily with a 12-hour anti-Xa value  drawn  after the first dose  in the post-protocol  group.  If the 
12 hour anti -Xa was < 0.1 IU/mL, the dose was increased to 5000 units twice -daily.  Low trough anti -Xa 
was seen in 51% of post -group patients.  VTE was lower in the post -protocol group (7.0% vs. 12.8%, p =  
0.009) and higher in the subgroup of patients with a subtherapeutic trough anti -Xa (14.4% vs. 5.4%, p =  
0.05).  Therefore, anti -Xa adjustment of LMWH ma y result in fewer VTE events.  No difference in blood  
transfusion after the first 48 hours was noted, suggesting appropriate safety with an anti -Xa driven dosing  
protocol  for dalteparin.  
 
Previous studies have tried to identify predictors for low anti -Xa co ncentrations. Young age, high body  
weight,  edema,  and low peak  anti-Xa concentration  have been associated  with low trough anti -Xa.11, 15, 17 
AT-III concentrations have not been collected or evaluated in many previous studies.  Low AT -III 
concentrations have not been evaluated as a risk factor for low anti -Xa. Theoretically, low serum AT -III 
may represent a reduction in substrate to which LMWH can bind and exert anticoagulant effects. Hence,  
LMWH  effectiveness  and anti -Xa may  be reduced.  
 
Pharmacokinetic  / Safety  Information  
Previous pharmacokinetic studies evaluating enoxaparin prophylaxis and anti -Xa levels suggest high  
inter-patient variability, especially in critically ill patients (table 1).11-12,14 However, the mean maximum  
serum conce ntration (Cmax) did not reach the lower threshold for therapeutic dosing.  Therapeutic  
enoxaparin anti -Xa concentrations are between 0.5 – 1.1 IU/mL for 1 mg/kg every 12 hours, and 1.0 – 2.0 
IU/mL for 1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours.19 No major bleeding events wer e identified in previous studies. 12,14 
Additionally, evaluation of anti -Xa adjusted dalteparin dosing found no difference in transfusion  
requirements.17 Other evaluations of enoxaparin have found few minor bleeding events such as  
hematoma following total hip arthroplasty, ecchymosis, hematuria, and epistaxis.10,20 Based on these  
previous pharmacokinetic evaluations, patients enrolled in the proposed study would achieve a steady  
state peak between 0.3 – 0.5 IU/mL and a steady state trough between 0.1 – 0.3 IU/mL.  Maintenance of  
said anti -levels should prevent major bleeding events.  Additionally, exclusion of patients with poor renal  
function, defined as a Cockcroft -Gault calculated creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min will reduce the risk of  
bleeding  events  due to reduced drug elimination.

Study  Justification  
Ideal enoxaparin dose for VTE prevention in high -risk trauma patients is unknown.  Predictors and  
explanations for low anti -Xa are also unknown. With emerging evidence demonstrating around 50% of  
trough anti -Xa concentrations are subtherapeutic and associat ed with increased VTE risk, the purpose of  
this study is to compare AT -III serum concentrations as a predictor of low anti -Xa. Secondly, the study will  
compare two enoxaparin dosing.  Ultimately, this information can be used to develop an optimum protocol  
for patient -specific  enoxaparin  dosing  for VTE prevention to  improve patient  outcomes.  
 
METHODS  
Study design  
This is an investigator -initiated, single -center, prospective, non -blinded, randomized controlled trial.  Multi - 
system trauma patients between 18 -80 years old admitted to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center  
(UCMC), an urban American College of Surgeons -verified Level 1 trauma center will be identified by the  
Trauma Surgery team.  The trauma team will inform s tudy personnel of these patients once enoxaparin is  
initiated. These  patients will  be screened  for inclusion  in the study.  Patients who  meet  inclusion  criteria  
will be administered  informed  consent  by study  personnel  in their rooms.  Patients in  the surgical  
intensive care unit (SICU) and on the surgical floor are eligible for enrollment if all other inclusion and  
exclusion criteria are met.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to enrollment. Goal enrollment is 200  
patients  with 100 patients  in the control  group and 50  patients  in each randomization  group.  
 
Research  data collection/study  procedures  
Patients  will be screened  daily by  the trauma  team.  Research  personnel  will be alerted  to potential  
patients  for enrollment.  
 
Intervention  
Seru m AT -III and anti -Xa will be drawn eight hours after the third dose of enoxaparin 30 mg q12h. Serum  
assays after at least the third dose should approximate drug steady state trough concentrations.  Patients  
with a serum anti -Xa ≥ 0.1 IU/mL will remain on enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours and will be the control  
group.  Patients with undetectable anti -Xa (intervention groups), defined as a trough anti -Xa < 0.1 IU/mL,  
will be randomized  to receive either:  
a. Enoxapar in 40 mg every  12 hours  (group  1) 
b. Enoxaparin  30 mg every  eight  hours  (group 2)  
Subsequent  trough  anti-Xa levels  will be performed  eight  hours  after the third dose.  Repeat  anti-Xa 
levels will be drawn eight hours after the third dose of the new regimen(s) (see attached figures) for  
patients in the treatment arms and eight hours after the sixth dose for those in the control arm.  For 
patients in group 2, anti -Xa levels will be drawn w ithin 30 minutes of the fourth and eight doses.  If 
patients continue to be subtherapeutic, the group 1 dose will be increased to 50 mg every 12 hours, while  
the group 2 dose will remain at 30 mg every eight hours.  Group 2 will not have subsequent dose  
adjustment, as this regimen has not been previously evaluated. Coordinated AT -III and TEG will be  
performed with the first anti -Xa assessment and the first repeat assessment in the interventional groups.  
After the initial assessments, weekly anti -Xa and AT -III will be collected on patients requiring dose  
adjustment for up to 28 days.  If the weekly trough anti -Xa level is ≥ 0.3 IU/mL, the enoxaparin dose will  
be decreased to the previous dose (i.e., enoxaparin 50 mg every 12 hours would be decreased to 40 mg  
every 12 hours; enoxaparin 40 mg every 12 hours would be decreased to 30 mg every 12 hours;  
enoxaparin 30 mg every eight hours would be decreased to 30 mg every 12 hours) with patient remaining  
in enrolled study  group  for all outcome analyses.  
 
Randomization  
Following informed consent, serum AT -III and anti -Xa values will be assayed per protocol.  Patients with  
an anti -Xa level < 0.1 IU/mL undergo unblinded 1:1 randomization to ensure equal allocation to each  
intervention group. Randomization will be performed by study personnel. If the standard of care anti -Xa 
per trauma protocol is not collected or inappropriately drawn/mistimed by nursing or phlebotomy staff,  
patients will be able to have a repeat standard of care anti -Xa within 24 hours of initial draw for  
assignment to treatment or control groups for enrollment and outcome analysis (protocol amendment).  
This practice aligns  with the current  daily trauma protocol  operations.  
 
Data  Collection:  
Coordinated serum anti -Xa, AT -III, and TEG will be collected as pre viously described. Time to goal anti - 
Xa achievement will be collected as previously described.  Additional data to be collected include patient  
sex, age, weight, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), injury mechanism (blunt vs.  
penetrating), ISS, abbreviated injury score ([AIS] for head, chest, abdomen, extremity, cervical spine,  
thoracic spine, and lumbar spine), RAP, admission and highest serum creatinine, admission and lowest  
creatinine clearance (Cockroft and Gault calculated ), admission unit (e.g., ICU; floor), time to enoxaparin  
initiation, heparin initiation (days and number of doses) prior to enoxaparin therapy, VTE events specified,  
length of stay (hospital and ICU), 28 -day mortality, major and minor bleeding events, over all mortality,  
interruption of study drug, cumulative fluid balance from admission with each serum assay, total milliliters  
of transfused fluid to date at each anti -Xa assessment, and milliliters of packed red cells transfused in  
specified time  frame.  
 
Specimen  collection  
Serum assays will be collected as previous described. In summary, initial AT -III and anti -Xa 
concentrations will be performed eight hours after the third dose of enoxaparin 30 mg q12h.  Repeat anti - 
Xa assessment will be performed after the  third dose of the new enoxaparin regimen, based on patient  
randomization. Coordinated AT -III and TEG will be performed with the first anti -Xa assessment and the  
first repeat assessment in the interventional group.  After the initial assessments, weekly ant i-Xa and AT - 
III will be collected on patients requiring dose adjustment for up to 28 days.  All serum anti -Xa and  
coordinated  AT-III and TEG will be drawn 30  minutes  prior to stated  dose.  
 
Subjects will have the serum assays drawn by either nursing staff v ia central catheter access or  
phlebotomy  via peripheral  venous  access.  All labs  will be drawn using two  2.7 mL  blue top, sodium  
citrate tubes.  One tube  is needed  for the TEG,  while  the other  is used  for the AT-III and anti -Xa. 
Potential  Benefits  
VTE are associated with a high morbidity and mortality.  Optimal LMWH dosing has not been established  
for critically injured patients who have altered pharmacokinetics due to altered volume of distribution and  
metabolism, variable age and weight, and potent ial decreases in AT -III. Subtherapeutic serum anti -Xa 
trough concentration has been associated with increased risk for VTE.  This pilot clinical investigation has  
the potential  to revolutionize  enoxaparin  dosing  and VTE prevention  through  anti-Xa guided  dosing. 
Thorough evaluation of risk factors for reduced anti -Xa may provide a focused assessment of patients  
requiring anti -Xa assessment and subsequent dose adjustments.  Overall, optimal enoxaparin dosing will  
result in fewer VTE events without increasing bl eeding risk with an anti -Xa driven adjustment.  Improved  
patient outcomes, expansion of scientific knowledge, and development of VTE prevention protocols may  
result.  
 
Potential  Risks,  Discomforts,  and Inconveniences  
Level  of Risk 
VTE risks with inadequate prophylaxis have been previously justified above. Risks of increased  
enoxaparin doses include major and minor bleeding events. Risks will be mitigated by appropriate  
exclusion of patients with low body weight and increased serum c reatinine / decreased creatinine  
clearance.  Serum assays for risk of bioaccumulation will be performed weekly with subsequent dose  
reduction. Additionally, patient serum creatinine and creatinine clearance will be assessed daily by the  
trauma team with app ropriate therapy modification should patient’s renal function worsen. Patients with a  
50% change in serum creatinine or an absolute change in serum creatinine by 1 mg/dL will be removed  
from the study.  If these changes in renal function occur after patient  has received initial laboratory  
assessment  (i.e., anti-Xa; AT-III; TEG) will be  included  in the  primary  outcome analysis.  
 
Blood volume loss due to serum anti -Xa, TEG, and AT -III assay as described above is minimal (2.7 mL x  
2). Patients requiring periphe ral vein access for serum assays will be at risk for pain/discomfort, bruising,  
fainting,  and infection  from phlebotomy  sites.  
 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Plan  
Collected data will be screened for adverse events. Jason Schrager, MD will act as medical monitor a nd 
review  collected data and all  adverse events  to ensure  patient  safety.  
 
Data  Analysis  
Primary  Endpoints  
1. Initial  AT-III activity  between  the control  group  and the intervention  group.  
2. Proportion of patients reaching goal anti -Xa between group 1 and group 2 overall, at first  
repeat  assessment,  and at second  repeat  assessment.  
3. Median  time to achievement  of goal anti-Xa between  group  1 and group  2. 
 
Secondary  Endpoints  
1. Patient outcomes to be compared between control and intervention groups including all VTE  
events (i.e., pulmonary embolism; upper extremity deep venous thromboembolism [DVT];  
proximal lower extremity DVT; distal lower extremity DVT), major bleeding (i.e., hemoglobin  
decrease of ≥ 2 g/dL in a 24 hour period requiring ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells while on  
enoxaparin; worsened or new intracranial hemorrhage while on enoxaparin; repeat surgical  
intervention due to hemorrhage while on enoxaparin), minor b leeding (minor gastrointestinal  
bleeding [coffee ground emesis with or without < 2 units packed red cell transfusion needed  
while on enoxaparin]; interruption of study drug by trauma team; other overt bleeding not  
characterized  a major  while  on enoxaparin) , total transfusion  requirements after  48 hours  
until discharge or  admission day  28. 
2. Proportion  of patients  with enoxaparin bioaccumulation  (defined as  an anti -Xa ≥ 0.3  IU/mL  at 
any assay)  between  group  1 and 2. 
3. Risk factor  determination  for low anti-Xa. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  An intention - 
to-treat model will be used for data analysis.  Patients excluded due to change in renal function will be  
included in the primary outcome analysis, but not patient outcome analyses for VTE and bleeding  
outcomes.   Nominal data will be reported using frequencies of occurrence and proportions as  
appropriate. Continuous data will be reported using means and standard deviations or medians and  
ranged as appropriate per distribution. Hypothesis testing for nominal data will be performed using the  
Fisher’s exact test or chi square test as required based on sample size. Continuous data will be  
compared using student’s t -test/ANOVA or rank sum/Kruskal -Wallis ANOVA for normally distributed and  
non-normally distributed data, respectively. A p -value < 0.05 will designate statistical significance.  Time - 
to-event analyses will be compared as appropriate and presented as Kaplan -Meier curves.  Multivariate  
logistic regression will be performed for low anti -Xa risk determination.  All values with a p -value < 0.2 will  
be included in the model.  Serum AT -III, weight, and age will be forced into the model, regardless of p - 
value.  
 
A total of 200 patients will be enro lled. Assuming that 50% of patients will have an undetectable anti -Xa 
on enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours, we hypothesize the intervention group will have an absolute  
reduction in AT -III activity of 10% compared to the control group if the control group has a mean AT -III 
activity of 80% with a standard deviation of 25%.  Secondarily, we hypothesize that there will be an  
absolute difference of 27% in the proportion of pat ients who achieve goal anti -Xa between group 1 and  
group 2, assuming 50% of group 1 achieves goal.  To achieve an 80% power with an alpha of 0.05 for  
both outcomes,  goal enrollment  is 200 patients  (table 2).

Data  storage  and confidentiality  (include  sample  storage  if applicable)  
A single, central, electronic database will be constructed using Microsoft Excel® for storing all study - 
related data (attached).  The database will be password protected such that only authorized study  
personnel can access the data.  Data will be maintained in a confidential manner with regular reminders  
of the need for confidentiality provided from the senior investigator. A single subject log will be kept for  
matching patient study number, initials, medical record number, and admission date (attached). Once  
assigned to the log, patients will only be evaluated using their de -identified,  study number.  Data entered  
into the electronic  database will  be de-identified.  
Once the study has been completed, the electronic database will be maintained in a locked office, per the  
IRB specifications.  Only study personnel will have access to  the data. Once the IRB -approved time has  
elapsed,  all materials  will be destroyed.

INTRODUCTION : 
 
A biomedical or health -related research study is performed to answer specific questions  
about a  disease.  
 
Before you agree to participate in this research study, it is important that you be told the  
purpose, procedures, benefits, risks, discomforts, and precautions of the research. You  
should also be told what alternative procedures are available to you if you  do not  
participate  in the research  study.  The informed  consent  document  is a written  summary  
of this information. Be sure to ask questions while you read this consent document and  
ask questions  if there  is anything  that you do  not understand.  
 
Your  participation  in this research  study  is entirely  voluntary.  
 
You may choose either to take part or not to take part in this research study. If you  
decide to take part, you may decide to leave the study at any time. Leaving the study  
will not result  in any penalty or  loss of  benefits  to you.  
 
The researcher  and sponsor  of this study  do not promise  that you will receive  any 
benefits from  this study.  
 
If you are acting  as a representative  to give consent  for another  person  to participate  in 
this study,  “you”  throughout  this consent  form refers  to that individual.  
 
The obligation of a representative is to try to determine what the individual would do if  
competent, or if the subject's wishes cannot be determined, what the representative  
thinks  is in the person's  best interest.  If possible,  an attempt  should  be made  to obtain  
permission from the individual. Some persons may resist participating in a research  
protocol that  has been  approved  by their representatives.  Under  no circumstances  may 
individuals  be forced to participate.  
 
 WHY  IS THIS  RESEARCH  BEING  DONE?  
 
There  are two reasons  this research  is being  done.  
1.) To find blood markers that may explain why some patients have low levels of the  
drug enoxaparin. Enoxaparin is used to stop blood clots from being made. Blood  
clots are usually formed in the legs and the lungs. If a blood clot occurs in the  
lungs, it can be life threatening. People with major injuries are at high risk for  
blood clots.  
2.) To learn  the best dose  of the medicine  enoxaparin  in patients  with injuries.  
 
Enoxaparin  is approved  by the Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  for the prevention  
of blood clots. Enoxaparin is the accepted drug for prevention in trauma patients by  
many  physician  groups  including  the United States Air Force.  
 
WHY  HAVE  YOU  BEEN  ASKED  TO TAKE  PART  IN THIS  RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because, you are at least 18  
years old and not more than 80 years of age, have a traumatic injury and have a high  
risk of forming a  blood clot.  
 
HOW  LONG  WILL YOU  BE IN THE RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
You will be in the research  study  for up  to four (4) weeks  or until you are discharged  
from the hospital,  whichever  comes first.  
 
The researcher may decide to take you off this research study at any time.  The 
treatment team may also decide to take your off this research at any time.  If you have  
side effects  that could  be from the study  medication s, you will be taken  out of the study.  
If there are any changes in your condition that would increase your risk of bleeding, the  
study medication will be stopped temporarily or permanently and you may be removed  
from the study.  
 
You may withdraw from the study at any time. If you decide to stop participating in the  
study,  we encourage  you to talk to the researcher and  your doctor  first so  that stopping  
can be done safely. Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking ab out 
stopping  is to discuss what  follow -up care  and testing  could  be most helpful  to you. 
 
You may be contacted in the future by representatives of the University of Cincinnati  
who are interested in asking you survey questions about your participation in this  
research  study.  If you choose  to participate  in the survey,  your responses  will be used  
for quality  assurance purposes only.  
WHO  IS CONDUCTING  THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
This study  is sponsored  by the United  States  Air Force.  
 
The study is directed by Molly Droege, PharmD, the researcher at the University of  
Cincinnati Medical Center. Medical supervision for the study is provided by Krishna  
Athota,  MD. 
 
HOW  MANY  PEOPLE  WILL  TAKE  PART  IN THE RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
About  200 people  will take part in this study  at the University  of Cincinnati  Medical  
Center.  
 
WHAT  IS INVOLVED IN  THE RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
You will be receiving  30 mg of enoxaparin  twice  daily as part of your clinical  care.  
 
If you choose to participate in the study, you will have 5.4 mL of blood (a little over a  
teaspoon)  drawn  before  receiving  your fourth  (4th) standard  of care dose  of enoxaparin  
to have  three blood tests run.  
1. Antithombin -III (AT -III) – is naturally in your body. Enoxaparin works with it to  
stop clots from forming.  Measuring  AT-III ensures  the drug has the ability  to work  
in your body.  
2. Anti-activated  factor  Xa (anti-Xa) – measures  how much  enoxaparin  is in your 
body.  
3. Thromboelastography (TEG)  – measures  how well your body  forms  clots.  
 
These  blood  labs will allow  the investigators  to determine  what  affects  enoxaparin  and 
how well enoxaparin stops clots from forming. You may benefit from this extra  
monitoring.  
 
If your anti-Xa level is normal,  you will continue  on the current  dose  of enoxaparin.  No 
additional  blood tests will  be taken.  
 
If your anti-Xa level is low, you will receive  one of two following  investigational  doses  of 
enoxaparin.  These  doses  are higher than  the FDA approved  dose.  The doses  are: 
1. Enoxaparin  40 mg injected  under  the skin twice  a day 
2. Enoxaparin  30 mg injected  under  the skin three  times  a day 
 
Which dose you receive will be determined completely by chance. You will have an  
equal  chance  of being  placed  in either  group.  This dose  adjustment  may benefit  you by 
decreasing  your risk of blood clot.  
 
Four hours  after receiving  the third investigational  dose,  2.7 mL  of blood  will be drawn  to 
run an anti -Xa test. This will tell the investigators how much enoxaparin is in your blood  
when  the drug  is at its highest  amount.  
 
Before the fourth investigational dose, you will have 5.4 mL (a little over a teaspoon) of  
blood drawn to run the three tests again. The three tests are the AT -III, anti -Xa, and  
TEG. These tests may benefit you because they will tell the investigators how well the  
drug is preventing blood clots. If your anti -Xa level is still low and you are in the group  
receiving enoxaparin 40 mg twice a day, your dose will be increased to 50 mg twice a  
day. Otherwise your dosage will remain the same. If your anti -Xa level is too high, your  
dose will be decreased to 30 mg twice a day. This may benefit you by pre venting too  
much  drug from  getting  in your  blood.  
 
Before  the fourth  adjusted  dose  for the  group  receiving  50 mg twice  a day,  or the eighth  
investigational dose for the 30 mg every eight (8) hours group, you will have 5.4 mL of  
blood drawn again to run the three tests.  The three tests are the AT -III, anti -Xa, and  
TEG.  
 
Additional blood (2.7 mL each time) will be drawn to test Anti -Xa levels on days seven  
(7), fourteen (14), twenty -one (21), and twenty -eight (28) if you are still in the hospital  
and are in one  of the  groups  receiving the  investigational  doses.  
 
The expected  maximum  amount  of blood  that will be drawn  if you are in one of the 
investigational  groups  for the entire  28 days  is 29.7 mL or about  two tablespoons.  
If at any time your anti -Xa level gets too high,  your dose  will be decreased  back  to the 
previous dose.  If at any time the trauma team believes you are having abnormal  
bleeding, a dose will not be given until it is determined to be safe or bleeding has  
stopped.  
 
If you decide to withdraw from the study at any time, you will resume the standard care  
enoxaparin dosage.  The standard dose is 30 mg twice per day. Depending on when  
you withdraw from the study, the team may draw an anti -Xa and adjust your dose to 40  
mg twi ce per day. This is the current routine care for trauma patients at the University of  
Cincinnati  Medical  Center.  
 
WHAT  ARE  THE RISKS  AND  DISCOMFORTS  OF THE RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
There  may be unknown  or unforeseen  risks associated  with study  participation . 
 
Common  side effects  of enoxaparin:  
 Low red blood  cell and platelet  counts  
 Redness,  irritation,  and bleeding  at the injection  site 
 Minor  bleeding  such  as bruising  or from existing  cuts or injuries  
 Feeling  light-headed,  dizzy,  or fainting  
 Tiredness  
 Allergic  reaction  
 Skin rash or  hives  
 Nose or gum  bleeding  
 Red or tarry stools  
 Red or dark brown  urine  
 
There  may be risks of  drawing  blood  (venipuncture).  Risks  of having  your blood  drawn  
include faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, bruising, bleeding at the site of the  
puncture  and, rarely,  infection.  
 
ARE  THERE  BENEFITS  TO TAKING  PART  IN THE RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
If you agree to take part in this research study, you will have additional monitoring  
outside normal care that may benefit you. Specifically, the blood samples being  
collected will determine how well enoxaparin is preventing blood clots. Additionally, it i s 
possible that adjusted enoxaparin dosing may decrease the risk of clot formation and  
blood  clot-related  death.  The investigator  evaluations  are over and above  the standard  
of care. Information learned from this research study may benefit you while you ar e 
enrolled  in the study and  benefit  other  patients with injury  in the future.  
WHAT  OTHER  CHOICES  FOR  CARE  ARE  THERE?  
 
Instead  of being  in this research  study,  you can continue  with the usual  standard  for clot 
formation prevention. The physicians on the trauma service will continue to prescribe  
enoxaparin or other medications and devices for the prevention of clot. This is the  
trauma  service standard  of care for patients at  risk for clot formation.  
 
WHAT  IS THE CLINICAL  TRIALS  REGISTRY?  
 
A description of this clinical trial will be available on www.clinicaltrials.gov , as required  
by U.S. Law.  ClinicalTrials.gov is a registry and results database of publicly and  
privately  supported  clinical  studies  of human  participants  conducted  around  the world.  
 
This Web site will not include  information  that can identify  you. At most,  the Web site 
will include  a summary  of the results.  You can search  this Web site at any time.

Authorization  to Use and Disclose  Health  Information  
 
A federal regulation known as the Privacy Rule gives you certain rights concerning the  
privacy of your health information.  Researchers covered by this regulation are required  
to get your authorization (permission) to use and disclose (share with others) an y health  
information that could identify you. You should have received a Notice of Privacy  
Practices when you received health care services here.  If not, let us know and a copy  
will be given to you.  
 
If you sign this informed  consent  form,  you are giving  permission  for the use and 
disclosure of your health information for purposes of this research study.  You do not  have 
to give this permission.  Your health care outside of the study, payment for your  health 
care, and your health care benefits will not be affected if you choose not to sign  this form.  
However, if you do not sign this form, you will not be able to participate in the  study.  
 
Who Will Use and Disclose My Health Information? The study doctor and research  
staff (the study  team)  may use your health  information  to conduct,  review,  and determine 
the results of the study.  The study team may also use your information to  prepare reports 
or publications about the study.  However, your name will not appear in  any report or  
publication without you r permission.  
 
What Health Information will be Used and Disclosed?  The study team will record  your 
medical history, the treatment you receive, and the results of examinations and  tests done 
during the study on study forms.  The study team will send the completed  study forms to 
the study sponsor.   Representatives from the groups identified below  may need to look 
at your medical records to make sure that the information on the study  forms is correct or 
that the study was condu cted properly. Your medical records may  include other health 
information about you and may include documents that directly  identify you.  Reviews like 
that will take place at the study center or where the medical  records  are stored  and can 
take place  after the study  is over.  
 
Who Will Receive My Health Information? Your study information or medical records  
(as described  above) or both  may be shared  with the  following  people  or groups:  
 
 The study  sponsor  or its representatives,  including  companies  it hires to provide  
study -related  services  
 Researchers  who are conducting  this study  at other  study  centers  
 UC Institutional  Review  Board  and any other  committees  responsible  for 
overseeing  the research  
 Staff of the UC Human  Research  Protection  Program  
 UC Health  employees  providing  service  or care to you  
 Federal and State agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  
(FDA), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the National  
Institutes of Health (NIH), and other US and non -US government b odies that  
oversee  or review  research  
 
Will My Information be Protected by the Privacy Rule After it is Disclosed to  
Others?  
UC Health are required by the Privacy Rule to protect your health information.   After  your 
information is shared with others, such as the study sponsor, it may no longer be  
protected by the Privacy Rule.  The people who receive this information could use it in  
ways not discussed in this form and could disclose it to others.   The sponsor wil l use  and 
disclose your information only for research or regulatory purposes or to prepare  research 
publications.  In addition to using it for this study, the sponsor may reanalyze  the study  
data at a later date or combine  your information  with information  from other  
studies for research purposes not directly related to this study.  The goal of any such  
research  would  be to learn  more  about  drugs  or diseases  or to help design  better  
studies in the future.  When using your information in these ways, the sponsor may  share  
it with regulatory  authorities,  other  researchers,  its business  partners,  or companies  it 
hires to provide research -related  services.  
 
What Happens if I Leave the Study Early?  If you stop par ticipating in the study early  
for any reason, the study team will tell the sponsor why.  If the study team asks you to  
come to any more study visits and you agree, the study team will send the sponsor  
information from those visits as well.   All information  collected about you may continue  
to be used and  disclosed.  
 
Will My Authorization Ever Expire?  This Authorization does not have an expiration  
date.  The study team may need to correct or provide missing information about you  even 
after your study participa tion is over and a review of your medical  records may  also take 
place after  the study  is over.  
 
May I Take Back My Authorization? You have the right to take back (revoke) your  
Authorization at any time by writing to the person in charge of this research study whose  
information is listed on the front of this form.  If you revoke your Authorization, the study  
team will not collect any new health information about you.  However, they  can continue  
to use and disclose  any already -collected  information  if that is necessary  for the reliability 
of the study.  The sponsor can also still keep and use any information that it  has already 
received.  If you revoke your Authorization, you can no lo nger continue to  participate  in 
the study.  
 
May I Look At My Study Information? You have a right to see and make copies of  your 
medical records.  However, to ensure the reliability of the study, you will need to  wait to 
see your study records  until the stud y is completed.

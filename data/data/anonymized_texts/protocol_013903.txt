Version: 07 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  
A phase I /II dose-escalation  trial of leflunomide in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory 
multiple myeloma  
Brief Protocol Title for the Lay Public (if applicable):  
Leflunomide in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
Study Phase:  
Phase I/II 
Participating Sites:  
Single Center: City of Hop e, Duarte 
Rationale for this Study:  
Despite many advances in treatment, multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease and new, 
effective treatments are needed. Leflunomide  is a commercially available oral immunosuppressive 
agent that has been FDA approved since 1998 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The 
primary mechanism of action  of leflunomide  is inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis by 
targeting dihydr oorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), and thus achieving anti -proliferative effect in B - 
and T-lymphocytes. Leflunomide has been investigated for its anti -neoplastic potential in a variety of 
pre-clinical tumor models . Recent pre-clinical studies have demonstrat ed significant anti -neoplastic 
activity in multiple myeloma. In addition, limited clinical experience is suggestive of a beneficial 
response when leflunomide is used to treat relapsed /refractory multiple myeloma.  Considering the 
favorable toxicity profile and extensive clinical experience with leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis, 
this drug represents a potential new candidate for therapy in multiple myeloma.   
Objectives:  
In patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma:  
Phase I 
Primary Objectives: 
o  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) 
of leflunomide, when given as a single agent.  
o  To assess the safety and tolerability of leflunomide at each dose level by evaluation of 
toxicities including: type , frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.  
 
Phase II 
Primary Objective:  
o  To evaluate the anti -myeloma activity of leflunomide , when given as a single agent, as 
assessed by overall response rate  (ORR). 
Secondary Objectives:  
o  To obtain estimates of :  
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 4 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 o  Response duration  
o  Clinical benefit response  
o  Overall survival and  
o  Progression -free survival.  
 
Clinical Pharmacology Objectives (Phase I and II)  
o  To characterize the relationship between serum concentration of the active leflunomide 
metabolite , teriflunomide (A77 1726), and toxicity.  
o  To assess the relationship between serum concentration of the active leflunomide 
metabolite, teriflunomide A77 1726), and disease response.  
Exploratory Ex-Vivo and Molecular Objectives (Phase I and II)  
o  To explore the relationship between polymorphisms in the CYP1A2, CYP2C19 , or DHODH 
genes and toxicity/response.  CYP1A2, CYP2C19 are the hepatic enzymes responsible for 
leflunomide metabolism . 
o  To explore the ex vivo cytotoxicity of leflunomide toward primary MM cells , in order to 
evaluate whether individual ex vivo leflunomide response might be a useful predictor of 
therapeutic response .  
o  To explore the potential additive or synergistic effects of combining leflunomide with 
other classes of FDA -approved drugs . The classes include HDAC inhibitors, 
immunomodulatory drugs  [IMiDs ], proteasome inhibitors, steroid hormones, and 
antibody therapeutics such as the CD38 antibody daratumumab . 
o  To generate a preliminary RNA/miRNA and DNA -methylation signature associated with 
response of MM cells to leflunomide  in vivo and teriflunomide ex vivo. 
 
Study Design:  
This study will be conducted as a single center, single agent phase I/II trial.  
The phase I portion will implement a modified rolling six dose escalation design, a more conservative 
version of the rolling six design of Skolnik, et al. [1], for enrollment with dose escalation, de-
escalation, or expansion of a cohort on the basis of the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
during cycle 1.   
The starting dose of leflunomide is 20mg daily, with the intention to test up to 60mg daily. Escalation 
will proceed in increments of 20mg/day  (odd numbered dose levels) ; de-escalation will proceed in 
decrements of 10mg/day.  Up to six doses of leflunomide will be considered:   
Dose Level  Leflunomide Dose*  
-1 10 mg PO daily  
1 20 mg PO daily  
2 30 mg PO daily  
3 40 mg PO daily  
4 50 mg PO daily  
5 60 mg PO daily  
*NOTE: Leflunomide is administered with a loading dose of 100 mg for the 1st three doses.  
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 5 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 The highest dose level that produces ≤1/6 DLTs in cycle 1 will be the MTD. The RP2D of leflunomide 
will generally be the MTD, but it may be less than the MTD based on a review of available 
data/cumulative toxicities.  
Following the phase I trial, a single arm phase II trial will be conducted using a Simon Two -Stage 
Optimal Design [2, 3] to evaluate the anti -myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a 
single agent,  as assessed by overall response rate  (ORR). The phase II portion of the study is 
expected to enroll a minimum of 19 and a maximum of 39 patients. The sample size is based on 
the desire to discriminate a promising ORR of 30% from a d isappointing response rate of 15 % 
using a type I error rate of 0. 10 and power of 80%.  
Patients will be treated in planned 28-day treatment cycles until disease progression , unacceptable 
toxicity, or other criteria for removal from study treatment are satisfied.  Patients will undergo 
monthly evaluation for response using t he International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.  
Endpoints:  
Phase I: The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined in Section 
13.1 of the protocol.  
Phase II: The  primary endpoint is response. Response will be categorized using the IMWG response 
criteria for multiple myeloma [37, 38]. The response categories and criteria are summarized in Table 
11.2 of the protocol.  
Sample Size:  
The expected phase I sample size  is 12-18 patients; allowing for 6 patients to replace 
inevaluable/ineligible patients.  The expected phase II sample size is 19 -39 patients. It is anticipated 
that the 6 patients  from the phase I portion who are  treated at the R2PD will be included in the 
sample size for the phase II portion  (phase I/II participants) .  
Estimated Duration of the Study  
With an expected accrual rate of approximately 1 patient enrolled per month, t he phase I portion of 
the trial is expected to complete accrual in 12-18 months. The phase II portion is expected to accrue 
2 patients per month, with completion in 17  months. The expected maximum  duration of therapy is 
24 months. The total study is expected to last a maximum of (18+17+24) 59 months or 
approximately 5 years .

  Clinically significant medical disease or condition that, in the investigator’s opinion, may 
interfere with protocol adherence or the patient’s ability to give informed consent.  
  Pregnant women and women who are lactating. Leflunomide has potential for teratogenic 
or abortifacient effects.  Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nurs ing infants 
secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be 
discontinued if the mother is enrolled on this study.   
  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator’s judgment, contraindicate the patient’s 
participation in  the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study 
procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow 
medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.  
  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply 
with all study procedures (including compliance issues related to feasibility/logistics).  
 
Investigational Product Dosage and Administration:  
Leflunomide w ill be administered orally at an initial dose of 20 mg daily following a loading dose of 
100 mg per day for the first three days of administration. For the phase I portion of the study, five 
daily dose levels of leflunomide may be tested (10, 20, 30, 40 or 60 mg daily) There will be no intra -
patient dose  escalation. The R2PD will be used as the daily dose for the phase II portion of the study. 
At the end of the study, all participants will receive 11 days of oral cholestyramine treatment (8 g 
three times daily) to reduce the plasma leflunomide levels.  
Clinical Observations and Tests to be Performed:  
Clinical observations will include tolerance as well as response to treatment. Baseline studies will 
include: history and physical, pulmonary function test, skeletal survey and bone marrow aspiration 
and biopsy (the bone marrow a spiration will be used for clinical assessment and leftover samples will 
be used for correlative laboratory studies) , as well as a laboratory evaluation to include CBC with 
differential, comprehensive chemistry panel (to include LDH, magnesium, phosphorus and uric acid) 
and myeloma labs (serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation, 24 -hour urine protein 
electrophoresis, urine immunofixation, serum free light chains, and quantitative immunoglobulins ). 
Clinical observation of res ponse will take place on day 1 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects will be 
evaluated through clinic visits and physical exams as well as laboratory tests to include CBC with 
differential, comprehensive chemistry panel and myeloma labs.  Blood tests will be performed at a 
minimum of every 28 days but may be done more frequently as clinically indicated. A skeletal survey 
may be repeated as clinically indicated.  Patients will undergo toxicity assessment every two weeks 
for the first three cycles following initi ation with leflunomide and will undergo , at a minimum , 
monthly toxicity assessments thereafter.  For all phase II patients and phase I patients  enrolled at the 
anticipated RP2D , a second bone marrow aspiration  will be conducted for correlative laboratory 
studies on day 1  of cycle 2 . Confirmation of complete response (CR), stringent complete response 
(sCR), and progressive disease (PD) will involve bone marrow aspiration and , for patients who have 
enrolled in  the phase II portion,  leftover samples  from thes e bone marrow aspirations will be used

Version: 07 for correlative laboratory studies.  
Statistical Considerations:  
Analysis: Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination), severity, attribution, time of onset, duration, serum concentration of the active 
leflunomide metabolite,  probable association with the study treatment and reversibility or outcome. 
Baseline information (e.g. the extent/type of prior therapy) and demographic information will be 
presented as well to describe the patients treated in this study . 
Rates and 95% Clopper Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for overall 
response rate (patients that have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR  or PR) and clinical benefit rate (patients 
that have confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/MR or SD). In addition, sub -analyses will be performed where 
participants will be considered evaluable for response if they are confirmed eligible, receive at least 
75% of leflu nomide during the first cycle of therapy and have their disease re -evaluated. Response 
rates will also be explored based on number/type of prior therapy(ies) and serum concentration of 
the leflunomide metabolite (µg/mL). Time to response and survival will be estimated using the 
product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier.  
Serum trough levels of leflunomide’s active metabolite , teriflunomide ( A77 1726) , will be measured 
in each patient at multiple time points throughout the study. Both total and free teriflunom ide will 
be tested. The association between serum level s and toxicity, as well as response , will be evaluated 
at the conclusion of the study.  
Genetic polymorphisms in genes associated with the biological activity of leflunomide (e.g.,  DHODH, 
CYP1A2, and CYP2C19 ) have been previously described and will be explored for possible associations 
with response and safety outcomes.   
Ex vivo studies will be performed on bone marrow aspirate -derived cells to evaluate the IC50 for 
teriflunomide and the potential  synergy with other anti -neoplastic agents. Correlation analyses will 
be performed to determine the relationship between ex vivo and in vivo response.  
Preliminary molecular profiles for miRNA, mRNA, and DNA methylation status will be derived from 
both ex vivo and in vivo treatment. These profiles will be used to identify molecular correlates of 
therapeutic response using pathway identification and supervised principal components analysis.

Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 14 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 2.0  BACKGROUND  
2.1  Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by periods of remissions and relapses.  
Worldwide, the incidence of MM is about 86,000 cases annually with about 63,000 deaths each year [4]. 
In the United States, over 30,000 patients are expected to be diagnosed  with MM in 2016  and more 
than 12,000 patients will die from the disease [5, 6].  
Treatments for MM include alkylating agents, immunomodulatory (IMiD) drugs, proteasome inhibitors, 
anthracyclines , and glucocorticoids. Therapeutic agents are  used sequentially or in combination either 
as double, triple or quadruple chemotherapy combinations. While the prognosis for MM patients has 
improved [7, 8], MM remains an incurable di sease with a median survival of approximately 3 to 4 years 
with standard therapy [9]. The 5-year survival rate for patients with MM is estimated at 46% (Cancer 
Statistics 2016), with only 17% of patients surviving for 10 years [10].  
Relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) is defined as disease that is nonresponsive while on 
salvage therapy, or progressing within 60 days of cessation of the most recent prior therapy in patients 
who have achieved minimal response (MR) or better [11]. Primary refractory myeloma is defined as 
disease that is nonresponsive in patients who have never achieved a minimal respo nse or better with 
any therapy [11]. The overall survival for patients who have received more than 3 prior regimens and 
whose disease has rel apsed after treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide is estimated  to be 
between 6 and 10 months [12, 13]. Treatment decision making in the RRMM popu lation is particularly 
challenging, given underlying comorbidities and the toxic nature of available agents. Moreover, duration 
of response to therapies is traditionally short due to multi -drug resistance as well as changes in disease 
biology (e.g., develo pment of aggressive phenotype, higher proliferation rates, and lower  apoptotic 
rates) [14]. Patients with RRMM are in dire need of new treatments with new mechanisms of action that 
could be used successfully long term.  
2.2  Leflunomide  
Leflunomide is a commercially available oral immunosuppressive agent that has been FDA approved 
since 1998 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a single agent or in combination with 
methotrexate.  It has been used in over 300,000 patients worldwide for RA treatment. Leflunomide is 
generally well -tolerated and may be taken over a long period of time.   
The in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of leflunomide are not completely defined. The primary clinical 
mechanism of action is inhibiting de novo pyrimidine synthesis by targeting dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase (DHODH), and thus achieving anti -proliferative effect in B - and T-lymphocytes. A 
secondary mechanism of action is inhibition of cytokine and growth fac tor receptor associated tyrosine 
kinase activity [15].  
Leflunomide (the pro-drug) is rapidly converted to its active primary metabolite teriflunomide ( A77 
1726), which mediates leflunomide’s pharmacologic activity. Teriflunomide  serum concentrations show 
wide inter -patient variability; in one study, the mean serum teriflunomide  concentration in patients 
receiving 20 mg/ daily was 42 mg/l with a range from 3 -150 mg/l and a standard deviation of 35 mg/l 
[16]. Of note, the serum concentration of this metabolite was shown to predict RA response [16].  
The FDA approved dose in adults for the treatment of RA is a loading dose of 100 mg orally (PO)  once 
daily for 3 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 -20 mg PO once daily. Leflunomide has been used 
at up to 40 mg/day in patient s with Wegner ’s granulomatosis with a safety profile similar to the 
20mg/day dose used in RA [17, 18]. Doses up to 60 mg/da y have been safely used for the treatment of 
allograft polyoma BK virus in renal allograft patients to achieve a targeted blood level of teriflunomide 
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 15 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 (A77 1726) of 50-100 micrograms/mL [19]; the targeted blood level was frequently achieved with a dose 
of 40mg/ day with no increase in toxicity reported [19].  
In addition to studies that demonstrate t he serum concentration of the metabolite may predict 
response, recent work demonstrates that polymorphisms in the  gene encoding  DHODH may be 
associated with leflunomide treatment outcome in RA patients [20, 21].  
The long half -life of the metabolite ( about 2 weeks) affects management of patients taking leflunomide.  
A loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days is used to facilitate rapid attainment of steady state levels of M1.  
Without a loading dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady state concentration s would require 
nearly two months of dosing [22]. To eliminate the metabolite, a drug elimination procedure using 
cholestyramine is recommended.  Cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant , fixes the metabolite , 
preventing  reabsorption and exp editing drug elimination.  Without the drug elimination procedure, it 
may take up to 2 years to reach non -detectable plasma levels after stop ping treatment with leflunomide 
[22].  
2.3  Preclinical Studies of Leflunomide  as an Anti-Neoplastic Agent  
Leflunomide has been investigated for its anti -neoplastic potential in a variety of pre -clinical tumor 
models. The first reports of an ti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of glioma indicate that 
inhibition of pyrimidine synthesis is not sufficient for anti -tumor activity and concomitant inhibition of 
tyrosine phosphorylation may also play a role [23]. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leflunomide 
has been shown to inh ibit the cell cycle progression in primary leukemic cells in vitro [24]. Dietrich et al 
showed that teriflunomide ( A77 1726 ) affects proliferation of CLL by blocking DHODH at very low 
concentration (3 -5 µg/ml) and by additionally inhibiting JAL/STAT pathway at intermediate 
concentrations (>10 µg/ml) [25]. The metabolite is also effective in fludarabine -refractory cells [25]. In 
addition, pre -clinical anti -tumor activity of leflunomide has been reported for melanoma [26] and 
prostate cancer [27].  
Recent pre -clinical studies  of teriflunomide ( A77 1726 ) have demonstrated significant antineoplastic 
activity in myeloma [28]. Teriflunomide  inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in common myeloma 
cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations (50 -200 µmol/L) in a time - and dose-dependent manner. 
The stimulatory effect of conditioned medium of HS -5 bone marrow stromal cells on multiple myeloma 
cell growth is completely abrogated by teriflunomide . In addition, studies revealed additive effects when 
teriflunomide  was combined  with the genotoxic agents melphalan  and doxorubicin and synergistic 
effects when combined with bortezomib and treosulfan [28]. Finally, the Rosen laboratory has found 
leflunomide to be active in both glucoco rticoid sensitive and resistant myeloma cell lines  (Steven Rosen, 
personal communication) .  
2.4  Clinical Experience with Leflunomide for Multiple Myeloma  
Oral leflunomide was given to an 81 -year-old female myeloma patient who did not have other 
treatment optio ns or suitable clinical trials. This patient was diagnosed with myeloma in January of 2001 
and had an extensive treatment history including Velcade, Ve lcade-Doxil, Revlimid -dexamethasone, 
Revlimid-Melphalan -Prednisone, and Velcade -dexamethasone.  Her diseas e was refractory and 
progressive, with rapidly increasing IgG, M protein, and pancytopenia with transfusion -dependent 
anemia. She began oral daily leflunomide (20 mg per day) in February 2011. Her myeloma showed a 
gradual and  significant improvement, with reduction of her serum IgG (from 6280 to 3890 mg/dl), M -
protein, and beta -2-microglobulin levels. Her anemia improved so that she was no longer transfusion -
dependent. She tolerated the treatment fairly well except for mild diarrhea managed with loperamide.  
She remained on leflunomide for 16 months with continued clinical response of her myeloma but 
unfortunately died of her other medical problems (severe cardiac valvular disease and congestive heart 
failure).  
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 16 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 2.5  Background for Correlative Studies  
Leflunomide  is rapidly converted to its active primary metabolite teriflunomide (A77 1726), which 
mediates leflunomide’s pharmacologic activity. Previous population -based PK studies in patients with RA 
have demonstrated a high degree of intersubject variability in me asured steady -state total (free + 
albumin-bound) teriflunomide serum concentrations, resulting in coefficients of variation in CL/F 
estimates of >50% [29, 30]. Teriflunomide is >99% bound to serum albumin and free drug concentrations 
have also been reported to be highly variable, w ith a median of 55.8 μg/l and a range of 27.9 -148.4 μg/l 
[31]. Moreover, measured total and free teriflunomide  levels have been shown to predict response and 
toxicity in RA patients, leading some investigators to suggest a role for therapeutic drug monitoring and 
dose optimization of leflunomide [16]. It has also been reported that genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 
and CYP2C19, the hepatic enzymes respon sible for leflunomide metabolism, and DHODH, a key enzyme 
in the de novo  synthesis of pyrimidines and the main target of teriflunomide, can all influence the risk of 
leflunomide -associated toxicity in RA patients [32-34]. DHODH is expressed in MM cells, however, the 
relationship between DHODH gene polymorphism and toxicity/response to leflunomide is not well 
understood. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between teriflunomide serum 
concentrations and toxicity/response, as well as the influence of inherited polymorphisms in the genes 
involved in the metabolism and mech anism of action of leflunomide is needed.  
Various distinct genomic and epigenomic abnormalities have been observed in multiple myeloma, 
including gene mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and DNA methylation  [35]. Inhibition of tumor 
suppressor gene expression by DNA hypermethylation promotes survival and expansion of MM cells  and 
clinical outcomes have been  recently  linked to DNA methylation status of MM cells  [36]. Molecular 
signatures capturing such gene expression data have also recently emerged as powerful tools to identify 
patients who might respond particularly well  to a specific treatment. Although genomic and epigenomic 
markers show promise for MM, there are still very few studies available and reliable markers have not 
yet emerged.  
2.6  Overview and Rationale of Proposed Study  
The pre-clinical data, along with limited although promising clinical data of leflunomide for treatment 
MM, and the relatively low toxicity profile seen with prolonged administration  in the rheumatoid 
arthritis population , in total provide evidence to support the investigation of leflunomi de as an anti -
myeloma agent. This single agent phase I/II dose-escalation trial is designed to determine the MTD  and 
to generate information about efficacy at the RP2D. Relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma  
(RRMM) patients with documented  measurable disease after at least three prior regimens will be 
considered for enrollment.   
While the standard dose of leflunomide (20mg daily ), following a loading dose of 100mg daily for 3 days, 
is FDA approved for continuous treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, l eflunomide has been administered 
without an increase in the type, frequency or severity of adverse events at doses up to 40 mg/day in 
patients with Wegner ’s granulomatosis, and up to 60mg/day in a subset of patients with polyoma BK 
neuropathy to achieve ta rgeted therapeutic levels  [17, 18].  
Because the current dosing guideline for patients with rheumatoid arthritis do not to exceed 20 mg daily 
maintenance doses [22], the 20mg/day dose is selected as the safe starting dose. We will attempt to 
escalate the dose of leflunomide to t hree times that approved for RA us ing a modified rolling six dose-
escalation/ de -escalation/expansion design, a more conservative version of the rolling six design of 
Skolnik, et al .[1]. The starting dose of leflunomide is 20mg daily, with the intention to test up to 60mg 
daily. Escalation will proceed in increments of 20mg/day  (odd numbered dose levels) ; de-escalation will 
proceed in decrements of 10mg/day.   
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 17 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 Patients will be treated in planned 28-day treatment cycles. Patients may continue to receive cycles of 
treatment on study until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for removal from 
study treatment are satisfied . While on active treatment p atients will undergo monthly evaluation for 
response using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria  [37, 38]. Following the 
decision to end leflunomide treatment, all patients will undergo 11 days of treatment with 
cholestyramine, which fixes the metabolite , preventing re -absorption and effectively lowering drug 
levels. Cholestyramine has been shown to decrease plasma levels of teriflunomide (A77 1726) in healthy 
volunteers by approximately 40% in 24 hours and by 49 -65% in 48 hours [22]. 
Previous RA studies have shown a large variation in the serum concentration of the primary active 
metabolite, teriflunomide (A77 1726), and a suggested association between serum concentration of this 
metabolite and response [19].  Although the prior PK/PD relationship was identified in a non -oncologic 
patient population, it is possible that a similar association could exist for leflunomide exposures and 
antitumor response. There fore, as part of the secondary objectives for this trial, enrolled RRMM 
patients will have blood samples collected and then processed by the Analytical Pharmacology Core 
Facility (APCF) to assess the possible relationship between serum concentration of the  active 
leflunomide metabolite (teriflunomide) and toxicity/response. The natural PK variability of leflunomide 
administered at fixed doses will allow us to assess patients over a wide range of measured drug 
exposures. If a therapeutic window for leflunomi de exposure can be identified, future studies based on 
targeted drug exposures will be considered. Additional testing will be done on collected blood samples 
to assess, in an exploratory manner, the potential association between germline polymorphisms in t he 
CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and DHODH gene and either toxicity or response.   
In addition to the PK/PD analysis,  additional molecular correlates  and ex vivo responses  will be 
evaluated  using bone marrow specimens , which will be collected from patients before treatment and 
after one month of leflunomide  treatment . MM cells will be purified from the pre -treatment specimens 
and treated with teriflunomide to determine the ex vivo IC50. The goal of this study is to determine 
whether ex vivo drug response predicts in vivo therapeutic response. The ex vivo treatment 
concentrations will be similar to in vivo drug levels. Teriflunomide will also be combined with drugs from 
other classes ( e.g., HDAC inhibitors , immunomodulatory drugs  [IMiDs], proteasome inhibitors, steroid 
hormones, and antibody therapeutics such as the CD38 antibody daratumumab ), in order to evaluate ex 
vivo synergy and potentially predict the success of combination therapies. Molecular correlate analysis 
of leflunomide response will include  miRNA, mRNA and DNA methylation profiling. Specimens derived 
from before and after leflunomide treatment  (after 1 month and at progression or complete response, if 
possible) will be analyzed, as well as pre -treatment specimens exposed to teriflunomide ex vivo. The 
miRNA, mRNA and DNA methylation profiling analysis of specimens derived from participants treated 
with leflunomide in vivo will be conducted only for participants treated at the RP2D in order to minimize 
extra interventions for participants who may not  receive a therapeutically effective dose.  
Following completion of the phase I portion of the study and identification of the RP2D, the phase II 
portion of the study will be initiated.  Recent studies evaluating daratumumab, a CD38 monoclonal 
antibody, as m onotherapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma were recently published [39, 40] 
and have led to FDA approval of this agent. O ne study included patients with relapsed multiple myeloma 
treated with at least three lines of therapy while the other included patients treated with at least two 
prior lines of treatment. Treatment with daratumumab as a single agent lead to an overall res ponse rate 
of 29.2% and 36% respectively in each of these studies. In both studies, the agent investigated was well 
tolerated but required IV dosing once weekly for 8 doses , followed by twice -monthly doses for 8 doses 
and then monthly thereafter. We suspec t leflunomide to be similarly well tolerated but with a more 
convenient dosing schedule. Because we are including patients who have received at least three prior 
lines of treatment, we will target an overall response rate of 30% for the phase II portion of  the study.

Noncompliance  
___ 32.  Prospective participants who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be 
able to comply with all study procedures (including compliance issues re lated to 
feasibility/logistics).  
3.3  Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
The study is open anyone regardless of gender or race/ethnicity. Efforts will be made to extend the 
accrual to a representative population . However , a balance must be struck between subject safety 
considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic or ineffective 
treatments on the one hand and the need to explore gender, racial, and ethnic aspects of clinical 
research on the other. If differences in outco me that correlate to gender, racial, or ethnic identity are 
noted, accrual may be expanded or additional studies may be performed to investigate those 
differences more fully.  
4.0  SCREENING AND REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
4.1  Screening Procedures  
Diagnostic or laboratory studies performed exclusively to determine eligibility for this trial will be done 
only after obtaining written informed  consent. Studies or procedures that were for clinical indications 
(not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be us ed for baseline values , even if the studies were 
done before informed consent was obtained.  All screening procedures and their respective windows are 
detailed in Section 10, Table 10, Study Activity Calendar .

Page 21 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 4.2  Informed Con sent  
The investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their 
attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the 
subject and a signed informed consent wil l be obtained.  Documentation of informed consent for 
screening will be maintained in the subject’s research chart and medical record  and the patient will 
receive a copy of the signed informed consent document . All Institutional, Federal, and State regulati ons 
concerning Informed Consent will be fulfilled.  
4.3  Registration Requirements/Process  
Confirming , reserving a slot  and dose level assignment  
Eligible subjects will be registered on the study centrally by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at City of 
Hope. Staff (including physicians, protocol nurses and/or CRCs) should call the DCC at (626) 256 -4673, 
ext. 63968 to verify the current dose level and slot availability, and to reserve a slot for a specific 
prospective subject.  Slots can only be held for a limit ed time.  
Eligible subjects must be registered prior to start of protocol therapy. Issues that would cause treatment 
delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a subject does not receive protocol therapy 
following registration, the subj ect’s registration on the study may be canceled after discussion with the 
PI. The Data Coordinating Center should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
Registration Process  
Once a slot at a dose level has been reserved, the signed informed consent has been obtained, all 
pretreatment evaluations have been performed, and subject’s eligibility has been confirmed by the Data 
Coordinating Center, a subject will be registered on study.  
To register a subject, the treating physician should contact t he protocol nurse or the responsible Clinical 
Research Coordinator (CRC) in the Clinical Trial Office (CTO) to complete the eligibility checklist.  
The protocol nurse or CRC will contact the Data Coordinating Center at City of Hope (626 -256-4673, ext. 
63968 or via e-mail at dcc@coh.org), scan and EMAIL a copy of the completed and signed eligibility 
checklist, a copy of the signed Informed Consent (including a copy of signed subject’s bill of Rights and 
HIPAA authorization form) and copies of any required pr e-study test results that are not readily available 
in the COH electronic medical record to dcc@coh.org .  
The protocol nurse or CRC may then call the Data Coordinating Center (626 -256-4673 ext. 6 3968) to 
confirm receipt o f all registration documents. To complete the registration process, the Data 
Coordinating Center will:  
  Verify and confirm the subject’s eligibility.  
  Assign a subject accession number (for example, COH -001, COH-002, etc.).  
  Register the subject on study cent rally (the City of Hope CRC assigned to the trial will still be 
responsible for accessioning via MIDAS).   
  Assign the subject to a dose level (as applicable).  
  Complete and email a Confirmation of Registration form within 24 hours to include the COH 
subject study number and dose level to the study team, which will include the Principal 
Investigator, treating physician, protocol nurse, CRC and COH IDS Pharmacy.  
  Call the protocol nurse and/or CRC to verbally confirm registration.  
  Enter the subject into Medidata  RAVE®. 
  A subject failing to meet all protocol requirements will not be registered.

Page 22 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 Patients must begin protocol treatment within 1 week following registration  date.  
4.4  Screen Failures and Registered Participants Who Do Not begin Study Treatment  
The reason f or screen failure or failure to begin treatment for registered participants will be 
documented.  
5.0  TREATMENT PROGRAM   
5.1  Treatment Overview  
Treatment on study will be in the outpatient setting and will consist of daily treatment with leflunomide; 
patients will be treated in planned 28-day treatment cycles. After the decision to end study treatment 
has been made, participants will receive treatment with cholestyr amine (Section 5.7 ) to eliminate 
leflunomide . Participants who end study treatment for reasons other than disease progression will 
undergo active follow -up (Section 5.9) until disease progression or the initiation of a new therapy. All 
participants will be followed  for survival  (Section 5.9 ).  
For a detailed tabular view of the treatment, monitoring, and follow -up schedule, see the Study 
Calendar in Section 10 .  
5.2  Treatment c ycle definition  
The planned cycle length is 28 days. Leflunomide will be taken orally once daily. Missed or held doses 
will not be made up. The day count continues despite a hold in agent administration. Day 1 safety 
assessments must be reviewed prior to the initiation of  the cycle. For a cycle to commence, the 
participant must be actively taking study agent. Windows for procedures are detailed in Section 10 . 
5.3  Phase I/II Treatment Plan  
This phase I trial will implement a modified rolling six dose escalation, de -escalation , expansion  design, a 
more conservative version of the rolling six design of Skolnik, et al . [1] to ensure safety and to allow for 
the evaluation of toxicities associated with leflunomide . See Section 13.3.2  for dose escalation/de -
escalation /expansion  rules, and Section 13.1 for the definition of dose limiting toxicity ( DLT). 
Up to six doses of leflunomide will be considered  (see Table 5.3.1 ). The starting dose of leflunomide is 
20mg daily, with the inten tion to test up to 60mg daily. Escalation will proceed in increments of 
20mg/day  (odd numbered dose levels) ; de-escalation will proceed in decrements of 10mg/day.  There 
will be no intra -patient dose escalation; participants will undergo dose modification d ue to toxicity per 
Section 6.2 .

1 20 mg PO daily  
2 30 mg PO daily  
3 40 mg PO daily  
4 50 mg PO daily  
5 60 mg PO daily  
*NOTE: Leflunomide is administered with a loading dose of 100 mg for the 1st three doses.  
5.4  Phase II Treatment Plan  
Following the phase I trial, a single arm phase II study will be conducted using a Simon Two -Stage 
Optimal Design [2, 3] to evaluate the ant i-myeloma activity of l eflunomide. For the phase II portion, up 
to 39 patients will be treated. The six patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion of the study will 
count toward the 39 patients required; given this, we expect  to enroll only 33 new patients on the phase 
II trial.   
5.5  Agents Administration  
5.5.1  Leflunomide  
Participants  will be instructed to take each dose of leflunomide  orally, once a day, at approximately the 
same time each day. They may take it with or without food. If a patient forgets or misses a dose for 
whatever reason, it should not be replaced or made up. Participants  will be given a study calendar (pill 
diary) to document each dose of leflunomide that is taken or missed.  
NOTE: On study visit days, participants should refrain from taking leflunomide until after blood is 
collected.  
Leflunomide is  administered with a loading dose of 100 mg  per day for the first three doses (first three 
days). 
There will be no intra -patient dose escalation ; patients will undergo dose modification due to toxicity 
per Section 6.2 .  
5.5.2  Cholestyramine 
Cholestyramine is not a study agent but is requ ired for the elimination of the study agent leflunomide. 
See Section 5.7 for cholestyramine administration details . 
5.6  Study Procedures  
For a detailed list of all study procedures including timing and windows, see Section 10.   
5.7  End of Treatment Evaluations and Leflunomide Detoxification  
All participants will be followed until resolution or stabilization of any serious adverse events occurring 
during treatment and completion of the Day 30 En d of Treatment assessments . See Section 10  for a list 
of all assessments and windows.  
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 24 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 Because of the ability of leflunomide to be reabsorbed through the colon, resulting in a very long half-
life, all participants will be treate d with cholestyramine to prevent re -absorption of leflunomide after 
the decision to end study treatment has been made.  
Participants removed from study treatment will undergo oral administration of cholestyramine 8 grams 
oral suspension three times daily f or 11 days. It will not be a deviation if an administration of 
cholestyramine is delayed or if the 11 days are not consecutive.  Cholestyramine administration may be 
adjusted per the discretion of the treating investigator. After the treatment with cholesty ramine, clinical 
laboratory testing will be performed to verify plasma levels less than 0.02 mg/L or 0.02 µg/mL by two 
separate tests at least 14 days apart.  If plasma levels are higher than 0.02 mg/L or 0.02 µg/mL, additional 
cholestyramine treatment will b e considered.  See Section 10  for a tabular view of cholestyramine 
administration and metabolite testing  windows and days of administration . 
Note: Cholestyramine can affect the absorption of other oral medications . Such medications should be  
taken 1 hour before the first administration  or per other guidance in the package insert.  Watch for 
bleeding abnormalities due to vitamin K deficiency for which intravenous vitamin K may be 
administered.  
5.8  Duration of Therapy  & Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment  
Patients will receive study treatment until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity  or other criteria for 
removal from study treatment are satisfied.  Of note, based on the guidelines outlined by Rajkumar et al. 
[38], “CR patients will need to progress to the same level as VGPR and PR patients to be considered PD. 
A positive im munofixation alone is therefore not sufficient. ” Participants may be removed from 
treatment for any  of the following reasons:  
o  Evidence of disease progression  
o  Patient is deemed intolerant to study treatment because of toxicity, despite dose 
modification/del ay 
o  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
o  Participant withdraw s from the treatment phase of the study  
o  General or specific changes in the participant's condition , including non -compliance,  
which renders the participant  unacceptable for further treatment in the opinion of the 
treating investigator.  
Documentation of the reason for discontinuing therapy and the date effective should be made in the 
medical record and appropriate eCRF. The participant should then proceed to o ff-treatment procedures 
for safety monitoring , leflunomide elimination and follow -up procedures.  The participant ’s status is to 
be modified in the MIDAS system once the off -treatment period is completed. Alternative care options 
will be discussed with the participant.  
5.9  Active Follow Up and Long Term Follow Up  
Participants who do not progress while on treatment will be in Active Follow Up , where they will 
continue to undergo monthly response assessment  (myeloma labs) until disease progression  or the 
initiation of a new therapy . 
Participants who progress during Treatment Phase skip Active Follow -Up phase and continue dire ctly 
into Long-term Follow -up phase.  
In Long-term Follow -Up participants will be followed for survival information which may be obtained by 
reviewing the City of Hope medical record, contacting the participant and/or a review of outside medical 
records. Note: this is not intended to be an all-inclusive list. 
The schedule and windows for assessments and data collection points  are further detailed in Table 10 .

Page 25 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 5.10  Criteria for Completion of Study Participation  
Participants may be removed from the study as a whol e at any time at their own request, or they may 
be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The 
reason(s) for discontinuing study participation should be documented and may include:  
o  Participant compl etes all study procedures including all study follow -up procedures.  
o  Participant withdraws consent for follow -up. 
o  Participant is determined to be lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact the subject 
must be documented.  
The reason for study removal and the  date the participant was removed must be documented in 
the source documentation and the study-specific case report form (CRF). The participant ’s status 
is to be modified in the MIDAS system once the participant completes the study.  
5.11  Supportive Care, Other  Concomitant Therapy, Prohibited Medications  
Concomitant medications and treatments that are permitted while on study treatment include 
allopurinol, anti -emetics, anti -diarrheals, FDA -approved bisphosphonates, erythropoietin, transfusions 
(as necessary), a nd palliative radiation.  
Concurrent treatment with any other anti -neoplastic therapies will not be permitted while on study 
treatment. Concurrent administration of live vaccines will not be permitted while on study treatment.  
During cycle 1 only : Transfusions are not permitted unless platelets <25,000/mm3 or platelets < 50,000/

7.0  DATA AND SAFETY MONI TORING, UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M AND ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING  
7.1  Definition of Risk Level  
This is a Risk Level 4 study as defined in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
[policy dated 07/09/2014] . This determination was made because the study involves  COH as the IND 
holder and escalates the study agent to a dose above that indicated by the FDA for the agent’s currently 
approved indication.  
7.2  Monitoring and  Personnel Responsible  for Monitoring  
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) consisting of the PI, Collaborating Investigator, CRC/protocol 
nurse, and statistician is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this study, including 
implementation of the stopping rules for sa fety. 
The PMT is required to submit periodic status reports (i.e., the PMT Report) according to the frequency 
prescribed in the  City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  [policy dated 07/09/2014].  
Important decisions made during PMT meetings (i.e., dose escalation, de -escalation, etc.) only need to 
be noted in the PMT Report submitted to the Data and Safe ty Monitoring Committee (DSMC).

Page 31 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 7.3  Dose Escalation  
This study will utilize the Phase I Tracking Log  to monitor data and safety for dose escalation.  The 
Tracking Log will contain dose levels administered, dose limiting toxicities (DLT), DLT -defining adverse 
events, and any details regarding dose level escalation.  The record of doses administered and resultant 
adverse events will be included in the PMT Report.  
7.4  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The PI will be responsible for determining the event name, assessing the se verity (i.e., grade), 
expectedness, and att ribution of all adverse events.  
Adverse Event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after treatment, whether or not it is considered to  be related  to the 
protocol intervention.  
Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events  – Adverse events will be collected after the patient is given the 
study treatment or any study related procedures.  Adverse events will be monitored by the PMT.  
Adverse events that do not meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems will be 
reported only in the PMT R eport. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  [Modified from the definition of unexpected adverse drug experience in 21 
CFR 312.32 ] - defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event s that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
  Death 
  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death f rom the event as it 
occurred) 
  Unplanned hospitalization (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization  
  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
  Secondary malignancy  
  Any other adver se event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  - begins afte r study treatment or any study related procedures.  All 
SAEs occurring during this study, whether observed by the physician, nurse, or reported by the patient, 
will be reported according to the approved City of Hope’s Institutional policy  [policy effective date:  
05/14/14].   Serious Adverse Events that require expedited reporting will be submitted electronically 
using iRIS. 
7.5  Adverse Eve nt Name and Severity  
The PI will determine the adverse event name and severity (grade) by using the CTCAE version 4.03.  
Expected Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected  event, OR is an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event.  
Unexpected  Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a) ] – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the 
investigator’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been

IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the a dverse event.  
7.6  Adverse Event Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study 
agent or study procedure.  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent or study procedure  and unrelated to 
any other cause.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the investigational agent or study procedure and unlikely 
related to other cause(s).  
Possible -The AE may be related to the investigational agent or study procedure and may be relate d 
to another cause(s).  
Unlikely -The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent or study procedure and likely 
related to another cause(s).  
Unrelated -The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent or study procedure and is 
attributab le to another cause(s).  
7.7  COH Held IND  
Serious Adverse Events meeting the requirements for expedited reporting to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 , will be reported as an IND safety report using the 
MedWatch Form FDA 3500A for Mandatory Reporting . 
The Office of IND Development and Regulatory  Affairs (OIDRA) will assist the PI in reporting the event to 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
The criteria that require reportin g using the Medwatch 3500A are:  
  Any unexpected fatal or life threatening adverse experience associated with use of the dr ug 
must be reported to the FDA no later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the information 
[21 CFR 312.32(c)(2) ] 
  Any adverse experience associated with use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected 
must be submitted no later than 15 calendar days after initial receipt of the information [ 21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)] 
  Any follow -up information to a study report shall be reported as soon as the relevant 
information becomes available. [ 21 CFR 312.32(d)(3) ] 
 
The PI or designee will be responsible for contacting the Office of IND Development and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIDRA) at COH to ensure prompt reporting of safety reports to the FDA.  OIDRA will assist the PI 
with the preparation of the report and submit the r eport to the FDA in accordance with the approved 
City of Hope’s Institutional policy  [policy effective date:  05/14/14] . 
7.8  Deviations an d Unanticipated Problems  
Deviation - A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol that occurred without prior 
IRB approval.  Investigators may deviate from the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the 
protection, safety, and w ell-being of the study subjects without prior IRB approval.  For any such 
deviation, the PI will notify the COH DSMC and IRB within 5 calendar days of its occurrence via iRIS in 
accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy  [policy effective date:  11/07/11].

Version: 07  
7.9  Single Subject Exception (SSE)  
An SSE is a  planned de viation, meaning that it involves  circumstances in which the specific procedures 
called for in a protocol are not in the best interests of a specific patient.  It is a deviation that is 
anticipated and receives prior approval by the PI and the IRB.  The SSE must be submitted  as a “Single 
Subject Exception Amendment Request”  via iRIS in accordance with  IRB guidelines and the Clinical 
Research Protocol Deviation policy  [policy effective date:  11/07/11].   An IRB approved SSE does not 
need to be submitted as a deviation  to the DSMC.  
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
 
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given the following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent doc ument or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND 
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experienc e, or outcomes may have been caused by the 
drugs, devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than previousl y known or recognized.  
 
Any UP that occurs during study conduct will be reported to the DSMC and IRB in accordance with the 
City of Ho pe’s Institutional policy  [policy effective date:  05/14/14]  using iRIS.   
8.0  AGENT INFORMATION . 
8.1  Leflunomide  
Leflunomide  is an FDA approved agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Please refer to the 
Package Insert for additional details not provided in this section.  
8.1.1  Description  and classification  
The chemical name for leflunomide is N -(4’-trifluoromethylphenyl) -5-methylisoxazole -4-carboxamide. It 
has a molecular formula C H F N O, a  molecular weight of 270.2 . Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis 
inhibitor. 
8.1.2  Mode of action  
Leflunomide is an isoxazole  immunomodulatory agent which inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (an 
enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Several in vivo and 
in vitro experimental models have demonstrated an anti -inflammatory effect.  
8.1.3  Toxicology 
See Section 6.1 .1. 
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 34 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 8.1.4  Pharmacology  
Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized t o an active metabolite teriflunomide (A77 
1726) which is responsible for essentially all of its activity i n vi vo. Following oral administration, peak 
levels of the active metabolite occurred between 6 to 12 hours  after dosing. Due to the very long half -
life of teriflunomide  (~2 weeks), a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was  used in clinical studies to 
facilitate the rapid attainm ent of steady -state levels of teriflunomide . Without a loading  dose, it is 
estimated that attainment of steady -state plasma concentrations would require nearly two  months of 
dosing. Biliary recycling is a major contributor to the long elim ination half -life of teriflunomide . The 
active metabolite of leflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. Use of a drug elimination 
procedure (cholestyramine or activated charcoal) is used to reduce the drug concentration more rapidly 
after stopping  leflunomide therapy.  
8.1.5  Storage and stability  
Leflunomide tablets should be stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions are permitted to 15 –30°C (59 –86°F). 
Protect from light.  
8.1.6  Preparation  
Leflunomide is commercially available for oral administration as tablets containi ng 10, 20, or 100 mg of 
active drug.  
8.1.7  Agent administration  
Leflunomide is administered orally. Participants will be given a study calendar to track all doses taken or 
missed. There will be an initial loading dose of 100 mg per day for the first 3 days of do ses. Participants 
will then receive leflunomide at the assigned dose level. See Section 5.5.1 for administration details.   
8.1.8   Availability and supply  
Tablets in 10 and 20 mg strengths are packaged in bottles of 30 pi lls per bottle. Leflunomide will be 
provided to patients by the study as an investigational agent. A commercial supply will be purchased and 
distributed as an investigational agent by the Investigational Drug Pharmacy at City of Hope . 
8.2  Cholestyramine  
Cholestyramine is not the study agent  being evaluated for efficacy,  but is required for the elimination of 
the study agent leflunomide. Cholestyramine is FDA approved for hypercholesterolemia.  
Cholestyramine use is indicated in the leflunomide package insert to eliminate the leflunomide 
metabolite.   
8.2.1  Description   
Cholestyramine is a strong anion exchange resin comprised of a quaternary ammonium group attached 
to an inert styrene -divinylbenzene copolymer. Cholestyramine removes bile acids from the body by 
forming insoluble complexes with bile acids in the intestine, which are then excreted in the feces.  
8.2.2  Other names  
Questran®, Questran Light, Cholybar, Olestyr  
8.2.3  Mode of action  
Cholestyramine resin adsorbs and combines with the bile acids in the intestine to form an i nsoluble 
complex which is excreted in the feces. This results in a partial removal of bile acids from the  
enterohepatic circulation by preventing their absorption.

15º-30ºC (59º-86ºF). 
8.2.6  Agent administration  
Cholestyramine  should be administered orally after being prepared per package insert (powder diluted 
in fluid). See Section 5.5 for study administration details.  
8.2.7  Availability and supply  
Cholestyramine will be provided to participants by the study. A commercial supply will be purchased and 
distributed by the pharmacy at City of Hope.  
9.0  CORRELAT IVE/SPECIAL STUDIES  
9.1  Pharmacokinetics  
All participants will undergo serial blood sampling to evaluate the steady -state systemic exposure to 
teriflunomide ( A77 1726)  the active metabolite of leflunomide. Pharmacokinetic sampling will consist of 
trough level monitoring throughout the entire period of active treatment with leflunomide.   
9.1.1  Specimen Collection  
Prior to initiation of drug administration on day 1 of cycle 1 of treatment and then at follow -up visit 
thereafter  (see Table 10 Study Activity Calendar) , venous blood will be collected into one 4-mL purple-
top (EDTA) tube. Patients will be instructed not to take their leflunomide dose until after they have had 
their blood drawn on the days of their clinic appointment. Blood samples will be kept on ice unt il 
prompt delivery (so that samples can be processed within an hour of collection) to the Analytical 
Pharmacology Core Facility (APCF) for processing.  Samples are to be taken to Shapiro room 1042. The 
APCF (Leslie Smith -Powell or her representative) will b e notified in advance of sampling (ideally at least a 
day in advance) by e -mail to LSmith-Powell@coh.org . Any updates to the location of the laboratory or 
the contact information will be distributed to the study  team.  
9.1.2  Initial specimen processing and storage  
Specimen processing and storage will occur at the APCF plasma is separated from whole blood by 
centrifugation at 1500 x g (within 1 hour). Plasma will then be transferred to appropriately labeled 
polypropylen e tubes and stored at < -70C until analysis. Each sample will be labeled with the 
participant’s  name, medical record number, date of collection, and actual sample collection time.   
9.1.3  Analytical Method  
Total and free t eriflunomide ( A77 1726) plasma concentra tions will determined in the Analytical 
Pharmacology Core Facility (APCF) at the City of Hope using a validated LC -MS/MS method. The method 
is based on a previously reported assay that has been validated over a wide dynamic concentration 
range of 10 -4000 ng/mL from a starting plasma volume of 200 µl  [41].  
9.1.4  Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis  
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analyses of teriflunomide ( A77 1726) will be used to determine 
the average s teady-state total and free teriflunomide  trough concentration (C trough). Ctrough results will be 
summarized within and between participants  using means and standard deviations.

Page 36 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 9.2  Pharmacodynamics  
All participants who undergo serial blood sampling to evaluate  pharmacokinetics will also have 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from their blood samples for exploratory analyses 
of potential pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of the effects of the active metabolite of l eflunomide. 
Potential PD assays incl ude the quantitative analysis of intracellular levels of dihydroorotate, orotate, as 
well as nucleotide pools as direct indicators of DHODH inhibition. Furthermore, the expression of 
lymphocyte cell surface activation markers will be assessed as an indirec t measure of drug effect. 
Additional PD assays may also be included based on the results of the ex vivo mechanistic studies to be 
performed under 9. 4 below. 
9.2.1  Specimen Collection  
Venous blood will be collected into two 4-mL purple-top (EDTA) tube s. Please refer to Sec 9.1.1 for other 
details of collection.  
9.2.2  Initial specimen processing and storage  
Any blood remaining in the t hree 4-mL purple-top tubes used to prepare plasma for PK above will be 
diluted 1:1 with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (“HBSS”, Irvine Scientific, Cat. 9228 or equivalent)  and 
combined in a sterile 50 ml conical centrifuge tube. PBMC will then be isolated from the combined 
whole blood sample by Ficoll -gradient separation as described below;  
o  Allow Accuspin -Histopaque tubes  (“Accuspin”, Sigma Cat. A6929 or A0561, for 12 or 100 tubes, 
respectively) and HBSS to warm to room temperature. Place a Mr. Frosty container in the 
refrigerator and prepare the freezing media by adding 10% DMSO to fetal calf serum and chill at 
4˚C or on ice.  
o  Prepare Accuspin tubes by centrifuging at 1000 x g for 1 minute at room temperature (RT) with 
brakes on. Each tube can process up to 20 mLs of whole blood; prepare the appropriate amount of 
tubes necessary. After centrifugation, the Histopaque reagen t should be below the barrier of the 
tube. Add 5 mLs of HBSS to the Accuspin tube. Add up to 20 mls of whole blood to each Accuspin 
tube until all the blood has been distributed.  
o  Centrifuge the blood sample at 800 x g for 15 minutes at RT with brakes on L OW. After 
centrifugation, three layers should be visible above the barrier of the tube: the plasma layer at the 
top, a cloudy layer in the middle where the PBMC are, and a clear Histopaque reagent layer right 
below. Using a pipette, remove the upper plasma  layer to within 2 cm of the cloudy interphase. 
Carefully pipette the cloudy PBMC interphase and transfer to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube.  
o  Add HBSS up to the 45 mL mark in the centrifuge tube with the PBMC and spin at 400 x g for 10 
minutes at RT with brakes on. Decant the supernatant and loosen the cell pellet before adding 
HBSS to the 45 -mL mark again for a second wash. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 minutes at RT with 
brakes on. Decant the supernatant, loosen the cell pellet and then add a known volume  of HBSS to 
resuspend the cells for counting. Mix the cell suspension up and down with a pipette several times 
before removing a small aliquot for cell count.  
o  Centrifuge the cell suspension one final time at 300 x g for 10 minutes at RT with brakes on. PBM C 
should be frozen down at 0.5 – 1 x 107 cells/vial. Determine the volume of freezing media (fetal 
calf serum with 10% DMSO) needed to give a 1 x 107 cell/mL suspension. After the last 
centrifugation is complete, discard supernatant and loosen the cell pel let before adding freezing 
media slowly, a small volume at a time with mixing in between (vortex at low speed). Aliquot 0.5 - 
1 mL of the final cell suspension into individually labeled cryovials. Transfer the cryovials into Mr. 
Frosty and store at -80˚C. Twenty four hours later, cryovials will be transferred to liquid nitrogen 
tanks for long -term storage.

IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 9.2.3  Analytical Method  
The intracellular levels of dihydroorotate, orotate, and nucleotide pools will be performed using liquid 
chromatography tandem mass sp ectrometry as previously described [42, 43]. Expression of cell surface 
markers of lymphocyte activation ( CD25 and CD134) will be measured by flow cyt ometryas previously 
described[44]. 
9.3  Pharmacogenomics  
All participants will undergo genetic studies to evaluate germline genetic polymorphisms in the coding 
exome. The potential association between germline polymorphisms in CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and DHODH 
and either toxicity or response will be analyzed.  CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 are maj or leflunomide metabolic 
enzymes and DHODH is the main molecular target of leflunomide  
9.3.1  Specimen Collection  and Processing and Analysis  
Cells will be obtained from the PK processing procedure ( Section 9.1.2 ) for DNA extraction by the APCF  
(one sample per participant) . The extracted DNA material will then be sent to the Integrative Genomics 
Core (ICG) for sequencing . 
9.3.2  Gene Sequencing Data Analysis  
Gene sequences provided by the IGC will be assessed for gene polym orphisms identified in the literature 
[20, 21] associated with leflunomide response in RA.   
9.4  Ex vivo and Molecular Studies  
9.4.1  Sample Collection, Transfer, and Initial Processing  
Please see the Appendix for detailed procedures. Any updates to the laboratory locations or c ontact 
information will be distributed to the study team. Bone marrow specimens will be collected prior to 
drug administration, on day 1 of cycle 2  (all phase II patients and phase I patients enrolled at the 
anticipated RP2D ), at progression (where applica ble), and at confirmation of CR/sCR (where applicable). 
See Table 10, Study Activity Calendar . Bone marrow aspirate (10 ml) will be collected into a sodium 
heparin (green -top) tube. Samples will be gently inverted 8 times to mix the sample and then promptly 
taken at room temperature  to Tinisha McDonald (Kaplan CRB, RM 3016) in Dr. Guido Marcucci’s 
laboratory (or her representative) for processing (so that samples can be processed with in an hour of 
collection). Tinisha McDona ld (tmcdonald@coh.org ) as well as the supervisors Allen Lin (alin@coh.org) 
and Dr. Guido Marcucci (gmarcucci@coh.org) will be notified in advance of sampling (at least 1 day in 
advance) by email. Each sample will be labeled with the participant’s name, medical record number, 
date of collection, and actual sample collection time.  
The Marcucci laboratory will conduct  Ficoll-Paque density centrifugation and preparation of 
mononuclear cells (MNCs) and then transfer the sample on ice to Dr. Ralf Büttner at the Rosen 
laboratory (Kaplan CRB, room 1026) for enrichment  CD138-positive (CD138+) plasma cells by magnetic 
cell sorting, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The CD138+ MNCs  will be re -suspended in 
complete RPMI medium, counted and stored on ice for further processing.  
9.4.2  Sample Storage and Distribution for Further Analysis  
At least 5 million (≥ 5%) CD138-positive MNCs can be expected from each BM aspiration after 
immunomagnetic enrichment. For RNA and DNA  analysis without further ex vivo treatment, 500,000

enriched cells will be stored in the vapor phase of a liquid nitrog en tank in freezing medium if the cells 
are not processed immediately. A small aliquot of the cell population (~50,000 cells) will also be used to 
confirm that the enriched cell population is >95% pure. Up to three million CD138 -enriched cells will be

9.4.3  Ex vivo Cytotoxicity and Synergy Analysis  
All cells will be grown in RPMI -1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat -inactivated FBS and 1x 
antibiotics/antimycotics. Primary pre -treatment MM patient -derived CD138+ cells will be co -cultured 
with increasing concentrations of teriflunomide. Teriflunomide will be used because conversion of 
leflunom ide to the active metabolite teriflunomide happens primarily in the intestine. Therefore, we 
consider it unlikely that conversion will occur ex vivo/in vitro , and that use of teriflunomide is the better 
option.  Proliferation and cytotoxicity of primary MM cells will be measured based on quantitation of the 
ATP present in cells , MTS assays,  and Annexin V staining; IC 50 values will be calculated. The cells will also 
be cultured with increasing amounts of teriflunomide and selected MM drugs. Examples from each  class 
include  the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat, the IMiDs  lenalidomide and pomalidomide, the proteasome 
inhibitors ixazomib and bortezomib, the steroid hormone dexamethasone and the CD38 antibody 
daratumumab . To evaluate synergy, we will generate combination index (CI) values by combining 
teriflunomide and the FDA -approved agents at constant ratios based on the IC 50s, as described 
previously by Chou TC  [45], and generate isolobograms to identify the ratios producing m aximal synergy.   
9.4.4  High Throughput Genomics Analysis  
We will evaluate MM cells treated with teriflunomide ex vivo (as described in Section 9.3. 3) and 
leflunomide in vivo (comparison  of MM samples from baseline,  after one month of treatment  and at PD 
or CR, where applicable ). DNA (from 1 million cells , in vivo treatment only ) and RNA (from 100,000 cells , 
ex vivo and in vivo treatment ) will be extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions for RNA 
isolation (Qiazol, Qiagen) and DNA isolation (DNAzol, Thermofisher) and submitted to the COH 
Integrative Genomics Core for analysis. Sequencing will be performed on an Illumina Hiseq 2500. Image 
and data processing will be conducted using Illumina's pipeline, as w ell as alignment tools such as 
TopHat (mRNA), Novoalign (miRNA), and Bismark (DNA methylation). Custom R scripts will be used for 
further processing, pathway analysis, and inter -group comparisons. Genetic loci/transcripts identified by 
bisulfite sequencing (DNA -methylation) and RNAseq (mRNA/miRNA sequencing) will be further 
validated using real time RT -PCR assays.

11.0  EVALUATION CRITERIA/ MEASUREMENT OF EFFEC T 
11.1  Phase I/Primary Endpoint: Toxicity  
The primary endpoint is toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined in section 13.1  of the 
protocol. The MTD will be based on the assessment of DLT during cycle 1. All patients who are not 
evaluable for dose limiting toxicity will be replaced.  
11.2  Phase II/Primary  Endpoint: Response  
The primary endpoint is response. Response will be categorized using the IMWG response cri teria for 
multiple myeloma  [37, 38]. Table 11.2 summarizes the categories and criteria.   
Table 11.2 Response Criteria  
Response Category  Response Criteria  
Complete response 
(CR)* Negative immunofixation of serum & urine, AND  
Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, AND

or to < 200mg per 24h  
If serum and urine M protein are unmeasurable, a ≥ 50% decrease in the dif ference 
between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M protein 
response criteria  
If serum and urine M protein are unmeasurable, AND serum free light assay is also 
unmeasurable, a ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow plasma cells is requ ired in place of M 
protein, provided baseline percentage was ≥ 30%.  
In addition to the above criteria, if present at baseline, ≥ 50% reduction in the size of 
soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required  
Minimal Response   25% but ≤ 49% reduction of serum M protein and reduction in 24-hour urine M-

  Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > 11.5mg/100ml) that can 
be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder  
* Confirmation with bone marrow assessmen t is required for CR and sCR.  Only a single bone marrow 
assessment is needed. CR and sCR require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if 
radiographic studies are performed.  
** The following response categories: VGPR, PR, MR,  SD, and PD require 2 consecutive assessments 
made at any time before the institution of any new therapy. VGPR, PR, MR, and SD require no known 
evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies are performed. The second 
assessment might b e at the time of a planned assessment or earlier, based on the judgement of the 
treating physician.  
*** Based on the recommendations in Rajkumar et al. [38], MR will be reported separately and will be 
distinguished from PR or better.

IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 12.2  Protocol Deviations  
12.2.1  Deviation Policy  
This protocol will be conducted in accordance with COH’s “ Clinical Research Protocol Deviation policy ”… 
Deviations from the written protocol that could increase patient risk or alter protocol integrity require 
prior IRB approval of a single subject exception (SSE) request. IRB pre-approved SSE protocol 
modifications are considered an amendment to the protocol and not a deviation.  The submission of a 
deviation report is not required.  
Brief interruptions and delays may occasionally be required due to travel delays, airport closure, 
inclement weather, famil y responsibilities, security alerts, government holidays, etc.  This can also 
extend to complications of disease or unrelated medical illnesses not related to disease progression.  The 
PI has the discretion to deviate from the protocol when necessary so long as such deviation does not 
threaten patient safety or protocol scientific integrity.  Examples include, but are not limited to:  a) dose 
adjustments based on excessive patient weight; b)  alteration in treatment schedule due to non -
availability of the research participant for treatment; c) laboratory test results which are slightly outside 
the protocol requirements but at levels that do not affect participant safety.  These instances are 
considered to be deviations from the protocol.  A deviation report will be submitted to the DSMC/IRB 
within five days.  
12.2.2  Reporting of Deviations  
All deviations will be reported to the COH DSMC within five days.  The DSMC  will forward to report to the 
IRB followi ng review. 
12.2.3  Resolving Disputes  
The COH Investigational Drug Service (IDS) cannot release a research agent that would cause a protocol 
deviation without approval by the PI.  Whenever the protocol is ambiguous on a key point, the IDS 
should rely on the PI to c larify the issue.  
In situations where there is misperception or  dispute regarding a protocol deviation among the persons 
involved in implementing the protocol, it is the responsibility of the PI to resolve the dispute  and the PI 
may consult with the DSMC c hair (or designee) to arrive at resolution.

13.2  Evaluable Participants and Participant Replacement  
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with leflunomi de. 
Evaluable for Dose -Escalation/De -Escalation Criteria:  Participants will be considered evaluable for 
dose-escalation criteria if they receive at least 75% of leflunomide and are followed during cycle 1, or 
experience a DLT. All participants who are not evaluable for dose -escalation criteria will be replaced.  
Note: While patients who receive <75% of the intended dose of leflunomide will be considered 
unevaluable for determination of MTD, if a patient discontinues leflunomide due to toxicities prior to 
receiving 75% of the dose, the patient will be considered evaluable and will not be replaced.  
Evaluable for Response:  Participants will have their response classified according to the IMWG response 
criteria (See Section 11 ). All patients included in the study will be assessed for response to treatment, 
even if there are protocol treatment deviations or if the patient is later determined to be ineligible. Each 
patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) comp lete response (CR), 2) stringent 
complete response (sCR), 3) very good partial response (VGPR), 4) partial response (PR), 5) minim al 
response (MR), 6) stable disease (SD), 7) progressive disease (PD), 8) early death from malignant disease, 
9) early death f rom toxicity, 10) early death due to other cause, or 11) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible of exception of those who received 
no study medication) should be included in ini tial analysis of response rate; overall response 
(sCR/CR/VGPR or PR) and clinical benefit response (sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/MR or SD). Patients in response

Version: 07 categories 7 -11 should be considered to have a treatment failure. Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule 
or incorrect drug administration does not result in the exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  
In addition, as part of the phase II anti -myeloma activity assessment, a sub-analysis will be performed 
where participants will be considered evaluable for  response if they are confirmed eligible, receive at 
least 75% of leflunomide during the first cycle of therapy and have had their disease re -evaluated  (phase 
II primary endpoint) .  
13.3  Study Design  
13.3.1  Phase I Design  
This single agent phase I dose -escalation tria l is designed to determine the MTD and  RP2D. The RP2D of 
leflunomide will generally be the MTD, but it may be less than the MTD based on a review of available 
data/cumulative toxicities. Extensive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are also 
incorporated into this protocol and may be helpful in determining the RP2D.  
While the standard dose of leflunomide, 20mg daily, is FDA approved for continuous treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis, leflunomide has been administered without an increase in the type, f requency or 
severity of adverse events at doses up to 40 mg/day in patients with Wegner ’s granulomatosis, and up 
to 60mg/day in a subset of patients with polyoma BK neuropathy to achieve targeted therapeutic levels. 
We will therefore attempt to escalate th e dose of leflunomide to three times that approved for RA using 
a modified rolling six dose -escalation/ de -escalation/expansion design, a more conservative version of 
the rolling six design of Skolnik, et al. [1]. The starting dose of leflunomide is 20mg daily, with the 
intention to test up to 60mg daily. Escalation will proceed in increments of 20mg/day (odd numbered 
dose levels); de -escalation will proceed in decrements of 10mg/day.  
Table 13.3.1 Dose Levels   
Dose Level  Leflunomide Dose*  
-1 10 mg PO daily  
1 20 mg PO daily  
2 30 mg PO daily  
3 40 mg PO daily  
4 50 mg PO daily  
5 60 mg PO daily  
*NOTE: Leflunomide is administered with a loading dose of 100 mg for the 1st three doses.  
 
13.3.2  Phase I Dose Escalation  
This phase I trial will employ a modified rolling six design, a more conservative version of the rolling 6 
design of Skolnik, et al [1]. In this design, at most 3 patients will be under observation for DLT (in cycle 1) 
on the current test dose level at any time. Patients who are not evaluable for dose escalation wil l be 
replaced. Once each patient completes cycle 1 and passes without a DLT, an additional patient may be 
accrued on that dose level for up to 6 patients. Once 3 patients have completed cycle 1 with no patient 
at that dose level experiencing a DLT, the dos e can be escalated. Up to 3 additional patients may be 
treated at the current dose level. Although this design does not require that 6 patients be treated, no 
more than 6 evaluable patients will be accrued to any dose level during the dose finding portion of this 
study. If at any time, the dose level has 1 documented DLT with fewer than 6 evaluable patients, accrual 
will continue until 6 patients are evaluable. Escalation will terminate as soon as two or more patients

Version: 07 experience a DLT attributable to the st udy treatment. MTD will be the highest dose in which ≤ 1/6 
patients experience a DLT. There will be no dose escalation within a patient. These rules are outlined in 
Table 13.3.2.  
Table 13.3.2: Dose Escalation Rules  
Phase II Design  
Following completion of the phase I portion of the study and identification of the RP2D, the phase II 
portion of the study will be initiated. Recent studies evaluating daratumumab, a CD38 monoclonal 
antibody, as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory multiple  myeloma were recently published [39, 40] 
and have led to FDA approval of this agent. One study included patients with re lapsed multiple myeloma 
treated with at least three lines of therapy while the other included patients treated with at least two 
prior lines of treatment. Treatment with daratumumab as a single agent lead to an overall response rate 
of 29.2% and 36% respec tively in each of these studies. In both studies, the agent investigated was well 
tolerated but required IV dosing once weekly for 8 doses, followed by twice -monthly doses for 8 doses 
and then monthly thereafter. We suspect leflunomide to be similarly well  tolerated but with a more 
convenient dosing schedule. Because we are including patients who have received at least three prior 
lines of treatment, we will target an overall response rate of 30% for the phase II portion of the study.  # Patients on Current Level

Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 50 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 This single-center, single arm phase II trial will implement a Simon Two -Stage Optimal Design [2, 3].  to 
evaluate the anti -myeloma activity of leflunomide, when given as a single agent,  as assessed by overall 
response rate  (ORR), in patients wit h relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM. The phase II portion of the 
study is expected to enroll a minimum of 19 and a maximum of 39 patients. The sample size is based on 
the desire to discriminate a promising ORR of 30% from a d isappointing response rate of 15% using a 
type I error rate of 0. 10 and power of 80%.   
At stage 1, 19 patients will be entered on the study. If ≤ 3 responses are seen, the study will be 
terminated. If at least 4 patients achieve response, the trial will continue to the second stage. The 6 
patients treated at the RP2D in the phase I portion will be evaluated as part of this phase II group. The 
probability of early stopping after the first stage is 0.68.  
At stage 2, 20 additional patients will be entered. At the end of stage 2, if 9 or more patients respond, 
leflunomide -as single agent therapy,  will be considered worthy of further study. If ≤ 8 patients respond 
further investigation is not warranted.  
13.4  Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
Phase I: In general, the total sample size will depend on th e number of dose levels evaluated to 
determine the RP2D. Assuming the highest dose tested is well tolerated (3 patients treated on dose 
levels 1 (20mg) and 3 (40mg); 6 patients treated on assumed MTD -dose level 5 (60mg), the phase I 
portion of the study would enroll and treat 12 patients. The expected sample size is 12-18 patients, 
allowing for 6 patients to replace inevaluable/ineligible patients. A maximum of 36 participants could be 
treated if 6 participants are treated at each dose level. A minimum of 6 patients could be treated if 
leflunomide is not well tolerated.  
Assuming one patient is enrolled each month, accrual is expected to be completed in 12-18 months for 
the phase I portion. When the phase II portion begins, it is anticipated that the accrua l rate will increase. 
This is a priority trial and the initiation of the phase II portion is likely to coincide with the end of other 
trials, increasing the pool of potential candidates. Therefore, we estimate a rate of 2 patients per month 
for the phase I I portion, for an accrual time of 17 months. The expected follow-up time is 24  months, for 
an estimated  maximum total study duration of (18+17+24) 59  months, or roughly five years . In the 
event that participants are receiving treatment at the end of the st udy, additional options for 
continuation, such as compassionate use, will be considered.  With ~150 relapsed or relapsed/refractory 
MM patients treated at COH per year, we do not expect any problems accruing the required patient 
numbers for both phases of the clinical trial within 29 -35 months from start of study, and therefore both 
phases of the clinical trial will be conducted solely at COH.  
13.5  Statistical Analysis Plan  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, medical history,  and prior 
therapy, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics 
(number [n], mean, standard deviation, standard error, median (range) will be provided. For categorical 
variables, patient counts and perc entages will be provided.  
Analysis: Observed toxicities will be summarized, for all dose levels, in terms of type (organ affected or 
laboratory determination), severity, time of onset, duration, serum concentration of the active 
leflunomide metabolite,  probable association with the study treatment and reversibility or outcome.  
The overall response rate and clinical benefit response rate will be calculated, for the initial and sub -
analysis for all dose levels; Clopper Pearson binomial 95% confidence inte rvals will be calculated for 
these estimates. As part of the initial analysis of response, the overall response rate (patients that have 
confirmed sCR/CR/VGPR or PR) and clinical benefit response rate (patients that have confirmed 
sCR/CR/VGPR/PR/MR or SD) will be calculated among all patients included in the study even if there are 
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 51 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 protocol treatment deviations or if the patient is later determined to be ineligible. In addition, as part of 
the phase II anti -myeloma activity assessment, sub-analyses will be performed where participants will 
be considered evaluable for response if they are confirmed eligible, receive at least 75% of leflunomide 
during the first cycle of therapy and have their disease re -evaluated. Response rates will also be 
evaluated based on  number/type of prior therapy(ies) and serum concentration of the leflunomide 
metabolite (µg/mL). Time to response and survival will be estimated using the product -limit method of 
Kaplan and Meier.   
Pharmacokinetics:  Because serum concentration of the meta bolite, teriflunomide (A77 1726), can be 
variable, and because some studies have found an association between serum concentration of this 
metabolite and RA response, samples will be collected throughout the study for analysis by the 
Analytical Pharmacology  Core Facility (APCF) for an exploratory analysis relating metabolite levels to 
safety and efficacy outcomes. At the conclusion of the study, total and free teriflunomide levels will be 
summarized at 2 - and 4-week sampling time points. Descriptive statisti cs will be used to characterize 
possible inter -patient variability and relationship to dose, toxicity and response for future studies, 
including guidance with respect to RP2D selection. Additional testing and analysis will be done on 
collected samples to a ssess, in an exploratory manner, the potential association between germline 
polymorphisms in the DHODH gene and either toxicity or response.  
Pharmacogenomics:  To evaluate the independent effect of germline polymorphisms, all models will be 
adjusted for ris k factors known to be associated with outcomes studied (e.g., age, disease status). 
Multiple comparisons adjustment with false discovery rate (FDR) will be conducted, and variants with 
FDR ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant. We will specifically look at  DHODH, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 gene 
polymorphisms and haplotypes identified in the literature that are associated with leflunomide 
response/ toxicity in RA. Functional annotation of the variants will be performed using ANNOVAR.  The 
major goal of this analysis i s to identify potential SNPs that might affect the responsiveness of 
treatment, other than the miRNA/mRNA/methylation signature. Given the small sample size, we 
consider this analysis as exploratory and may not provide enough power to detect significant 
associations.  
Ex vivo and molecular studies:  The IC50 values for teriflunomide in MM cells will be calculated using 
Prism software (GraphPad ). These values will be used for correlation analysis to determine the strength 
and linearity of the relationship between the ex vivo response and the response characteristics in vivo. 
The results will also be compared to responses from cell lines.  
For the studies combining teriflunomide with other agents ex vivo, combination Index (CI) values will be 
calculated using the CalcuSyn software program (Biosoft, Ferguson) to determine which of the 
compounds work synergistically, if any. A combination index of <  0.9 indicates synergism, whereas CI = 
0.9 to 1.1 indicates additive effects. CI > 1.1 indicates antagonism. Isobologram diagrams will be 
generated that show the varying combination treatments and the ratio where maximal synergy is 
obtained.  
The miRNA/mRN A expression profile and DNA methylation data will be used to identify the 
miRNA/mRNA and differential methylated regions (DMRs) that show significant differences between 
responders and non -responders after leflunomide treatment. For miRNA/RNA profiling, f old changes >3 
with an FDR <0.05 will be considered significant. Assuming the dispersion of genes across replicates is 
0.2 and minimum average expression is 10 reads per gene, 10 samples in each group (responder vs. non -
responder) should have 89% power to detect a 3 -fold difference between groups at an FDR level of 0.05.  
The major goal of RNA -seq/miRNA -seq/RRBS-seq is to predict potential responders based on pre -
treatment genomic profiling. A logistic regression -based algorithm with risk score formula described 
previously [46] will be used to build a classifier for respons e prediction. Differentially expressed 
miRNA/mRNA and DMRs together with other known clinical risk factors will be included in the 
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 52 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 multivariable logistic regression model. The performance of the identified classifier will be evaluated 
with leave one out cr oss validation (LOOCV). Specifically, for each iteration -as part of a random 
selection process, one sample will be left out as the test sample; the remaining samples will be used to 
build a classifier, and the classifier will be used to predict the respon se status of the test sample. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the classifier will be calculated, as well as receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) to evaluate its accuracy.   
Another goal of the genomic profiling is  to identify potential new pathways to complement leflunomide 
treatment. We will compare the miRNA/mRNA/methylation profiles between responders and non -
responders. Differentially expressed genes will be used to identify pathways that are activated in non -
responders, which will provide insights into possible complementary therapy. Gene ontology (GO) and 
KEGG pathways will be analyzed using DAVID and GSEA. Pathways and GO that are activated in non -
responders will be sorted by their multiple comparison adjuste d p-value. Potential miRNA targets will be 
identified using TargetScan and the enrichment of GO and pathways will be identified as well. The NCI 
connectivity map, an online resource to predict therapeutic efficacy based on pathway based gene 
expression pro files, will also be explored to determine the complimentary therapeutic agents for 
leflunomide .

Version: 07 APPENDIX B.  DETAILED METHODS FOR  PHARMACOGENOMIC, EX VIVO, AND MOLECULAR STUDIE S  
This is a description of the detailed analytical methods at the time of protocol submission. Any changes 
to the procedures will be stored in the laboratory manual of procedures /standard operating procedures  
or in the laboratory research notes.  
Pharmacogenomics  
The extracted DNA material will t hen be sent to the Integrative Genomics Core (IGC; Director, Xiwei Wu, 
PhD) for sequencing. The DNA samples will be fragmented into 200 bp, and a pre -capture library will be 
generated following Illumina’s recommended protocol. Agilent SureSelect Human all exon V6 probes will 
be used to capture the coding exome. The captured library will be sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 
for paired -end 100 bp sequencing for a minimum of 100x coverage. The paired -end sequences will be 
aligned to the human genome (hg38) u sing Novoalign. Only reads aligned to a unique genomic location 
will be kept for further analysis. The aligned reads will be piled up using Samtools. Variants (SNPs and 
short indels) will be identified using VarScan. The quality of variants will be assesse d by the concordance 
of variants to the dbSNP database. The prognostic significance of germline polymorphisms on toxicity 
risk/response will be analyzed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. To evaluate the 
independent effect of germline polymorphisms, all models will be adjusted for risk factors known to be 
associated with outcomes studied (e.g., age, disease status). Multiple comparisons adjustment with 
false discovery rate (FDR) will be conducted, and variants with FDR ≤ 0.05 will be co nsidered significant. 
We will specifically look at DHODH, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms and haplotypes identified 
in the literature  that are associated with leflunomide response/toxicicty in RA. Functional annotation of 
the variants will be perfor med using ANNOVAR.  The major goal of this analysis is to identify potential 
SNPs that might affect the responsiveness of treatment, other than the miRNA/mRNA/methylation 
signature. Given the small sample size, we consider this analysis as exploratory and m ay not provide 
enough power to detect significant associations.   
Ex Vivo and Molecular Studies Bone marrow aspirates will be promptly taken on ice to Tinisha 
McDonald in Dr. Guido Marcucci’s lab for Ficoll -Paque density centrifugation and preparation of 
mononuclear cells and then forwarded to Dr. Ralf Büttner at the Rosen laboratory for processing. The 
bone marrow aspirate will first be filtered through a 40 µm mesh to avoid coagulated products. The 
filtrate will be carefully layered on top of Histopaque  (Sigma cat. # 1077 -1) in 50 ml polypropylene 
centrifuge tubes. The sample will be centrifuged (with the brake set to “off”) at 1500 x g for 25 minutes. 
The mononuclear blood cells at the interface between the Histopaque  and the top aqueous layer will 
be aspirated into a clean 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube using a glass Pasteur pipette.  
The aspirated cells will then be washed twice in ice cold PBS, cells will be counted and placed on ice for 
enrichment of CD138 -positive cells. CD138 is a transmembra ne protein expressed on the surface of 
plasma cells. CD138 -positive cells will be enriched by magnetic cell sorting according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (CD138 MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec Cat# 130 -051-301). In brief, 
mononuclear cells obtained from  the density centrifugation will be pelleted by centrifugation and 
incubated with CD138 magnetic beads for 15 minutes at 4 C in MACS buffer, washed in MACS buffer 
and subjected to column separation. To increase the purity of the CD138 -positive cells, the eluted 
fraction from the first column will be enriched over a second column, washed 1x in PBS, re -suspended in 
complete RPMI medium, counted and stored on ice for further processing. For RNA, DNA, and protein 
analysis of pre -treatment patient samples, 100, 000 cells (RNA) and 1,000,000 cells (DNA, protein) will be 
pelleted and frozen at -80 C. The remaining CD138 -enriched cells will be stored in the vapor phase of a 
liquid nitrogen tank in freezing medium (10% DMSO, 50% FBS, 40% RPMI -1640) if the cells are not 
processed immediately. A small aliquot of the cell population will also be used to determine purity of 
the enriched cells by flow cytometry using anti -CD138-PE antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat# 130 -081-301). 
Purities of >95% will be accepted for further experiments.  
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma 
Page 59 of 59 
IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 All cells will be grown in RPMI -1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat -inactivated FBS and 1x 
antibiotics/antimycotics.  
1): To determine the ex vivo cytotoxicity of leflunomide toward MM cell lines and primary MM cells.  
Based on our experience , a minimum of one -hundred million mononuclear cells (MNCs) can be expected 
from each bone marrow (BM) aspiration after Ficoll centrifugation. The COH Cytogenetics Core 
Laboratory will obtain a separate BM sample for standard karyotype analysis and to dete ct genetic 
variations frequently found in MM. At least 5 million (≥ 5%) CD138-positive MNCs can be expected from 
each BM aspiration after immunomagnetic enrichment. MM cell lines and MM patient derived CD138+ 
cells (20,000 cells per well of a 96 -well plate;  in triplicate) will be co -cultured in RPMI -1640 medium with 
increasing concentrations of teriflunomide (0 uM, 50 uM, 100 uM, 200 uM, 300 uM, 400 uM) for 24, 48 
and 72h. Proliferation of primary MM cells will be measured based on quantitation of the ATP pr esent in 
cells (CellTiter -Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, Promega). IC 50 values will be calculated using 
GraphPad Prism. IC 50 values will also be determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V. The results from 
primary MM cells will be compared with th e following human MM cell lines RPMI-8226, MM.1S, NCI -
H929 and U266 and the human bone marrow stromal cell line HS -5, which were purchased from the 
American Type Culture Collection   
2) To determine potential additive or synergistic effects when combining leflunomide with other classes 
of FDA-approved drugs. Primary pre -treatment CD138+ MM cells will be cultured in 96 -well plates 
(20,000 cells/well) with increasing amounts of teriflunomide and selected multiple myeloma drugs for 
72h in RPMI -1640 medium supp lemented with or without conditioned medium derived from HS -5 
stroma cells. Conditioned medium will be used to model the in vivo  cytokine stimulation milieu. We will 
first determine the IC50s of each individual agent by adding increasing amounts of each dr ug to the cell 
culture for 72h, followed by the MTS assay (colorimetric assay, for cell lines) and ATP assay 
(luminescence assay, for primary cells). Once the IC50s are established using GraphPad Prism, we will 
repeat above cell culture experiments by comb ining teriflunomide and the FDA -approved agents at 
constant ratios based on the IC 50s, as described previously by Chou . Combination Index (CI) values will be 
calculated using the CalcuSyn software program (Biosoft, Ferguson) to determine which of the 
compo unds work synergistically, if any. A combination index of < 0.9 indicates synergism, whereas CI = 
0.9 to 1.1 indicates additive effects. CI > 1.1 indicates antagonism. Isobologram diagrams will be 
generated that show the varying combination treatments and the ratio where maximal synergy is 
obtained.   
3) To generate a preliminary RNA/miRNA and DNA -methylation signature associated with response of 
MM cells to leflunomide. We will conduct high resolution genomic profiling (RNA -seq and miRNA -seq) to 
evaluate mRNA and miRNA profiles, and we will also conduct Reduced Representation Bisulfite 
Sequencing (RRBS -seq) for evaluation of DNA methylation profiles. We will compare the profiles of 
primary MM cells before and after in vivo  leflunomide therapy and before an d after ex vivo  
teriflunomide treatment. These results will be compared with in vitro  teriflunomide treatment of human 
MM cell lines, in order to generate information about common molecular pathways of drug response. 
RNA and DNA will be extracted from prim ary patient samples (CD138 -enriched) prior to start of 
treatment and 4 w eeks into treatment. RNA  will also be extracted from MM cell lines and CD138+ 
primary, pre -treatment cells treated with 300 µM teriflunomide (a concentration that can be achieved in 
vivo) or vehicle control for 24h. DNA (from 1 million cells) and RNA (from 100,000 cells) will be extracted 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for RNA isolation (Qiazol, Qiagen) and DNA isolation 
(DNAzol, Thermofisher) and submitted to the COH Inte grative Genomics Core for analysis.  
Illumina Hiseq 2500 will be used to profile total cellular RNA (RNA -seq) and micro -RNA (miRNA -seq). The 
concentration and integrity of RNA samples will be measured using Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer.  Poly(A) 
RNA will be enr iched with oligo d(T) and reverse transcribed,  and cDNA will be used for mRNA library 
preparation following Illumina’s TrueSeq protocol. Briefly, cDNA will be fragmented and ligated to 
Phase I/II: L eflunomide for Multiple M yeloma

IRB Protocol N o. 15140  Version Date:  10/23/17 
Version: 07 Illumina adapters. The cDNA fragments of 130 -280 bp will be isolated fr om polyacrylamide -urea gels. In 
addition, all small RNAs of 15 -52 nucleotides will be selected separately and used to make small RNA 
libraries following the Illumina's protocol. The libraries will be quantified using qPCR and loaded to cBot 
for clustering generation. Sequencing will be performed on a Hiseq 2500, and image processing and 
base calling conducted using Illumina's pipeline. For mRNA -seq, sequence reads will be mapped to the 
human genome (hg19) using TopHat and the frequency of Refseq genes will be counted with customized 
R scripts. For miRNA -seq, sequences will be adapter -trimmed and aligned to hg19 genome using 
Novoalign, and miRNA expression level will be counted as previously described. The raw counts will then 
be normalized and compared using  the Bioconductor package “edgeR”. Gene ontology (GO) and 
pathways will be analyzed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated 
Discovery), an online bioinformatic resource for functional interpretation of large lists of genes. 
Pathways and GO that correlate with response will be sorted by their multiple comparison adjusted p 
value. Potential miRNA targets will be identified using TargetScan and their functional annotation will be 
done using DAVID.  
The DNA Methylation of 5 -methylcyt osine will be profiled by reduced representation bisulfite 
sequencing (RRBS -seq). Briefly, purified genomic DNA will be digested by the methylation -insensitive 
restriction enzyme MspI to generate short fragments that contain CpG dinucleotides at the ends. After 
end-repair, A-tailing and ligation to methylated Illumina adapters, the CpG -rich DNA fragments (40 -220 
bp) will be size selected and subjected to bisulfite conversion and PCR amplification. The library will be 
sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 with  paired end 100bp  reads. The reads will be aligned to hg19 
genome and methylation levels of each cytosine in the CG context will be summarized using Bismark. 
The methylation levels of each CG will be compared between leflunomide  treated and untreated 
samples to identify hyper and hypo -methylated regions (DMRs). The common DMRs across the cell lines 
will be identified and considered as candidate regions.  The location of the DMRs relative to coding genes 
will be annotated using R s cripts and RefSeq database. The genes with promoter DMRs and also showing 
differential expression by mRNA -seq will be identified and their functions and pathways will be 
identified by DAVID on online annotation tools and KEGG database.

1 1. RCT Details
This section provides a high-level overview of a published  RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title
A 26 Week, Randomized, Double-blind, Parallel-group, Active Controlled, Multicenter, Multinational Safety Study 
Evaluating the Risk of Serious Asthma-related Events During Treatment With Symbicort®, a Fixed Combination of Inhaled 
Corticosteroid (ICS) (Budesonide) and a Long Acting β2-agonist (LABA) (Formoterol) as Compared to Treatment With ICS 
(Budesonide) Alone in Adult and Adolescent (≥12 Years of Age) Patients With Asthma (D5896C00027 Study 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To assess the effects of 26 weeks treatment with budesonide-formoterol compared with budesonide alone on the incidence of 
first serious asthma-related event (a composite of adjudicated death, intubation, and hospitalization) in patients who had 
persistent asthma.  
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication 
First serious asthma-related event (a composite of adjudicated death, intubation, and hospitalization. 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
To meet the prespecified noninferiority margin, the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio 
for the first serious asthma-related event with budesonide-formoterol versus budesonide had to be less than 2.0.  The 
incidence rate of serious asthma-related events in the budesonide-only treatment group was predicted to be 0.0075 over a 26-
week period.  It was calculated that 87 events would have to occur for the study to have 90% power to rule out an event rate 
with budesonide-formoterol that was twice as high as the rate with budesonide alone.   
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding 
Individual components of the primary outcome 1) Asthma-related hospitalization 
2) Asthma-related intubation
3) Asthma-related death

 2 1.6 Trial estimate 
Hazard Ratio, HR = 1.07 (95% CI, 0.70 to 1.65) comparing budesonide-formoterol versus budesonide during a 26-week  
period (Peters et al., 2016).

5. Cohort Identification  
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort design comparing budesonide-
formoterol versus budesonide alone. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 
days before initiation of budesonide-formoterol or budesonide.  
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
New use of budesonide-formoterol (exposure) is defined as no use of the exposure drug with in the 180 days prior to index date. 
This will emulate the trial requirement for which treatment with budesonide-formoterol was not allowed any time before 
randomization. New use of budesonide (comparator) is defined as no use of the comparator drug with in the 180 days prior to index 
date. New users of budesonide are not allowed to receive of budesonide-formoterol with in the 180 days prior to index date, and 
new users of budesonide-formoterol are not allowed to receive budesonide within the 180 days prior to index date. 
 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates 
Budesonide-formoterol was approved by FDA on July 21, 2006 for management of asthma.  The initial eligible cohort 
entry date was the first date after July 21, 2006 for both the databases investigated (IBM® MarketScan®, Optum CDM). 
The last date eligible as cohort entry date was the end of available data for IBM® MarketScan® and Optum CDM. The 
following eligible cohort entry dates were included: 
• IBM® MarketScan®: July 21, 2006 – December 31, 2018 (end of available data)  
• Optum CDM: July 21, 2006 – June 30, 2020 (end of available data)  
5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion are 
provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure-related variables:  
 
Study drug:  
New initiation of Budesonide-formoterol (80/4.5 ug or 160/4.5 ug twice daily). New initiation is defined as no use of Budesonide-formoterol in the prior 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period). New users of Budesonide-formoterol are not allowed to 
receive budesonide within the 180 days prior to treatment initiation. 
 
Comparator agent: 
New initiation of Budesonide alone. New initiation is defined as no use of budesonide in the prior 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period). New users of budesonide are not allowed to receive Budesonide-formoterol within the 180 days prior to treatment 
initiation. 
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariates: 
• Age 
• Gender 
• Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to and including index date. 
 
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. 
We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between 
treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility 
analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  
 6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables

Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A): 
§ Primary outcome: First serious asthma-related event (a composite of adjudicated death, intubation, and hospitalization 
  Secondary outcome: Individual components of the primary outcome 1) Asthma-related hospitalization  
                                                                                                 2) Asthma-related intubation 
                                                                                                  3) Asthma-related death  
 
6.3.2 Study follow-up 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment. 
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of Budesonide-formoterol and Budesonide and will continue until 
the earliest date of the following events: 
 
§ The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, 
§ The date of end of continuous registration in the database, 
§ Discontinuation of the index drugs, 
§ End of the study period, 
§ Measured death event occurs, 
§ Nursing home admission 
o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for 
cohorts for the same reason. 
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (Budesonide-formoterol or a comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 60 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main analyses). 
• The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation 
§ A dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion

 In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment will be used. This outcome 
is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. Complete a 1:1 
PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, gender, and combined comorbidity 
index. Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008). 
 
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators and FDA. Reviewers evaluate the results of the 
analyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow-up time, and reasons 
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re-evaluated and 
reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.  
 
• Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators, FDA, and assigned members of advisory board.

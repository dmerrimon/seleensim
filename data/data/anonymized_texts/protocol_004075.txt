Each study treatment will be provided by Hope Biosciences on the day of the infusion after all quality control essays have been performed and the results are within normal range.   Placebo Infusions   Study subjects who are randomly assigned during the screening process to the Placebo group will receive Saline Solution 0.9% in each infusion.    Study subjects, investigators and study staff will be blinded to the assigned treatment. In order to maintain the blinding of this investigation, amber plastic bags shall be used to cover treatment bags. Only subject identification number, patient initials, date of birth and the phrase: “Caution: New Drug Limited by Federal law to Investigational Use (required by 21 CFR 312.6) will be on the bag label, to ensure proper distribution.   Treatment Regimen    Study subjects will receive the assigned treatment (HB-adMSCs or Placebo) through intravenous infusion only, with a treatment duration of 32 weeks, infusion rate 4-5ml/min and total volume of 250 ml Sodium chloride 0.9%. Each study participant will receive a total of 6 doses of HB-adMSCs or Placebo with a dosing regimen of approximately 4 to 8 weeks between infusions.    Instructions for Administration  The infusion should be prepared by a designated unblinded pharmacist using aseptic technique with the following procedures: (detailed instructions will be available in the Investigational Product Manual):  1. Gather all equipment and materials you need including cooler inside cardboard box with HB-adMSCs or placebo.  2. Don non-sterile gloves and clean countertop where infusion is to be prepared using antibacterial wipes according to manufacturing instruction. 3. Remove and discard gloves, clean hands with hand sanitizer and allow to dry. 4. Don non-sterile gloves. 5. Open cooler and remove bag containing syringe with the study treatment.  6.

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 11 of 22 11. Properly label the infusion bag with the subject ID, D.O.B, preparation date, time and expiration and cover it with an amber bag.   Investigational Product Assignment (Randomization and Blinding)  A total of 24 eligible subjects will be randomized to either placebo (12) or active drug (12) (HB-adMSCs) in a 1:1 balanced design. The randomization will be applicable only to eligible subjects, if a subject is not eligible during the screening process for study participation, this subject shall not me randomized to any group.   Randomization will be conducted using the REDCap randomization module. REDCap does not use an algorithm to dynamically randomize subjects, but rather a pre-determined, stratified and permutated randomization schedule. The module allows for creating a custom allocation list, which serves as a lookup table for deciding how to randomize subjects. The allocation table is stratified to achieve even study treatment distribution within the following subgroups. Raw coded values corresponding to the table are in parenthesis following their representative category.  • Parkinson’s severity (Mild vs Moderate):   o Mild severity (1) (MDS-UPDRS score < 13 AND Carbidopa/levodopa < 375mg/day) (if taking) o Moderate severity (2) (MDS-UPDRS > 13 OR Carbidopa/levodopa > 375 mg/day) (if taking)   • Age:    < 50 (1) vs > 50 (2) • Sex:     Male (1) vs Female (2)   Controlling Blinded Information  REDCap system’s user privileges can be used to allow only certain users to be able to set up the randomization, perform the randomization, or view the allocation information. All REDCap end users will be blinded and will not have access to the randomization information with exception to the unblinded pharmacist and the personnel who will be responsible in setting up the randomization schedule and performing the randomization.   Blinding for Dose Administration  All subjects, investigators, and site staff will be blinded to treatment assigned.  For the preparation of the investigational product, Unblinded pharmacist (UP) will inject the investigational product into a 250 ml sodium chloride (Saline) infusion bag, cover it with an amber plastic bag and apply the label before delivering it to study site.   
Confidential  
Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 12 of 22 Unblinded pharmacist, also identified as Mixer, will keep records of the treatment assigned to each subject in the unblinded pharmacy binder. Access to this pharmacist binder will be limited to the unblinded pharmacist.   Blinding for Clinical Evaluators  To minimize assessment bias, clinical evaluators (data analysts and physicians) will be trained on how to maintain blinding to treatment as best as possible. “Best as possible” means that blinding will be maintained unless an adverse event or serious adverse events occurs that requires unblinding the physician, which is determined by the medical monitor or DSMB.   Training includes review of the process of blinding, describing who will be responsible for assigning product for the appropriate group, labels that will be used to identify subjects but not treatment group, and the process that should be followed if an adverse event occurs, triggering review by medical monitor and/or DSMB.   Prior and Concomitant Medications          Concurrent and prior medications (up to one week before the screening visit) should be recorded in the subject’s medical history at the screening visit. This list of concomitant medications may be updated if necessary, at the following visits.   It is important to ask the subject about the start and end date of the current and prior medications, if the subject does not remember the specific date or month, it is recommended to include the approximate year to give an estimate of how long the patient has been taking the medication.  Trial Procedures     The trial includes a up to 28 days screening period, a 32-week Treatment Period and a 20-week Safety Follow-up Period. All periods are associated with evaluations and procedure that must be performed at specific time points as represented in Table 3 Schedule of Assessments.

Trial Assessments   Assessments Related to Endpoints   MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale   The MDS-UPDRS scale refers to Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and it is a rating tool used to gauge the course of Parkinson’s disease in patients. Each answer to the scale is evaluated by the principal investigator during the study visit. Some sections of the MDS-UPDRS scale require multiple grades assigned to each extremity.   Physical Examinations   A complete physical examination will be performed by the principal investigator or delegated sub-investigator, including general appearance, head, eyes, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT), neck, cardiovascular, thorax/lungs, abdomen, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, lymph nodes, skin,

The principal investigator or delegated sub-investigator will evaluate the clinical significance of abnormal findings identified during physical examinations. Pre-existing conditions diagnosed through assessments and examinations at the screening visit or during the screening period are not adverse events but are recorded as medical history. If any clinically significant abnormal findings are discovered after informed consent or any pre-existing conditions worsen during the trial, these must be recorded as adverse events.  Vital Signs    Vital signs will be measured at Visits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and will include respiratory rate, pulse rate, blood pressure (measured after the study participant has been in a seated position for more than 5 minutes of rest), body temperature and oxygen saturation. Clinical significance of any abnormal result must be evaluated by principal investigator. Clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as adverse events.    Clinical Safety Laboratory Parameters    The following laboratory parameters should be collected at Visit 1, 2, 6 and 9.    • Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, also known as CMP or Chemistry Panel is a group of different tests that measure several substances in the study’s participant blood.  • Complete Blood Count, also known as CBC, hemogram or CBC with Differential is a group of tests that evaluate the cells that circulate in blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets.  • Coagulation Tests including Prothrombin Time (PT or PT-INR) to identify any coagulation disorder during study participation.  • Urine Pregnancy Test, a urine sample, preferably collected during morning time, to confirm pregnancy during study participation. This test will be limited to Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)   Other Assessments    Demography     Demographic data will be collected at the Screening Visit, including age, race, ethnicity, date of birth and gender.   Medical and Surgical History     Medical information on any previous concomitant illnesses, other than Parkinson’s disease should be collected during Screening Visit and updated if needed during the following study

For planned procedures/hospitalizations during the clinical trial, documentation should be completed at the time of the Screening.  Parkinson’s disease and Previous Therapy for this disease     The date of diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, as well as previous treatments, will be recorded during Screening visit.   Concomitant Medication Review      Data concerning concomitant medications and procedures will be collected throughout the clinical trial. This data will be obtained at scheduled or unscheduled visits based on information provided by the patient.   Handling of Biological Samples   Sampling tubes, material for shipments of the samples and a laboratory manual detailing all sample collection and shipment procedures will be provided and distributed to the clinical trial site by the selected laboratory. Laboratory samples will be collected as per protocol during Visit 1 – Screening, and/or Visit 2 – Infusion 1 (Baseline), Visit 6 - Infusion 5 and Visit 9 – End of Study.  Adverse Events    Adverse Event  An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered as adverse events if the abnormality results in study withdrawal, a serious adverse event, leads to additional treatment or diagnostic tests, or is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance. Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source documents, CRF and in the appropriate adverse event section of the source documents. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document and CRF, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event. Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an adverse event. All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 19 of 22 Serious Adverse Event  Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  • fatal • life-threatening • requires or prolongs hospital stay • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • a congenital anomaly or birth defect • an important medical event  Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above. All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious adverse events. Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  Adverse Event Reporting Period  The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow-up.  For this study, the study treatment follow-up is defined as approximately 20 weeks following the last administration of study treatment.   Stopping Rules    Infusion Stopping Rules   Study treatment infusion will be stopped if a least one of the following events occur:   1. Allergic reaction as evidenced by severe dyspnea, bronchospasm, or hypoxia after the product has been administered intravenously.   2. Patient verbally decline the treatment at any moment prior, or during the infusion.    3. Hyperpyrexia develops after infusion administration begins (core body temperature greater than or equal to 104°F).   4. Principal Investigator may stop the infusion at any time, based upon PI’s discretion.    5. Malignant Hypertension (180/120 mm/Hg)

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 20 of 22 6. Sudden Severe Hypotension (30-40 mm/Hg drop from pre-infusion level)  If an infusion is stopped for a subject due to an adverse event or serious adverse event, including but not limited to hypersensitivity reaction/anaphylaxis, no additional study treatment will be given to the study participant who develops the event. Although, the study participant will not receive the investigational product, he or she must be followed for safety purposes according to the protocol.   Study Stopping Rules   This Clinical Trial will stop if any of the following events are present:   1. Subject’s Death.   2. Occurrence of any thromboembolic event during or after HB-adMSCs administrations (up to 72 hours).   3. Any cerebrovascular ischemia or seizure event occurring within 72 hours after any of the investigational product administrations.   4. Any Serious Adverse Events determined to be related to the following:   - When there is one CTCAE.v5 grade 4 or 5 AE, irrespective of attribution.  - Either any CTCAE Grade 2 adverse event that persists for more than two weeks, or any Grade 3 adverse event, that occurs within 72 hours after product administration.  Should the study participant discontinue study treatment he/she will be followed for safety according to the protocol safety monitoring plan. The study participant will receive follow up communication to ascertain the outcome until resolved fully. All will be documented as per protocol. Statistical Methods     Sample size consists of up to 24 subjects who have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. All data collected from subjects who are enrolled and received the investigational product will be analyzed. The incidence of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events will be recorded and reported. Efficacy will be measured by improvement of subject’s signs and symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Interim analysis of all safety and efficacy data may be performed at any time deemed appropriate by the Sponsor. Although, the subject’s data may be analyzed at any time, a data analysis of all available data will be conducted when a least 10 subjects in each group have completed Week 24. Data may be analyzed for internal informational purposes, reports, presentations, and manuscripts.

Protocol Version 1.0  Version date: 29/APR/2021 Page 21 of 22 A repeat measure mixed model will be used to assess within-subject changes from baseline. correction for multiple comparisons will be employed for post-hoc comparisons. Parkinson’s assessment scores (i.e., MDS-UPDRS) at screening and infusion 1 (before treatment) will be averaged and treated as a baseline. Averaging is performed to minimize sources of variance (i.e., patient condition, assessors) and particularly to establish a reliable baseline from which to establish changes.   Data Handling     Case Report Forms (CRF)  As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both. Reports received by the site, or from the central laboratory should be printed, retained as source documentation and signed by the principal investigator, indicating which values are considered clinically significant and to be reported as AEs if applicable.   Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents  Changes in the Conduct of the Clinical Trial       Protocol Amendments   Any change to the protocol will need to have a protocol amendment submitted to the IND, and FDA and IRB must agree prior to proceeding.  Deviations from the Protocol   Deviations from the protocol should not occur. If safety deviations occur, the principal investigator must inform the Monitor, and the implications of the deviations must be reviewed and discussed. Any deviation must be documented in the protocol deviation log. In addition, each deviation must include a description of the deviation, the relevant dates (start and stop), and the action taken. All deviation reports and supporting documents must be kept in the Investigator Site File and in the Trial Master File.   Premature Clinical Trial Termination   Both the Study Investigator and Sponsor have the right to terminate the clinical trial at any time.  Should this become necessary, the procedures will be agreed upon after consultation between the two parties. In terminating the clinical trial, the Sponsor and the Study Investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the best interests of the study participants. Regulatory authorities and IRB will be informed.  In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the participation of any clinical trial site. Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:

 Protocol Synopsis  
 
Title  A Phase 2/3, Open- Label, Repeat -Dose Study of the Pharmacokinetics, 
Efficacy, and Safety of Prometic Plasminogen Intravenous Infusion in 
Subjects with Hypoplasminogenemia  
Study Design  Multicenter, open- label, uncontrolled, repeat -dose 
Indication  Systemic treatment of Type I plasminogen deficiency 
(hypoplasminogenemia)  
Phase  2/3 (pivotal)  
Investigational 
Medicinal Product  Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous (IV), lyophilized material reconstituted with Water for Injection to produce a sterile suspension with a concentration of 5.5 mg/mL  
Objectives  Primary objectives:  
• To achieve an increase of individual trough plasminogen acti vity 
by at least an absolute 10% (i.e., 10 U/dL) from baseline in adult and pediatric subjects with hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of plasminogen replacement therapy in Segment  2; 
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or visible lesions of hypoplasminogenemia 
during 48 weeks of dosing in Segments 2 and 3. 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of plasminogen replacement therapy during the 48 weeks of  dosing;  
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or visible symptoms of hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of dosing in Segment  2.
 
• To evaluate the effect of plasminogen replacement therapy on pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity during the 48 weeks of dosing.
 
Study Sites  This study will be conducted in at least 2 sites, including at least 1 site in the US and 1 in Norway.  
Study Design  Approximately 15 subjects aged 2 to 80 years with hypoplasminogenemia  
will be enrolled  to ensure  a sample  size of at least 10 PK-evaluable  subjects. 
At least 2 pediatric subjects, aged 2 to 18 years, will be enrolled. An 
evaluable subject  for PK is defined  as a subject  who completes  Segment  2

 of plasminogen replacement therapy (see below) of the study and provides 
at least 3 blood samples to measure trough plasminogen activity levels.  
The study consists of a screening period and 3 segments as illustrated in 
Figure 1. Subjects who have documented i ndividual PK profiles with the 
sponsor  (e.g., due to participation in the previous  Phase 1 study  and received 
6 mg/kg Plasminogen) do not need to undergo Segment 1 and can proceed 
directly to Segment  2. 
Screening  
Subjects  will be screened  for study eligibility  within  a period of no more  than 
21 days before the start of dosing. Subjects will enter either Segment 1 or 2, 
depending on the availability of their prior individual PK  profile.  
Segment 1  
For subjects undergoing Segment 1, each will receive a single dose of 
6.6mg/kg Plasminogen IV infusion on Day -4. Blood samples for PK 
analysis will be drawn prior to infusion and subsequently through 96 hours 
after the infusion to establish  individual  PK profiles. The sample drawn  prior 
to infusion will be used to measure the subject’s baseline plasminogen  
activity  and antigen  as well as D-dimer  levels.  The last PK sample  (96 hours 
post infusion) will be withdrawn on Week 1, Day 0, before the 
administration of the first dose in Segment 2. The resulting PK profile will 
be used to determine each subject’s dosing interval in Segment  2. 
Segment  2 
Based  on individual  PK profiles, subjects  will receive 6.6 mg/kg 
Plasminogen IV infusion every second, third, or fourth day for 12 weeks 
during Segment 2. Subjects will receive approximately 21 to 42 doses in 
Segment  2. 
For subjects  who do not participate  in Segment  1 and directly  enter  Segment 
2, baseline assessments  will be conducted before the first dose of 
Plasminogen IV infusion, including a blood sample to measure the baseline 
plasminogen activity and antigen as well as D-dimer levels. Their dosing 
interval will be every second, third, or fourth day, depending on each 
subject’s PK profile on file. 
Subjects who have gone through Segment 1 will start with the every -third- 
day dosing interval until their individual PK results become available. This 
initial dosing regimen is based upon the aggregate PK obtained from the 
Phase  1 study. Once each subject’s  individual  PK profile  becomes  available, 
his or her dosing interval will be adjusted to every second, third, or fourth  
day accordingly.  
The first  dose of Plasminogen  IV infusion  in this segment  will 
beadministered at the study site on Week 1, Day 0. Subjects will visi t the 
study sites every 4 weeks and receive the investigational medicinal product 
(IMP) infusion at the study site. The infusions between study visits can be 
administered  at the study site or an ancillary  site by study  personnel  or at the

 subject’s  home by a home health  nurse, by the subject (i.e., self - 
administration), or by a caregiver/family  member  (US subjects  only). 
Subjects or caregivers may be trained for IMP administration as deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator (US subjects only). The final dose at the 
Week 12 visit (or at study discontinuation)  in Segment  2 must be 
administered at the study site to allow for a repeat PK profile.  
Plasma samples will be drawn before IMP administration every 2 weeks to 
measure the trough  levels  of plasminogen activity  and antigen  and D-dimer. 
The samples  will be obtained at each study  visit at Weeks  4, 8 and 12 and by 
a home  health  nurse  at Weeks  2, 6, and 10. Additional  samples  may be taken 
in addition if needed.  
Subjects will undergo clinical assessments of the disease at each study visit 
depending on the system and organ involvement of hypoplasminogenemia 
and the characteristics of lesions, including but not limited to: photographic 
measurements of visible lesions (e.g., ocular, gingival), spirometry for 
subjects with pulmonary involvement, and imaging study of nonvisible 
lesions (e.g., oropharyngeal, ureteral, bronchial), as deemed appropriate by 
the investigator.  
Safety assessments will include vital signs, physical exam ination, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinogen and 
coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing 
potential), AE assessments, virology, and immunogenicity.  
In addition, subjects will be given a dia ry to record infusions, symptoms, 
concomitant medications and AEs at home between visits.  
At the end of Segment 2, subjects will have the option to participate in 
Segment 3. Subjects for whom there is no perceived or anticipated benefit  
from  further dosing would  not be enrolled  in Segment  3 at the investigator’s 
discretion and based on discussion with the Safety Monitoring Committee  
(SMC, see Section 3.7) and the  sponsor.  
Any subject who discontinues the study during or at the end of Segment 2 
should return to the study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the 
final IMP dose.  
Segment 3  
Subjects who participate in Segment 3 will continue to receive Plasminogen 
IV for 36 additional weeks in Norway and until product licensing or study 
termination by the sponsor for subjects in the United States. The dose will 
be 6.6 mg/kg with the frequency determined during Segment 2, with the 
option of modification based on clinical response and plasminogen trough  
levels. Subjects (or their caregivers) may be trained to self-administer the 
IMP at home if deemed appropriate by the Investigator. 
Subjects will return to the study sites for assessments every 3 months to 
monitor  subjects’  clinical  status  and plasminogen trough levels.  Subjects  will 
be given a diary to record the dates of IMP administration, any AEs, 
concomitant  medication  and other  relevant  information.  Subjects  will be

 given instructions for how to document receipt of IMP and how to return  all 
used IMP vials.  
Subjects at the Norway site in Segment 3 should return to the study site for 
a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose.  
Due to the delay  in product  approval, subjects  at the United  States  (US) site 
in Segment 3 will be allowed to enroll in Treatment Protocol 2002C018G  
and continue ongoing IMP treatment without any break in treatment. If 
subjects decide to enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will 
return to the study site and complete the End of Study visit and sign an 
informed consent/assent for that study and stop participation in the current  
study. If subjects decide to not enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then 
they will stop IMP and return to the study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 
30 days after the final IMP dose.  
Stopping rules  
Any subject  who experiences  any of the following  occurrences  will suspend 
the IMP treatment until further  assessments:  
• Anaphylactic response to study drug  administration  
• A significant AE that, in the investigator’s opinion, necessitates  
suspension of treatment  
• Confirmed  presence of neutralizing  antibodies (in at least 2 
measurements) in association with diminished plasminogen activity 
that obviates the potential benefit of plasminogen replacement  
thera py 
• Thrombotic or uncontrolled bleeding event requiring  hospitalization  
The SMC will review safety data on an ongoing basis and will determine if 
a subject should stop treatment, or if there are unforeseen events (e.g., 
thromboembolic event) that would warr ant halting or stopping the study. 
Such an event will be discussed with FDA before enrolling further subjects.  
Duration  For each subject, the estimated duration of study participation is no more 
than 21 days for screening, 4 days for Segment 1, 12 weeks for Segment 2, 
and 40 weeks (36 weeks Treatment and 4 weeks Safety Follow -up) for 
subjects who participate in Segment 3 in Norway.  
For those subjects who participate in Segment 3 in the United States, it will 
be dependent on product approval and sponsor decision. A Safety Follow - 
up visit is required 30 days after the final IMP dose. However, due to the 
delay  in product  approval,  subjects  at the US site will be allowed  to enroll  in 
Treatment Protocol 2002C018G and continue ongoing IMP treatment 
without any break in treatment. If subjects decide to enter Treatment 
Protocol  2002C018G, then they will return  to the study site and complete  the 
End of Study visit and sign an informed conse nt/assent for that study and 
stop participation in the current study. If subjects decide to not enter 
Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will stop IMP and return to the 
study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose.

Administration & 
Dosage  IMP Preparation  
Plasminogen  (Human)  Intravenous  lyophilized material will be reconstituted 
with sterile Water for Injection to yield a solution of 5.5 mg/mL for IV 
infusion.  
Infusion  
Only eligible and enrolled subject s will receive IMP. The entire dose of the 
Plasminogen IV solution should be calculated on the basis of each  subject’s 
body weight and infused over 10 to 30 minutes.  
Dose and Dosing Interval  
In Segment 1, a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered 
to each subject. However, subjects who have documented individual PK 
profiles with the sponsor (e.g., due to participation in the previous Phase 1 
study  and received  6.6 mg/kg  Plasminogen)  do not need to undergo Segme nt 
1 and can proceed directly to Segment  2. 
In Segment  2, repeated  doses  of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen  will be administered 
every second, third, or fourth day, depending on individual PK profile. 
Subjects  will receive  a range  of 21 to 42 doses  in Segment  2. 
The dosage and dosing interval in Segment 3 will be the same as Segment 
2, with the possibility of modification based on discussion between the 
Investigator and the sponsor.  
Inclusion criteria  1. Subject or legal guardian has provided informed consent (as well as 
assent by subjects with ages dictated by local Investigational Review 
Board [IRB]  guidelines).  
2. Subject  is male  or female  between  the ages of 2 and 80 years  (inclusive).  
3. Subject has a documented history of lesions and symptoms consistent  
with a diagnosis of hypoplasminogenemia.  
4. Subject has plasminogen activity level ≤ 45%.  
5. Subject has documented vaccination to hepatitis A virus (HAV) and 
hepatitis  B virus  (HBV),  or has received  the first dose of HAV and HBV 
vaccine prior to the first dose of IMP and is scheduled to receive the 
second vaccine dose. If subject has documented vaccination more than 
1 year before  screening  but has a negative  antibody titer to HAV and/or 
HBV at screening, subject is required to begin a re-vaccination series  
with the first dose of HAV and/or HBV vaccine prior to the first dose 
of IMP and is scheduled to receive the second vaccine dose. No 
revaccination is required if the documented vaccination took place 
within 1 year of screening.  
6. Subject  agrees  to use contraceptive  methods  from  screening  through 14 
days after last dose of study  treatment  (unless  documented as 
biologically or surgically sterile (e.g., postmenopausal, vasectomized), 
or has not reached reproductive  age.

laboratory grade  plasminogen, fresh frozen plasma, or Prometic  
Plasminogen (Human) within 2 weeks of the screening visit.  
8. Subject has a psychiatric disorder, other mental disorder, or any other 
medical disorder that impairs the subject’s ability to provide informed 
consent or to comply with the requirements of the study  protocol.  
9. Subject  has evidence  of renal  dysfunction defined as of > 2 X the upper 
limit of normal (ULN) in serum  creatinine.  
10. Subject has evidence of hepatic dysfunction defined as > 3 x ULN in 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  
11. Subjec t has participated  in another  IRB-approved interventional  clinical 
trial of a drug, biologic, or device within 30 days before the first dose

12. Subject has a chronic or acute clinically significant intercurrent illness 
(e.g., cardiac,  hepatic,  renal, endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, 
neoplastic, immunological, and skeletal) that the investigator 
determines could interfere with the assessments in this  study.  
Criteria of 
Evaluation  Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for plasminogen activity and plasminogen antigen levels using validated assays at a central laboratory.  
Segment 1  
Blood samples are drawn on Day - 4 before the IMP infusion to establish 
baseline levels for plasminoge n activity, antigen, and D -dimer and at the 
following time points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 
minutes,  6 hours  (± 30 minutes),  24 hours  (± 2 hours, Day -3), 48 hours  (± 
2 hours, Day -2), 72 hours  (± 2 hours, Day -1), and 96 hours  (± 2 hours,

 Day 0). An individual PK profile will be developed based on these time 
points. 
Subjects who have had individual PK profile for 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen 
with the sponsor, due to participation in the prior Phase 1 study, do not participate in Segment 1.  
Segment 2  
For subjects who do not undergo Segment 1, blood samples are drawn to 
measur e plasminogen activity  and antigen  levels  on Week  1, Day 0, before 
the first dose of the IMP is given, to establish the baseline  levels.  
For all subjects, blood samples will be drawn every 2 weeks before IMP 
infusion to measure trough levels through the final dose. 
A full PK profile will also be done for all subjects at the end of Segment 2 (Week  12 visit)  to evaluate the stability  of individual  PK profile  after 12 
weeks of IMP administration. As plasminogen is a consumable clotting 
factor, if significant lesion burden is present at the start of the study or if neutralizing antibody develops, a subject’s PK profile may be altered by 
the end of the 12-
week treatment period. At the Week 12 visit, blood 
samples are drawn before the IMP infusion and at the following time 
points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 minutes, 6 hours (± 
30 minutes), 24 hours (± 2 hours), 48 hours (± 2 hours), 72 hours (± 2 hours), and 96 hours  (± 2 hours, Day 0). The PK profile  will be developed 
for each subject and compared with his or her prior PK  profile(s).  
Furthermore, additional PK analyses may be performed at other time 
points during Segment 2 as ne eded, such as when a subject’s trough level 
or antibody test suggests the appearance of neutralizing antibody against the IMP.  
Segment 3  
Blood samples will be drawn at each study visit every 3 months before IMP infusion to measure trough levels. 
Efficacy:  
All subjects will be clinically evaluated by the investigator for the clinical 
manifestation and severity of hypoplasminogenemia. 
• Visible  lesions (ocular, gingival) will be evaluated using 
photographs. 
• Nonvisible lesions (e.g., ureteral, oropharyngeal, and bronchial) 
may be evaluated via imaging studies, such as computed 
tomography [CT] scans, X -ray, or other imaging techniques, as 
deemed appropriate by the Investigator.  
• Functionality of affected organs may be assessed as deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator. Respiratory tract involvement 
may be assessed by spirometry to measure forced vital  capacity

 (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak 
expiratory flow (PEF), and FEV1/FVC ratio.  
• Clinical Global Impression  scales  
• Quality of life  assessment  
Safety Assessments Physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be 
assessed at each study visit.  
Virology will be assessed  at Screening,  Baseline,  and every  12 weeks  during 
dosing and at Study Discontinuation which is 30 days after the final dose of 
the IMP. An archive sample for virology will be taken at Baseline.  
Immunogenicity testing will be assessed at Screening and every 4 weeks 
during Segment  2, every  12 weeks during Segment 3 and at Study 
Discontinuation which is 30 days after the final dose of the IMP.  
At each IMP infusion during Segments 1 and 2 Study Visits, the study 
personnel will assess AEs and vital signs. Subjects will be provided a diary 
to record AEs and infusions between visits.  
All treatment- emergent AEs and SAEs will be documented, including 
assessments of their severity and relatedness to the IMP.  
Laboratory abnormalities, physical examination findings, and vital sign 
abnormalities that are clinically significant, as judged by the investigator, will be reported as AEs.  
Statistical Methods  Analysis datasets  
Safety population:  Includes any subject who receives at least one dose of 
the IMP and provides safety data for at least one non- screening visit. 
PK population:  Includes  any subject  who has completed  Segment  2 dosing 
and have provided sufficient samples for PK  assessments.  
Full Analysis  Set (FAS) : Includes  any subject  who receives  at least 1 dose 
of the IMP and provided data for at least one post -baseline efficacy 
assessments.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The primary PK endpoint is the number and percentage of subjects who achiev
e the target plasminogen activity trough levels for at least 3 
measurements in 12 weeks during Segment 2. The target trough level is defined  as an increase in plasminogen activity  level  of at least an absolute 
10% (10 U/dL) from the subject’s individual baseline level. Baseline is defined  as the plasminogen activity  level  measured  before  the first dose of 
IMP at Segment 1, Day -
4 for subjects who undergo Segment 1 or at 
Segment 2, Day 0 for those who do directly enter Segment 2. Primary 
endpoint  success  is defined as at least 80% of evaluable subjects  (i.e., 8 or 
more) achieving the target trough levels for at least 3 measurements in  12 
weeks.

 The secondary PK endpoints include individual PK profiles at the end of 
Segment 2, compared with their PK profiles at baseline, and trough 
plasminogen activity  and antigen  levels  during Segment  2 and Segment  3. 
Plasminogen activity and antigen levels will be presented by individual 
subjects and summarized descriptively (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV], medium, 
minimum,  maximum,  geometric  mean  and associated  CV).  Individual  and 
median profiles of the concentration- time data will be plotted using 
nominal  times.  Median  profiles  may be presented  on both linear -linear  and 
linear -log scales.  
Standard  PK parameters,  including area under  the curve  (AUC),  clearance 
(CL), mea n residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (V d) and 
terminal half -life (t 1/2) will be calculated using non- compartmental 
analysis and baseline -adjusted plasminogen activity levels derived from 
Segment 1 data and, if a subject is suspected to develop ne utralizing 
antibody to the IMP,  plasminogen activity  levels  at the end of Segment  2. 
Additional PK compartmental analysis may be performed and best -fit 
model will be used for further individual PK prediction. 
D-dimer is monitored as a potential pharmacodynamic marker to better 
understand if there is a relationship between the levels of D -dimer in 
subjects over time and the subject’s potential response to therapy.  
Safety Analysis  
For analysis of safety and tolerability, TEAEs and SAEs will be 
summarized descriptively. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
biochemistry, urinalysis, fibrinolysis/coagulation) will be presented in 
summary  and shift tables.  The numbers  of subjects  who had changes  from 
baseline in viral tests and immunogenicity tests will be presented in 
individual subject listings and summary  tables.  
Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is:  
Overall clinical success in number and size of lesions as measured by  
photographic or other imaging modality depending on the organ 
system affected or change in affected organ functionality at 48 weeks  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are  
• Overall  clinical  success  in number  and size of lesions  as measured 
by photographic  or other  imaging modality  depending on the organ 
system affected or change in affected organ functionality at 12 
weeks  
• CGI scores at 12 and 48 weeks  
• Quality of life scores at 12 and 48 weeks

 Clinical success is considered achieved if 50% of subjects with visible or 
other measureable lesions demonstrate at least a 50% improvement in 
lesion number/size or functionality impact from baseline at 12 and/or 48 
weeks. Visible lesions are defined as le sions which can imaged and

 1 Introduction 
1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1  Overview of Hypoplasminogenemia  
 
Hypoplasminogenemia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to a variety of 
significant clinical manifestations primarily associated with fibrous depositions on mucous membranes  throughout  the body (Schott  et al., 1998). Plasminogen is a naturally  occurring protein 
that is synthesized by the liver and circulates in the blood. Plasminogen is activated to form plasmin, an enzymatic component of the fibrinolytic system and is the main enzyme involved in 
the lysis of clots  and clearance of extravasated  fibrin  (Collen  et al., 1991). Plasmin  is also involved 
in wound healing, cell migration, tissue remodeling, angiogenesis and embryogenesis (Castellino 
et al., 2005). 
Hypoplasminogenemia is a multisystem disease that can affect the eyes, ears, nasal and oral 
cavities,  sinuses,  tracheobronchial  tree, genitourinary tract,  gastrointestinal tract,  and gingiva.  The 
most common clinical manifestation of hypoplasminogenemia is ligneous conjunctivitis, which is 
characterized by thick, woody (ligneous) growths on the conjunctiva of the eye. If left untreated, ligneous  conjunctivitis  can lead to blindness.  Most  affected  cases  are infants  and children  showing 
their first clinical  manifestation  at a median  age of approximately 10 months  (Schuster  et al., 2007; 
Bateman et al ., 1986). Ligneous conjunctivitis is believed to be triggered by local infections, 
injury, irritation or inflammation, and various surgical interventions into the eye (Schuster et al., 
2003). 
In addition to ligneous conjunctivitis, hypoplasminogenemia can cause tracheobronchial lesions 
including abnormal  membranes  with poor pulmonary toilette  that can result  in chronic  obstruction 
of the affected pulmonary segment or even respiratory failure. H ydrocephalus occurs in 
approximately 10% of children with severe hypoplasminogenemia, apparently related to the 
deposition of fibrin in the cerebral ventricular system; treatment may require implantation of a 
shunt which can be complicated by repeated occl usions and may lead to death. Severely impaired 
skin- wound healing has also been reported (Schott et al ., 1998).  
Hypoplasminogenemia  is listed  as a rare disease by the National  Institutes  of Health  (NIH) Office 
of Rare Diseases Research. Prevalence for hypoplasminogenemia is estimated at approximately 
1.6 per 1,000,000 (Tefs et al ., 2006). 
1.1.2  Current Treatment for  Hypoplasminogenemia  
There are 2 forms of plasminogen: Glu and Lys. Most literature references of  plasminogen 
replacement therapy are based on the Lys form; it is important to note the Prometic plasminogen 
IND Number: 16186  
Protocol Number: 2002C011G  Prometic Biotherapeutics  Inc. 
Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous

Confidential   
 is the Glu form,  which  has a longer  half-life (approximately  2.5 days in healthy  subjects)  than Lys- 
plasminogen (0.8 days) (Collen e t al., 1991; Claeys et al ., 1973). 
Attempted treatments for ligneous conjunctivitis lesions include: surgical removal; high dose 
intravenous corticosteroid treatment; topical treatment with heparin, corticosteroids and alpha - 
chymotrypsin, or cyclosporine;  azathioprine; and hyaluronidase. These treatments are not 
consistently or completely successful in either the treatment or the prevention of lesion regrowth (Schuster  et al., 2007;  DeCock  et al., 1995;  Silva  et al., 2006;  Rubin et al., 1991). After  treatment, 
including surgical removal, the lesions will usually recur. Local administration of fresh frozen 
plasma (which contains plasminogen) and other plasminogen- containing eye drops, however, has 
shown effectiveness in treating eye lesions of ligneous  conjunctivitis (Heidemann et al ., 2003). 
Furthermore, continued topical administration of plasminogen- containing eye drops can treat the 
lesion and prevent regrowth. Other research shows that systemic administration of plasminogen concentrates results in partial resolution of the lesions (Schott et al., 1998; Kraft et al., 2000). A 
6-month- old child treated with Lys -plasminogen preparation as a continuous infusion and later as 
daily bolus injections led to complete regression of ligneous conjunctivitis wit hin 4 weeks and 
normalized hyperviscous secretions in the respiratory tract as well as skin wound healing (Schott et al., 1998). Currently, there is no plasminogen replacement product approved for the treatment 
of plasminogen deficiency in the  US. 
1.2 Pre-clinical Experience with  Plasminogen  
 
A literature review revealed the following information regarding work done in plasminogen deficient animal models. Bugge et al. (1995) generated the first plasminogen- deficient 
homozygous ( PLG 
-/-) knockout mouse model to study the physiological role of plasminogen in 
development, hemostasis,  and reproduction. The PLG  -/- mice  completed  embryonic  development, 
survived to adulthood and were fertile. However, the PLG -/- mice were predisposed to severe 
thrombosis, and young a nimals exhibited thrombotic lesions in the liver, stomach, rectum, lungs, 
pancreas and other tissues. Further histological examination of the mice between 5 and 21 weeks 
old revealed formation of fibrin deposits in the liver and ulcerated lesions in the ga strointestinal 
tract compared to controls. The authors concluded that plasminogen plays a critical role in 
fibrinolysis and hemostasis.  
Ploplis et al. (1995) also generated homozygous knockout mice to investigate the effects of 
plasminogen disruption on thrombosis, growth, viability, and fertility in mice. Plasminogen-  
deficient mice survived embryonic development but developed spontaneous fibrin deposit ion due 
to impaired thrombolysis, suffered retarded growth (weighing significantly less than control and heterozygous knockouts), and had reduced fertility and survival. Approximately 20% of the homozygous Pg
-/- mice developed rectal prolapse. Histological  examination revealed fibrin 
deposits in the liver, lungs, and stomach, associated with gastric ulcers in 6 to 12 weeks old Pg-/-

Confidential   
 mice, but not in the controls or heterozygous littermates. These PLG -/- mice displayed a reduced 
capacity to di ssolve spontaneous pulmonary plasma clots within 24 hours. Thus, the most 
prominent phenotype of plasminogen- deficient mice appears to be related to fibrin homeostasis; 
some of the lesions, such as gastric ulcers, indicated that the plasminogen system may play a role 
in the prevention and/or healing of tissue damage.  
Bugge et al. (1996) also investigated the effects of combined homozygous plasminogen and 
fibrinogen deficiencies in mice by interbreeding of lines carrying disrupted plasminogen and 
fibrinogen- binding protein ( FIB) genes. The double -deficient mice ( PLG -/- and FIB-/-) exhibited 
similar phenotypic survival patterns to control animals. These results demonstrate that the lack of 
fibrinogen prevents animals from early morbidity and premature death associated with a PLG -/- 
deficiency.  The authors  concluded that the fundam ental,  and possibly only, essential  physiological 
role of plasminogen is  fibrinolysis. 
Lijnen et al. (1996) administered bolus injections of purified mouse plasminogen to PLG -/- mice 
and showed that the levels of plasminogen antigen and activity were incr eased to normal levels. 
Moreover, plasminogen  administration  was associated  with significant  restoration  of thrombolytic 
potential and markedly reduced fibrin deposition in the liver after 24 hours of  treatment.  
These studies in the plasminogen knockout mi ce (PLG /-) confirm the fundamental role of 
plasminogen in fibrinolysis  and help establish  the scientific  understanding of the symptoms/lesions 
associated with plasminogen deficiency in humans. However, systemic administration of human plasminogen to plasminogen knockout  mice  would result  in the development  of cross -species  anti- 
human antibodies  in mice,  making the mouse  model  impractical  for studying the pharmacology of 
human plasminogen. No other suitable animal models for studying systemic treatment of 
plasminogen deficiency have yet been identified.  
1.3 Clinical Experience with  Plasminogen  
 
Prometic Biotherapeutics, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the sponsor), is developing Plasminogen 
(Human) Intravenous Lyophilized Solution (the investigational medicinal product [IMP]), for the treatment  of hypoplasminogenemia. The IMP is derived from  pooled plasma  donated by US blood 
donors and has undergone multiple steps of viral testing and inactivation.  
The clinical development program for Plasminogen (Human) in subjects with hypoplasminogenemia  consists of a completed  Phase  1, single -ascending -dose study in adolescent 
and ad ult subjects (2002C005G), an ongoing pivotal Phase 2/3 repeat dose study in pediatric and 
adult subjects (2002C011G), and supportive data from 3 ongoing single -subject, repeat -dose, 
Expanded Access studies (2002C013G, 2002C016G, and 2002C017G). In the Phas e 1 study 
2002C005G, 5 subjects received a single IV infusion of Plasminogen (2 mg/kg) and 7 subjects received a single IV infusion of Plasminogen (6.0 mg/kg). Both doses were well  tolerated.

In addition to the Phase 1 study, Prometic provided Plasminogen to an infant with 
hypoplasminogenemia in Germany on the compassionate -use basis. Prometic was contacted by a 
German physician who made a request to obtain Plasminogen for a patient. The patient is a 22 - 
month- old child with hypoplasminogenemia. Within 2 weeks after birth, he presented with 
problems  with his eyes and respiratory  tract and was diagnosed with hypoplasminogenemia. From 
then onward, he has been through various treatments, including surgery in combination with antibiotics, and other medications. He had also received fresh frozen plasma infusions as part of 
his treatment. When Prometic was contacted, the patient was in critical condition in a pediatric ICU receiving ventilatory and cir culatory support. He had a collapsed left lung and right lower 
lobe related to viscous bronchial secretions and to obstructing ligneous lesions in the bronchial 
tree. On 15 September 2015, the physician gave an initial dose of 4 mg/kg the IMP, which was 
increased to 6 mg/kg and then 6.5 mg/kg every second day. The patient was extubated within a 
matter of days. To date, no adverse events (AEs) associated with administration of Plasminogen have been observed.  
In the current study, an interim analysis was perf ormed after the first 10 subjects completed 12 
weeks of treatment with a data cutoff at 30 November 2016. All 10 of these subjects achieved target PK trough levels demonstrating the ability of Prometic’s Plasminogen (Human) to serve as effective replacemen t therapy. Preliminary efficacy evaluation at 12 weeks revealed that 13 of 14 
visible lesions had resolved, and the remaining lesion had improved from 15 × 5 mm at baseline to too small to be measured at 12 weeks. There were no recurrences and no new lesions during 
this period of observation. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug. The most frequent AEs were headache and 
nasopharyngitis. Nausea, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, 
and hematuria were also frequent in adult subjects, and upper abdominal pain and cough were frequent AEs in pediatric subjects. A US Biologics Licensing Application was submitted based 
on these interim data; this application is und er review. As of 14Dec2017 study enrollment is 
complete and all 15 enrolled subjects received at least 48 weeks of treatment. Three subjects in 
Norway completed the study as planned, with the remaining 12 subjects in the US continuing treatment until produ ct licensing or study termination by the Sponsor. However, due to the delay 
in product approval, subjects at the US site will be allowed to enroll in Treatment Protocol 2002C018G and continue ongoing IMP treatment without any break in treatment. If subject s 
decide to enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will return to the study site and complete the End of Study visit and sign an informed consent/assent for that study and stop 
participation in the current study. If subjects decide to not enter Trea tment Protocol  2002C018G,

 then they will stop IMP and return to the study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the 
final IMP dose. 
Subject dosing has been revised throughout the protocol from 6.0 mg/kg to 6.6 mg/kg of 
plasminogen t o reflect the true concentration and dosing as agreed with FDA during the 
05Oct2016 Pre -BLA Meeting (CRMTS# 10393). 
Details of these studies can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
1.4 Benefit Versus Risk and Study Rationale  
 
The prognosis of hypopla sminogenemia is variable depending on the extent, location(s), length, 
and site of the lesions. A number of patients have died or have suffered loss of affected organ 
functions, such as sight and dentition, as a result of hypoplasminogenemia (Mehta and Sha piro, 
2008). The one clearly  documented  effective  therapy that leads  to resolution  and halts  re-formation 
of ophthalmologic lesions is systemic or topical plasminogen concentrates (Heidemann et al ., 
2003;  Watts  et al., 2002;  Pergantou et al., 2011;  Tabarra  et al., 2004). There is no effective licensed 
local or systemic plasminogen replacement ther apy available for  hypoplasminogenemia. 
Prometic is developing purified human plasminogen as replacement therapy from its proprietary 
PPPS plasma  fractionation  process  for the systemic  treatment  of hypoplasminogenemia. This rare 
disease represents  an area of unmet  medical  need,  where optimal treatment  is likely  to be systemic 
replacement of plasminogen to reduce or resolve the clinical manifestations in patients and to prevent  or suppress  lesion  recurrence.  Prior to generation  of this material  by Prome tic, no purified 
Glu-plasminogen has been available for evaluation in plasminogen deficient subjects. We 
hypothesize based on pharmacokinetic data in the Phase 1 study using Glu- plasminogen that a 
trough level of >10% plasminogen activity above baseline is  achievable with every other day or 
every third day dosing. Potential clinical benefit will be assessed during Segment 2 and Segment 3 to monitor and correlate plasminogen replacement therapy with clinical response in visibly 
evident lesions. 
In support of this strategy, results from a case study indicate the benefit of repeat dosing as 
demonstrated in a named patient in Germany treated with Prometic’s plasminogen. The 
plasminogen deficient subject had a collapsed left lung and right lower lobe  related to viscous 
bronchial secretions and to obstructing ligneous lesions in the bronchial tree. Pharmacokinetic results for this subject showed that the trough values 10% above baseline were achieved with the 
current dosing regimen. The subject was ext ubated within a matter of days of administration of 
intravenous  Plasminogen (Human).  To date,  no adverse events  have  been  observed associated  with 
administration of Plasminogen (Human) in this  subject.  
This is a Phase 2/3 pivotal study of Prometic Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous Lyophilized 
solution.

Confidential   
 As the IMP is derived  from  pooled plasma,  there are potential  safety  risks  associated  with the IMP, 
including a  low inherent  risk of transmiss ion of  blood- borne  pathogens.  These are unlikely, given 
current viral donor testing and robust virus elimination/inactivation processes performed during 
manufacturing. The IMP was well tolerated in the Phase 1 single -dose study at 2 mg/kg and 6 
mg/kg. 
Addi tionally, there is a risk that subjects will develop antibodies to exogenous plasminogen since 
plasminogen deficiency  is a heterogeneous  disease  with a variety  of genetic mutations  resulting  in 
altered plasminogen protein. It is unknown if such antibodies will be neutralizing and perhaps 
interfere with the efficacy of Plasminogen (Human). The effects of potential neutralizing antibodies will be assessed during the  study. 
Given the absence of effective licensed treatment for hypoplasminogenemia, the potential 
benefits of this study to the affected population and study participants outweigh the risk of their participation.  
1.5 Dose  Rationale  
 
A successful outcome for this study is defined as achieving a trough level of plasminogen that is 
at least 10%  above  the subject’s  baseline  level  for at  least 3 measurements  during the 12 weeks  of 
treatment  in Segment  2. Table 1 shows  the results  of a single  IV infusion of Plasminogen 6 mg/kg, 
in the 5 adult subj ects in Cohort 2 of the Phase 1 study. Red highlighted cells indicate when a 
trough level less than 10% above the baseline level was obtained at 72 or 96 hours, while orange cells indicate  a value  exceeding  but close to the desired  >10%  level.  All subjects  achieved  a trough 
level at 48 hours above the 10% level over baseline. These data are used to establish the dosing regimens in this Phase 2/3 study. For example, if Subjects 2, 6 and 7 were to enter the Phase 2/3 study, they would require dosing e very second day to routinely avoid a trough level <10% above 
baseline, while Subjects 1 and 8 would require dosing every 3 days. This data may be augmented by PK modeling of repeat dosing to aid the investigator with the selection of the appropriate dose for the  subject.  
Therefore, subjects who enter the Phase 2/3 study will be commenced on an initial regimen of  
6.6 mg/kg every 2, 3, or 4 days, with the decision based on each subject’s individual known PK profile if they have been dosed in Cohort 2 at 6 mg/kg in the Phase 1 study. New subjects will undergo a PK study (Segment 1) with blood samples taken up to 96 hours after injection and will be started on an every -third -day dosing regimen at 6.6 mg/kg until their individual PK results are 
available,  at which  time dosing will tailored  accordingly  (Section  3.2). A change  in dosing interval 
to provide an increase or decrease in the trough levels may be required at the discretion of the principal investigator (PI) and the Sponsor, based on the actual results in each individual  patient.

At the end of Segment 2, subjects will be asked to participate in long- term therapy in Segment 3, 
if this is deemed appropriate by the Investigator, Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), and 
Sponsor. Plasminogen deficiency is a life -long disorder, and continued plasminogen replacement 
therapy to suppress lesion development and/or worsening disease is likely necessary for patients with a history of frequent or recurrent lesions.

2 Study  Objectives 
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
• To achieve an increase of individual trough plasminogen activity by at least an absolute 
10% (i.e., 10 U/dL) from baseline in adult and pediatric subjects with hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of plasminogen replacement therapy in Segment 2;  and 
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or 
visible symptoms of hypoplasminogenemia during the 48 weeks of dosing in Segments 2 and 3. 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of plasminogen replacement therapy during the 48 
weeks of dosing;  and 
• To evaluate the efficacy of plasminogen replacement therapy on clinically evident or 
visible symptoms o f hypoplasminogenemia during the 12 weeks of dosing in Segment 2; 
and 
• To evaluate the effect of plasminogen replacement therapy on pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity during the 48 weeks of  dosing.
 
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 Overall Study  Design  
 
Approximately 15 subje cts aged 2 to 80 years with hypoplasminogenemia will be enrolled to 
ensure a sample size of at least 10 PK -evaluable subjects. At least 2 pediatric subjects, aged 2 to 
18 years, will be enrolled. An evaluable subject for PK is defined as a subject who completes 
Segment 2 of plasminogen replacement therapy (see below) of the study and provides at least 3 
blood samples to measure trough plasminogen activity levels. 
The study consists of a screening period and 3 segments as illustrated in Figure 1. Subjects who 
have  documented  individual  PK profiles  with the sponsor  (e.g.,  due to participation  in the previous 
Phase 1 study and received 6 mg/kg Plasminogen) do not need to undergo Segment 1 and can proceed directly to Segment  2.

Version 5 Page 28 of 75 
Confidential   
 Screening  
Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within a period of no more than 21 days before the 
start of dosing. Subjects will enter either Segment 1 or 2, depending on the availability of their 
prior individual PK profile. 
Segment 1  
For subjects undergoing Segment 1, each will receive a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen IV 
infusion on Day - 4. Blood samples for PK analysis will be drawn prior to infusion and 
subsequently through 96 hours after the infusion to establish individual PK profiles. The samp le 
drawn prior to infusion will be used to measure the subject’s baseline plasminogen activity and 
antigen as well as D-dimer levels. The last PK sample (96 hours post infusion) will be withdrawn 
on Week 1, Day 0, before the administration of the first dos e in Segment 2. The resulting PK 
profile will be used to determine each subject’s dosing interval in Segment 2. 
Segment 2  
Based on individual PK profiles, subjects will receive 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen IV infusion every 
second, third, or fourth day for 12 wee ks during Segment 2. Subjects will receive approximately 
21 to 42 doses in Segment 2. 
For subjects who do not participate in Segment 1 and directly enter Segment 2, baseline 
assessments will be conducted before  the first dose of Plasminogen IV infusion, including a blood 
sample to measure the baseline plasminogen activity and antigen as well as D -dimer levels. Their 
dosing interval will be every second, third, or fourth day, depending on each subject’s PK profile 
on file. 
Subjects  who have  gone  through Segm ent 1 will start with the every -third -day dosing interval  until 
their individual PK results become available. This initial dosing regimen is based upon the 
aggregate PK obtained from the Phase 1 study. Once each subject’s individual PK profile becomes 
available,  his or her dosing  interval  will be adjusted  to every second, third, or fourth  day accordingly.  
The first dose of Plasminogen  IV infusion in this segment  will be administered  at the study site on 
Week 1, Day 0. Subjects will visit the study sites every 4 weeks and receive the IMP infusion at the study site. The infusions between study visits can be administered at the study site or an 
ancillary site by study personnel or at the subject’s home by a home health nurse, by the subject 
(i.e., self -administration), or by a caregiver/family member (US subjects only). Subjects or 
caregivers may be trained for IMP administration as deemed appropriate by the Investigator (US 
subjects only). Subjects administering IMP at home (home administration in the US only) are not 
required to take vital signs with the infusion. Vi tals for home administration subjects will only be 
taken when the nurse draws trough levels (Week 2, 6, and 10) and when the subject returns to the site for visits  (Week  4, 8, and 12) and every  12 weeks  thereafter  in Segment  3. The final dose at

Confidential   
 the Week  12 visit (or at study discontinuation)  in Segment  2 must  be administered  at the study site 
to allow for a repeat PK  profile.  
Plasma samples will be drawn before IMP administration every 2 weeks to measure the trough 
levels of plasminogen activity and antigen and D -dimer. The samples will be obtained at each 
study visit at Weeks 4, 8 and 12 and by a home health nurse at Weeks 2, 6 and 10. Additional samples may be taken in addition if needed.  
Subjects will undergo clinical assessments of the disease at each study visit depending on the system and organ involvement of hypoplasminogenemia and the characteristics of lesions, 
including but not limited  to: photographic  measurements  of visible  lesions  (e.g., ocular, gingival), 
spirometry for subjects with pulmonary involvement, and imaging study of nonvisible lesions 
(e.g., oropharyngeal, ureteral, bronchial), as deemed appropriate by the  investigator. 
Safety assessments will include vital signs, physical examination,  clinical laboratory tests 
(hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinogen and coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential), AE assessments, virology, and immunogenicity. 
In addition, subjects  will be given a diary  to record infusions, symptoms,  concomitant  medications 
and AEs at home between  visits.  
At the end of Segment 2, subjects will have the option to participate in Segment 3. Subjects for 
whom there is no perceived or anticipated benefit from further dosing would not be enrolled in 
Segment 3 at the investigator’s discretion and based on discussion with the Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC, see Section 3.7) and the sponsor. 
Any subject who discontinues the study during or at the end of Segment 2 should return to the 
study site for a Safety Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose.  
Segment 3  
Subjects who participate in Segment 3 will continue to receive Plasminogen IV for an additional 
36 weeks in Norway and until product licensing or study termination by the s ponsor for subjects 
in the United States. The dose will be 6.6 mg/kg with the frequency determined during Segment 
2, with the option of modification based on clinical response and plasminogen trough levels. 
Subjects (or their caregivers) may be trained to self -administer the IMP at home if deemed 
appropriate by the Investigator. 
Subjects  will return  to the study sites  for assessments every  3 months  to monitor  subjects’  clinical 
status and plasminogen trough levels. Subjects will be given a diary to record the dates of IMP 
administration,  any AEs,  concomitant  medication  and other  relevant  information. Subjects  will be 
given instructions for how to document receipt of IMP and how to return all used IMP  vials.

 Subjects at the Norway site in Segment 3 should return to the study site for a Safety Follow -up 
visit 30 days after the final IMP dose. 
Due to the delay  in product  approval, subjects  at the US site in Segment  3 will be allowed  to enroll  in 
Treatment Protocol  2002C018G  and continue  ongoing IMP treatment  without  any break  in treatment. 
If subjects  decide  to enter  Treatment Protocol  2002C018G,  then they will return  to the study site and 
complete the End of Study visit and sign an informed consent/assent for that study and stop  
participation  in the current  study. If subjects  decide to not enter  Treatment  Protocol  2002C018G, then 
they will stop IMP and return  to the study  site for a Safety  Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP 
dose.

3.2 Treatment, Dosage, and  Duration 
 
In Segment 1, a single dose of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered to each subject. 
However, subjects who have documented individual PK profiles with the sponsor (e.g., due to particip ation in the previous Phase 1 study and received 6 mg/kg Plasminogen) do not need to 
undergo Segment 1 and can proceed directly to Segment 2. 
In Segment 2, repeated doses of 6.6 mg/kg Plasminogen will be administered every second, third, 
or fourth day, depending on individual subject’s PK profile. Individual dosing intervals will be 
determined by the longest time point that the subject’s plasminogen activity level remains 10% (absolute) above their baseline value. For example, if a subject’s plasminogen act ivity level 
remains above 10% (absolute %) above their baseline at 48 hours and their activity level at 72

 hours drops below 10% (absolute %) then that subject will be dosed every second day. Subjects 
will receive a range of 21 to 42 doses in Segment 2. 
The dosage and dosing interval in Segment 3 will be the same as Segment 2, with the possibility 
of modification based on discussion between the Investigator and the sponsor. In the event that a 
subject  does not achieve the  expected/optimum  clinical  response  by the completion  of Segment  2, 
the principal  investigator  may reduce the dosing interval  during Segment  3 by one day increments 
until the trough plasminogen activity level exceeds  45%.  
For each subject,  the estimated  duration of study participation  is no more  than 21 days for screening, 
4 days for Segment  1, 12 weeks  for Segment  2, and 40 weeks  (36 weeks  of treatment and 4 weeks  of 
safety follow -up) for Segment 3 for subjects in Norway. For those subjects in the United States who 
participate in Segment 3, it will be dependent on product approval and sponsor decision. A Safety 
Follow -up visit is required 30 days after the final IMP dose. However, due to the delay in product 
approval, subjects at the US site will be allowed to enroll in Treatment Protocol 2002C018G and  
continue  ongoing IMP treatment without  any break  in treatment.  If subjects  decide  to enter  Treatment 
Protocol 2002C018G, then they will return to the study site and complete the End of Study visit and 
sign an informed consent/assent for that study and stop participation in the current study. If subjects 
decide to not ent er Treatment Protocol 2002C018G, then they will stop IMP and return to the study 
site for a Safety  Follow -up visit 30 days after the final IMP dose.

d. Women with child -bearing potential  only.  
e. Genetic test for hypoplasminogenemia is optional. Subjects who already have known test results or who do not 
wish to participate can omit the  test. 
f. See Section 3.5.2.6 for PK sampling time  points.  
g. The types and timing of clinical assessments depend on each subject’s disease presentation and include but are 
not limited to: 1) measurement of visible lesions using photographs, 2) functionality tests (e.g., spirometry), 3) 
imaging of non- visible lesions (e.g., ureter al, oropharyngeal and bronchial) based on the investigator’s 
discretion. See Section 3.5.2.13 for  details.  
h. Vital signs  are taken  within  15 minutes  before  and 15 minutes  after each infusion  that takes  place at the study 
site and when a home health nurse is present during a  visit.  
i. At each study visit, the IMP is infused by study staff on site. Between study visits, the IMP is infused at the site or an ancillary site, or at home by a home health nurse or self -administered by the subject or a 
caregiver. See Section 3.2 for details. Subjects’ infusions window for both Segment 2 and Segment 3 is +/ - 
1 day. 
j. For subjects who participate in Segment 1, these baseline assessments are performed on Day - 4 only. For 
subjects  who do not participate  in Segment  1 and are directly  entering  Segment  2, these  baseline  assessments

3.5.2  Description of  Assessments 
 
Informed Consent/Assent  
Informed consent is a process that includes the signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) for 
all subjects. Assent will be required from subjects younger than 18 years with consent from their legally authorized representative according to state law. Patients should be approached according to site policies regarding confidentiality. Potential subjects should be informed about the study 
according to the requirements of International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP). The informed  consent process involves the investigator, and the subject should 
have the opportunity to discuss all aspects  of the study, ask questions, consider the ICF/assent  and 
statements, and provide an informed decision regarding any potential risks and any potential benefits. Both ICFs and assent, if applicable, must be signed prior to any study procedures being 
conducted. The informed consent/assent process continues throughout a subject’s participation in the study. Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study for any reason and at any time. A separate genetic testing consent will be required. 
Demographics  
Demographic information will be collected, including the subject’s date of birth, race, ethnicity, and sex. 
Medical History and Disease History and Symptoms  
A complete  medical  and surgical  history will be obtained. If the subject  is biologically  or surgic ally 
unable to reproduce offspring,  the reason  for sterility  should be recorded  as a diagnosis (males  and 
females).  
At least 1 year of documented general history are recorded.  
As part of the medical history assessment the investigator or designee will obtain a complete and 
detailed documented history regarding the progression of hypoplasminogenemia within at least 1 
year before screening, including any surgeries performed, other  treatments, and all symptoms of 
the disease (e.g., ligneous conjunctivitis). In addition, the investigator will interview the subject and record  any self-reported  lifetime  history and treatment  of the disease,  including the date when 
the disease was origi nally  diagnosed.

Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 43 of 75 
Confidential   
 Prior Medications and Treatments  
Documented  prior and current  medications  within  at least 1 year before screening  will be recorded, 
including non-prescription, prescription, herbal/natural,  blood products, and birth  control for males 
and females who are able to reproduce at the time of screening. Records will include dates of use, 
indications, routes, doses, and schedules as appropriate. Corresponding diagnoses will also be 
recorded in the medical history with dates o f diagnoses. 
Plasminogen Genetic Test  
Optional plasminogen genetic testing will be conducted at screening for those subjects who provide written informed consent form for genetic testing. A blood sample will be obtained, 
centrifuged, transferred to, and frozen in a cryovial and stored at - 20°C. Genetic testing will be 
conducted by a Central Laboratory using a validated method developed by Machaon. Please see Laboratory Manual  for more  details  on processing and shipping of blood samples.  The genetic test 
is not necessary if the subject has undergone genetic testing in the past and the test result is 
available.  
PK Analyses for Plasminogen Activity and Antigen Levels  
Blood samples will be drawn and analyzed for plasminogen activity and plasminogen antigen 
levels at a Central Laboratory using validated assays. Plasminogen activity is assessed with a 
chromogenic assay developed and validated at a central specialty laboratory. Plasminogen 
antigen levels are determined by ELISA (Cell Sciences) and validated at a central specialty laboratory. 
For each sample taken for Plasminogen activity and antigen testing in Segments 1, 2, 
and 3 a backup sample will also be taken and stored at the Central Laboratory facility in case of 
repeat testing requirements. No backup sample is needed at the End of Study visit for subjects 
who decide to enter the treatment protocol.  
Segment 1  
Blood samples are drawn on Day - 4 before the IMP infusion to establish baseline levels for 
plasminogen activity, antigen, and D -dimer and at the following time points after the end of the 
infusion: between  5 and 15 minutes,  6 hours (± 30 minutes),  24 hours (± 2 hours, Day -3), 48 hours 
(± 2 hours, Day - 2), 72 hours (± 2 hours, Day - 1), and 96 hours (± 2 hours, Day 0). An individual 
PK profile will be developed based on these time points. 
Subjects who have had individual PK profile for 6 mg/kg Plasminogen with the  sponsor, due to 
participation in the prior Phase 1 study, do not participate in Segment 1. 
Segment 2  
For subjects who do not undergo Segment 1, blood samples are drawn to measure plasminogen 
activity  and antigen  levels  on Week  1, Day 0, before  the first dose of the IMP is given, to establish 
the baseline levels.

Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 44 of 75 
Confidential   
 For all subjects,  blood samples  will be drawn  every  2 weeks  before IMP infusion to measure trough 
levels through the final dose.  
A full PK profile will also be done for all subjects at the end of Segment 2 (Week 12 visit) to 
evaluate the stability of individual PK profile after 12 weeks of IMP administration. As 
plasminogen is a consumable clotting factor, if significant lesion burden is present at the start of 
the study or if neutralizing antibody develops, a subject’s PK profile may be altered by the end of the 12- week treatment period. At the Week 12 visit, blood samples are drawn before the IMP 
infusion and at the following time points after the end of the infusion: between 5 and 15 minutes, 
6 hours (± 30 minutes), 24 hours (± 2 hours), 48 hours (± 2 hours), 72 hours (± 2 hours), and 96 
hours (± 2 hours). The PK profile  will be developed  for each subject  and compared  with his or her 
prior PK  profile(s).  
Furthermore, additional PK analyses may be performed at other time points during Segment 2 as 
needed, such as when a subject’s trough level or antibody test suggests the appearance of 
neutralizing antibody against the IMP or when the dosing frequency has changed. 
Segment 3  
Blood samples will be drawn at each study visit every 3 months before IMP infusion to measure 
trough levels. Plasminogen activity and antigen, D -dimer spot levels will be measured at the End 
of Study visit for subjects who decide to enter Treatment Protocol 2002C018G. 
PK Sample Handling:  
Blood samples  will be obtained, centrifuged, and resulting  plasma  will be transferred  to, and frozen 
in a cryovial and stored at - 20°C. All samples will be shipped frozen to a Central Laboratory for 
analysis. Details on processing and shipping of blood samples are provided in the Laboratory 
Manual.  
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
 
Specimens for laboratory analysis will be obtained to ascertain if the subject meets eligibility criteria  and to assess for abnormal changes  and possible  AEs during the study. The laboratory tests 
include hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, fibrinolysis and coagulation panels, and urine pregnancy test (as applicable). See Appendix 15.2 for a list of specific tests to be conducted. 
Abnormal laborator y results will be reviewed by the investigator. Clinically significant 
abnormalities or changes from baseline will be reported as AEs, according to the investigator’s 
judgment. However, changes that are associated with clinical improvement (for example, bl ood 
clot discharged in urine, increases in D- dimer) are not reported as AEs.  
Details of sample collection and shipping will be outlined in the Laboratory Manual provided by 
the Central Laboratory.

 Vital Signs  
 
Vital signs will be collected to include body temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and 
heart rate. In each subject, the same arm will be used to collect all blood pressure readings, and 
every attempt will be made to use the same equipment and investigator/designee at each visit.  
Physical Examination  
 
The investigator will perform a physical exam to include a gross neurological exam and major body systems. The exam will focus on systems and organs known to be affected by 
hypoplasminogenemia. 
Antibodies to Plasminogen 
 
A blood sample will be obtained, centrifuged, and resulting serum sample transferred to and frozen in a cryovial, stored at -20°C, and shipped frozen to a Central Laboratory for detection of anti-plasminogen antibodies. Testing for anti-plasminogen antibodies is performed by ELISA. If 
neutralizing antibodies are suspected based on the plasminogen activity levels, an assay for 
assessing binding versus non-binding antibodies will be implemented. Details on processing and 
shipping of blood samples are provided in the Laboratory manual. For each sample taken for 
Plasminogen a ntibody testing in Segments 1, 2, and 3 a backup sample will also be taken and 
stored at the Central Laboratory facility in case of repeat testing requirements. No ba ckup 
sample  is needed  at the End of Study visit for subjects  who decide to enter  the treatment protocol. 
 
 
Virology  
Screening serology testing will be conducted for HIV -1, HIV -2, HCV, HBV, HAV, and B19 
(Appendix 15.2). Provided the subject  meets  all inclusion/Exclusion criteria,  the subject  may begin 
IMP infusion in Segment 1 or 2 without waiting for the virology results. Retention samples for virology at baseline will be tested with  PCR.  
Subject Diary  
A diary will be provided to subjects during Segments 2 and 3 to record hypoplasminogenemia 
symptoms, IMP administration and any AEs between visits. The diary will be reviewed by the 
study personnel at each visit. Subjects will return the diary at the End of Study visit or Safety Follow- Up visit.  
Clinical Assessments 
All subjects will be clinically evaluated by the investigator for the clinical manifestation and severity of hypoplasminogenemia at the time points specified in the Schedule of Events table.

 Measurement of Visible Lesions  
The size (length and width) of visible  lesions, such as ocular and gingival lesions, in subjects  who 
have ligneous conjunctivitis will be measured and documented using photography at each visit. 
The procedure of photographic measurements is described in the Study Manual. 
Imaging 
Nonvisible lesions (ureteral, oropharyngeal, and bronchial) may be qualitatively evaluated as 
appropriate via imaging  studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scans,  X-ray, or other suitable 
imaging techniques at the Investigator’s discretion. For example, if there is lung involvement 
suspected,  lesions may be monitored via a CT scan obtained at Screening  (unless already  available 
within the past 6 months) and at the Week 12 visit, and at other time points if  warranted.  
Functionality Testing  
Spirometry may be performed in subjects who have respiratory tract involvement of 
hypoplasminogenemia, if deemed appropriate by the investigator. The spirometry will measure 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow 
(PEF),  and FEV1/FVC  ratio.  If applicable,  these tests may be performed  at Screening  and Baseline 
(before the first dose of IMP), and every 4 weeks subsequently. However, no testing beyond Baseline is warranted if the subject’s lung function is within normal limits at Screening and/or 
Baseline. Spirometry does not need to be repeated at Baseline if Screening is within 3 weeks of 
Baseline. Other functional tests appropriate for the affect ed organ system may be performed and 
analyzed as determined by the PI. 
Clinical Global Impression – Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale  
The Clinical Global Impression -Global Improvement (CGI -I) Scale is a single, clinician - 
completed scale designed to capture the clinician’s impression of the subject’s disease improvement over time (Appendix 15.3). Clinicians are asked to consider their experience in this patient population and rate the change relative to the subject’s state at baseline using a 7-point scale (1 = very much improved, 7 = very much worse). 
Quality of life assessment  
Subjects are asked to rate their overall quality of life using a 10-point scale (0 = non-functioning, 
10 = normal; Appendix 15.4), adapted from a scale developed by the American Chronic Pain 
Association.

 3.6 Stopping Rules and Withdrawal  
 
3.6.1  Study  Termination  
 
The sponsor and/or a principal investigator may elect to terminate the study early as defined by 
the clinical trial agreement.  
Any decision to voluntarily suspend or terminate a clinical trial will be carefully reviewed and fully justified. The  sponsor will notify the FDA and the IRB of any suspension or termination, 
along with justification for restarting or terminating the study as applicable. 
3.6.2  Stopping Rules  
 
Any subject who experiences any of the following occurrences will suspend the IMP tre atment 
until further assessments:  
• Anaphylactic response to study drug  administration  
• A significant AE that, in the investigator’s opinion, necessitates suspension of treatment  
• Confirmed  presence of neutralizing  antibodies  (in at least 2 measurements)  in association  with 
diminished  plasminogen  activity  that obviates  the potential  benefit  of plasminogen 
replacement  therapy.  
• Thrombotic or uncontrolled bleeding event requiring hospitalization  
The SMC will review safety data on an ongoing basi s and will determine if a subject should stop 
treatment, or if there are unforeseen events (e.g., thromboembolic event) that would warrant 
halting or stopping the study. Such events will be discussed with FDA before enrolling further 
subjects.  
3.6.3  Withdrawal a nd Replacement of  Subjects  
 
Subjects will be withdrawn for the following reasons:  
• The subject withdraws consent (no justification is required);  and/or  
• The subject develops a condition that in the investigator’s opinion makes it medically 
necessary that the subject not continue in the  study. 
After a discussion between the investigator and sponsor, subjects may be withdrawn for the 
following reasons:  
• An AE that in the investigator’s or sponsor’s opinion requires the subject be withdrawn from 
the study;  
• Violation of eligibility  criteria;  
• Major protocol violations or deviations from the treatment plan (e.g., incorrect IMP 
administration);

Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 48 of 75 
Confidential   
 • Lost to follow -up after all attempts at contacting the subject; and/or  
• Death.  
In all cases,  the reasons  for withdrawal  will be recorded  in the subject’s  source  documentation  and 
in the Case Report Form (eCRF). It is possible that some subjects may become lost to follow -up 
during the study. Every reasonable effort will be made to contact these subjects; all available 
efficacy and safety data co llected for these subjects will be used, even if incomplete. Subjects 
withdrawn from the study may be replaced so that there are at least 10 evaluable  subjects.  
Subjects  who do not meet  the entry  criteria at screening  will be ineligible  for treatment  and will be 
deemed screen failures. Subjects who are screen failed will not receive IMP; therefore, no PK or safety  data will be collected  for these subjects,  and only demographic  information  will be collected 
on the eCRF.  Subjects  who screen  fail will be considered  screened  but not enrolled.  A screen  failed 
subject may re- enter the study if they pass the re -screening. Only subjects who qualify for 
treatment will be  enrolled. 
3.7 Safety Monitoring  Committee  
 
The SMC is composed of the sponsor’s Medical Monitor and an independent Medical Monitor 
and will review the safety data (e.g., AE listings, laboratory data, vital sign data, trough levels) 
biweekly during Segments 1 and 2, as data become available. Formal meetings of the SMC will be convened if warranted based on data obtained at any time during Segments 1 and 2. Any AEs will be discussed between SMC members in an ongoing basis. The SMC will continue to review 
the safety data periodically during Segment 3. 
3.8 Subject  Identification  
 
Subjects will be identified by their initials and a numerical code in the database. All subjects who 
sign the ICF/assent  will receive a Subject  Identification  Number  according  to the following format: 
XX-YYY (site number -subject number) to be defined in a Study Manual. The anonymity of 
subjects will be maintained insofar as is required by law and to protect the subjects’ rights to 
privacy. Personally identifying information may only be obtained by the investigator or their 
designee to complete the requirements of the protocol and must be kept by the investigator in strictest confidence and may not be released unless required by law. See Section 11 for  additional 
information regarding confidential ly. 
3.9 Treatment  Compliance  
 
The IMP will be provided by the sponsor and delivered to participating sites. IMP administration 
will be performed  and recorded  by study personnel  or home  nurse,  or by subjects  or their caregivers 
trained in  self-administration.

Confidential   
 Subjects  will be given instructions  how to document  the receipt  of IMP and how to return  the used 
vials for accountability. The subjects will document IMP administration in the study diary. The 
study personnel will review the diary at each visit and document all doses used and missed in the CRF.  
3.10 Protocol  Deviations  
 
Every effort should be made to avoid deviations from the protocol during the conduct of the trial. When  protocol  deviations  do occur,  the Investigator  should promptly inform  the Monitor, and the 
implications of each deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Any deviation must be documented, stating  the reasons,  date,  actions  taken, and the impact  for the  subject  and/or  trial for 
each deviation. This documentation must be kept in the Sponsor Files and Investigator Files. In case of any major  protocol  deviati ons (i.e., violations), the investigator  and sponsor  will decide on 
the further participation of the affected subject, after having discussed all relevant aspects. Such deviations will be reported to the IRB by the site according to its local IRB requirements. 
Deviations  occurring  outside  of the study site, by vendors  will be  documented  by the Sponsor  and 
supplied to the site for IRB  submission.  
 
 
4 Restrictions  
4.1 Concomitant and Prohibited Medications  
 
The administration of concomitant medications, in accordance with the standard of care for 
subjects with hypoplasminogenemi a, is permitted during the study. Any medications (e.g., 
prescription and non- prescription medications, blood products, herbal/natural products) taken by 
the subject within 30 days prior to Visit 1 (Screening) and/or during the course of the study will be recorded in the eCRF, including the dates of use, reason for use, dose, and dosage/schedule.  
Any product containing plasminogen is not allowed from Screening to the end of the study.  
4.2 Other  Restrictions  
 
None.  
 
 
5 Reporting of Adverse  Events  
Adverse events will be recorded from the first dose of IMP administration through 30 days after administration of IMP and collected by observation and reporting. AEs will be elicited from subjects by asking questions regarding changes in the subject’s stat us at each visit.

 5.1 Definitions  
 
5.1.1  Adverse Event  
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether or not considered to have a causal 
relationship to IMP) in a study subject administered an IMP. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable  and uninte nded  sign (including clinically  significant  laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the  IMP.  
However,  signs  and observations  that are associated  with clinical  improvement  (such  as discharge 
of blood clots in urine), as judged by the investigator, will not be reported as  AEs.  
5.1.2  Adverse Drug  Reaction  
 
All noxious and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose should be considered ADRs. The phrase “responses to an IMP” means that  a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE 
is at least a reasonable possibility, that is, the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
5.1.3  Serious Adverse  Event  
 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death.  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred. 
This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or wa s allowed to 
continue, might have caused death).  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
drug) or  
• Is a medically important event or  reaction:  
Events that did not result in death or hospitalization but may, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, jeopardize the subject or require intervention, to prevent one of the outcomes in the 
definition of SAE listed above, should also be considered SAEs.  
5.1.4  Assessment of  Severity 
 
The severity of all AEs and SAEs must be assessed according to the following categories:  
• Mild  – The AE/SAE  is easily  tolerated  by the subject,  causes  minimal discomfort  and does not 
interfere with everyday activities; or  
• Moderate – The AE/SAE is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities; or  
IND Number: 16186  
Protocol Number: 2002C011G  Prometic Biotherapeutics  Inc. 
Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 51 of 75 
Confidential   
 • Severe – The AE/SAE prevents the subject from engaging in normal everyday activities.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of a specific event. The event itself may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). “Severe” is not the same as 
“serious”,  which  is defined on subject/event  outcome  or action  criteria usually  associated  with events 
that pose a threat to a subject/subject’s life or ability to carry out life functions. Seriousness is a 
medical term, while severity is a subjective term.  
5.1.5  Assessment of  Causality  
 
The following 4- point scale will be used by the investigator to rate the relationship of the adverse  
event to the IMP:  
• Definitely related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) occurring in a 
plausible  time relationship to IMP administration  and which  cannot  be explained  by concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) 
should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitively associated pharmacologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure, if necessary;  or 
• Probably related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(de-challenge). Re- challenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or 
• Possibly related: A clinical event (including laboratory test abnormality) with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, but which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other  drugs  or chemicals.  Information on drug withdrawal  may be lacking  or unclear; 
or 
• Not related: An event for which sufficient information exists to conclude that the etiology of 
the event is unrelated to the  IMP.  
The degree of certainty with which an AE or SAE is attributed to treatment with IMP (or alternative 
causes, e.g., natural history of underlying diseases, concomitant therapy) will be determined by how 
well the event can be understood with regard to one or more of the following:  
• Known pharmacology of the  IMP;  
• Reaction of similar nature being previously observed with this medication or class of 
medications; 
• The event having often been reported in literature for similar medications as related;  and/or  
• There is a temporal relationship between IMP administration and the  event.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for all available relevant information about the IMP.

Confidential   
 The investigators will assign causality at their respective sites during the study. The medical monitor 
responsible for the study will review the assigned causality for all AEs and SAEs prior to data-base 
lock. This assignment will be included in the study database and final study report.  
5.2 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse  Events  
 
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, AEs will be 
elicited using a standard non- leading question such as “ How have you been since the last visit / 
during the previous study period?” AEs will also be elicited through the use of Subject Diary 
cards,  which  the investigator  will review  in detail  with  the subject  at each  visit,  ensuring accuracy 
and completeness of entries recorded by the  subject. 
Any AE or ADR  occurring during the  study will be noted in detail  on the appropriate  pages  of the 
eCRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms, which represent a single syndrome or 
diagnosis, the latter  should be recorded  in the eCRF.  The investigator  will grade  the severity  of all 
AEs or ADRs  (mild,  moderate or severe),  the seriousness  (non- serious  or serious)  and relatedness, 
as defined in Section  5.1. 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated and 
followed- up, as needed. Diseases, signs and symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already 
existing  before  the first administration  of IMP are not considered  as AEs  when  observed  at a later 
stage unless they represent a worsening. 
The investigator  should always  provide  detailed  information  concerning  any abnormalities  and the 
nature  of, and reasons  for any necessary  action(s),  as well as any other  observations  or comments, 
which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the subjects’ AEs or  ADRs.  
5.3 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
All AEs must  be evaluated  as potential  serious  adverse events  (SAEs).  All AEs assessed  as serious 
must  be reported  beginning from  the time of first dose  of IMP  until 30 days post dose. SAEs  must 
be followed until the event  resolves,  the event  or sequelae stabilize,  or it is unlikely that additional 
information can be obtained after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up efforts (i.e., the 
subject or investigator is unable to provide additional information or, the subject is lost to follow - 
up). 
5.3.1  SAE Reporting to the  CRO  
 
All SAEs wil l be reported within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event to the 
Pharmacovigilance (PV) CRO Safety Department submitting the Safety Report 24/7 on the fax 
number below.

Confidential   
 Toll Free Fax Norway : 800-24-747. 
Full details of SAE reporting to the PV CRO will be defined in the Safety Management Plan. The 
telephone number for ITSI is 1- 888-784-2723 in US. Alternately any safety information can be 
sent via email to  Prometic_Safety@integratedtsi.com. 
It should be noted that reporting to the PV CRO Safety Department within 24 hours of awareness 
is required for all SAEs regardless of their causal relationship with the IMP.  
The PV CRO Safety Depar tment, together with the sponsor’s medical monitor, will review all 
safety information/documentation and follow up with the investigative site to obtain any other 
required information. Follow -up information should be actively sought by the investigator and  
reported to the PV CRO Safety Department as it becomes available using the Safety Report.  
The sponsor is responsible for reporting SAEs to IND/CTA under the oversight of the FDA and 
NMA (Norwegian Medicines Agency), respectively, as applicable.  
5.3.2  Institutional Review Board/Ethics  Committee  
 
All AEs will be  reported  to the IRB/EC according  to the guidelines  of the IRB/EC.  However,  as a 
general guideline, IRBs/EC need to know about any AEs that are unexpected or of a greater severity  than what  is reported  in the IB. Reporting is always  required  for all SAEs.  Any new safety 
data (or other finding) that might affect an IRB/EC’s judgments regarding their risks versus 
benefits analysis should always be reported to the IRB/EC. The sponsor and the CRA will assist 
the investigator in determining which events require reporting and in what  timeframes.  
5.3.3  Expedited SUSAR Reporting (Sponsor  Responsibility)  
 
The sponsor will submit a written IND Safety Report (i.e., completed FDA Form 3500A and/or 
CIOMS form) within 15 calendar days of receipt to the responsible review division of the FDA and 
the Norwegian Medicines Agency, as required, for any observed or volunteered SAE that  is: 
1) Suspected to be associated with the investigational drug or study treatment(s); and  
2) Unexpected.  
Any SUSARs that will be filed to the IND for the purpos e of notifying FDA, and will be filed 
electronically via EudraVigilance for the purpose of notifying the Norwegian Medicines Agency.  
In addition,  if the event  is fatal or life-threatening  and meets  the above  criteria,  a telephone  or facsimile 
notification will be sent to the FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor’s initial receipt, followed by a completed FDA Form 3500A within 15 calendar days after 
initial receipt.  
Each IND Safety Report will be prominently labeled “IN D Safety Report,” and a copy will be 
provided to all participating site investigators.

Confidential   
 For each written IND Safety Report, the sponsor will identify all previously submitted IND Safety 
Reports that addressed a similar adverse event experience and will provide an analysis of the 
significance of the newly reported adverse event in light of the previous, similar report(s).  
If the results of the sponsor’s follow -up investigation show that an adverse event that was initially 
determined to not require a written IND Safety Report does, in fact, meet the requirements for 
reporting, the sponsor will submit a written IND Safety Report as soon as possible, but in no event 
later than 15 calendar days after the determination was made.  
Follow -up information to an IND Safety Report will be submitted to the applicable review division 
of the FDA as soon as the relevant information is available.  
5.4 Pregnancy  
 
Every effort must be made to avoid a pregnancy during the trial. Contraception should be used in 
accordance with Inclusion Criterion #6, and the techniques discussed at Screening should preferably not be changed during the course of the trial. A pregnancy test will be performed at 
Screening and at each study visit.  
In case a subject  becomes  pregnant  during the trial, she has to be withdrawn. Pregnancies  occurring 
during the study after exposure to the IMP need to be reported. The pregnancy notification form 
has to be sent to the CRO  Safety  Department.  Follow -up information  on the outcome  of both mother 
and fetus must also be reported. 
5.5 Procedure for Breaking the  Blind  
 
This is not a blinded study. 
5.6 Follow -up of Adverse  Events  
 
The responsible investigator will follow up each AE until it is resolved or until the medical condition of the patient has returned to baseline, and all relevant follow -up information has been 
reported to the sponsor.  
 
 
6 Statistical  Analysis  
6.1 Datasets for  Analysis  
 
Safety population:  Includes any subject who receives at least one dose of the IMP and provides 
safety data for at least one non -screening visit.

 Full Analysis  Set (FAS) : Includes  any subject  who receives  at least 1 dose of the IMP and provided 
data for at least one post -baseline efficacy  assessments.  
6.2 Handling of Missing Data  
 
No missing data will be imputed. Missing plasminogen activity or antigen data will be ignored in 
the calculation of PK parameters.  
6.3 Analyses Plan  
 
Details will be provided in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before the database lock.  
6.3.1  Demographics and Baseline  Characteristics  
 
Subjects’ demographic and baseline clinical characteristics will be summarized descriptively. Continuous variables will be presented as mean, standard deviation, median, and range. 
Categorical parameters will b e presented as numbers and percentages.  
6.3.2  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic  Analysis  
 
The primary endpoint is the number and percentage of subjects who achieve the target 
plasminogen activity trough levels for at least 3 measurements in 12 weeks during Segment  2. 
Primary  endpoint  success  is defined  as at least 80% of evaluable subjects  (i.e., 8 or more)  achieving 
the target  trough levels  for at least 3 measurements  in 12 weeks.  The target  trough level  is defined 
as an increase in plasminogen activity level of at least an absolute 10% (10 U/dL) from the subject’s  individual  baseline level.  Baseline is defined  as the plasminogen activity  level  measured 
before the first dose of IMP at Segment 1, Day - 4 for su bjects who undergo Segment 1 or at 
Segment 2, Day 0 for those who do directly enter Segment  2. 
The secondary PK endpoints include individual PK profiles at the end of Segment 2, compared with their PK profiles at baseline, and trough plasminogen activity a nd antigen levels during 
Segment 2 and Segment 3. 
Plasminogen activity and antigen levels will be presented by individual subjects and summarized 
descriptively (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of variation [CV], 
medium, minimum, maximum, geometric mean and associated CV). In dividual and median 
profiles of the concentration- time data will be plotted using nominal times. Median profiles may 
be presented on both linear -linear and linear -log scales.  
Standard PK parameters, including area under the curve (AUC), clearance (CL), mean residence 
time (MRT), volume of distribution (V
d) and terminal half -life (t 1/2) will be calculated using non-  
compartmental analysis and baseline- adjusted plasminogen activity levels derived from Segment

 1 data and, if a subject is suspecte d to develop neutralizing antibody to the IMP, plasminogen 
activity levels at the end of Segment 2. 
Additional PK compartmental analysis may be performed and best -fit model will be used for 
further individual PK prediction. 
The summary statistics will include the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum. The PK parameters will be summarized with the geometric mean and 95% confidence interval around the geometric mean 
D-dimer is monitored as a potential pharmacodynamic marke r to better understand if there is a 
relationship between the levels of D -dimer in subjects over time and the subject’s potential 
response to therapy.  
6.3.3  Efficacy Analysis 
 
The primary endpoint is:  
Overall Clinical Success in number and size of lesions or change in organ functionality at 48 
weeks  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• Overall Clinical Success in number and size of lesions or change in organ functionality at 12 weeks  
• CGI scores at 12 and 48 weeks  
• Quality of life scores at 12 and 48 weeks  
Overall clinical success is defined as 50% of subjects with visible or other measureable lesions 
achieving  at least a 50% improvement  in lesion  number/size  or functionality impact  from  baseline. 
Visible lesions are defined as lesions which can imaged and analyzed with digital photography. 
Other measureable lesions are defined as lesions whose dimensions can be assessed by medical 
imaging studies (e.g. computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, etc) or 
functional assessments (e.g. spirometry, audiogram, oximetry, etc).  
Clinical success will be further described as a graded evaluation of potential clinical responses;  
1) Excellent response: > 75% decrease; 2) Good response : > 50% and < 75% reduction; 3) 
Moderate response: >  25% to < 50% reduction; 4) Minimal response: < 25% reduction; 5) No 
response: an increase or no reduction in the size of the lesion. Clinical responses will determined 
by the principal investigator for t he assessment of clinical success.  
All efficacy results will be presented descriptively by individual subjects, including summarized 
hypoplasminogenemia  symptoms  over time recorded  in subject  diaries.  The small sample  size and 
high variability of disease presentation do not allow formal statistical analyses.

6.3.4  Safety  Analysis  
 
For safety analyses, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs will be summarized 
descriptively. Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, fibrinolysis/coagulation) will be presented in summary and shift tables. The numbers of subjects 
who had changes from baseline in viral tests and immunogenicity tests will be presented in 
individual subject listings and summary tables.  
6.4 Sample  Size 
 
Approximately 15 subjects with hypoplasminogenemia will be enrolled in this study to achieve  at 
least 10 evaluable subjects. No formal calculation was made for sample size because of the rarity 
of the disease. The sample size is based on known patients who have  hypoplasminogenemia.  
6.5 Interim  Analysis  
 
The data in this study will be conducted in sta ges. An initial analysis of the PK data will be 
conducted when at least 10 subjects have completed Segment 2 dosing and have provided 
sufficient samples for PK assessments. The second data analysis will be conducted when all subjects have either completed the Week 48 visit or have withdrawn consent and completed the 
final safety visit. The final data analysis will occur when all subjects have completed the final 
safety visit or remain in the study in Segment 3 (US subjects only). Additional details for thes e 
analyses will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

 7.4 Shipment, Returns, and Destruction  
 
IMP will be shipped  from  Prometic  Biotherapeutics  to a selected  Central  Drug  Repository (one  in 
the US and one in Norway). The Central Drug Repositories will ship IMP to the sites and/or 
directly to subjects’ homes or treating study nurse office location. Details regarding the drug shipping and receipt will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual which will include detailed 
instructions  for subjects  covering the receipt,  storage, preparation  of IMP as well as return  of used 
and unused vials.  Inventory should be  entered  into the IMP  Drug  Accountability  Log at the Study 
site. At the end of the trial, or upon request  of the sponsor, all unused,  partially  used or empty  IMP 
containers will be returned to Prometic Biotherapeutics or the CRO or destroyed at the site after 
accountability has been completed by the  Monitor. 
7.5 Preparation  
 
IMP infusions  should be prepared  by a pharmacist  or a qualified  designee  (subjects  will be trained 
by site personnel for home preparation and infusion). 
IMP must  be removed  from  refrigerated  storage and brought  to room  temperature for reconstitution 
with 12.5 mL of Water for Injection using sterile technique. The IMP should be reconstituted by 
addition of water slowly with swirling until dissolved. After reconstitution, the plasminogen solution should be colorless and clear to slightly opalescent. Reconstituted plasminogen must be used within 3 hours after  reconstitution. 
Please see the Pharmacy Manual for complete details regarding drug reconstitution.  
7.6 Administration 
 
Only eligible and enrolled subjects will receive IMP. The entire dose of the Plasminogen IV solution should be  calculated  on the  basis  of each  subject’s  body weight  and infused over  a period 
of 10 to 30 minutes. IMP will be administered using a syringe with filter or disk filter according to 
the instructions in the Pharmacy  Manual.  
 
 
8 Records  Management  
8.1 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory 
inspection(s), providing direct access to source data and documents.  
The investigator or designee must record study participation details including enrollment, safety, and efficacy information for each subject onto source documents. The investigator is responsible for mai ntaining complete and adequate case histories in the source records of each subject.

Confidential   
 Source  data must  be preserved  for the maximum period of time permitted  by local  regulations  and 
made available by the investigator in the cases described  above. 
8.2 Data Collection and  Management  
 
Data generated as per protocol will be entered onto the eCRF in accordance with the ICH Topic 
E6 (R1) Guidelines for GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95). When the eCRFs have been completed, a 
monitor, with the assistance of the study site coordinator, will verify the source documentation 
records and review the data.  
Subsequent electronic review of the data may result in queries being generated that will be forwarded simultaneously to the appropriate investigator or designee and the CRO appointed for 
the study for prompt resolution. Resolutions will be sent back to Data Management in a timely 
fashion. All data modifications  resulting  from  review  or querying  of the data will be electronically 
tracked.  
Any errors detected by either the CRA or the investigator after query resolution should be 
communicated  via eCRF  data change forms.  In all cases,  an investigator  or designee  signature  will 
be required.  
Coding of AEs and SAEs will be performed automatically  by the Data Management using the 
MedDRA dictionary. Similarly, coding of all medications will occur using the WHO Drug Dictionary.  
The medical monitor or designee will perform a periodic medical review of the coding and of the 
AE profile.  
8.3 Record  Keeping  
 
The investigator is responsible for maintaining all records pertaining to the clinical trial and for ensuring complete and accurate documentation.  
The investigator is responsible for maintaining a subject identification log. This confidential subject ident ification log provides the link between named subject source records in the subject 
file and anonymous eCRF data provided to the sponsor. 
The sponsor requires that each investigator retain records (all regulatory documents such as the 
protocol, study approval letters, all eCRFs, drug dispensing and accountability logs, all original 
subject consent forms, and all correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study) for a period of no less than 2 years from the date of final regulatory approval or as per local regulations, whichever  is longer. If the  study is discontinued, or  if no application/license  is to be filed  or if the 
application/license  is not approved for such indication, records  should be retained  for 7 years  after 
the investigation is discontinued or as per local regulations, whichever is  longer.

Confidential   
 In all instances, it is prohibited for study documents to be destroyed without prior written 
agreement between the investigator and the sponsor. If the investigator wishes to assign the study 
records  to another  party, or move  them  to another  location, the sponsor  must  be notified  in writing.  
9 Quality Control and Quality  Assurance  
9.1 Quality Control by the Monitoring Team  
 
The Clinical Research  Associates  (CRA)  will monitor  the data collected  throughout  the study thus 
providing Quality Control (QC) of the study. Independent monitoring of the clinical study for 
protocol  and GCP  compliance  will be conducted  periodically  at selected  sites by qualifi ed Quality 
Assurance (QA)  auditors. 
The investigator must make himself or herself available for CRAs during their visits and ensure that CRAs have direct access to all documents that they require, including direct access to the 
subjects’ files. The investi gator agrees to cooperate with the CRAs to make certain that any 
problems detected in the course of monitoring visits are resolved. The investigator will permit 
direct access to the source data and documents to the appropriate regulatory authorities to ver ify 
the accuracy of this data.  
The present study sponsored Prometic Biotherapeutics will be conducted in accordance with ICH 
GCP. The clinical team at the CRO will systematically control the essential documents generated 
during this trial. The trial will b e monitored by the clinical team and will be subject to internal 
audits  by Quality  Assurance.  All clinical  study monitoring  visits  and audits  by QA will be followed 
by internal reports and corrective actions, if needed. Follow -up letters will be forwarded to sites 
after all visits and any findings should be addressed by the investigator. The follow -up letters 
should be filed with the study correspondence and other essential  documentation. 
9.2 Quality Assurance by an Audit  Team  
 
Any study site may be selected  for audit  at any time by an audit  team  originating from  the sponsor 
or from an external organization acting on behalf of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to 
cooperate with the auditor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these audit visits are resolved.  
9.3 Quality Assurance by Data Management  
 
The CRO or delegate will be responsible for QA and QC of the database and data management.

 10 Ethics and  Responsibility  
10.1 Investigational Review Board/Ethics  Committee  
 
Where possible a list of IRB/EC members should be obtained by the investigator and provided to 
the sponsor. The investigator/sponsor will obtain prior approval for this clinical trial, its corresponding ICFs, and any material viewed by the subject. The IRB /EC will be provided with 
the following documents for review:  
• Clinical protocol and corresponding ICF(s);  
• Modifications (amendments) to the clinical protocol and corresponding ICFs;  
• Advertisements (i.e., directed at potential research subjects) for study recruitment, and any other 
material presented to a  subject.  
• Any other document they request for review  
• Clinical Investigational Drug  Brochure  
The IRB/EC must  operate  in compliance with FDA  regulations  21 CFR 50 and 21 CFR  56 and/or  EU 
Directives, and in conformance with applicable ICH E6 Guidelines on GCP. IRB/EC review 
documents should refer to the study be exact protocol title and number, and should identify the 
documents reviewed and the date of the review. The investigator is responsible for keeping the 
IRB/EC updated regarding any new safety  data. 
10.2 Ethical Conduct of the  Trial  
 
The clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the current IRB/EC -approved clinical 
protocol; ICH E6 Guidelines on GCP; and relevant policies, requirements, and regulations of the 
IRB/EC and applicable federal agencies. Any violations by sites, CR O, or sponsor will also be 
submitted to IRBs and relevant regulatory agencies. 
The IRB/EC and the FDA/ Norwegian Competent Authority will be notified promptly of 
discontinuation of the entire clinical study. Respective protocol modifications will be submit ted 
prospectively to the IRB/EC and to the FDA/Norwegian  Competent  Authority  for discontinuation 
or modification  of parts  of the clinical  study. Enrolled subjects,  investigators,  and sub-investigators 
will be notified  immediately  of discontinuation of parts  of the clinical  study  or if the study ends or 
the discontinuation of a subject is  necessary.  
If there are changes  to the protocol  and a new informed  consent  has been  approved, subjects  should 
be informed of the changes and of any changes to the risks /benefits of participation. Subjects will 
need to go through the informed consent process and sign a new approved ICF to be eligible to continue on the  study.

Confidential   
 If a subject decides she or he does not want to continue with the treatment portion of the study, a 
subject can give consent to be followed for safety only and can continue to allow access to 
Protected Health Information (PHI) even after withdrawal. However, the amended and approved ICF will need to be signed, and discontinuing treatment  only should be clearly documented in a 
progress note in the subject’s source documents. A subject still retains the right to withdraw participation in the study at any time and to discontinue further access to PHI. However, all data collected to that poin t will be made available to the sponsor and CRO.  
10.3 Informed Consent and Assent  
 
The investigator must explain to each subject the nature of the study, the purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits involved, and any discomfort it 
may entail. The investigational product(s) should be identified as “experimental” and that its side 
effects are not completely known. This information must be provided in language that the subject 
understands. Each subject must be inform ed that participation in the study is voluntary and that 
they may withdraw from the study at any time, and that withdrawal of consent/assent will not affect their subsequent medical treatment or relationship with the treating physician. The subject should be given sufficient time to read the informed consent/assent form and the opportunity to 
ask questions and consider the statement before signing and dating it, and should be given a copy 
of the signed document(s). 
Informed consent will be obtained from eac h subject (or subject’s legally authorized 
representative) before the subject is admitted to the study. Assents will be obtained from each 
child. The assent will be presented to the child at an appropriate level of understanding for the 
particular  child. The assent  consists  of the same components  as the consent  and requires  discussion 
between the child and the parent or guardian and the investigator. The child will provide verbal assent and provide their signature or mark on the assent form (the parent or guardian may fill out 
the time and date,  if necessary).  No subject  can enter  the study before  informed  consent/assent  has 
been  obtained.  
The sponsor or its designee will supply a model informed consent/assent form that complies with 
regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for the study, as well as a model inform ed 
consent/assent form for optional genetic testing for plasminogen. Any changes to the sample consent  form  suggested  by the investigator  must  be agreed  to by the sponsor  or its designee  before 
submission to the IRB/EC,  and a copy of  the approved version must  be provided to the sponsor  or 
the designated medical monitor after IRB/EC  approval. 
During the study, subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. Should a protocol amendment be required, the consent/assent may be 
revised to reflect the changes of the protocol. If the consent/assent form is revised, it is the

Confidential   
 investigator’s responsibility to ensure that an amended consent/assent form is reviewed and 
approved by the IRB or ethics committee, and this amended form is signed by all subjects 
subsequently entered in the study as well as those currently in the study.  
10.4 Changes in the Conduct of the  Study  
 
The investigator may change the protocol without IRB/EC or sponsor approval only if it is necessary in order to safeguard the safety or rights of the subjects (i.e., in emergent situations). Any protocol amendment must be submitted for information or consideration to the applicable 
regulatory agencies.  
IRB approval will be requested for any change to this protocol, which could affect the safety of 
subjects,  the scope  or design of the study. Minor  procedural  changes  will be implemented  by Study 
Notes to File, with supporting documentation at each site, if appropriate. A non- substantial 
amendment of a study protocol includes minor correction or clarification that have no significant impact on the way the clinical study is to be conducted and no effect on subject safety (i.e., 
administrative  changes  like change  of telephone  number(s),  logistical changes,  etc.).  Any changes 
of the protocol (substantial amendments and non- substantial amendments) will be integrated into 
an updated study protocol, with a listing of all changes and reasoning for  them.  
11 Confidentiality  
The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be  limited 
to those data that are necessary to investigate the efficacy, safety, quality, and utility of the IMP 
used in this  study.  
The investigator will ensure that the subjects’ anonymity will be maintained. The privacy  rules  of 
the US HIPAA  will be followed  to obtain authorization for most  uses and disclosures  of Protected 
Health Information. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor or its designee, subjects will not be identified by their names, but by an i dentification code, consisting of the 
combination of subject’s initials and study number. Documents not for submission to sponsor or its designee  (e.g., the site confidential  subject  enrollment  log and original  subjects’  consent  forms) 
will be maintained b y the investigator in strict confidence. Appropriate technical and 
organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss, or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel  whose  responsibilities  require  access  to personal  data agree to keep  the identity  of study 
subjects  confidential.  
The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator to allow direct access to his or her original medical records  
IND Number: 16186

Confidential   
 for study- related monitoring, audit, IRB, and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses 
the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries.  
The subject  has the right  to request  through the investigator  access  to his/her  personal  data and the 
right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps should 
be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the 
conditions of the study, and the applicable laws and  regulations. 
12 Publication Policy 
In collaboration with the sponsor, the CRO will prepare a draft study report after the completion of the study. The final draft study report will be submitted to the selected investigators for 
information, review, and comments.  
Publication of data generated in the study is governed by the Investigator Clinical Trial Agreement.  
13 Liabilities and  Insurance  
The sponsor will pay for all study related costs. A separate financial agreement will be made (as 
appropriate) with the i nvestigator and/or institutions. 
The sponsor also carries insurance coverage for incidents of damage or injury to study subjects while participating in the study or taking IMP.

15.1 Declaration of  Helsinki  
 
WMA Declaration of Helsinki -  Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human 
Subjects  
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by 
the: 29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975 35th WMA General  Assembly, 
Venice, Italy, October 1983 41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 53rd WMA General Assem bly, Washington DC, USA, October 2002 (Note of Clarification added) 55th WMA 
General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 2004 (Note of Clarification added) 59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013 
Preamble 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research on identifiable human material and  data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The WM A encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human 
subjects to adopt these  principles. 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the  words, 
“The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical 
Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when provi ding medical 
care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote  and safeguard  the health, well-being and rights  of 
patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of t his duty. 
5. Medical  progress  is based  on research  that ultimately  must  include  studies  involving human 
subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions  (methods, procedures  and treatments).  Even  the best proven interventions  must  be 
IND Number: 16186  
Protocol Number: 2002C011G  Prometic Biotherapeutics  Inc. 
Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 68 of 75 
Confidential   
 evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and 
quality. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and  rights.  
8. While  the primary  purpose  of medical  research  is to generate new knowledge, this goal can 
never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research  subjects.  
9. It is the duty of  physicians  who  are involved in  medical  research  to protect  the life, health, 
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information 
of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest 
with the physician or other health care professi onals and never with the research subjects, even 
though they have given consent. 
10. Physicians  must  consider  the ethical,  legal  and regulatory  norms  and standards  for research 
involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international  norms and 
standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this  Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the 
environment. 
12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate  ethics  and scientific  education, training  and qualifications.  Research  on patients  or 
healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician 
or other health care  professional. 
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participation in  research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients 
in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or 
therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of 
participating in research must be  ensured.  
Risks, Bur dens and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of 
the objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical  research  involving human subjects  must  be preceded  by careful  assessment  of 
predictable risks  and burdens  to the individuals  and groups  involved in the research  in comparison 
with foreseeable benefits  to them  and to other  individuals  or groups  affected  by the condition under 
investigation.

Plasminogen (Human) Intravenous  
Version 5 Page 69 of 75 
Confidential   
 Measures to minimize the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously 
monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.  
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily  managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive 
proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately 
stop the study. 
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additi onal harm.  
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive specifically considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to 
the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-  
vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from  the knowledge, practices or 
interventions that result from the  research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be  based  on a  thorough knowledge  of the scientific  literature,  other  relevant  sources  of 
information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described and justified in a research  protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The pr otocol should include 
information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequen ce of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval  to the concerned research  ethics  committee  before  the study begins. This committee  must 
be transparent  in its functioning, must  be independent  of the researcher,  the sponsor  and any other 
undue  influence  and must  be duly qualified. It must  take into consideration the laws and regulations 
of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for researc h subjects set forth in this  Declaration.

Confidential   
 The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must 
provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious 
adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and a pproval 
by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privac y of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal  information.  
Informed Consent  
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subjects in medical 
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult fami ly members or 
community  leaders,  no individual  capable of giving informed  consent  may be enrolled  in a research 
study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible  conflicts  of interest,  institutional affiliations  of the researcher,  the anticipated  benefits  and 
potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any other 
relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to w ithdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special 
attention  should be  given to the specific  information  needs  of individual  potential  subjects  as well 
as to the methods used to deliver the  information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely- given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expr essed in writing, the non-  
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the 
general outcome and results of the study. 
27. When  seeking  informed  consent  for participation  in a research  study the physician  must  be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or 
may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an 
appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this  relationship. 
28. For a potential  research  subject  who is incapable of giving informed  consent,  the physician 
must  seek informed  consent  from  the legally  authorized  representative.  These individuals  must  not 
be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead 
be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only 
minimal risk and minimal burden.

Confidential   
 29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is 
able to give assent  to decisions  about  participation  in research, the physician must  seek that assent 
in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent 
should be  respected.  
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for exa mple, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent  to 
remain  in the research  must  be obtained  as soon  as possible  from  the subject  or a legally  authorized 
representative.  
30. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely affect the patient - physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed 
consent  for its collection,  stora ge and/or  reuse.  There may be exceptional  situations  where consent 
would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics  committee.  
Use of Pl acebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable;  
or 
Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any  
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo,  or no intervention  will not be subject  to additional  risks  of serious  or irreversible  harm  as 
a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions  for post-trial access  for all participants  who still need  an intervention identified

 as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the 
informed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every  research  study  involving human subjects  must  be registered  in a publicly accessible 
database before recruitment of the first  subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results  of their research  on human subje cts and are accountable  for the 
completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for 
ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or 
otherwise made publicly available . Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of 
interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the 
principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for  publication.  
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other 
known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with 
informed consent from the patient or a legally authori zed representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available.

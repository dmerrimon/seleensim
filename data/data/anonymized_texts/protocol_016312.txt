Page 6 of 72 2.0 Introduction, Background, and Rationale 
 
2.1 Introduction 
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a non-profit research 
and educational organization, is proposing a double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled exploratory pilot study with dose escalation to assess safety and feasibility of 
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for social anxiety in 12 
MDMA-naïve adults on the autism spectrum. This study will also obtain estimates of 
effect size based on response to two experimental sessions of MDMA-assisted therapy in 
comparison to an inactive placebo control group in order to properly power subsequent 
investigations. The study will be conducted in association with researchers at Los 
Angeles Biomedical Research Institute (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, main site) and 
Stanford University Medical Center (collaborating site). The sponsor has ongoing studies 
using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) that will be used to inform the safety and dosing aspects of this new investigation 
as a potential therapy for social anxiety that could benefit the quality of life of adults on 
the autism spectrum. 
 
Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports, the sponsor intends 
to conduct this exploratory study which will focus on enhancing functional skills and 
quality of life in this underserved population, who tend to experience greater anxiety, 
depression and victimization than typically developing (TD) adults. The exploratory 
elements of this study are: group sequential dosing, refinement of the treatment method, 
study endpoints, assessment of clinical response, appropriateness of the chosen measures, 
and biomarker analysis of response to treatment. This study is designed to explore 
treatment-related changes in social anxiety, social perception, and neuromodulators such 
as oxytocin (OT), arginine vasopression (AVP) and cortisol (CORT), that are critically 
involved in anxiety and social behavior. Outcomes from this study, if promising, will 
inform the dose, endpoints and treatment regimen for subsequent studies.  
 
2.2 Background 
 
2.2.1 Autism  
The term autism refers to a spectrum of congenital pervasive developmental disabilities. 
A complex developmental and biopsychosocial condition, autism is characterized by a 
combination of six or more types of behaviors under the following symptom domains in 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) [1]: 
 
(A) Qualitative impairment in social interaction;  
(B) Qualitative impairments in communication; 
(C) Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities. 
 
At present, the DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder also apply to varying degrees to 
Asperger’s Disorder  (AS) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder – Not Otherwise 
Specified (PDD-NOS). However, individuals with AS do not present with marked 
language or cognitive development delays, motor skills problems (i.e., clumsiness, 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                 May 21, 2013  
  
Page 7 of 72 awkward gait) are more prevalent than with other autistic conditions, and, in the majority 
of cases, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores range from average to superior. However, they 
tend to lack requisite skills for social adaptability among the TD population, such as 
interpreting facial expressions, body language, and subtle nuances of social 
communication such as figures of speech and sarcasm. A major revision of autism 
diagnostic criteria is anticipated in the upcoming 5th edition of the DSM (DSM- V), which 
would eliminate the distinctions between autism categories and combine them under 
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Therefore, the AS and PDD-NOS diagnostic 
categories may become obsolete prior to completion of this study; thus, in this protocol 
we have chosen to utilize autism or ASD as the diagnostic term in anticipation of the new 
version of the DSM. 
 
AS was first defined in English-language medical literature in 1981[2]. The condition is 
often misdiagnosed or not identified until adolescence or early adulthood, after the period 
when developmentally appropriate social skills would need to be developed. PDD was 
the more common diagnosis utilized for milder forms of autism throughout the 1980s and 
early 1990s, whereas AS was not employed until later. As recently as the 1980s, ASDs 
were considered rare [3]. However, in 2008, the prevalence of ASDs in 8-year-old 
children at 14 Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network sites across 
the United States was estimated at one in 88, an increase of 78 percent since 2002 [4]. 
The increase in diagnoses may be due to increased awareness of the diagnostic criteria 
among clinicians, increased public awareness and education, as well as improved 
accuracy in recognizing spectrum disorders in females and minority populations. These 
factors were found to contribute to increases in prevalence estimates, but a true rise in 
cases could not be ruled out. As a result, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
consider escalating prevalence rates of autism in the general population as an urgent 
public health concern. This dramatic rise in prevalence has led some to propose that 
autism is more accurately conceptualized as variations of cognitive differences that have 
always presented in humans as opposed to an epidemic or spectrum of disorders [5]. 
 
Autistic adults often present for treatment of common co-occurring conditions such as 
anxiety, trauma, depression, and social adaptability challenges. However, responses to 
conventional prescription medications developed in TD individuals are often ineffective 
in autistics [6], and difficulties with establishing therapeutic rapport with therapists can 
interfere with conventional psychotherapy [7]. The search for new supportive treatments 
for autistic adults is relevant in the absence of established or effective treatment options.  
 
2.2.2 Social Anxiety and Autism 
 
Social anxiety, also known as social phobia, is characterized by fear of scrutiny and 
avoidance of social interactions. Social anxiety is prevalent [8], begins early [9, 10], and 
follows a chronic course [11]. Impairment is substantial in TD individuals [12] and it 
interferes with ability to work and attend school, as well as developing relationships, 
leading to low quality of life [13, 14]. Social anxiety is differentiated from anxiety 
proneness[15], and is described in the DSM-IV as:

Page 8 of 72 (A) Marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in 
which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. 
The individual fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) 
that will be humiliating or embarrassing. Note: In children, there must be evidence 
of the capacity for age-appropriate social relationships with familiar people and the 
anxiety must occur in peer settings, not just in interactions with adults. 
(B) Exposure to the feared social situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, 
which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally predisposed panic 
attack. Note: In children, the anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, 
freezing, or shrinking from social situations with unfamiliar people. 
(C) The person recognizes that the fear is excessive or unreasonable. Note: In 
children, this feature may be absent. 
(D) The feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured 
with intense anxiety or distress. 
(E) The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared social or 
performance situation(s) interferes significantly with the person’s nor mal routine, 
occupational (academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is 
marked distress about having the phobia. 
(F) In individuals under the age of 18, the duration is at least 6 months.  
(G) The fear or avoidance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a 
substance (e.g., drug abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition and is not 
better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder with or without 
agoraphobia, separation anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, a pervasive 
developmental disorder, or schizoid personality disorder). 
(H) If a general medical condition or another mental disorder is present, the fear in 
Criterion A is unrelated to it, e.g., the fear is not of stuttering, trembling in 
Parkinson’s disease, or exhibiting abnormal eating behavior in anorexia nervosa or 
bulimia nervosa. 
Specify if:  Generalized: if the fears include most social situations (also consider the 
additional diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder) 
 
Autistic adults who are verbal and whose autism might not be immediately recognizable 
to others often initially present in a clinical setting with symptoms of anxiety or 
depression [16]. Autistic adults are at an increased risk for developing co-morbid anxiety 
and depression as they are faced with increasing amounts of exposure to social situations 
compared to children [2, 17]. Long-term multi-cohort studies following autistic children 
into early adulthood have found that co-morbid behavior and emotional problems remain 
high in adulthood [18]. Comparative studies suggest that autistic adults, especially those 
who are verbal and whose autism might not be immediately recognizable to others and 
who are faced with strong pressure to conform to non-autistic social norms, are at greater 
risk for lifetime and current co-morbid psychological disorders, especially social anxiety 
[19-21]. Social anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges 
experienced by autistic adults [22].

U.S.                                                                                                                                 May 21, 2013  
  
Page 9 of 72 There are currently no pharmacologic treatments approved for autistic adults, although 
off-label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the rise in 
this population [23]. The antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole are the only 
pharmacologic treatments approved by the FDA for irritability associated with autism in 
children and adolescents. Conventional anti-anxiety medications, including SSRIs, 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and benzodiazepines, lack clinical effectiveness 
in autistic adults, potentially due to physiological differences between autistic and TD 
individuals. There is some evidence for a lower number of benzodiazepine binding sites 
in the brains of autistic adults [24]. Although serotonergic dysfunction has been proposed 
as a potential neurobiological basis for autism, efficacy data on SSRIs in the treatment of 
symptoms associated with autism are of varied nature, with some trials finding efficacy 
for global severity and repetitive behaviors [23] and a large multi-site trial finding no 
efficacy for repetitive behaviors [25]. Given the paucity of confirmed efficacy in clinical 
trials and clinical practice, the search for supportive treatments for social anxiety in 
autistic adults is relevant in the absence of established or effective treatment options.  
 
2.2.3 MDMA 
MDMA is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative. Chemists at the Merck 
pharmaceutical company first synthesized it in 1912 [26, 27], though its clinical effects 
were not subject to formal investigation until the 1980s. MDMA is a potent monoamine 
releaser that has its greatest effects on serotonin, followed by norepinephrine and 
dopamine [28-33].  
In TD healthy volunteers, MDMA administration acutely decreases activity in the left 
amygdala [34], a brain region involved in interpretation of negative cues, and attenuates 
amygdalar response to angry faces [35]. This action of MDMA is compatible with its 
reported reduction in fear of emotional injury or defensiveness [36]. Thus, brain imaging 
after MDMA indicates less reactivity to angry facial expressions and greater reward in 
happy faces [35]. Based on functional brain imaging studies with anxiogenic stimuli in 
autistic individuals, the amygdala may be differentially activated [37] or it may signal in 
an altered manner to the fusiform gyrus, a key brain region for facial recognition, 
resulting in differences in social perception [38]. A recent study in TD healthy volunteers 
found correlations between plasma OT levels, amygdalar volume, and extraverted 
personality [39].  
OT is a neuropeptide associated with pair bonding and social affiliation in mammals that 
also attenuates amygdalar response to anxiogenic stimuli [40, 41]. OT administration is 
associated with increased interpersonal trust and changes in social perception, including 
attenuated reactivity to threatening faces [42-44]. OT administration also improves 
empathic accuracy in some individuals who are shy or lack adequate social skills 
[45]. Alterations in OT signaling have also been proposed as a potential mechanism for 
the underlying neurological basis for the core social differences in autism and has been 
implicated as a possible novel therapy [41]. These claims are now supported by several 
clinical trials of intranasal OT treatment for the core social impairments in autism [46-
49].  
 
MDMA elevates OT in peripheral blood [50-52], which is an imperfect but somewhat 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                 May 21, 2013  
  
Page 10 of 72 reliable indicator of elevated OT in the brain [41]. Findings of an association between 
elevated OT and detectable MDMA in peripheral blood were first reported in a 
naturalistic study of London nightclub attendees with and without detectable plasma 
MDMA levels [50]. Dumont and colleagues reproduced these results in humans and 
found that MDMA significantly elevated peripheral plasma OT levels in a placebo-
controlled study in healthy volunteers [51], in addition to a positive association between 
elevated levels of OT and prosocial feelings. Hysek and colleagues replicated these 
results and further reported that administering a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but not a 
norepinephrine uptake inhibitor nor several adrenergic antagonists, attenuated the effects 
of MDMA on OT levels, suggesting a serotonergic mechanism in producing elevated OT 
[52]. The effects of MDMA on OT could be partially responsible for changes in 
personality [53] and empathy [54]. However, the multi-level effects of MDMA on 
monoaminergic signaling and OT, combined with a therapeutic setting focused on 
enhancing functional skills, are more likely to provide the opportunity for a corrective 
emotional experience greater than OT alone, and could be useful in the treatment of 
social anxiety in autistic adults. 
In addition to increased OT release, MDMA also results in increased secretion of the 
highly related neuropeptide AVP [50]. AVP neurobiology has been linked to social 
behavior in animal models and has been shown to increase social cognition when 
administered to healthy adult volunteers [46, 55, 56].  
 
Also of interest is the stress-related hormone CORT, the major output of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. MDMA has also been shown to increase 
CORT levels and it has been proposed that these changes are related to the stimulating 
effects of the drug [57]. In addition to the extensive prosocial behavioral effects of OT 
and AVP, their release has been shown to modulate other neuroendocrine systems, 
particularly the stress responsive activity of the HPA axis, that is dysregulated in 
individuals with social anxiety [58, 59].  
2.2.4 MDMA-Assisted Therapy 
MDMA-assisted therapy is an innovative mode of treatment that combines therapeutic 
techniques with the administration of MDMA, a pharmacological adjunct that may 
enhance or amplify certain aspects of therapy. The therapeutic method that is most 
appropriate for this population will be adapted from therapy techniques that have been 
empirically developed in adults with an AS diagnosis [7]. The main features of the 
therapy will focus on developing a therapeutic relationship with the subjects that will 
provide a permissive setting to learn and practice social skills.  
 
MDMA possesses unique pharmacological properties that may make it especially well 
suited to use as an adjunct to therapy. MDMA is capable of inducing unique 
psychological effects, including: 
 
 Decreased feelings of fear 
 Increased feelings of wellbeing 
 Increased sociability  
 Increased interpersonal trust

Page 11 of 72  Alert state of consciousness 
 Increased awareness of some domains of empathy[36, 60, 61] 
 
Early observers in clinical settings noted increased acceptance of self and others in the 
TD population, increased tolerance of emotionally upsetting materials, and the ability to 
address these issues without extreme disorientation or ego loss [36, 60-64]. In the U.S., 
MDMA was used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by a considerable number of 
psychiatrists and other therapists in the treatment of neuroses, relationship problems, and 
PTSD [61, 62, 65, 66] before it was placed in Schedule 1 in 1985, as a result of extensive 
non-medical use [36, 64, 67]. Placement in Schedule 1 prohibited it for use, except within 
federally-approved research settings.  
 
As part of her dissertation at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology, co-investigator 
Alicia Danforth, Ph.D. Candidate, gathered 100 surveys, 90 anecdotal reports, and 
conducted interviews with 24 individuals on the autism spectrum who have taken 
Ecstasy, a street drug purported to contain MDMA, in non-medical settings. A majority 
of these individuals reported the experience to be helpful in their learning to cope more 
effectively in social situations [68]. From a list of commonly reported MDMA effects, 
72% of survey respondents (N=100) reported experiencing “more comfort in social 
settings,” with 12% indicating that the change lasted over two years. 78% of respondents 
reported “feeling at ease in  my own body,” with 15% experiencing this effect for over 
two years. 77% reported “easier than usual to talk to others,” with 18% reporting that the 
effect lasted up to a year or longer. These anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA 
may be a suitable pharmacologic agent for the treatment of social anxiety in autistic 
adults and warrants further investigation in a randomized controlled clinical trial. 
 
In contrast to daily administrations of SSRIs, MDMA-assisted therapy consists of only a 
few drug-assisted sessions interspersed within a brief course of non-drug therapy. Thus 
the effects of MDMA are distinct from and go well beyond those of anti-anxiety drugs 
such as SSRIs and benzodiazepines. Furthermore, there is no evidence that MDMA 
creates a physical dependency, as benzodiazepines do. Previous studies of polydrug users 
have found that a small percentage of non-medical, recreational users exhibit problematic 
use of Ecstasy (material represented as containing MDMA, though often the object of 
drug substitution of compounds other than MDMA, including methamphetamine and 
other addictive psychostimulants ) [69, 70]. Studies of regular or problematic Ecstasy 
users indicate that on average, regular use occurs no more often than once a week [71]. 
Hence, MDMA may have moderate abuse potential in a subset of individuals. A 
comprehensive review of MDMA research is included in the IB supplied by the sponsor. 
This document should be reviewed prior to initiating the protocol. 
 
2.2.5 Previous Clinical Experience with MDMA 
Classification as a Schedule 1 drug has hampered research into the medical uses of 
MDMA. In recent years, clinical investigation of the safety and effectiveness of MDMA-
assisted therapy has become more feasible due to an open IND with the FDA [72-74]. 
The first double-blind, placebo controlled U.S. Phase 1 study sanctioned by the FDA was 
conducted by the Principal Investigator (PI) of this study at Harbor-UCLA Medical 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2

Page 12 of 72 Center in 1994, with findings that suggested MDMA may cause a statistically significant 
increase in body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure in some healthy volunteers 
[75]. However, these increases were found to be transient and generally tolerable in a 
controlled clinical setting. Subsequent trials confirmed that MDMA produced significant 
increases in heart rate and blood pressure that were likely to be well tolerated by healthy 
individuals [51, 75-80]. The elevation in body temperature noted in healthy volunteers 
was not clinically significant in sponsor-supported studies at normal ambient 
temperatures [81, 82]. As of May 2013, MDMA has been administered to more than 845 
research subjects, in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and the sponsor has not been 
informed of or seen published reports of any unexpected MDMA-related Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) in research studies [28, 31, 35, 36, 52, 54, 75, 76, 79-122].  
 
The potentially therapeutic effects of MDMA were initially investigated in a placebo-
controlled, blinded dose response pilot study funded by MAPS in Spain, in six female 
survivors of sexual assault with treatment-resistant PTSD [101]. In this study, doses 
ranging from 50 mg to 75 mg demonstrated mild signs of improvement without any 
adverse events (AEs) or signs of deteriorating mental health [101]. MAPS went on to 
sponsor the first randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot study of MDMA-assisted 
psychotherapy for the treatment of chronic, treatment resistant PTSD, which 
demonstrated promising results in a sample of 20 subjects [82]. Findings from the long-
term follow-up of this study indicate that the therapeutic benefits have been sustained 
over time on average, although two subjects experienced a relapse in PTSD symptoms 
[123]. The sponsor also supported a randomized, double-blind pilot study in 12 subjects 
with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD in Switzerland, which found a trend toward 
significant improvement in subjects receiving full dose MDMA, when compared to a 25 
mg active placebo MDMA, at two-month follow-up. The improvement continued to 
increase during the twelve-month follow-up [81]. These studies have shown promise for 
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to help people overcome PTSD, an anxiety-related 
disorder, that suggest this treatment could also be useful in treating social anxiety in 
autistic adults. 
 
2.3 Protocol Purpose 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding Phase 2 pilot study 
designed to explore the safety and the therapeutic potential of MDMA-assisted therapy 
for treating social anxiety in 12 MDMA-naïve adults on the autism spectrum. This study 
will provide an estimate of effect size based on response to two experimental sessions of 
MDMA-assisted therapy in autistic adults on measures of safety, social anxiety, social 
perception, and psychiatric symptoms in comparison to a placebo control group. The 
primary outcome measure for the study will be the clinician-administered Liebowit z 
Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) administered by a blinded Independent Rater (IR). Self-
report measures will correspond to indications that often co-present with autism, 
including anxiety, stress, depression, emotion regulation, alexithymia, differences in 
some empathy domains, and other psychosocial challenges. Subjects will receive ongoing 
social support during the study in the form of non-drug therapy and active involvement of 
a support partner.

Page 13 of 72 This study will employ biomarker analyses in combination with clinical outcome 
measures to provide useful insights into the underlying mechanism of MDMA's 
psychosocial and anxiolytic effects, and to examine any biological differences to 
treatment responses. The time course of biomarker concentrations will be used to 
determine if MDMA-assisted therapy causes lasting changes in biomarker levels in 
comparison to baseline.  
Each of the 12 subjects will participate in two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by 
either MDMA or placebo, of seven hours in duration within a brief course of non-drug 
therapy, including three hour-long preparatory sessions at the start of the study and three 
hour-long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session at two 
week intervals. This study is designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the 
exploration of safety and finding the most effective dose in this population. Based on 
anecdotal reports, subjects in this population may be more sensitive to the standard dose 
of 125mg MDMA that has indications of efficacy for PTSD [68]. Subjects assigned to the 
MDMA group will receive two of three different doses, either 75mg, 100mg, or 125mg 
MDMA. Overall, eight subjects (66.7%) will be randomized to the MDMA group and 
four subjects (33.3%) will be randomized to the placebo group. During the study, there 
will be a maximum of 24 experimental sessions with MDMA, with eight sessions in each 
dose group, and eight experimental sessions with placebo. Observations before, during, 
and after experimental sessions will be compared between these groups of equal size to 
explore the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy in the first double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial of this treatment for social anxiety in a sample of autistic adults. 
 
2.4 Rationale of Dose Selection 
The MDMA doses of 75mg and 125mg to be used in this study have been used in 
previous and ongoing MAPS-sponsored studies in the U.S., Switzerland, and Israel [81, 
82]. Previous researchers have also used doses within this range up to 225mg [75, 76, 78, 
79, 91, 99, 116, 124-126]. Prior to the scheduling of MDMA, similar doses and regimens 
were used in psychotherapy [36, 62, 64]. Each MDMA dose is expected to produce the 
commonly reported effects of MDMA.  
 
Anecdotal reports suggest a potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of MDMA in 
autistic individuals who experience sensory hyperarousal [68]. Therefore, subjects will 
only receive a single administration of MDMA during experimental sessions, and the 
lower 75 mg and 100 mg doses will be administered to assess for enhanced sensitivity 
during the first experimental session to subjects randomized to MDMA. MDMA subjects 
will only escalate to a 25mg higher dose in the second experimental session that they 
receive one month later. If any subjects within each dose group experience a drug-related 
SAE, the dose escalation procedure will not continue for remaining subjects in the same 
dose group in the interest of subject safety. If this occurs, the institutional Data Safety 
Monitor and Sponsor Medical Monitor will be consulted to determine the course of 
action. Any subject who experiences a drug-related SAE will be excluded from any 
additional experimental sessions, but will continue with non-drug therapy and follow-up 
assessments whenever possible.

The following objectives will compare effects in specified subjects: 
 To conduct a within-subject comparison of Stage 1 LSAS outcomes to Stage 2 
open-label LSAS outcomes. 
 To conduct a hierarchical regression analysis using condition assignment in Stage 
1 and TAS-20 scores and OT, AVP, and CORT at baseline as predictors and 
LSAS outcomes as dependent variables. 
 
The following objectives will include exploratory analyses intended to inform protocol 
design: 
 To assess the ability of the investigators and subjects to accurately guess 
condition assignment in Stage 1. 
 To assess perceptions about dose and study procedures at baseline and 6-month 
follow-up using a qualitative interview and feedback questionnaire. 
 To determine feasibility of recruiting, testing and treating subjects on the autism 
spectrum with MDMA-assisted therapy as measured by enrollment rates, dropout 
rates, and completion of assessments and other study-related procedures.  
 
3.3 Safety Objective s: 
 
The safety of subjects will be assured during and after the experimental sessions by 
assessing physiological effects, psychological distress, AEs, spontaneously reported 
reactions and suicidality.  
 Vital signs (BP, HR, temp.) will be measured at baseline and every hour during 
experimental sessions until they return to baseline.   
 Participant distress will be measured by the Subjective Units of Distress (SUD) 
scale at baseline and every hour during experimental sessions until return to 
baseline.

Page 16 of 72  Risk of suicide will be measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(CSSRS) during all in person visits, as well as twice during each experimental 
session at two hours after drug administration and the end of the experimental 
session, and on Day 2 and Day 7 after each experimental session. 
 SAEs and AEs will be assessed throughout the study and spontaneously reported 
reactions, defined as expected AEs, will be assessed during each experimental 
session and for seven days after each experimental session, or until resolution.  
 In addition to spontaneously reported reactions, symptoms specific to the study 
population will be collected at baseline and tracked throughout the study.  
 
4.0 Protocol Design 
Twelve subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled. Throughout the study, the 
study therapists will maintain communication with the referring physician or therapist 
and any other health care providers requested by the subject. In consultation with their 
prescribing physician, any individuals taking psychiatric medications will taper off these 
medications, allowing for a washout period of at least 5 times the medication and active 
metabolite half- lives plus one week for stabilization before the experimental session. 
During the study, benzodiazepines or atypical antipsychotics may be used to alleviate 
severe distress or panic responses if other interventions are ineffective. Subjects who are 
in psychotherapy with an outside therapist at the time of enrollment may continue that 
therapy during the treatment period without increasing the number or type of sessions or 
changing type of psychotherapy until after the outcome assessment, one month after the 
second experimental session in Stage 1. After the treatment period, subjects may resume 
psychotropic medications and may change therapists or psychotherapy type. 
 
Each of the 12 subjects will participate in two experimental MDMA-assisted therapy 
sessions of seven hours in duration within a brief course of non-drug therapy, including 
three preparatory sessions at the start of the study and three integrative sessions during 
the month after each experimental session. During preparatory sessions, subjects will 
learn what to expect during experimental sessions and complete pre-treatment 
assessments. The second preparatory session will include a comprehensive tour of the 
treatment location and introductions to all available research and support personnel who 
subjects are likely to see during experimental sessions. In-person visits will occur in a 
private room in an outpatient research facility. All in-person sessions after enrollment 
may be video recorded for the purposes of evaluating structural elements of therapy for 
effectiveness and feasibility. Video recordings will be used for research and training 
purposes during and after the study. 
 
Upon enrollment, the first six subjects (Group 1) will be randomized to receive one dose 
of either placebo (N=2) or 75 mg MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one 
month later, Group 1 subjects randomized to MDMA will escalate to 100 mg MDMA, 
unless contraindicated by safety and tolerability concerns. The second six subjects 
(Group 2) will be randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 100 m g 
MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 2 subjects 
randomized to MDMA will escalate to 125 mg MDMA, unless contraindicated by safety 
and tolerability concerns. Subjects randomized to placebo in Group 1 and Group 2 will

Page 17 of 72 receive placebo in both experimental sessions also scheduled one month apart. The blind 
will be maintained through the six-month follow-up for each individual subject, after 
which the blind will be broken. Placebo subjects will be offered an open-label extension 
(Stage 2) with two experimental sessions scheduled one month apart, in addition to three 
hour-long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session. Stage 2 
subjects will receive 75 mg MDMA in the first experimental session and will escalate to 
125mg MDMA in the second experimental session, unless contraindicated by safety and 
tolerability concerns from other subjects in Stage 1. 
 
During experimental sessions, there will be periods of structured and unstructured 
interactions. The structured interactions will be selected based on elements of therapeutic 
interventions that are currently in use in this population for the treatment of social anxiety 
and to enhance functional skills [7]. The unstructured interactions will include an array of 
therapeutic activities and approaches that would be appropriate for subjects to engage in 
during experimental sessions. All subjects will follow the same schedule of structured 
alternating with unstructured periods but will be able to choose from a selection of 
activities during each unstructured period. Examples include, but are not limited to, 
working with art supplies, listening to preselected music, writing in journals, silent 
introspection, and engaging in rapport-building interactions with researchers.  
 
An overnight stay at a hotel located close to the site will be offered to subjects, 
accompanied by their support partners, if they live further than 30 miles from the site. 
Subjects will attend a 1-hour follow-up integrative therapy session on the day after the 
experimental session. Two additional integrative sessions will be conducted within the 
month following each experimental session, prior to outcome assessments being 
conducted one month after each experimental session. During integrative therapy 
sessions subjects will receive support in integrating their experiences and insights from 
the experimental session. The second experimental session will be scheduled 
approximately one month after the first experimental session, after outcome assessments 
have been completed.  
 
All subjects, even those who have a prior diagnosis, will be clinically evaluated by the PI 
to determine autistic status. In addition, autistic status will be confirmed with the gold-
standard diagnostic measure of autism and diagnosis of co-morbid psychological 
disorders will be conducted according to DSM-IV criteria at screening. Outcome 
measures will be assess ed prior to treatment, during the treatment period, one month after 
each experimental session, and during the 6-month follow-up according to the Time and 
Events table. The sponsor will conduct an ongoing review of videos of therapy sessions, 
entry criteria, vital signs, and reaction data for completed sessions and any AEs. The 
sponsor will provide ongoing feedback to the co-therapist teams to ensure subject safety.  
For all subjects blood samples will be obtained for biomarker analysis at baseline and 
during the study according to the Time and Events Table. Biomarker analyses including 
plasma OT, AVP, and CORT will be explored as surrogate endpoints at baseline, two 
hours after drug administration during the second experimental session, one month after 
the second experimental session, and at 6-month follow-up. Blood will be collected 
during the open-label extension Stage 2 two hours after drug administration during both

4.1 Planned Duration of Study 
 
 Subjects in Stage 1 and follow-up: 8 months  
 Subjects in Stage 1, follow-up, and Stage 2: 10 months 
 
These lengths of time do not include screening, which may take up to two months. The 
total duration of the study will depend on enrollment rates, but is expected to last at least 
22 months. Any delay between visits would result in a corresponding extension of study 
duration.

Page 23 of 72 5.1 Measures 
 
The following diagnostic, outcome, safety, and process measures will be used in the 
study. All therapy sessions, including experimental sessions, may be recorded to audio 
and video, with all recordings preserved for research and training purposes.  
 
5.1.1 Diagnostic Measures 
 
The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2, Module 4) is a 
semi-structured social interaction to assess autism and autism-spectrum disorders in 
adults [127]. It takes 40 to 60 minutes to administer ADOS-2 Module 4. The assessment 
includes a construction task, semi-structured conversation with the assessor, emotional 
and creative responses to cartoons and pictures, describing an unusual event and telling a 
story. The assessment is scored by an algorithm and assessment is made on observation 
of participant nonverbal and verbal behavior, restricted or stereotyped behavior and 
degree of empathy. Most factors of the original Module 4 were reliable, with kappa 
greater than 0.60 and inter-rater reliability was high, from 0.83 for “repetitive /restrictive” 
to 0.93 for “so cial” [127]. Subsequent specific examination of the measure found that 
Module 4 could reliably detect ASD in adults, and that it could differentiate between 
autism spectrum disorders, psychopathy and typical development [128]. The activities 
used in the ADOS-2 are identical to those used in the original version of the ADOS, but 
instructions have been revised. A certified assessor will administer the ADOS-2 at 
screening to confirm autistic status. 
 
The Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnoses Axis 1 Research Version (SCID-I-RV) 
is a structured interview used to assess and diagnose psychiatric conditions listed in the 
DSM –IV [129]. The interview is designed for use in adults and is suitable for use with 
psychiatric and non-psychiatric populations. The SCID consists of ten modules. Modules 
are based upon the symptoms listed for diagnoses as set out in the DSM-IV. The SCID 
can take from 30 to 90 minutes to perform. The SCID will be used to assess for 
psychological disorders. The PI will administer the SCID once at screening.  
 
5.1.2 Outcome Measures 
 
The primary outcome measure for the study will be the clinician-administered LSAS 
[130]. The LSAS is a 24-item, semi-structured interview on the severity of Social 
Anxiety Disorder, which has been widely used in clinical studies, including research on 
social anxiety in autistic adults [16]. The LSAS separately assesses fear (0 to 3 = none, 
mild, moderate, severe) and avoidance (0 to 3 = never, occasionally, often, usually) of 24 
social situations, providing an overall social anxiety severity rating and subscale scores 
for performance fear, performance avoidance, social fear, and social avoidance.  The 
overall scores are interpreted as: 55-65 moderate, 65-80 marked, 80-95 severe, and 
greater than 95 very severe social anxiety. The LSAS has been shown to have good 
internal consistency (score inter-correlations ranging from 0.81 to 0.96), reliability, 
convergent validity with other measures of anxiety, and sensitivity to treatment response. 
The LSAS was also demonstrated to be sensitive to the effects of pharmacological 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 24 of 72 treatments of social phobia in comparison to placebo and to have convergent validity 
[15]. A qualified blinded IR, who will not be present during experimental sessions, will 
complete the LSAS assessment. Subjects will be instructed not to inform the IR of any 
beliefs they or others have concerning their condition assignment during the assessment.  
 
The BDI- II is a 1996 revision of the BDI, a 21-item self-report measure [131, 132], that 
will serve as a measure of depression according to DSM-IV criteria [133]. The BDI-II 
has been validated, has high internal consistency and good test/re-test reliability, and is 
not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. It takes five to ten minutes to complete 
[133]. Score cutoffs indicate: 0-13 minimal depression, 14-19 mild depression, 20-28 
moderate depression, and 29-63 severe depression. Higher scores indicate more severe 
depressive symptoms. The BDI-II will be completed according to the Time and Events 
table. 
 
The PSS is a 10-item self-report measure that is widely used in research to assess stress in 
persisting conditions and takes about 1 – 2 minutes to complete. The PSS includes six 
negative items that are intended to assess lack of control and negative affective reactions 
and four positive items that measure the degree of ability to cope with existing stressors. 
Individuals indicate how often they felt or thought a certain way during the last month (0 
= never , 4 = very often ). The PSS was correlated with depressive symptomatology and 
social anxiety in TD populations [134]. The PSS will be completed according to the Time 
and Events table. 
 
The IRI assesses four aspects of empathy: social functioning, self-esteem, emotionality, 
and sensitivity to others [135-137]. Empathy is not a discrete emotion. More accurately, 
empathy is a set of constructs. Therefore, the IRI accounts for the fact that each construct 
concerns an individual’s responses to the observed experiences of other people, yet each 
construct is distinctive from the others. The self-report questionnaire includes 28 items 
that are rated on a 5-point, Likert-type scale. The four 7-item subscales include two 
measures of cognitive empathy and two measures of affective empathy. The internal 
reliabilities for the four scales range from .71 to .77, and test-retest reliabilities range 
from .62 to .71 [135]. One study [138] administe red the IRI to 21 adults with Asperger’s 
Syndrome and to 21 matched controls. As anticipated, the Asperger’s group scored lower 
on the measures of cognitive empathy, but they scored similarly to controls on the 
Empathic Concern scale, and scored higher than controls on the Personal Distress scale. 
In the absence of an abundance of robust validity testing of empathy assessments with 
adult autistic populations, the IRI provides a good option for a multidimensional 
assessment of empathy factors. The IRI will be completed according to the Time and 
Events table. 
 
The RSES is widely used in clinical research to assess two facets of self-esteem: self-
competence (instrumental value) and self liking (intrinsic value) [139]. The RSES is a 
simple, 10-item scale with five questions for each facet, and it can be completed in 1 – 2 
minutes. In anecdotal accounts, autistic adults have reported increased self-esteem and 
self-competence following MDMA use, attributes that influence anxiety, affective states, 
and interpersonal style. The RSES satisfies tests of item convergent and discriminant

Cronbach’s α has been shown to be substantial M = 0.81) across cultural contexts  [140]. 
The RSES will be completed according to the Time and Events table. 
 
The STAI Form Y is a widely used self-report instrument for assessing anxiety in adults 
that includes separate measures of state and trait anxiety [141, 142]. The STAI evaluates 
the essential qualities of feelings of apprehension, tension, nervousness, and worry. The 
STAI differentiates between the temporary condition of "state anxiety" and the more 
general and long-standing quality of "trait anxiety." The STAI state scale asks for 
feelings at the moment of filling out the questionnaire, and the STAI trait scale asks 
subjects to indicate how they generally view themselves. The proposed study will use the 
20-item trait scale with questions about how respondents generally feel. Response options 
are based on a 4-point Likert-type scale (1=almost never, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 
4=almost always). The STAI will be completed according to the Time and Events table. 
 
The TASIT is an audio-visual test of social perception and emotional expression 
comprehension presented in video vignettes of interpersonal interactions [143]. 
Standardized response probes assess understanding of emotional expression. The 3-part 
test includes The Emotion Evaluation Test, the Social Inference-Minimal, and the Social 
Inference-Enriched test. Each part takes approximately 10 – 15 minutes to complete. The 
TASIT has demonstrated adequate test-retest rel iability (range = 0.74 for “Emotional 
Evaluation” to 0.88 for “Social Inference - Minimal”)  and hi gh internal consistency α = 
0.71 [144, 145]. The TASIT will be completed according to the Time and Events table. 
 
The ERQ is a brief measure of self-reported emotion-regulation. It consists of ten items 
that is intended to assess means of coping with emotions via changing them, as through 
reappraisal, or suppressing them [146]. Respondents rate indicate the extent of their 
agreement or disagreement with each item by selecting a point on a 7-point Likert scale, 
where 1= strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree. The ERQ should take four to six 
minutes to complete. Specific items are summed to produce two separate scales, 
Reappraisal and Suppression. The measure is reliable, with Reappraisal obtaining a 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.79 and Suppression an alpha of 0.73, and test -retest reliability of 
0.69 [146], and scores on the ERQ are correlated with other measures of degree of 
emotional expressivity. Studies in people with A sperger’s or ASD suggest difficulties 
with emotion regulation that include less use of reappraisal and greater numbers of 
negative versus positive emotions [147]. The ERQ will be completed according to the 
Time and Events table. 
 
The TAS-20 is a 20-item measure of self-reported difficulties with recognizing and 
verbalizing emotions[148, 149]. Responses are made on a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = 
strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. Estimated time of measurement is 5 to 10 
minutes. The scale is comprised of three subscales; Difficulty Describing Feelings, 
Difficulty Identifying Feelings and Externally-Oriented Thinking, with all scales summed 
to create a total score reflecting presence and degree of alexithymia. The TAS-20 can be 
used diagnostically with a score of 61 or higher indicative of alexithymia. The TAS-20 is 
reliable and has good test- retest reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81, test -retest of 0.77). 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 26 of 72 It is an established measure of alexithymia. There is some suggestion of an overlap 
between this condition and Asperger’s syndrome, with samples of people with Asperger’s 
syndrome showing greater rates of alexithymia than age and gender-matched controls 
[147, 150]. The TAS-20 will be completed according to the Time and Events table. 
 
The QoL-Q is a 40-item measure of quality of life. It is administered as an interview and 
assesses eight domains [151]. The QoL-Q assesses the following domains; self-
determination, (autonomy and decision-making), social inclusion (acceptance by others 
within the community, supports), material well-being (financial security and 
socioeconomic status), personal development (education, skills and competence), 
emotional well-being (spirituality, happiness, sense of safety) interpersonal relations 
(intimacy, affection, friendship), rights (voting, privacy, legal rights and protections) and 
physical we ll-being (health, nutrition, mobility).  It is estimated to take between a half 
hour to an hour to complete the QoL-Q. It can be used in diverse populations, including 
autistics and other developmentally disabled people [152, 153]. The measure has 
excellent internal reliability (alpha = 0.90) and strong test-retest reliability (alpha = 0.87). 
The QoL- Q will be completed according to the Time and Events table. 
 
 
5.1.3 Safety Measures 
 
Safety measures will be applied, as described below, to minimize risks associated with 
drug-assisted therapy sessions. The co-therapist or PI will be available via mobile phone 
or pager throughout the study to ensure subject safety.  
 
Safety measures, including vital signs and a measurement of psychological distress, will 
be assessed during all experimental sessions. Subjects will rate their current degree of 
subjective distress with the SUD scale, which is a single-item self-report scale. The SUD 
will be completed repeatedly during the experimental sessions, with the degree of distress 
marked along seven points. Results of the SUD are intended to assist therapists in 
maintaining subject safety during experimental sessions. 
 
The therapists will assess general wellbeing during each preparatory session, on each 
integrative session and during integrative telephone calls for seven days. Results of this 
scale are intended to assist therapists in maintaining subject safety throughout the 
treatment period of the study. 
 
The C-SSRS is a clinician-administered measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect 
potential suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a clinical trial [154]. It consists of a 
Baseline form that assesses lifetime suicidal ideation, ideation intensity and behavior, and 
a form for assessing current suicidal ideation and behavior. The C-SSRS consists of a 
series of questions, and can be administered during a face- to-face interview or over the 
telephone. Suicidality will be assessed at Baseline, once during any face- to-face visit, 
during the second and seventh days of integrative telephone contact, and twice during 
each experimental session. Subjects who are discontinuing medication to participate in 
the study will complete the C-SSRS before and after medication washout. The C-SSRS

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 27 of 72 data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs) for all administrations except for the 
second integrative session, unless the therapists observe an increase in suicidality. C-
SSRS data from the second integrative session after each experimental session will be 
kept with the subject’s Source Record.  
 
Cardiovascular effects will be assessed via blood pressure and pulse measurement. Blood 
pressure and heart rate will be assessed periodically during each experimental session by 
an automatic blood pressure and pulse monitor. Blood pressure and pulse will be 
measured at the outset of the experimental session, once approximately every hour, or as 
needed. More frequent measures will be taken if there are symptoms, such as chest pain, 
shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms that may be indicative of hypertension. 
The therapists will measure subject body temperature approximately every 60 to 90 
minutes. The timing of these measurements will be adjusted so that they do not interfere 
with the therapeutic process.  
 
All AEs and spontaneously reported reactions will be collected, as described in Section 
8.5. AEs and spontaneously reported reactions may be collected during face- to-face visits 
or over the telephone. Common reactions that are spontaneously reported are collected 
for seven days after each experimental session on a separate CRF page and will be 
categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 
As an additional safety and support measure, all subjects will be required to designate a 
family member, close friend, or significant other who knows them well to provide 
ongoing support for the duration of their active participation in the study. Precedence for 
the importance of post-session support has been established in earlier similar studies 
[155]. Responsibilities of the designated support person include: 
 
 Providing reliable transportation, as required, to and from pre- and post-session 
appointments and participating in study visits, as appropriate.  
 Driving the subject home or to another secure location following sessions. No 
participant will be allowed to drive themselves home after experimental sessions.  
 Remaining available to attend to basic comfort needs and to talk with subject in 
person, by phone, or online for 24 hours post-session.  
 
5.1.4 Process Measures 
 
All therapy sessions, including experimental sessions, may be recorded to audio and 
video, with all recordings preserved for research and training purposes.  
 
Belief of condition assignment and certainty will be collected from each therapist 
responsible for treating the subject and the subject at the integrative session on the day 
after each blinded experimental session in Stage 1. These beliefs are collected as a part of 
the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to optimize the blinding of MDMA -assisted therapy.  
 
The Feedback Questionnaire has been developed internally by the sponsor to assess 
perceived benefits and harms of MDMA-assisted therapy, feedback on therapeutic

Page 28 of 72 methods, and prior treatments received. The questionnaire will be completed as a self-
report measure and then reviewed with the subject in order to ask follow-on questions 
during a semi-structured qualitative interview, which may be video recorded. This 
questionnaire will be completed at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up visit. 
 
5.2 Study Procedures and Visit Descriptions  
 
5.2.1 Prescreening and Screening 
 
The therapist team for this study will consist of the PI, Charles Grob, M.D., and co-
investigator Alicia Danforth, Ph.D. Candidate, and all study visits will be completed at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Prospective subjects will be prescreened by telephone or 
email according to an IRB-approved script to learn if they meet basic eligibility criteria. 
All individuals who are prescreened should be assigned a screening number and recorded 
on the Subject Screening Log where information on the selection of potential subjects in 
the trial should be collected.  
 
Upon signing the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF), the potential subject may 
commence study-related screening activities. The screening number should also be 
recorded on the signed ICF. If a subject is enrolled, the study staff should record the 
enrollment date and assign a subject number. If a subject is not enrolled, an explanation 
should be recorded on the Screening Log. A CRF will not be completed for subjects who 
are not enrolled. These subjects will only be documented on the Screening Log and 
Source Records. It is the responsibility of the PI to file the Screening Log in the 
investigator site file (ISF) to be readily available for on-site monitoring and/or inspection 
by relevant authorities. Screening may take place over more than one day and should be 
complete by up to two months prior to enrollment. If, after reviewing all information, the 
PI concludes that a subject is eligible, they will enroll the subject in the study. Visits will 
be scheduled consecutively, as described in the Time and Events Table.  
 
a. Explain and obtain written informed consent from the subject and Support Partner. 
Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to performing any 
tests or evaluations for the study.  
b. Assign the subject a screening number. Complete the Screening Log.  
c. Review the ability of females of childbearing potential to become pregnant and their 
commitment to practice appropriate birth control, as determined by the PI for the 
treatment period of the study. 
d. Collect perceptions about the study using the Feedback Questionnaire. 
e. Administer C-SSRS to assess suicide risk. 
f. Administer the SCID-I-RV to assess co-morbid psychological disorders. 
g. Administer ADOS-2, Module 4 to confirm autistic status. 
h. A blinded IR will administer the LSAS. 
i. Obtain medical and psychological history by interview. 
j. Collect symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
k. Collect information on pre-study and current medications.

procedures:  
 Blood pressure 
 Pulse 
 Height 
 Weight 
 Body temperature 
 Examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, 
and extremities 
 Brief neurological exam (cranial nerves 2-12, sensory, motor, reflexes, and 
cerebellar function) 
 Urine-dip pregnancy test on females with childbearing potential  
 Urinary drug test 
k. Conduct Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) 
l. Collect information on phase of menstrual cycle for female subjects. 
m. Collect samples for clinical lab assessments, including: 
 Blood for screening clinical lab assessments (see Section 10.1) 
 Blood for baseline OT,AVP, and CORT analysis  (see Section 10.2) 
 
 
Results of HIV serology will be kept confidential and appropriate referral for counseling 
may be necessary in accordance with state law. The clinical laboratory values will be 
used to establish eligibility and will be kept with the subject’s Source Record.  The 
clinical laboratory values will not be captured in the CRF, but will be used to establish 
eligibility and will be kept with the subject’s Source Record. Clinically significant 
abnormal values will be captured as medical history. If, upon examination, there are 
questions raised about possible medical problems, the PI will request a review of subject 
medical records and request additional tests or assessments, as indicated. 
 
5.2.2 Preparatory Sessions and Baseline Measures 
 
Subjects who do not complete all screening activities will not be enrolled. Eligibility may 
be discussed by phone after screening is complete and at the time Visit 3 is scheduled but 
the final confirmation will occur at Visit 3. If all inclusion criteria and no exclusion 
criteria are met, eligibility will be confirmed with the subject. 
 Complete a final review of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
 Assess general wellbeing. 
 Confirm eligibility and willingness to participate in study. 
 Enroll subject and issue subject number. 
 Ensure medical history and medication history is complete. After enrollment new 
events will be collected as AEs and new medications, as described in Section 8.5 
and Section 9.0. 
 Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
 Discuss medication tapering, if applicable. Upon confirmation of eligibility, the 
PI will consult the prescribing physician to initiate medication tapering for

Page 30 of 72 subjects who must refrain from taking a psychiatric medication for the study. 
Tapering will follow a time course appropriate for the medication given its half-
life, with the first experimental session scheduled to occur after complete 
washout.  
 
The subjects will undergo three preparatory sessions lasting approximately sixty minutes 
each with their therapist team, prior to their first experimental session. The first 
preparatory session will take place at Visit 1 after enrollment confirmation. Baseline 
measures will be spread out among preparatory sessions in order to reduce participant 
fatigue from completion of measures. 
 
The therapists will work with the subject to prepare for MDMA-assisted therapy. The 
therapists and subject will seek to form a strong working relationship with each other as 
the therapists help the subject prepare for upcoming experimental sessions. Preparatory 
sessions will promote a safe set and setting for confronting emotions and are intended to 
develop therapeutic alliance.  
 
During preparatory sessions: 
a. Therapists may record all sessions to audio and video. Subjects may access video 
recordings from these sessions upon request via a secure and password protected 
website.  
b. Collect AEs and medications, as described in Section 8.5 and Section 9.0. 
c. Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
d. The therapists will inquire about any possible changes in the subject’s health to 
ensure that subject continues to meet eligibility criteria and, if applicable, will 
confirm that the subject has appropriately tapered off of medications.  
e. The subject and therapists will discuss goals for the experimental session and will 
review what will happen during the experimental session. 
f. During one of the preparatory sessions, the therapists will introduce the subject to the 
staff at the outpatient research center who they will be most likely to encounter 
before, during, or after treatment sessions.  
g. The Support Partner will meet with the therapists prior to the first experimental 
session to review and confirm their role and responsibilities and sign an ICF 
addendum. There must be mutual agreement between the subject and therapists 
concerning the presence of the Support Partner. 
h. The therapists will administer the C-SSRS just prior to beginning the second 
preparatory session, unless a subject is still undergoing medication washout. Subjects 
still undergoing medication washout will complete the C-SSRS during the second 
preparatory session or at a point after washout is complete prior to the first 
experimental session.  
i. Assess general wellbeing at each preparatory session. 
j. At the end of the first preparatory session, subjects will complete: 
a. BDI- II 
b. STAI  
c. PSS 
d. IRI

Page 31 of 72 e. RSES 
k. At the end of the second preparatory session, subjects will complete the TASIT. 
l. The second preparatory session will include a comprehensive tour of the treatment 
location and introductions to all available research and support personnel who 
subjects are likely to see during experimental sessions. 
m. At the end of the third preparatory session, subjects will complete: 
a. ERQ 
b. TAS-20 
c. QoL-Q 
n. During the third and last preparatory session, give the Reminder of Study Rules to the 
subject, which includes instructions and restrictions for conduct prior to receiving the 
drug. Subjects must agree to: 
 Refrain from eating after 24:00 (midnight) the evening before the experimental 
session. 
 Ingest only alcohol-free liquids after 24:00 (midnight) the evening before the 
experimental session.  
 Refrain from the use of any psychoactive drug, with the exception of caffeine or 
nicotine, within 24 hours of each experimental session. 
 Not use caffeine or nicotine for two hours before and six hours after ingesting the 
drug, or until therapists deem it safe to do so. 
5.2.3 Experimental sessions  
Subjects will receive two blinded experimental sessions of therapy assisted by MDMA or 
placebo, scheduled one month apart after integrative sessions are complete. Procedures 
for drug-assisted therapy will remain the same across all sessions. During experimental 
sessions, there will be periods of structured and unstructured interactions. The structured 
interactions will be selected based on elements of therapeutic interventions that are 
currently in use in this population for the treatment of social anxiety. Structured 
interactions during experimental sessions are intended to develop the therapeutic 
relationship between subjects and therapists and to enhance skills of social perception 
through administration of the TASIT. The unstructured interactions will include an array 
of therapeutic activities and approaches that would be appropriate for subjects to engage 
in during experimental sessions. All subjects will follow the same schedule of structured 
alternating with unstructured periods but will be able to choose from a selection of 
activities during each unstructured period. Examples include, but are not limited to, 
working with art supplies, listening to preselected music, writing in journals, silent 
introspection, and engaging in rapport-building interactions with therapists. The 
therapists will create and communicate a setting of safety and support the subject during 
periods of inner focus. Therapists will use a largely nondirective approach. Therapists 
will provide encouragement for staying present with difficult experiences. Therapists 
may occasionally offer gentle guidance or redirection as a choice to encourage 
collaborative exploration if the subject repeatedly avoids interpersonal contact. Therapists 
will use music to support the experience without being intrusive.

Pre-drug: 
a. At least 24 hours prior to the first experimental session the subject will be 
randomized. The PI will obtain the container assignment using a web-based 
randomization program prior to the blinded sessions.  
b. On the day of the experimental session, the subject will arrive approximately one to 
one and a half hours prior to drug administration.  
c. Confirm continuing eligibility by reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
d. Collect information on phase of menstrual cycle for female subjects. 
e. Perform a urine drug screen. A positive drug screen will be reviewed by the PI and 
may be cause for delaying drug administration to a later time, rescheduling the 
session to a later date, or withdrawing the subject from the study. 
f. If a woman is of childbearing potential, perform a urine pregnancy test. A positive 
pregnancy screen is cause for withdrawal from the protocol. 
g. If the subject continues to meet criteria and the subject reports that they followed 
appropriate rules and restrictions, the session will proceed. 
h. Review procedures for the experimental session with the subject. 
i. Record the entire session to video and audio. Subjects may review video recordings 
of their experimental sessions upon request. 
j. The session will last for approximately seven hours or longer. 
k. The therapists will administer the C-SSRS prior to drug administration. 
l. Before drug administration, discuss and review the subject’s goals, intentions, and 
concerns and some of the commonly experienced effects of MDMA. 
m. Instruct the subject not to use caffeine or nicotine two hours before or six hours after 
the dose of drug.

Page 33 of 72 initial dose and approximately every hour after that. The therapists may make more 
frequent measurements if body temperature exceeds more than 1oC above baseline. 
o. Subjects will complete the SUD at baseline prior to administration of the initial dose. 
Subjects will complete the SUD every 60 to 90 minutes, until the session is over, 
allowing a window of up to 30 minutes to fit into the therapy process where a natural 
break occurs. If necessary, the therapists can make a greater number of 
measurements, as their clinical judgment dictates. 
p. Measure BP, pulse, and BT at baseline prior to drug administration.  
 
During:  
q. At approximately 10:00 in the morning, subjects will receive the initial dose of drug 
along with a glass of water.  
r. The subject will sit or recline on comfortable furnishings. Eyeshades and a program 
of music will be provided if the subject wishes to use them. Subjects may speak to the 
therapists whenever they wish, who will provide guidance and support, as needed. 
s. Measure BP, pulse, and BT once every hour throughout the experimental session. 
More frequent measures will be taken if clinical signs and symptoms of hypertension 
are observed. If BP values are sustained at 180 systolic and/or 110 diastolic, the P I 
will make a decision about whether to conduct additional measurements or to provide 
treatment. Measurements may be repeated until they have been decreasing for 15 
minutes or have stabilized at a level judged by the PI to be safe.   
t. After the first hour, if the subject has not spoken spontaneously, check in with 
him/her about the nature of the experience. For the rest of the experience, as 
appropriate, the therapists will support and encourage the subject in emotional 
processing and resolution of whatever psychological material is emerging. 
u. Approximately two hours after drug administration during the second experimental 
session, prepare the subject for the blood draw for biomarker analysis. Bring in the 
phlebotomy technician when the subject is emotionally ready for the blood draw. 
v. Initiate the TASIT. The TASIT administration may be spread out between hours two 
and three to fit around the therapeutic process.  
w. Record any spontaneously reported reactions during the session. 
x. Provide water and electrolyte containing fluids throughout the session but not to 
exceed 3 L overall. 
y. Provide food during the latter part of the session.  
z. If it is appropriate to do so, initiate the first question of the C-SSRS at any point in the 
session if the subject is experiencing significant psychological distress that does not 
respond readily to processing with the therapists. The C-SSRS is required at least 
once during the session. It is preferable to administer it towards the end of the 
session, about six hours after the initial dose.  
aa. End the session if all medical and psychiatric parameters are acceptable and the 
subject is alert, ambulatory, and emotionally stable. 
 
Post-drug: 
bb. The therapists will depart from the site when they have concluded that the subject is 
emotionally and medically stable. Therapists shall remain available to subjects during 
the experimental session and for one week after via 24 hour cellular phone for

Page 34 of 72 integration, as needed.  
cc. Spontaneously reported reactions, AEs, and concomitant medications will be 
collected, as described in Section 8.5 and Section 9.0. 
dd. Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
ee. After the experimental sessions, an overnight stay at a hotel located close to the site 
will be offered to subjects, accompanied by their support partners, if they live further 
than 30 miles from the site. 
ff. During the night of the experimental session, subjects will be given the following 
measures to complete prior to the integrative session on the next day: 
a. RSES 
b. IRI 
c. PSS 
 
5.2.4 Integrative Sessions 24 Hours after Experimental Session  
 
The subject and support partner (if applicable) will receive pagers (or similar device) that 
will allow them to contact the therapists during the period after the first in-person office 
visit following treatment sessions in the case of an emergency or request for additional 
support. Subjects will be encouraged to use much of the time during the 24-hours post-
session for rest and for a period of reflection and integration in a quiet atmosphere. On 
the morning after each experimental session, the therapists will meet with the subject for 
a 60-minute integrative therapy session.  
 
Activities during these sessions include discussing material that emerged during 
experimental sessions and helping subjects integrate their experiences both internally and 
into daily life. Therapists will validate the choices of the subject about how much they 
wish to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and experiences at this time, but will elic it 
enough information to be able to assess the subject’s level of emotional stability and state 
of emotional and physical wellbeing. Therapists will emphasize their commitment to 
support the subject during the integration period and will be available via phone for 
additional meetings if needed. Subjects will be encouraged to relax and rest as much as 
possible for several days after the experimental session. 
 
During integrative sessions: 
 
a. The integrative session may be recorded to audio and video. Subjects may receive 
access to copies of the recordings on a secure, password-protected website upon 
request. 
b. The therapists will administer the C-SSRS during each integrative session. 
c. The subject and both therapists will indicate their beliefs concerning subject 
condition assignment.  
d. Discuss and review events that occurred with the subject during the experimental 
session, including thoughts, feelings, and memories. If necessary, the therapists 
will help the subject to reduce any residual psychological distress he or she is 
experiencing. The therapists will also encourage the transfer of states of 
acceptance, feelings of intimacy, closeness, and reduced fear experienced in 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 35 of 72 experimental sessions to emotionally threatening everyday situations. The 
therapists will be supportive, validating the experience, and facilitating 
understanding and emotional clearing.  
e. The therapists will remain accessible any time the subject needs support outside 
the scheduled integration sessions.  
f. Assess the subject’s mental health and the presence of any remaining reactions 
during the integrative session.  
g. Integrative sessions can also serve as an opportunity for the therapists to gather 
information about the effects of the drug on the subject in an unstructured manner.  
h. At the end of the session, subjects will complete: 
a. BDI- II 
b. STAI 
i. The IR will administer the LSAS. 
j. Spontaneously reported reactions, AEs, and concomitant medications will be 
collected, as described in Section 8.5 and Section 9.0. 
k. Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population.  
l. After the integrative session, a person previously selected by the subject will 
provide a ride home to the subject. If the subject is unable to locate an individual 
willing or able to take him or her home, or if the designated person is unable to 
assist the subject due to unforeseen events, the therapists will assist the subject in 
finding an alternative means of returning home. 
m. Remind the subjects that they will have daily phone contact for the next seven 
days. 
5.2.5 Daily Contact for Seven Days after an Experimental Session 
 
During daily contact:  
 
a. Starting on the day of the integrative session following each experimental session, 
one of the therapists will contact the subject via telephone or email on a daily 
basis for seven days. The goal of daily contact is assessment of changes in general 
wellbeing, safety of the subjects, and offering support for subjects.  
b. The integrative phone contact will be for a brief check-in lasting five to fifteen 
minutes or as long as necessary to address any concerns a subject has and to 
assess subject’s wellbeing. Additional telephone contact can be initiated at the 
request of the therapists or subject. 
c. On the second and seventh day of contact after the experimental session, one of 
the therapists will administer the C-SSRS. 
d. General wellbeing will be assessed at each phone call. 
e. Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
f. Spontaneously reported reactions, AEs, and concomitant medications will be 
collected, as described in Section 8.5 and Section 9.0. 
 
5.2.6 Biweekly Integrative Sessions  
 
In addition to the integrative session the morning after each experimental session, the 
subject will have two additional integrative sessions with the therapists lasting 60 minutes 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 36 of 72 with the therapists between each experimental session scheduled at two-week intervals 
following the last integrative session. The therapists may conduct more or longer 
integrative sessions if they and the subject deem it necessary.  
 
Activities for these sessions include integration of material that emerged as a part of 
experimental sessions and afterward into daily life. Therapists will emphasize their 
commitment to support the subject during the integration period and will be available via 
phone or pager.  
 
During integrative sessions: 
 
a. Record each integrative session to audio and video. Subjects may receive access 
to copies of the recordings on a secure, password-protected website upon request. 
b. The C-SSRS will be administered just prior to beginning each integrative session.  
c. General wellbeing will be assessed at each integrative session. 
d. The subject and therapists will continue to work on supporting the subject as she 
or he considers his or her experiences during experimental sessions.  
e. The therapists will use clinical judgment to assess the subject’s psychological 
wellbeing during this period of time. If there are any indications of continuing 
anxiety or distress, the therapists may arrange to work on reducing the distress at 
a specially scheduled integrative session, through continuing contact, or at the 
next regularly scheduled integrative session. The subject may also initiate contact 
with the therapists at any time throughout the study. 
f. At the second integrative session after the second experimental session, blood will 
be drawn for biomarker analysis. 
g. At the second integrative session after the second experimental session, collect 
information on phase of menstrual cycle for female subjects. 
h. At the beginning or end of each integrative session, subjects will complete: 
a. BDI- II

c. TASIT 
k. Spontaneously reported reactions, AEs, and concomitant medications will be 
collected, as described in Section 8.5 and Section 9.0. 
l. Assess status of symptoms at baseline specific to the study population. 
m. Remind the subject that the last integrative session in Stage 1 that this will be the 
last in-person visit prior to the 6-month Follow-up visit, and that some measures 
will be collected monthly by mail. 
n. Review how to use the Memory Aid Card with the subject. Subjects will use this 
card to record AEs, medications, and changes in psychiatric status that they will 
be asked about at the 6-month follow-up visit. Memory Aids will not be collected.

Page 38 of 72 5.2.8 Open-Label Stage 2  
During Stage 2: 
 
a. Subjects will be reminded that participation in Stage 2 is voluntary and optional. 
b. Subjects who elect to cross over to Stage 2 will undergo the same course of 
therapy and evaluation as in Stage 1, but with 75 mg MDMA during the first 
experimental session and will escalate to 125mg MDMA during the second 
experimental session, unless contraindicated. 
c. Subjects will have the same sequence of experimental sessions and integrative 
sessions as subjects receiving MDMA in Stage 1 in an open-label context. Visits 
will be scheduled consecutively according to the Time and Events Table.

experimental sessions and one month after both experimental sessions during 
Stage 2. 
g. Stage 2 subjects will not complete an additional 6-month follow-up. 
h. Stage 2 subjects will complete the termination visit at the end of the final 
integrative session. 
 
5.3 Randomization and Subject Numbering 
 
Prior to enrollment, subjects will be tracked with their initials and a screening number 
assigned sequentially starting at “ S001”. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no 
exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be assigned a four-digit subject 
number. The first two digits wil l be “ A1” and will identify the protocol number. The next 
two digits identify the subject within the site and will be assigned sequentially, with 01 
corresponding to the first subject enrolled, e.g. the first enrolled subject will be A101, the 
second will be A102, etc. 
 
In total, 12 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Stage 1 will be blinded and randomized 
and there will be an 8:4 ratio between subjects in the MDMA and placebo conditions. An 
unblinded Randomization Monitor will generate the randomization list. Subjects will be 
assigned subject numbers and this number will be used to ensure that confidentiality and 
HIPAA compliance is maintained throughout the study. Upon enrolling a subject, the PI 
will be provided with an enrollment code for that subject. Container numbers will be pre-
printed on the container labels corresponding to doses for individual experimental 
sessions. Randomization will be performed at least 24 hours before the experimental 
session for each subject. The therapists will utilize a web-based randomization program 
to obtain the container assignment for each experimental session. Blinded personnel will 
conduct all study evaluations in the randomized portion of the study until the blind is 
broken for each subject per protocol via the web-based randomization program. Detailed 
instructions will be provided to the site in a separate document.

Page 39 of 72 If there is an emergency requiring knowledge of subject's condition assignment, the blind 
may be broken for an individual subject. The PI will be provided with sealed emergency 
unblinding envelopes corresponding to each enrollment code. These sealed envelopes 
will be stored in a secure limited access area and should remain sealed if there are no 
emergency unblinding events during the study.  
 
5.4 Removal of Subjects from the Study 
 
Subjects can withdraw consent at any time without prejudice. The therapists can 
withdraw a subject if, in their clinical judgment, it is in the best interest of the subject or 
if the subject cannot comply with elements of the protocol that are critical for safety or 
for the scientific integrity of the study. If the therapists withdraw a subject from the 
study, the therapists will explain the reason for withdrawing the subject. The reason for 
early termination will be recorded in the s ubject’s Source Records and CRF.  
 
If a subject develops any exclusion criteria that in the opinion of the Medical Monitor, 
affects the safety of the subject, including psychiatric diagnosis, pregnancy, or requiring 
use of excluded medications, the subject will discontinue treatment but remain in the 
study for follow-up purposes. Whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the 
follow-up will be carried out. Efforts will be made to obtain information about AE 
outcomes, if deemed necessary by the PI, Data Safety Monitor, Medical Monitor, and/or 
sponsor. 
 
Subjects discontinuing treatment before the first experimental session will be replaced 
until blinded data has been collected from 12 subjects. Subjects who discontinue 
participation after the first experimental session will not be replaced, and an intent- to-
treat analysis will be conducted with all available data. Subjects discontinuing treatment 
prior to the second experimental session will be asked to complete integrative therapy 
sessions, outcome assessments prior to discontinuation and complete the six-month 
follow-up assessment if possible. The blind will not be broken for these subjects until 
after the six-month follow-up assessments have been completed.  
 
5.5 Premature Discontinuation of the Study 
 
The sponsor or the PI (following consultation with the sponsor) has the right to 
discontinue this study at any time. If the trial is prematurely terminated, the PI is to 
promptly inform the study subjects and will assure appropriate therapy and follow-up. If 
the trial or study is prematurely discontinued, all procedures and requirements pertaining 
to retention and storage of documents will be observed. All other study materials will be 
returned to the sponsor and will be treated in accordance with federal and state 
regulations. 
 
6.0 Investigational Product 
 
6.1 Description of Active Compounds 
 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 40 of 72 The investigational product to be used in this protocol is MDMA. This ring-substituted 
phenethylamine has a complex pharmacology, but it acts most prominently as a 
monoamine releaser and uptake inhibitor [156-158]. MDMA primarily releases serotonin 
but also releases adrenaline and dopamine. It is also an indirect serotonin receptor 
agonist. See Section 2.2.3 and the IB for more information and references on the 
investigational product. 
 
6.2 Preparation and Administration 
 
6.2.1 Doses 
 
Doses of MDMA to be used in this study will be 75 mg, 100 mg or 125 mg MDMA.  
Upon enrollment, the first six subjects (Group 1) will be randomized to receive one dose 
of either placebo (N=2) or 75 mg MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one 
month later, Group 1 subjects randomized to MDMA will escalate to 100 mg MDMA, 
unless contraindicated by safety and tolerability concerns. The second six subjects 
(Group 2) will be randomized to receive one dose of either placebo (N=2) or 100 mg 
MDMA (N=4). In the second experimental session one month later, Group 2 subject s 
randomized to MDMA will escalate to 125 mg MDMA, unless contraindicated by safety 
and tolerability concerns. Subjects randomized to placebo in Group 1 and Group 2 will 
receive placebo in both experimental sessions also scheduled one month apart. The blind 
will be maintained through the six-month follow-up for each individual subject, after 
which the blind will be broken. Placebo subjects will be offered an open-label extension 
(Stage 2) with two experimental sessions scheduled one month apart, in addition to three 
hour-long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session. Stage 2 
subjects will receive 75 mg MDMA in the first experimental session and will escalate to 
125mg MDMA in the second experimental session, unless contraindicated by safety and 
tolerability concerns from other subjects in Stage 1. 
 
6.2.2 Compounding and Encapsulation 
 
All drug shipments will be conducted in compliance with national and international 
controlled substance laws. Schedule 1 licenses will be obtained from the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA) whenever applicable. MDMA in bulk will be sent from the 
Schedule 1 storage facility to the Schedule 1 license holder for the study. The Schedule 1 
license holder and unblinded Randomization Monitor will oversee compounding by a 
pharmacist in a manner that will maintain the blind for the Schedule 1 license holder. The 
pharmacist will provide bulk lactose for compounding MDMA capsules. The pharmacist 
will compound the MDMA in bulk and then weigh the MDMA into doses of 75 mg, 100 
mg, and 125mg (calculated as the weight of the hydrochloride salt) and place it in gelatin 
capsules with lactose. Placebo capsules will contain only lactose. All capsules will be 
compounded so that they weigh the same amount, but contain varying amounts of 
MDMA and lactose. 
 
6.2.3 Labeling

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 41 of 72 During compounding, bulk MDMA will be stored in a holding box prior to encapsulation. 
Each holding box will be labeled with the protocol code, drug name, lot number, sponsor 
name, and a statement that the drug is for clinical trial use only (see box label). 
 
The doses of MDMA for a single subject to complete one experimental session will be 
stored in a single container labeled with the protocol code, drug name, lot number, unique 
container number, sponsor name, and a statement that the drug is for clinical trial use 
only (see container label). Each dose of MDMA for each experimental session will be 
labeled and stored individually within the container (see container labels for each session 
and dose). Labels will be provided by the sponsor and applied by the pharmacist. During 
packaging and labeling, the randomization list will be hidden from the PI and therapists 
to assure blinding. All drug labels will comply with federal and state regulations.

Page 42 of 72 MDMA is a Schedule 1 compound and will be stored and handled in compliance with all 
relevant federal and state regulations. In accordance with these requirements, the 
Schedule 1 license holder will be responsible for storing, dispensing, and administering 
the investigational product. It will be stored in a secure safe, in accordance with 
international, federal and state regulations.  
 
Investigational product will only be removed from the safe for one experimental session 
at a time prior to the session and the investigational product will not leave the control of 
the Schedule 1 license holder until consumed by the designated subject. All doses 
administered will be recorded on the appropriate accountability logs. 
 
Records pertaining to the use of scheduled, regulated compounds will be maintained in 
accordance with all relevant regulations.  
 
6.5 Stability 
 
Complete details on the chemistry, manufacturing, and control of the MDMA to be used 
are described in Drug Master file (DMF) # 6293. As described in that file, MDMA was 
prepared for human consumption in 1985 by David Nichols, Ph.D., at the Dept. of 
Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Purdue University. The identity and purity of 
this MDMA was confirmed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in 
1997, as described in DMF # 6293, and was found to be 99.87% pure. On August 12, 
2002, Chemic Laboratories reanalyzed the MDMA at the request of the sponsor prior to 
starting MAPS’ first U.S. pilot study of MDMA -assisted psychotherapy in people with 
PTSD. The analysis found the MDMA to be more than 99.7% pure. A more recent 
analysis performed by Nichols at the request of researcher Dr. Carl Hart on February, 
2006, continued to find a high degree of purity. This analysis found the MDMA in 
question to be 99.9% pure. This MDMA is currently in use in an ongoing investigation of 
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the U.S. The MDMA is currently stored at Organix, 
Inc. and will be shipped from that facility for the study. 
 
7.0 Risks of Participation 
7.1 Risks and Discomforts Associated with Non-drug and Experimental Sessions and 
Assessment of Measures 
In preparation for drug-assisted therapy sessions, blood draws and a full medical 
examination are required to establish eligibility for the study and for biomarker analyses. 
Temporary discomfort, inflammation, or infection could arise as a result of sampling 
blood at the punctured vein. Submitting to a full medical examination may also cause 
discomfort or psychological distress. Since medical examinations and blood draws are 
required to establish eligibility for the study, they cannot be omitted from the protocol. 
 
During screening, non-drug and drug-assisted therapy sessions and assessment of study 
measures, subjects will be asked to think about and discuss their thoughts and emotions 
relating to social anxiety symptoms. They may experience intense emotional responses to 
recalling and speaking about this material. In a therapeutic context, thinking about and 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 43 of 72 discussing the effects of social anxiety on life function can produce distress during and 
immediately after non-drug therapy, experimental, and open-label sessions. Therapy is 
conducted as part of this study, and people undergoing therapy are expected to confront 
unpleasant thoughts, feelings and memories in the process of therapy. Because therapy is 
an integral part of the research study design, the potential distress arising from therapy is 
unavoidable.  
 
All in-person sessions after enrollment may be recorded to video for research and training 
purposes. Subjects may feel uncomfortable with having their sessions recorded. Subjects 
may have access to recordings if they request them. The recordings are necessary for 
developing the experimental treatment. Subjects will receive information on who will 
have access to any of their recordings outside of a research and training setting and will 
have control over any presentation of this material beyond viewing by researchers or 
regulatory agencies. 
 
7.2 Risks of Receiving MDMA 
Spontaneously reported reactions and common adverse effects of MDMA are modest and 
have generally not been associated with serious discomfort by healthy volunteers and 
PTSD subjects in previous studies. Common reactions include lack of appetite, insomnia, 
dizziness, tight jaw or bruxism (tooth-grinding), difficulty concentrating, impaired gait or 
balance, dry mouth, ruminations, and thirst. Other slightly less common reactions include 
restlessness, parasthesias (odd somatic feelings, such as tingling or feeling hot or cold), 
impaired judgment, perspiration, drowsiness, and nystagmus (eye-wiggling). While 
anxiety, headache, fatigue, insomnia, and lack of appetite were spontaneously reported by 
40% to 80% of subjects in both conditions in MAPS study MP-1 (N=23), tight jaw, 
nausea, impaired gait/balance, and sensitivity to cold were more often reported by 
subjects in the MDMA than the placebo condition, and irritability was slightly more 
likely to be reported in the placebo condition. Additionally, subjects in the MDMA 
condition were more likely to report muscle tension in various body parts and diarrhea.  
 
These effects are transient and diminish as drug effects wane. Sub-acute effects that may 
either continue for the next 24 hours or appear later include insomnia, fatigue, needing 
more sleep, weakness, heavy legs, dry mouth, low mood, or irritability. Sub-acute effects 
are reported less often than acute effects. More information on spontaneously reported 
reactions is described in the IB.  
 
MDMA may produce mild alterations in sensory perception and altered perception of 
time [78, 109, 159]. Women may be more sensitive to these effects [124]. MDMA 
acutely affects attention, information processing, and memory. MDMA acutely impairs 
verbal memory and recall for object location without affecting recall of complex scene 
changes [114]. For this reason, subjects will stay close to the site overnight and will not 
be permitted to drive after experimental sessions.  
 
MDMA may produce modest changes in immune functioning, lasting up to 48 hours. 
Because of their limited duration, these changes are not likely to have clinical

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 44 of 72 significance beyond several days of possible increased risk of viral upper respiratory 
infection or similar illness.  
 
Further information on the risks associated with MDMA, including information drawn 
from case reports and studies of ecstasy users, can be found in the IB.  
 
7.2.1 Cardiovascular and Sympathomimetic Effects 
The MDMA dose of 125 mg is expected to produce significant but transient, self-limited 
increases in blood pressure and heart rate. These changes should last no more than six 
hours. In less than 5% of volunteers in Phase 1 studies, peak blood pressure values were 
higher than 140/90 mmHg. Clinical intervention was not required in any of these cases. 
Nonetheless, careful monitoring of subjects and predefined contingency plans will allow 
the researchers to rapidly identify and manage any related toxicity. For more information, 
see the IB. 
 
Risks posed by elevated blood pressure will be addressed by excluding people with pre-
existing hypertension and monitoring blood pressure and pulse, as described in Section 
5.1.2. During experimental sessions, the PI will be present throughout and will 
continually evaluate the patient for increasing blood pressure and signs or symptoms of a 
developing hypertensive or other cardiovascular emergency. Subjects reporting chest 
pain, shortness of breath, neurological symptoms, or other potential indicators of 
hypertension will have more frequent measurements and assessment by the PI. Any 
subject who experiences medical complications during an experimental session will not 
be given another experimental session, unless it is approved by the PI, the Data Safety 
Monitor and the Medical Monitor. Subjects who are excluded from receiving another 
experimental session would continue in integrative therapy sessions and follow-up 
assessments whenever possible.  
 
If a subject has a sustained blood pressure of 180 systolic and/or 110 diastolic without 
evidence of end organ damage (such as chest pain, shortness of breath, signs of 
encephalopathy), then the responsible physician should make a judgment about possible 
treatment. In most cases, the most appropriate course would be to monitor the subject 
clinically and wait for the hypertensive effect of the MDMA to wear off. If the blood 
pressure remains elevated above 180 systolic and/or 110 diastolic and is not decreasing 
three to four hours after MDMA administration, or if for some other reason the PI deem s 
gradual treatment appropriate, then oral carvedilol would be a good choice because of its 
mixed alpha and beta blocking effects [160].  If the blood pressure is in the range of 180 
systolic and/or 110 diastolic or higher with accompanying evidence of end organ damage, 
then a hypertensive emergency would be indicated and the subject should be transported 
to the medical Emergency Department at the site for definitive evaluation and treatment 
with intravenous drugs for more rapid management of the blood pressure and any 
complications. Reasons for moving a patient to the medical Emergency Department 
would include, but not be limited to, severe headache in the setting of hypertension, 
angina, or neurological deficits regardless of blood pressure. The PI may, at any time,

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 45 of 72 make a clinical judgment to transfer the patient to the medical Emergency Department for 
closer monitoring and additional treatment.  
 
The PI will be prepared to respond to rare complications of cardiovascular effects, such 
as stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). If any subject has neurological deficits, 
as assessed by the PI, whether or not they are associated with hypertensive crisis, they 
will receive oxygen and will be monitored, as described below. If evaluation at the 
medical Emergency Department reveals a nonhemorrhagic stroke, there will be sufficient 
time to administer recombinant tissue plasminogen within the three-hour time frame 
recommended in the American Academy of Neurology/American Heart Association 
guidelines [161, 162]. 
 
The PI will observe the subject and note any complaints of chest pain. If a subject 
experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated with hypertensive 
crisis, he or she will receive heart rhythm monitoring, oxygen, and will be monitored as 
described above. If necessary, he or she will be transported to the Harbor-UCLA Medical 
Center medical Emergency Department or a location in the hospital where appropriate 
care can be given. The subject will be given nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL q 5 minutes as 
needed (PRN) chest pain pending transport to the hospital. If further evaluation at the 
hospital reveals that the subject has had an AMI, they will be well within the time frame 
required for definitive therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association guidelines for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 
recommend percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) as the treatment of 
choice when it can be performed within 90 minutes of arrival at the hospital in patients 
who present within 12 hours of an episode of chest pain lasting more than 30 minutes and 
who have ECG evidence of AMI [163].  
 
7.2.2 Psychological Distress 
Mild anxiety and depressed mood are occasionally reported one to three days after 
MDMA administration [76, 124, and see the IB]. Psychological distress from MDMA 
could arise from the first indications of drug effects until the last effects have dissipated 
(approximately three to five hours after drug administration) or even later. Anxiety or 
distress during the session may last for as little as five minutes or for as long as five hours 
or more. In addition, psychological distress could arise following an experimental session 
as a result of subjects having difficulty integrating their experience after the MDMA 
effect has subsided. In previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, these symptoms have been 
self-limiting and have responded well to reassurance from the therapists, with occasional 
PRN use of benzodiazepines for anxiety. In this study, subjects spontaneously might 
confront and work through unpleasant experiences. Accordingly, signs of psychological 
distress, panic, or other unpleasant psychological reactions are to be expected and may be 
considered an element of the therapeutic process.  
 
Proper preparation and follow-up support will reduce the difficulties subjects might have 
with acute or sub-acute reactions. The potential for destabilizing psychological distress 
will be minimized by:

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 46 of 72  
 Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed 
with bipolar affective disorder – 1, psychotic disorders) 
 Preparatory non-drug therapy sessions before the experimental session 
 Creating an atmosphere of trust during the experimental session 
 Close monitoring 
 Daily contact with subjects for the period of a week after the experimental session 
 Providing non-drug integrative therapy sessions 
 
During the preparatory sessions, subjects will be made aware of the fact that difficult 
emotions, including grief, rage, anxiety, fear or panic, may arise during experimental 
sessions. Every effort will be made to help subjects resolve difficult symptoms and to 
arrive at a more comfortable and relaxed state by the conclusion of the experimental 
session, including empathic listening on the part of the therapists and performance of 
diaphragmatic breathing by subjects.  
 
At the end of the seven hour experimental session, if the subject is still severely agitated 
or experiencing any other severe psychological distress, the following measures will be 
taken:  
 
 If the subject is anxious, agitated, in danger of any self-harm, or is suicidal at the 
end of the experimental session, the therapists will remain with the subject for at 
least two more hours. During this time, the therapists will employ affect 
management techniques, will talk with the subject to help him or her gain 
cognitive perspective of their experiences, and will help the subject implement the 
self-soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the preparatory 
sessions. If this situation should occur during an integrative session, at least one 
of the therapists will be available to stay with the subject for at least two 
additional hours. 
 If a subject remains severely anxious, agitated, in danger of self-harm or suicide, 
or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the end of this two-hour  
stabilization period, the PI will decide between the following options: 
 
1. The Harbor-UCLA psychiatric Emergency Department will admit the 
subject for direct monitoring until the time of his or her appointment 
with the therapists the next day. The therapists will then meet with the 
subject daily if necessary until the period of destabilization has passed.  
2. If a subject experiences severe, persisting emotional distress, such as 
panic attacks, severe generalized anxiety, or insomnia following an 
MDMA session, the PI may prescribe a benzodiazepine, atypical 
antipsychotic, or zolpidem as a “rescue medication.” Any atypical 
antipsychotic medications used during the experimental session or the 
week after should not be primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, such as 
quetiapine instead of risperidone. This medication will be captured on 
the concomitant medications CRF page. The physician should not

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 47 of 72 prescribe an SSRI, SNRI, or MAOI in this context, unless it has been 
determined that the subject will be withdrawn from the study. Residual 
symptoms will be addressed during the frequent follow-up therapy 
visits with the therapists. 
3. Hospitalization for stabilization. If a subject should become psychotic, 
arrangements will be made to stabilize them and transfer them to the 
psychiatric Emergency Department at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
if necessary. 
 
Subjects hospitalized after a severe panic or anxiety reaction will be suspended from the 
protocol until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the PI will carefully evaluate 
the subject’s emotional status. Subjects will continue with non-drug integrative therapy 
visits and follow-up assessments whenever possible. 
 
For those subjects engaged in an ongoing therapeutic relationship with a psychotherapist 
or psychiatrist, the subject’s outside therapists will be involved in the manage ment of any 
psychiatric complications. For those subjects engaged in an ongoing psychotherapeutic 
relationship with the PI, the management of any psychiatric complications will be 
undertaken by them in their capacity as the subject’s therapist.  
 
7.2.3 Body Temperature 
MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body 
temperature [124]. Ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight 
elevation in humans.  
 
If temperature rises more than 1° C, attempts will be made to lower it by removing 
blankets and layers of clothing, decreasing the ambient temperature, and, if necessary, 
directing a fan toward the subject. If at any time the temperature rises more than 1.5° C 
above baseline despite these efforts, the PI will be present at all times and will determine 
the need for further evaluation and treatment.  
 
7.2.4 Reproductive and Developmental Risks 
Risks posed by MDMA to pregnant women are not known. One of two studies of Ecstasy 
users suggests that use of Ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be associated 
with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association [164, 165], 
and a third reported some developmental delays in mothers reporting use of ecstasy and 
other drugs during pregnancy [166]. These studies are discussed in the IB. 
 
Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from participation in the study. Women 
who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before 
undergoing each experimental session and must agree to use birth control for the 
treatment portion of the study.

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 48 of 72 Some researchers believe that MDMA is neurotoxic in humans even at doses used in 
clinical trials [167]. However, they are basing their case on studies that employed 
inappropriately high doses of MDMA utilized in animal studies and on human studies 
comparing the effects of repeated use of Ecstasy, often along with other drugs. 
Meanwhile, another recently published meta-analysis has taken careful steps to overcome 
methodological limitations in previous work and found only modest evidence of 
neurotoxicity [168]. We have carefully considered the risks of such neurotoxicity and 
conclude that they are minimal in the proposed study. This conclusion is supported by 
empirical and toxicokinetic evidence and is consistent with the lack of toxicity reported 
in previous clinical MDMA studies. More information on the potential neurotoxicity of 
MDMA can be found in the IB.  
 
7.2.6 Risk Mitigation 
 
Careful review of medical screening data will be utilized to exclude potential subjects 
with pre-existing exclusionary medical conditions from the study. Study procedures have 
been developed to mitigate the risks of receiving MDMA described in detail in the IB. 
Ambient temperature will be kept at a comfortable level during Experimental sessions. 
Subjects will not be allowed to drink more than 3L of fluids over the course of the 
experimental session and fluid intake will be spread out appropriately during the session. 
Fluids administered will include electrolytes. If a subject exhibits any signs of toxicity or 
clinically significant dilutional hyponatremia despite these precautions after an 
experimental session, subjects will be excluded from receiving future experimental 
sessions, unless approved by the PI, Data Safety Monitor, and the Medical Monitor.  
 
7.3 Abuse Liability 
 
Findings in humans and animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse 
potential that is higher than that reported for “classic hallucinogens,” like psilocybin, but 
lower than that reported for psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. 
More information on abuse liability is provided in the IB. 
 
To ensure MDMA-assisted therapy does not cause  autistic adults to develop symptoms 
of drug abuse after the treatment period of the study, drug use is monitored during the 
follow-up period. Based on long-term follow-up data from two sponsor-supported studies 
(N=32), only one subject took Ecstasy after completing the study and failed to reproduce 
the experience from the study and a number of subjects volunteered that they would 
never seek out Ecstasy outside a legal, controlled, therapeutic setting. In addition, 
negative results from MDMA-specific drug testing data obtained from the Swiss study 
MP-2 (N=12) supports that none of these subjects took Ecstasy outside of the study 
during a 12-month follow-up period.  
 
Diversion is not an issue in this protocol because MDMA will only be administered in a 
controlled environment under the supervision of the PI and no take-home doses will be 
permitted. MDMA will be handled following all regulations pertaining to the handling 
and dispensing of controlled substances within research studies.

8.0 Adverse Events 
 
8.1 Adverse Events 
 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in 
a clinical research study subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the 
subject’s involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation 
in the research. This definition includes concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation 
of pre-existing conditions.  
 
An unexpected adverse event  is one that is not listed in the current IB or an event that is 
by nature more specific or more severe than a listed event. 
 
All AEs will be monitored by the therapists until resolution or, if the AE becomes 
chronic, a cause can be identified. If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the 
protocol, a clinical assessment will be made by the CI and/or Medical Monitor as to 
whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted. 
 
The severity of events reported on the “Adverse Events” CRF will be determined by the 
PI as: 
 
 Mild: No limitation in normal daily activity 
 Moderate: Some limitation in normal daily activity 
 Severe: Unable to perform normal daily activity 
 
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by the PI based on 
the following definitions: 
 
1. “Not Related”: The AE is not related if exposure to the investigational product has not 
occurred, or the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related in time, or the AE is 
considered unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product, i.e. there are no 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, or the AE is more likely 
related to the subject’s  pre-existing condition. 
 
2. “Possibly Related”: The administration of the investigational product and AE are 
considered reasonably related in time and the AE could be explained by causes other than 
exposure to the investigational product. 
 
3. “Probably Related”: Exposure to the investigational product and AE are reasonably 
related in time and the investigational product is more likely than other causes to be 
responsible for the AE, or is the most likely cause of the AE. 
 
8.2 Spontaneously Reported Reaction s

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 50 of 72 Commonly expected spontaneously reported reactions to MDMA are collected on a 
separate CRF page and will be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Common, 
expected reactions are defined as those most frequently reported in the literature and 
include:  Anxiety, Diarrhea, Difficulty Concentrating, Dizziness, Drowsiness, Dry 
Mouth, Fatigue, Headache, Heavy Legs, Impaired Gait/Balance, Impaired Judgment, 
Increased Irritability, Insomnia, Jaw Clenching or Tight Jaw, Lack of Appetite, Low 
Mood, Muscle Tension, Nausea, Need More Sleep, Nystagmus, Parasthesias, 
Perspiration, Restlessness, Rumination (increased private worries), Sensitivity to Cold, 
Thirst, and Weakness.  
 
Spontaneously reported reactions will be collected during the experimental session and 
the seven days of telephone contact following the integrative session that occurs on the 
day after each experimental session. Each reported reaction will be followed during 
follow-up phone calls or visits until resolution. Reactions that persist beyond the seven 
days after each experimental session will be recorded as AEs on the AE CRF page. 
 
8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (i.e. the subject was, in the opinion of the CI, at immediate risk 
of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the event causes 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage 
 Is an important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life-
threatening or resulting in death or hospitalization, but based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. 
 
AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious. It should be noted 
that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, by  
definition, be severe. 
 
In addition, a pre-existing event or condition that results in hospitalization should be 
recorded on the medical history. The hospitalization would not result in the event or  
condition being reported as a study-related SAE, unless, in the view of th e PI, 
hospitalization was prolonged as a result of participation in the clinical trial or was 
necessary due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition. This is because the onset of 
the event (the reason for the procedure) occurred before the subject was entered in the 
trial. Hospitalization for cosmetics, non-emergency prophylaxis, or abortion does not

Page 51 of 72 result in an SAE report, unless, in the view of the PI, hospitalization for these procedures 
was prolonged as a result of participation in the clinical trial. 
 
8.4 Medical Emergencies 
 
The sessions will be conducted in an outpatient research building on the campus of the 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, which is a 10 minute walk from the Emergency 
Department. The PI will conduct all experimental sessions accompanied by co-
investigator Alicia Danforth. The co-therapist or PI will be available via mobile phone or 
pager throughout the study if any problem occurs when a subject is not at the site. 
Subjects will continue to see their outside therapist throughout the study. For a recently 
completed Phase 2 trial, the sponsor has established contingency plans for responding to 
those AEs that appear most likely, based on a comprehensive review of literature 
described in the current IB. The same contingency plans and equipment will be used in 
this protocol.  
 
8.5 Adverse Event Collection 
 
The PI will be responsible for reviewing and confirming all AEs and SAEs collected 
during the study. The co-therapist or PI will collect AEs during study visits after 
enrollment.  
 
All SAEs will be collected for the duration of the protocol. All SAEs which occur during 
the course of the trial, whether considered to be associated with the study drug or not, 
have to be reported within 24 hours of the CI’s awareness of their occurrence. All SAE 
reports should be faxed to the sponsor. A fax number will be provided to the site in 
separate site-specific instruction for SAE reporting. In addition to the fax, the PI, or 
designee should call the Clinical Research Associate ( CRA ) during normal working 
hours and verbally inform the CRA of the SAE. During off business hours or if medical 
advice is needed immediately, the sponsor Medical Monitor will be called . SAE reporting 
instructions with all contact numbers will be provided to the site prior to study start.  
 
The following symptoms will be assessed at baseline and exacerbations during the study 
will be tracked and categorized as mild, moderate, or severe on a separate Symptoms 
CRF log page: Persistent feelings of alienation, Rigidity, Tremor, Dystonic Symptoms, 
Akathisia, Increased Motor Activity, Decreased Motor Activity, Sensory Hyperarousal, 
Excitement/Agitation.  
 
AEs to be collected during the study are: 
 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be collected from enrollment through 
termination.  
 All AEs and spontaneously reported reactions will be collected on the day of and 
seven days after each experimental session or until they resolve.

Page 52 of 72  AEs requiring medical attention, including a doctor visit or treatment with 
prescription medication, will be collected from the first experimental session 
through the final integrative session after the second experimental session. 
 AEs related to planned treatments or physician visits for baseline conditions 
collected in the Medical History will not be collected unless there is an 
exacerbation of the condition. 
 Any AE leading to withdrawal will be collected throughout the study. 
 All AEs related to changes in psychiatric status will be collected throughout the 
study. 
 Any exacerbations of Symptoms recorded at Medical History will be collected 
throughout the study. 
 
A Memory Aid Card will be provided to the subject on the last visit prior to the 6-month 
follow-up to record information on medications taken to treat SAEs, AEs leading to 
withdrawal and psychiatric AEs during the follow-up period during the follow-up period. 
The Memory Aid Card will not be collected, but information from the card will be used 
to aid the subjects in providing information to the CI.

9.0 Concomitant Medications and Tapering Instructions 
 
The PI will record concomitant medications during screening. If the subject is being 
treated with psychiatric drugs at the time he or she is recruited into the study, the 
prospective subject will be encouraged to discuss medication tapering with his or her 
outside treating physician, if any, and will be required to give the PI permission to do so 
as well. The drugs will then be tapered in an appropriate fashion to avoid withdrawal 
effects. They will be discontinued long enough before the first experimental session to 
avoid the possibility of any drug interactions (the interval will be at least five times the 
particular drug’s half -life).

The therapists will request information about any changes in medication just prior to each 
experimental session. The PI will be responsible for reviewing and confirming all 
medications collected during the study.  
 
All medications, over the counter (OTC) and prescription, will be collected from 
screening through seven days after the last experimental session. From the end of the 
seven days after the last experimental session through the 6-month follow-up visit, only 
prescription or OTC medications taken to treat AEs will be collected. Throughout the 
protocol all medications used to treat AEs will be collected as specified in Section 8.5 
and all changes to psychiatric medications will be collected, including discontinuations or 
additions. Medications will be recorded on the concomitant medications CRF.  
 
Subjects must be willing to refrain from taking any psychiatric medications during 
treatments received in Stage 1 and Stage 2. If the subject is on stimulants for ADHD at 
baseline, they can continue to use them at the same dose and frequency, as long as they 
utilize a washout period of at least five half-lives of the drug and active metabolites plus 
one week for stabilization before each experimental session and do not restart for ten 
days after each experimental session.  
 
The PI may prescribe a designated rescue medication in the event of symptoms that 
require it during or after the experimental session (e.g. insomnia or severe anxiety that 
does not respond to other management). Rescue medications may be benzodiazepines 
such as lorazepam, or sedative hypnotics such as zolpidem, or atypical antipsychotics. 
Any atypical antipsychotic medications used during the experimental session or the week 
after should not be primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, such as quetiapine instead of 
risperidone. SSRIs, SNRIs, and MAOIs should not be used as rescue medications.

Subjects must agree that, for one week preceding the MDMA session: 
a. They will refrain from taking any herbal supplement (except with prior approval 
of the research team).  
b. They will refrain from taking any prescription or nonprescription medications 
(with the exception of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, 
birth control pills, thyroid hormones, or other medications approved by the 
research team).  
 
Subjects may return to taking psychiatric medications and discontinue birth control 
during the follow-up period if necessary. Subjects will receive a Memory Aid Card to 
record these medications between the final integrative visit in Stage 1 and the 6-month 
follow-up, as described in Section 8.5. Subjects will use this card to record changes in 
psychiatric medications that they will be asked about at the 6-month follow-up visit. 
Memory Aids will not be collected.  
 
10.0 Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
 
10.1 Screening Assessments 
 
A central laboratory will perform clinical laboratory tests conducted at screening to 
establish medical eligibility. Effective clinical lab normal ranges will be provided by the 
clinical laboratory and kept on file in the ISF. Abnormal clinically significant clinical 
laboratory results will be reported as a part of Medical History and must be recorded on 
the Medical History CRF page. The PI will examine laboratory assessments gathered 
during screening to assess subject eligibility usi ng the appropriate list of normal ranges to 
conclude whether subjects are eligible for the protocol, and will indicate justification for 
admitting subjects with abnormal values, after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
 
The following laboratory assessments will be performed as a part of screening:

10.2 Biomarker Analysis 
 
Biomarker laboratory analyses will be performed using plasma for OT, AVP, and CORT 
collected from all subjects at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center according to the Time 
and Events Table. For blood samples, a butterfly needle will be used to draw 30mL of 
blood into chilled EDTA vacutainer tubes. Samples will be immediately placed on wet 
ice. Plasma will be extracted by centrifugation in a refrigerated (4oC) centrifuge at 1,300g 
for 10 minutes, aliquotted into individual tubes, and stored at -80oC at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center prior to shipment to the collaborating site at Stanford University Medical 
Center. Biomarker analyses will be performed by Dr. Dean Carson and Dr. Karen Parker 
in Dr. Parker’s laboratory at the Stanford University Medical Center in Stanford, 
California (collaborating site). Concentrations of OT and A VP will be quantified using 
commercially available enzyme immunoassay kits (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, 
New York) and concentrations of CORT will be quantified using radio immunoassay kits 
(Siemens, Deerfield, Illinois) that have been validated for use in humans. These kits are 
highly specific and exclusively recognize OT, A VP and CORT respectively, and not 
related peptides. Plasma samples are extracted using Strata-X columns and then assayed 
in duplicate and measured using a tunable microplate reader for 96-well format according 
to manufacturer’s instructions.  
 
11.0 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Documentation 
 
Prior to trial initiation, the CI must provide to MAPS a fully executed and signed FDA 
Form 1572 and a Financial Disclosure Form.  Financial Disclosure Forms also must be 
completed for all sub-investigators listed on the Form 1572 who will be directly involved 
in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects in this trial. 
The CI, therapists, and study staff will be trained prior to the start of the study. The trial 
will be administered and monitored by employees or representatives of the sponsor. The 
site and collaborating sites will be monitored as appropriate for the rate of enrollment in 
order to comply with GCP guidelines and to ensure validity of the study data.  During 
each monitoring visit, source data verification will be performed to ensure compliance, 
including accurate and complete recording of data on CRFs, source documents, and drug 
accountability records. A CRF collation supplied by the sponsor will be completed for 
each subject enrolled. Study monitor contact information, monitoring and auditing 
procedures will be supplied in a separate document.  
 
During or after the study, the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or representatives of the 
sponsor may request access to all source documents, CRFs and other protocol 
documentation for on-site audit or inspection.

Page 57 of 72 This study is primarily a safety study that will also obtain estimates of effect size  
compari ng MDMA vs. placebo using observer-blind data from the LSAS as the primary 
outcome measure. MDMA doses are not expected to differ greatly in treatment outcomes 
and will be combined for effect size estimates. Descriptive statistics will be computed 
overall for MDMA and placebo, and within the MDMA dose groups for all available data 
from outcome measures, including minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation. 
Distributional characteristics will be examined for outliers and extreme values and, if 
either is evident, nonparametric statistics will be utilized in the analysis. Effect size for all 
outcome measures will be estimated using Cohen's techniques. 
 
The sponsor will examine MDMA and placebo groups for homogeneity through 
comparing demographic characteristics. There is no expectation that conditions will 
differ in composition by gender, race or ethnicity, duration of autism diagnosis, or 
presence versus absence of other permitted psychiatric disorders, such as depression. 
However, owing to small sample size, such variations may arise by chance. If MDMA 
and placebo subjects differ upon a demographic variable, then the effects of this variable 
will be taken into account when looking at safety analyses. No systematic differences are 
expected.  
 
Primary and secondary outcome measure scores will be plotted across each time of 
administrations for trend analyses. The number of intervals will vary in accordance with 
times listed for each measure, but will include in most cases baseline, one or more times 
after the first experimental session, one or more times after the second experimental 
session and at six month follow up. Plots will be made for MDMA and placebo subjects, 
and if trends occur for MDMA subjects, separate exploratory plots will be made for 
outcome measures after 0, 75, 100 and 125 mg MDMA.  
 
The main estimates of effect size from blinded data will be conducted after the outcome 
measure assessments at the six-month follow-up are complete for all subjects. Data from 
all doses of MDMA during Stage 1 (n=16), to be compared with all data from placebo 
sessions (n=8), with each experimental session treated as an independent observation. 
The MDMA condition will encompass both Group 1 and Group 2 MDMA doses.  
Estimates of effect size will be obtained from BDI-II, STAI, PSS, IRI, RSES, ERQ, TAS-
20, and QoL- Q scores collected pre-treatment, during and after each experimental 
session, and the follow- up period, with p value set at 0.05. Effect size will be used to 
determine the appropriate sample size for future studies.  
 
Scores for BDI-II, STAI, PSS, IRI and RSES completed after each of the experimental 
session will be averaged to produce mean scores for these periods, including a post-
experimental session 1 and post-experimental session 2 average score. BDI-II, STAI and 
PSS scores gathered via postal mail at monthly intervals from two to five months after 
the second experimental session will be averaged to produce mean scores for the follow-
up period. Missing responses will be replaced with the sample average. These averages 
will be used for estimates of effect size.

Page 58 of 72 TASIT scores will be compared assessing baseline, after experimental session 1, after 
experimental session 2, at integrative session six and at 6-month follow up. Correlations 
between TASIT scores and LSAS scores at the time point following each TASIT score 
will be made to see whether increased awareness of social cues is associated with reduced 
social anxiety. MDMA dose will be used as a covariate in order to examine the potential 
relationship between dose and changes in one or more variable, with dose (75, 100 or 125 
mg) serving as the covariate.  
 
Biomarkers will be evaluated for predictive and prognostic power. Separate estimates of 
effect size will be performed for OT, AVP and CORT. Changes in biomarker 
concentrations from pre-treatment levels will be used to analyze effects of acute dosing 
and to determine the time-course of elevated OT and AVP levels post-drug. Pre-treatment 
biomarker concentrations will be evaluated for predictive power using an exploratory 
hierarchical regression analysis with condition assignment in Stage 1 and biomarker 
concentrations at baseline as predictors and treatment outcomes as dependent variables. 
One regression will be performed with biomarker values taken at the second experimental 
session. A second regression will be performed on biomarker values taken two weeks 
after the second experimental session. 
 
TAS-20 scores will be evaluated for predictive power using an exploratory hierarchical 
regression analysis with condition assignment in Stage 1 and TAS-20 scores at baseline 
as predictors and with LSAS scores as dependent measures. One regression will examine 
the predictive power of condition and baseline TAS-20 scores upon LSAS scores one 
month after the first experimental session and the other will investigate whether condition 
and baseline TAS-20 and will predict LSAS score at one month after the second 
experimental session. 
 
Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to the second experimental session will be 
asked to complete the final outcome assessment prior to continuing to the 6-month 
follow-up whenever possible. The data from these subjects will be tested for equivalence 
to data from subjects completing the study per protocol. If found to be equivalent, data 
from these subjects will be combined for an exploratory intent- to-treat effect size 
estimate to examine results without bias towards subjects more likely to complete the 
study per protocol.  
 
Stage 1 and Stage 2 outcomes in extension subjects will be compared after the outcome 
measure assessments are complete for all extension subjects. 
 
Descriptive statistics will be computed for vital signs and subjective distress during each 
experimental or open-label session. The sponsor will compare pre-drug and post-drug 
peak blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature during and after all experimental 
sessions by condition and MDMA dose. Analyses will compare peak vital signs between 
MDMA and placebo subjects, and a separate analysis will consider the effects of dose (0, 
75, 100 or 125 mg MDMA) upon vital signs.

Page 59 of 72 Frequency tables will be produced on prevalence of spontaneously reported reactions and 
AEs. Number and severity of spontaneously reported reactions will be compared in 
MDMA and placebo subjects using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 
effects of MDMA dose upon number and severity of spontaneously reported reactions 
will also be assessed. Presence and degree of exacerbated symptoms across MDMA and 
placebo participant will also be examined. 
 
Perceptions of study participation will be examined at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 
end of Stage 2 using the Feedback Questionnaire and a qualitative interview. The results 
of this qualitative analysis will inform the sponsor of expectancies and perceptions about 
study procedures for future protocol development. Similarly, belief of condition 
assignments collected during Stage 1 will be used to assess the effectiveness of the 
double-blind in preparation for future studies. Results from the Feedback Questionnaire 
and safety data will be utilized to find the appropriate active MDMA dose for future 
studies. 
 
To facilitate the planning of future studies, a preliminary estimate of effect size may be 
performed after all the subjects have completed the outcome assessments, one month 
after the second experimental session, but not all subjects have completed the s ix-month 
follow-up evaluation. This preliminary estimate will consist of safety and outcome 
measures. Results of the preliminary estimate will have no effect on study conduct.  
 
12.1 Statistical Power 
This is a pilot study intended to collect estimates of effect size of MDMA compared to 
placebo. The study is likely to be underpowered for detection of differences of a small or 
moderate effect size and it may detect differences if the effect size is large. Statistical 
power estimates were not available for this study, as this is the first prospective clinical 
trial of MDMA-assisted therapy for social anxiety in this population.  
 
13.0 Ethics 
This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented and reported in accordance 
with the ICH Harmonized Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local 
regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US Code of Federal Regulations 
Title 21) and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
The protocol, ICF and accompanying documents given to subjects must be reviewed and 
approved by a properly constituted IRB and FDA before study start. Signed and dated 
documentation of IRB and FDA approvals must be provided to the sponsor. Prior to 
study start, the PI is required to sign an Investigator Agreement page confirming her/his 
agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the 
instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data 
and records to the sponsor.

Page 60 of 72 14.0 Informed Consent 
A properly executed, written ICF, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH-
GCP Guidelines, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 
CFR 50.25[a, b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and applicable state regulations, will be 
obtained by a study therapist from each subject and support partner prior to entering the 
trial. In addition to the explanation of study visits, the ICF should include a HIPAA 
release giving the PI permission to access original medical records and processing of 
coded personal information. A copy of the ICF will be submitted by the PI to the IRB for 
review and approval prior to the start of the study. 
Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e. 
all of the procedures described in the protocol, including screening activities). 
Information about the study must be given orally and in an understandable form. Written 
information about the trial will also be provided. The subject and support partner should 
have the opportunity to inquire about details of the study and adequate time to consider 
participation. Subjects will be informed in the ICF that they may receive either MDMA 
or placebo during the study. The ICF and the HIPAA authorization must be signed and 
dated by the subject and support partner and must be countersigned by the qualified 
therapist who conducted the informed consent discussion (according to local, national, 
and international agreements and laws). The therapist will provide a copy of the signed 
ICF to each of the subjects and support partners, and will maintain the original in the 
subject’s source records.   
 
The subject and Support Partner are to be informed in a timely manner if new 
information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject's willingness to 
continue participation in the clinical study. The communication of this information is to 
be documented. The written ICF and any other written information to be provided to 
subject s and support partners should be revised whenever important new information 
becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent. Any revised ICF and 
written information should receive approval from an IRB before use. 
Subjects can withdraw consent at any time without prejudice. If a subject withdraws 
consent but does not revoke the HIPAA authorization, the PI will have full access to the 
subject’s medical records, including termination visit information. If a subject revokes 
only the HIPAA authorization, the PI will have full access to all of the subject’s medical 
records prior to the date and time of revocation. 
 
15.0 Confidentiality 
Every effort will be made to strictly safeguard the confidentiality of subjects in their role 
as research subjects. Removing identifying information from data and restricting access 
only to approved researchers should prevent the dissemination of confidential data, with 
or without identifying information. Except for the screening log, the informed consent 
and a subject contact information sheet that will be stored separately from other 
documents, all data will be identified only by the subject's initials on the source document 
MAPS Study MAA-1  Original Protocol Version 2 
U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 61 of 72 and four-digit subject number. If past medical records are needed, subjects will sign 
forms for the release of information upon consent to permit screening. Any materials 
mailed to subjects will be sent along with stamped return envelopes using the office 
address of the PI both as main and return address. All assessment records will be kept in a 
locked file drawer or cabinet in a locked office, and access to measures will be limited to 
regulatory agencies, researchers, and individuals analyzing data. Researchers, other than 
the PI who are directly involved in conducting the protocol, with access to data will not 
be provided with any information that would identify subjects by name or by other 
means. 
 
All in-person visits after enrollment may be recorded to video. Diagnostic assessments 
may also be video recorded to establish inter-rater reliability. These recordings will be 
used for treatment manual development and potentially for training therapists to perform 
MDMA-assisted therapy to reproduce results in subsequent studies. Recordings are 
intended to document the events occurring during in-person visits, and will not serve as 
outcome measures. Full names and addresses will not appear in these recordings. Copies 
of video recordings intended for sharing with subjects will only be marked with the 
subject’s subject number.  
 
16.0 Costs to Subjects 
There will be no costs to the study subjects. The sponsor will cover all costs of study 
participation, including any assessments or tests performed solely for the purpose of 
establishing eligibility for participation. Charges for treatment of the subject’s condition 
that are unrelated to the research study or any of its procedures will continue to be billed 
to the health insurance provider of the subject or to the subject him or herself. It is 
anticipated that there will not be any charges for treatment that is unrelated to the study 
except in the case of subjects who previously received therapy from the PI and who will 
continue to receive ongoing treatment that is not related to participating in the study.  
 
17.0 Treatment and Compensation for Study Related Injury 
Costs for treatment of a study- related emergency would first be billed to a subject’s 
health insurance provider. The sponsor will cover any direct costs relating to the 
treatment of a study- related emergency that are not covered by a subject’s health 
insurance. Some study-related emergencies can be treated by the PI, as described under 
Section 8.4. If the PI cannot treat a study-related emergency, then there are contingency 
plans for the transport of subjects to the appropriate Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
Emergency Department.  
 
18.0 Record Retention 
The PI is responsible for retaining all study records required by the sponsor and 
applicable ICH-GCP and FDA regulations in a secure and safe facility. The PI must 
consult a representative of the sponsor before disposal of any study records. “Essential 
documents” are defined as documents th at individually and collectively permit evaluation 
of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced. These documents will be

U.S.                                                                                                                                May 21, 2013  
  
 
Page 62 of 72 filed according to ICH-GCP regulations in the ISF. It is the responsibility of the sponsor 
to inform the PI or institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 
19.0 Publication Policy 
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and 
therefore encourages publications in reputable scientific journals and presentations at 
seminars or conferences. It is understood by the PI that the information generated in this 
study will be used by the sponsor in connection with the development of the 
investigational product and therefore may be disclosed to government agencies in various 
countries. To allow for the use of information derived from the study, it is understood 
that the P I is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results, all study data, and 
access to all study records. It is mandatory that all data analysis is done on the official 
monitored sponsor database and that the analysis plan is agreed upon with the sponsor 
statistician.  
 
Any results of medical investigations with the sponsor products and/or publications/ 
lectures/manuscripts based thereon, shall be exchanged and discussed by the PI and the 
sponsor clinical research representative(s) prior to submission for publication or 
presentation. Due regard shall be given to the sponsor's legitimate interests, e.g. 
manuscript authorship, obtaining optimal patient protection, coordinating and 
maintaining submissions to health authorities, and coordinating with other studies in the 
same field.  
The full details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations based on the data from this trial will be described in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.

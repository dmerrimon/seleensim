Page 19PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Background and Rationale:
The janus kinase ( JAK)family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine- protein kinase 2
(TYK2), is a group of cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via 
interactions with T ype1 and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, 
proliferation, survival and function. Cytokine receptors demonstrate restricted association 
with JAKs such that different receptors or receptor classes preferentially  utilize a given J AK 
dimer combination to transduce their signal.   JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate  - common 
cytokine signaling and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit the signals of additional 
cytokines important in inflammation and immune responses including interleukin (IL ) -2, -4, 
-5, -6, -12, -13, -15, -21, -23, -31, i nterferon gamma (IFN), and interferon al pha(IFN).  
Following cy tokine activation, receptor -associated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn 
phosphory late specific sites on the receptor intracellular domain.   Phosphory lation of specific 
sites on the intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal 
transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently  be phosphory lated 
by JAKs
.16  Phosphory lated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to 
the nucleus where they  bind to specific sites on the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA )and 
regulate gene transcription .18  The ty rosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(TEC) kinase family  consists of five members including TEC, B ruton’styrosine kinase 
(BTK )
, bone marrow -expressed kinase (BMX ) , inducible T -cell kinase (ITK ) and resting 
lymphocy te kinase (RLK/ TXK) ,that a re primaril y expressed in hematopoietic cells.  TEC 
kinases play  an important role in antigen receptor signaling and 
BTK and ITK regulate the 
signal transduction pathway s initiated by  the activation of B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell 
receptor (TCR), respe ctively .31,27
PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits irreversibly  JAK3 with 
selectivity  over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2.   PF-06651600 also 
inhibits irreversibly  the ty rosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase 
family  (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, TXK), with high selectivity over the broader kinome. 
PF
-06651600 inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells which have been 
implicated in the pathogenic process of AA.34,30This inhibition may be mediated through 
mechanisms dependent on JAK3 and TEC kinase family  members.33,28,29PF-06651600 also 
potently  inhibits signaling of the JAK3 -dependent receptors for IL -15 and IL-21, which have 
been implicated in the pathogenic pathway s of AA .32
PF
-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor with a good selectivity  profile over the other 
human kinases including JAK2.   TYK2 /JAK1 are critical s ignaling kinases that regulate the 
signal transduction pathway s triggered by  several cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of 
AA
,including IFN, IL-2, IL -15, IL -12, and IL -23.4,25,6
Both compounds will be investigated in patients with AA.

PF-06700841 in AA.  This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, 
multicenter study  with twoextension period s . The study  will have a maximum duration of 
approximatel y 113weeks. This includes an up- to-5weeks Screening Period, a 24 -week 
Treatment Period, a 4 -week D rug Holiday #1, a n up to 12 months Single -Blind (sponsor 
open, investigator open and subject blind) Extension Period, a 4-week Drug Holiday  #2, a 
6-month Cross -Over Open L abel Extension P eriod and a 4 week Follow -up Period. The 
study  will enroll a total of approximatel y 132 subjects.  The study  will be conducted at 
approximatel y 30 to 40 sites.
Subjects who have moderate to severe alopecia areata ( 50% hair loss of the scalp [SAL T 
score 50]and without evidence of hair regrowth within the previous 6 months; current 
episode of 
fixed hair loss  7years) present at the screening and baseline visits will be 
included in the study .  Photographs will be taken at the Screening Visit to verify  eligibility  
(50% hair loss of the scalp).   Subjects will be randomized to PF -06651600 or matching 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio or PF -06700841 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio in the initial 
Treatment Period .  During the data analy sis, placebo groups will be com bined to y ield final 
investigational product: placebo ratios of 1:1:1 for each investigational product.   
Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study
 team will be blinded as to treatment group.
Data will be cleaned, a snapshot of the database will be cr eated, and efficacy  and safet y data 
from the 24 -week Treatment Period will be summarized in the interim CSR and published 
once the last subject last visit occurs for the initial 24-week Treatment Period. The interim 
study  report may beshare d with the pri ncipal investigator (PI)when it is available. 
Subjects will be screened within 35 days prior to the first dose of study  drug to confirm that 
they meet the subject selection criteria for the study .  The 24
-week treatment period consist s
of a 4 -week induct ion treatment period and a 20 -week maintenance treatment period . 
An induction dose of 200 mg once dail y (QD) for 4 weeks followed b y maintenance dosing 
of 50 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF -06651600, an induction dose of 60 mg QD for 4 weeks 
followed b y maintena nce dosing of 30 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF -06700841, and matching

Page 30Single -Blind Extension Period
Alopecia A reata is a disease with high unmet medical need.  Currently  there areno approved 
medications for treatment of AA.  An Extension Period has been added to this study  to
evaluate additional safet
y and tolerability of PF -06651600 and PF-06700841. The Extension 
Period will become Single -Blind (investigator open, sponsor open and subject blind) upon 
approval of A mendment 4.
The Single -Blind Extension Period will provide an opportunity  for subjects to receive 
additional active 
study  treatment .  It will start after a 4 -week Drug Holiday #1.The duration 
of the 
Single -Blind Extension Period can be up to 12 months.  Only  subjects who complete 
Week 24 of the initial treatment period may be considered for eligibility  to enter the 
Single -Blind Extension Period.  Subjects who discontinue during the initial treatment period 
will enter the 4 -week Follow up Period and will not be el igible for the Single -Blind 
Extension Period. 
All subjects who complete the initial 24-week Treatment Period will be evaluated during 
Drug Holiday  #1 for potential entry  into the Single -Blind Extension Period.  After the 
4-week Drug Holiday #1, subjects w ill enter the Single -Blind Extension Period providing 
none of the Exclusion criteria #9, #10, and #26aremet and the audiogram result does not 
preclude patient’s entrance in the Extension Period.  Subjects who meet Exclusion 
criteria #9, #10, or #26 will be discontinued and enter the Follow -up Period.
AtWeek 28 (after the 4 -week Drug Holiday #1that follows completion of Week 24)
, 
subjects will be assigned by  the study  designee(s) to receive either active treatment 
(PF-06651600 or PF- 06700841) to start the segment for non- responder or placebo to start th e 
Withdrawal/Retreatment segment for responder. The detailed criteria for treatment 
assignment will be described in the statistical analy sis plan ( SAP).The study  designee(s), 
who are independent of the study  team, will provide the site with a treatment assignment 
when investigational product ( IP)is being supplied via the I RT s ystem post Week 24. A 
detailed communication plan will be provided to the site.  The probabilit y to receive active 
treatment in the Single -Blind Extension Period is approximatel y 33% to 100%. During the 
Single -Blind Extension Period , all the subjects assigned to placebo at Week 28 will have a 
probability  of 100% to receive active treatment if they  meet the retreatment criteria outlined 
in the SAP . 
During the Single -Blind Extension Period, subjects who are assigned to the active treatment 
(PF-
06651600 or PF-06700841) at Week 28 to start the segment for non- responder will 
receive the same respective active compound ( PF-06651600 or PF- 06700841), dose, and 
treatment duration ( a 4-week Induction Period and a 20 -week Maintenance Period) as the 
original Treatment Period. 
Subjects 
who are assigned to the placebo group at Week 28 to start the 
Withdrawal/Retreatment segment will receive p lacebo for up to 24 weeks until they  meet the 
retrea tment criteria described in the SAP. These subjects 
will be assessed every  2weeks 
during the first 8 weeks and then every  4weeks up to 24 weeks by the study designee(s).

Amendment 3 availability  is eligible for evaluation for potential enrollment into the 
Single -Blind Extension Period. Subjects are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible 
enrollment for the Single -Blind Extension Period
.
Cross -Over Ope n Label Extension Period
A 24 week Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period has been added to this study  to evaluate 
safet y and efficacy of PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 in subjects who complete the segment 
for non -responder in Single -Blind Extension Period and did not respond to the initial active 
treatment . More specifically , subjects who arePF-06651600 non- responder at Week 52 will 
receive PF -
06700841 in the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period. Subjects who are
PF-06700841 non- responder at Week 52 willreceive PF -06651600 in the Cross -Over Open 
Label Extension Period. The subjects who were responders at Week 52 will enter the 
Follow -up Period directly .Non-
responders are defined as subjects who have not achieved 
30% improvement in SALT relative to the baseline of the Treatment Period at Week 52. 
All subjects who complete the segment for non -responder in Single -Blind Extension Period 
and are non -responders at Week 52 will be evaluated during the Drug Holiday #2 for 
potential entry  into the Cross -Over O pen Label Extension Period.  After the 4 -week Drug 
Holiday #2, subjects will enter the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period providing none 
of the Exclusion criteria
#9, #10, and #26 are met and the audiogram result does not preclude 
patient’s entrance in the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period
as well as the 
non-responder criteria is met at Week 52. Audiogram result av ailable within 8 weeks is 
acceptable . Subjects who meet Exclusion criteria #9, #10, or #26 will enter the Follow - up 
Perioddirectl y. Subjects who do not meet the non -responder criteria at Week 52 will be 
informed b y the study designee(s) during the Drug Holiday
#2 and go directly  to the 4-week 
Follow -up Period
. Subjects who discontinue during the Single -Blind E xtension Pe riod will 
enter the 4- week Follow -up Period and will not be eligible for the Cross -Over Open Label
Extension P eriod.

Page 32At Cross-Over Open Label Day 1 (after the 4-week Drug Holiday #2 that follows completion 
of Single-Blind Extension Period), non-responders will be assigned to receive either PF-06651600 or PF-06700841(the opposite of the assigned active treatment in the initial 24 weeks and Single-Blind Extension Period). 
During the Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period, subjects will receive an induction dose 
of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF-06651600 or an induction dose of 60 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 30 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF-06700841. 
Any subjects who has completed the segment for non-responder in Single-Blind Extension 
Period prior to protocol Amendment 4 initiation at the investigator site is eligible for evaluation for potential enrollment into the Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period.  These subjects are to be discussed with the sponsor prior to any possible enrollment into the Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period.
Statistical Methods:
A comprehensive overall Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be provided prior to the 
un-blinding of the trial.
The sample size is based on the primary efficacy endpoint, mean change from baseline in 
SALT score at Week 24.
All subjects who receive at least one dose of randomized study medication, and have a 
baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement (after taking randomized study medication) will be included in the efficacy data analyses.
The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in the SALT score for the Treatment 
Period.  The primary time point is Week 24.
 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of the 
study drug or placebo. 
Pharmacokinetic concentrations in treatment period will be summarized and presented with 
summary statistics and, if appropriate, non-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates will be provided. There will not be any PK assessments during the Single-Blind Extension Period.
Details regarding the analysis procedures to be used for the interim analysis will be provided
in the interim analysis plan (IAP).  The interim analysis may be performed when
approximately 50% of subjects have completed or had the chance to complete the Week 12visit. Additional interim analyses may be performed based on emerging data.

v. Blood sample for PK will be collected pre-dose at each visit as specified in SOA in Treatment Period and Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period. No PK 
samples are collected for Single-Blind Withdraw/Retreatment Extension Period.
w. Blood samples for PK will also be collected at 0.5 hours post dose on Weeks 8 and 20; 0.5 and 1 hour on Week 12 during Treatment P eriod, and 0.5, 1, 2, 
and 4 hours post dose on Weeks 4 and 24 during Treatment Period and Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period. Blood sample for PK wi ll be collected at 
early termination visit for subjects who discontinue early from the Treatment Period prior to Week 24 visit or during the Cross-Ov er Open Label Extension 
Period only if the most recent dose taken prior to ET visit was within 48 hours. No PK samples will be collected at ET visit for su bjects who discontinue 
early from the Single-Blind Extension Period.
 
y. Biopsy samples will be collected only on subjects who provide consent to participate in the biopsy sub-study at selected biop sy sites.  Biopsies of the 
lesional and non-lesional scalp (in subjects that have non-lesional scalp) will be obtained.  Biopsies of the lesional scalp at  ET visit will only be obtained for 
subject who discontinue early from the Treatment Period prior to Week 24 visit. No biopsies will be obtained at ET visit for sub jects who discontinue early 
from the Extension Periods.
z. Biopsy at Week 4 is optional. 
aa. All subjects who complete the initial 24-week Treatment Period will be evaluated for potential entry into the Single-Blind E xtension Period during the Drug 
Holiday #1. After the 4-week Drug Holiday #1, subjects will enter  the Single-Blind Extension Period providing none of the Exclusio n criteria # 9, #10, and 
#26are met and the audiogram result does not preclude patient’s entrance in the Single-Blind Extension Period. Subjects who meet E xclusion # 9, #10, or

1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits irreversibly  JAK3 with 
selectivity  over the oth
er three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2.   PF-06651600 also 
inhibits irreversibly  the ty rosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase 
family  (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, TXK) , with high selectivity  over the broader kinome.   
PF
-06700841 is a du al inhibitor of human ty rosine- protein kinase 2 (TYK2) and Janus 
kinase 1 (JAK1).  Both compounds will be investigated in patients with alopecia areata (AA). 
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Drug 
Development R ationale
The JAK family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2, is a group of cy toplasmic 
tyrosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Ty pe1 and Ty pe2
cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, proliferation, survival and function. 
Cytokine receptors demonstrate restrict ed association with JAKs such that different receptors 
or receptor classes preferentially  utilize a given JAK dimer combination to transduce their 
signal.  JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate -common cy tokine signaling and also with JAK2 
or TYK2 to transmit t he signals of additional cy tokines important in inflammation and 
immune responses including interleukin (IL) -2, - 4, -5, -6, -12, -13, -15, - 21, - 23, -31, 
interferon gamma (IFN), and 
interferon al pha(IFN).  Following cy tokine activation, 
receptor -associ ated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn phosphory late specific sites on the 
receptor intracellular domain.  Phosphory lation of specific sites on the intracellular domain 
of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of tr anscription 
(STATs) that can subsequently  be phosphory lated by  JAKs
.16Phosphory lated STAT 
molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to the nucleus where they  bind to 
specific sites on the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA )and regulate gene transcription .18
The ty rosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase family  consists of 
five members including TEC, Bruton’s ty rosine kinase ( BTK )
, bone m arrow -expressed 
kinase (BMX ), inducible T -cell kinase (ITK) and resting lymphocy te kinase (RLK/TXK) , 
that are primarily  expressed in 
hematopoietic cells .  TEC kinases play  an important role in 
antigen receptor signaling and BTK and ITK regulate the signal transduction pathway s 
initiated by  the activation of B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR), 
respectivel y.31
,27
PF-06651600 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that inhibits irreversibly  JAK3 with 
selectivity  over the other three JAK isoforms, JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2. PF-06651600 also 
inhibits irreversibly  the ty rosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase 
family  (BTK, BMX, ITK, TEC, TXK) , with high selectivity  over the broader kinome.
PF-06651600 inhibits the cytotoxic function of CD8+ T cells and NK cells which have been 
implicated in the pathogenic process of AA.34,30This inhibition may be mediated through 
mechanisms dependent on JAK3 and TEC kinase family  members.33,28,29PF-06651600 also 
potently  inhibits signaling of the JAK3 -dependent receptors for IL -15 and IL-21, which have 
been implicated in the pathogenic pathway s of AA .32

Page 49PF-06700841 is a dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibi tor with a good selectivity profile over the other 
human kinases including JAK2.   TYK2 /JAK1 are critical signaling kinases that regulate the 
signal transduction pathway s triggered by  several cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of 
AA
,including IFN, IL-2, IL -15, IL -12, and IL -23.4,25,6
1.2.2. Study Background
Alopecia areata is an autoimmune T -cell mediated disease characteriz ed by  non-scarring hair 
loss.5  The disease includes the following forms: limited patchy hair loss (patch y alopecia 
areata), complete loss of hair on the scalp (alopecia totalis) and complete loss of hair on the
scalp and the bod y (alopecia universalis).  Even though the patches are well
-circumscribed , 
short fragile hairs are often seen in the periphery  of lesions .  Nail changes are also seen in 
AA patients.
  Pruritus is sometimes reported in AA patients although the affected skin 
usually  does not have signs of inflammation.  Both males and females of all ages and races
can be affected.9  Alopecia areata is associated with immune diseases including asthma, 
allergic rhin
itis, atopic dermatitis, thy roid disease, and automimmune diseases such as 
thyroiditis and vitiligo.9
The complex pathoph ysiology  of A Ais still not completely  understood.  CD8+Tcells, 
natural killer (NK) cell s, and mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata .  
The possible cy tokine pathway s of the disease include a role for cytokines from t ype
1helper
Tcell(TH1) axis, including IL -1, IFN -and interferon  -induced protein 10(IP-10) that take 
part in the hair follicle cycle and immune-privilege collapse.  Mouse models have shown that 
IL-2 and IL -15 play  a role in the initiation of auto -reactive CD8+cells.   Recent studies have 
demonstrated 
AA signature with ty pe2 helper T cell (TH2), T H1,IL-23, and IL -9/T H9 
cytokine activation in scalp lesions of patients with AA.24
To date, there is no cure for AA.   Current treatment options are limited and include topical, 
intralesional, and s ystemic agents. Topical treatments usually  have low efficacy  and are not 
suitable for large areas or long
-term use.  I ntralesional steroids are also not applicable for 
large areas.  Healthcare providers have been using oral broad immunosuppressants includ ing 
cyclosporine A, oral corticosteroids, my cophenolate mopheti l,and azathioprine .  None of 
these immunosuppressive medications have been approved b y the regulatory agency(ies) for 
treatment for AA.   The off - label use of immunosuppressive therapies is often associated wi th 
adverse events and side effect profiles that prevent their long- term use.4  Spontaneous hair 
growth is rare in moderate to severe AA patients.   The lack of effective treatments causes 
psychosocial distress wi
th high prevalence rates of depression and anxiet y in AA patients.1  
There is an unmet need for targeted therap y in patients with moderate to severe AA.
Recent studies have suggested potential utility  of JAK inh ibitors in the treatment of AA.   
Baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, has reversed AA in a subject.11  Treatment with ruxolitinib, a 
JAK1/2 inhibitor, resulted in hair regrowth in a patient with AA and vitiligo.7  Tofacitinib, a 
pan JAK inhibitor, was reported to provide therapeutic effect in a patient with alopecia 
universalis.2

1.2.3.1. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF -06651600
Following intravenous and oral administration of PF- 06651600 to rats and dogs, absorption 
was rapid with high bioavailability  in both species (approximatel y 85-100%).  The high oral 
bioavailability  indicated high absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in -vitro 
passive permeability  properties.  Plasma clearance (CL) was approximately  69 and 
13mL/min/kg in rat and dog respectivel y.  Half -life was approximatel y 0.33 and 1.1 hour in 
rat and do
g respectivel y.  Sy stemic exposures of PF -06651600 as measured by  maximum 
concentration (C max) and area under the concentration- time curve (AUC 24) in repeat oral 
pivotal toxicology  studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 400 mg/kg/day ) and 
dogs (up to 45 mg/kg/day ).  Renal excretion of parent PF -06651600 was limited in the rat 
and dog.  Biliary  excretion of parent PF -06651600 was limited in the rat. 
PF
-06651600 binding to plasma proteins was approximately  10 to 30% across species 
(fraction un bound values for rat, dog, and human were 0.67, 0.82 and 0.86 respectivel y).  
Invitro and in vivo metabolite profiling suggested that the primary  clearance mechanisms for
PF-06651600 were cy tochrome P450 mediated oxidation and glutathione related conjugat ion.  
No unique human metabolites were observed in vitro compared to metabolite profiles in rat 
and dog.  Reaction phenoty ping in recombinant enzy me sy stems identified CYP3A4 as the 
predominant CYP450 isoform responsible for the metabolism of PF -06651600, with minor 
contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP3A5.  I n addition, glutathione -
S-transferase (GST) 
conjugate was formed in a time dependent manner in recombinant GST mu 1 -1 and pi 1-1 
incubations. 
PF
-06651600 showed a low risk of inhibition and induction of the major CYP450 enzy mes 
as well as the major uridine 5’ -diphospho- glucuronosy ltransferase enz ymes.  However, in the 
presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, PF -06651600 showed evidence of 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4.  This CYP3A4 inhibition indicated a potential for 
pharmacokinetic drug interactions for which CYP3A constitutes the primary  mechanism of 
clearance. 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details on the non -clinical 
pharmacokinetics and metabolism of PF-06651600.
1.2.3.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of PF -06700841
The pharmacokinetic ( PK)of PF -06700841 have been studied in rat where the compound has 
shown a plasma clearance of 31 mL/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 2.0 L/kg, and oral 
bioava ilability  of approximately  80-100%.  The high oral bioavailability  indicated high 
absorption from the gut, consistent with its high in -vitro passive permeability  properties.
  Rat 
invivo clearance was predicted within approximately 2 -fold b y both in vitro rat liver 
microsomes and hepatocy te intrinsic clearance highlighting the importance of CYP450 
metabolism.  Sy stemic exposures of PF -06700841 as measured b y C maxand AUC 24in repeat 
oral pivotal toxicology  studies increased with increasing dose in rats (up to 55 mg/kg/day ) 
and monkey s (up to 45 mg/kg/day ).  Renal and biliary  elimination of parent PF -
06700841 
was limited in rat.

Page 51Plasma protein binding of PF -06700841 was consistent across rat, monkey , and human with 
a fraction unbound (fu) of approximatel y 0.6-0.7.  Values of fu were lower in mouse 
(fu=0.51) and rabbit (fu = 0.36).
Oxidative metabolites of PF -06700841 accounted for the primary  routes of biotransformation 
in rat, monkey
, and human consistent with CYP450 as the primary  clearance route.  No 
unique human metabolites of PF -06700841 were evident compared to the safet y species of 
rat and monkey . 
Clearance phenotyping of PF -06700841 indicated that CYP3A4 will be the predominant 
mediator of human metabolism with minor contributions from CYP1A2, 2C19, and 2D6. 
PF-06700841 showed a low risk of CYP450 inhibition and induction, 
UDP -glucuronos yltransferase (UGT )inhibition, OATP1B1/1B3 inhibition, and multi- drug 
resistance 1 (MDR1) inhibition.  PF -06700841 showed some potential to inhibit metformin 
mediat ed transport b y organic cation transporter 2(OCT2) (IC 50=1.1M), multidrug and 
toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1 )(IC 50=7.7M) and MATE2K (IC 50=17M) in vitro.  The 
respective unbound Imax/IC 50ratios are 0.65, 0.09, and 0.04 for a predicted 60 mg clinical 
dose of PF -06700841 (unbound C max=0.72M).  SimCYP modeling indicated a low risk of 
drug-drug interactions (DDI) perpetrated by  a 60 mg once dail y (QD) dose of PF -06700841 
(Cmax/AUC ratios 1.19/1.20). 
1.2.4. Safety Data
1.2.4.1. Non-Clinical Safety 
1.2.4.1.1. Non-Clinical Safety of P F-06651600
The nonclinical safet y profile of PF -06651600 was characterized through the conduct of 
single -and repeat -dose studies of up to 6 months (rats) and 9 months (dogs) in duration, 
invivo and in vitro safety pharmacolog y (neurofunctional, pulmonary , and cardiovascular), 
and in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicolog y studies.  Dose range -finding and definitive 
embry o-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits were also conducted.  I n addition, an 
invivo immunotoxicity  study  was done to characterize the risk for h ypersensitivity , and 
phototoxicity  was evaluated in rats.  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL ) in the 
9-month toxicity  study  in dogs was 5 mg/kg/day , based on the finding of axonal dy strophy  
and associated auditory  effects.  In the 9
-month study  in dogs, an adverse, 
PF-06651600-related dose- dependent finding of bilateral axonal dy strophy  was observed 
within the olivary  nuclei of the brainstem of male and female dogs administered 
20mg/kg/day .  Auditory  testing ( Brainstem Auditory  Evo
ked Potential [BAEP]) testing 
performed on recovery  control and high dose animals showed severe to mild hearing loss and 
waveform defects, with partial recovery  in the histological lesions and functional auditory  
effects indicated at the end of the 3- month recovery  period.  The lowest observed adverse 
effect level (LOAEL) was 20 mg/kg/day .  The data from the 9 -month dog study  represent the 
limiting exposure.

B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 52The current planned Phase 2 clinical study  in AAinclude doses up to 200 mg QD (stead y 
state unbound Cmax 1078 ng/mL and AUC last 3192 ng•h/mL ).  Axonal dy strophy  was not 
observed in the 8
-week repeat dose dog stud y, and exposure at the NOAEL in the 8 -week 
dog study  was approximately  14x the predicted human exposure at the 4-week 200 mg 
clinical dose. 
The most commonly  observed findings in the repeat -dose toxicity  studies were effects on 
bone marrow and the immune and hematol ymphopoietic sy stems that were consistent with 
the known pharmacological activity  of JAK inhibitors.  Except at the high dose in the
9-month dog toxicity  study , which was associated with signs indicative of infection, no 
adverse clinical signs, clinical pathology
, or microscopic evidence of infection were observed 
in repeat dose toxicit y studies, and effects related to the pharmacological activity  of 
PF-06651600 were judged to be nonadverse. 
PF-06651600 was not mutagenic but was aneugenic in assay s in vitro.  I n vitro aneugenicit y 
with kinase inhibitors is a common observation and is probably the consequence of off -target 
inhibition of kinases involved in cellular division .19  PF- 06651600 did not induce 
micronuclei in vivo in rats at exposures 18x and 42x, respectivel y, the predicted human 
unbound C maxand area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero 
extrapolated to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC last)values at the highest dose of 
200mg once dail y (QD)in planned Phase 2 studies.
PF
-06651600 is a covalent inhibitor of JAK3 and an integrated assessment of its potenti al to 
induce h ypersensitivity  and/or nonspecific toxicity  reactions resulting from covalent 
interactions with other proteins was conducted.  The nonspecific reactivity  potential of 
PF-06651600 was evaluated by  assessing CYS containing kinase selectivity, h uman serum 
albumin binding, human hepatocy te recovery , and the modified mouse allergy  model for 
hypersensitivity .  These assessments demonstrated a high level of specificity  for the JAK3 
enzy me, minimal covalent binding to serum albumin, high recovery  following human 
hepatocy te incubations (ie, minimal persistent binding to hepatocy tes), and no evidence of 
hypersensitivity  response in the modified mouse allergy  model.
In an embry o-fetal development study  in rats, the maternal NOAEL was 175 mg/kg/day .  
Skele tal malformations and variations, and lower fetal bod y weights occurred at 175 and 
325mg/kg/day .  The exposure margins at the developmental NOAEL of 75 mg/kg/day  were 
7.2x and 5.3x, respectively , the predicted steady  state human unbound C max (1078 ng/mL )
and AUC last (3192 ng•h/mL ) values at the highest daily  dose of 200 mg in planned Phase
2 
studies.  In an embry o-fetal development study  in rabbits, lower mean fetal body  weights and 
higher incidences of visceral and skeletal malformations and skeletal vari ations were 
observed at 75 mg/kg/day .  The exposure margins at the developmental NOAEL of 
25mg/kg/day  in rabbits were 4.1x the predicted steady  state human unbound C max 
(1078 ng/mL )and AUC last (3192 ng•h/mL
) values at the highest daily  dose of 200 mg in 
planned Phase 2 studies.  Please refer to Section 4.4.1 on the contraception requirements for 
participation in this study .

Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 53There was no evidence of cutaneous or ocular phototoxicity  following oral administration to 
rats for 3 days at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day .
In summary , the nonclinical safety  profile of PF -06651600 has been adequately  characterized 
to support progression into this Phase 2 study .  Adequate safet y margins based on planned 
maxim um doses and predicted exposures in patients were determined for effects observed in 
nonclinical studies.
Please refer to the IB for more details on the non -clinical information with PF -06651600.
1.2.4.1.2. Non-Clinical Safety of PF -06700841
PF-06700841 was evaluated in single -dose and repeat -dose toxicit y studies up to 6 months 
(rats) and 9 months (monkey s) in duration.  Dose range -finding and pivotal embry o-fetal 
development studies (EFD) were conducted with PF -06700841 in rats and rabbits.  Target 
organs identified with PF -06700841 administration in rats and cy nomolgus monkey s include 
the immune and hemolymphatic sy stems (thy mus, spleen, ly mph nodes, and bone marrow) , 
gastrointestinal tract (body weight and weight gain effects ), and adrenal gland (vacuolation).  
Thefindings in the thy mus, spleen, ly mph nodes, and bone marrow are consistent with the 
pharmacological activity  of PF -06700841 and were not adverse because they were not 
associated with adverse clinical signs or adverse changes in hematology  parameters, and
there was no evidence of test article -related infections in these animals. Gastrointestinal and 
adrenal effects were not adverse because they  were either transient, of small magnitude 
and/or severit y, and/or lacked associated tissue injury or inflammatio
n, or changes in clinical 
pathology  parameters.  In addition, there were inconsistent findings in the bone, liver, lung 
and prostate where the relationship to PF- 06700841 is less clear.  Adverse findings in the 
central nervous s ystem ( decreased activity , mortality , prostration, convulsions) were 
observed at high exposures in pregnant rabbits, and emesis was observed in monkey s at high 
doses in studies 1month in duration.  I n safet y pharmacolog y assessments 
PF
-06700841-related effects were observed in the cardiovascular s ystem (blood pressure, 
heart rate, QTc interval) and central nervous s ystem (decreased locomotor activity ).  Based 
on the lack of adverse findings at any  dose, t he NOAELs in the 6- month rat and 9 -month 
monkey  studies were 45 mg/kg/day  in ra ts and 20 mg/kg in cy nomolgus monkey s.  
Exposures at these doses were 6.2x to 40x the predicted efficacious human exposure 
(Cmax=218 ng/mL  and AUC 24=1730 ng•h/mL) from a 50 mg dose .
In the pivotal EFD stud y in rats, there were no PF -06700841- related matern al effects.  
However, higher incidences of fetal skeletal malformations (in long bones, scapulae, 
sternebrae or palatine bones) and variations (in the ribs, cervical vertebrae or sternebrae) 
occurred at  2mg/kg/day , and delay s in the ossification of the a xial and appendicular 
skeleton occurred at 15 mg/kg/day .  In addition, lower embry o-fetal viability ; lower mean 
fetal bod y weights, external malformations (cleft palate) and variations (whole body 
subcutaneous edema or edematous neck) occurred at 15 mg/kg/ day.  The maternal NOAEL 
in rats was 15 mg/kg/day (13x and 11x the predicted efficacious human C maxand AUC 24
exposure from a 50 mg dose ) and the developmental NOAEL was not determined but was 
<2mg/kg/day , the lowest dose tested (2.2x and 1.3x the predict ed efficacious human Cmax
and AUC 24exposure from a 50 mg dose ).  In the pivotal EFD study  in rabbits, there were no

B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 54PF-06700841-related maternal effects.  However, test article- related higher incidences of late 
resorptions and post -
implantation loss occur red at 3mg/kg/day  and lower mean numbers of 
viable fetuses occurred at 7 mg/kg/day .  Test article -related skeletal variations were observed 
at 3mg/kg/day , but were not adverse because most of these findings represent delay s in 
ossification that would r esolve with further growth and development.  The maternal NOAEL 
in rabbits was 7 mg/kg/day , the highest dose tested, (6.6x and 3.2x the predicted efficacious 
human C maxand AUC 24exposure from a 50 mg dose ) and the developmental NOAEL was 
1mg/kg/day  (0.8x and 0.4x the predicted efficacious human C maxand AUC 24exposure from 
a 50 mg dose ).  Please refer to Section 4.4.1 onthe contraception requirements for 
participation in this study .
PF
-06700841 was negative for mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay s.  
Although PF -06700841 was positive in the in vitro micronucleus 
assay s in both CHO and 
TK6 cells, and was aneugenic in vitro (at 72,100 nM), it did not induce micronuclei, in vivo,
in reticulocy tes in the 1 -month study  in rats (at exposures 35x to 51x the predicted human 
efficacious exposure (unbound C max=218 ng/mL  and AUC 24=1730 ng•h/mL) from a 
50mgdose.
Although PF -06700841 absorbs in the ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB)range,
PF-06700841 ( 100mg/kg/day  [unbound C maxand AUC 24were 46x and 82x the predicted 
efficacious human exposure from a 50 mg dose] ) had no evidence of phototoxicity  in the skin 
or ey es of pigmented Long Evans rats in a 3- day phototoxicity  study .  This demonstrates that 
PF
-06700841 was not a phototoxicant, in vivo.
In summary , the nonclinical studies adequatel y support the planned clinical trials with 
PF-06700841.
Please refer to the IB for more details on the nonclinical information with PF-06700841.
1.2.4.2. Clinical Experience
1.2.4.2.1.
Clinical Experience with PF-06651600
As of April 27, 2016, 74 subjects have received at least one active dose of oral PF-06651600.  
This accounts for 60 subjects from the first- in-human (FIH) B7981001 study  who received 
active soluti on and 14 subjects from the bioavailability  (BA) B7981003 study  who received 
solution/tablet. 
The FIH study  is a Phase 1, randomized, double blind, third party  open, placebo controlled, 
single and multiple dose escalation, parallel group study  in health y adult subjects.   During the 
single dose period, subjects received doses of 5, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg of 
PF
-06651600 in a dose escalation format.   Subjects returned for the multiple dose periods to 
receive doses of 50, 200, or 400 mg QD or 100 or 200mg twice a day  (BID
)for 14 days.

Page 551.2.4.2.1.1. Clinical Safety Experience with PF -06651600
Eighty  (80) subjects were enrolled into the FIH study .  Single doses up to 800 mg and 
multiple doses up to 400 mg daily , as both 400 mg QD and 200 mg BID were administered.  
PF-06651600 appears to be generally  safe and well -tolerated.  No clinically significant 
changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram or laboratory data were observed.  No dose limiting 
adverse events were reported and no subjects met the protocol prescribed i ndividual stopping 
rules.  There were no deaths in the study . 
The most commonly  reported all causality  treatment emergent adverse events (TE AEs)
across both single ascending dose (SAD )and multiple ascending dose (MAD )PF-06651600 
cohorts were gastrointes tinal (GI)disorders including diarrhea (9 subjects), abdominal pain 
(6subjects), abdominal discomfort (2 subjects), and flatulence (3 subjects).  Change of bowel 
habit, constipation, fecal volume increased, discolored feces, nausea, paresthesia oral, and
vomiting have each also been reported (1 subject each event).  All cases were mild in 
severit y with the exception of 1 moderate TEAE each of abdominal pain, dy sphagia, and 
vomiting.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders including, but not limited to ras h, maculopapular 
rash, dermatitis acneiform, and ery thema of mild to severe intensit y were reported in the 
PF-06651600 cohorts and are summarized in Table 1below .  There were no skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders reported in the 5, 20, 50, 200, 400, and 800 single dose 
cohorts; nor were there any  skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders reported in the 50 mgQD 
multiple dose cohort.

Page 56Three (3) serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the FIH trial. 
The first event was a cutaneous abscess on the left buttock during the 200 mg single dose 
period in a subject who entered the study with a pre-existing boil on the left buttock.  This was assessed 19 days after the single dose was administered and was considered related to the study drug.  The subject was discontinued from treatment.  The SAE criterion was met as the incision and drainage procedure was performed in a hospital setting.
The second SAE was a sacrococcygeal cyst/pilonidal sinus abscess during the 400 mg single 
dose period.  This was assessed 19 days after the single dose was administered and was considered related to the study drug.  The SAE criterion was met as the incision and drainage procedure was performed in a hospital setting.
The third SAE was a varicella infection during the 400 mg QD MAD dose period.  The start 
date was 11 days after the last dose and was considered related to the study drug.  The source of the infection is unknown; however, a second subject, who had a reactivation of varicella zoster, may be the source as the subjects were confined during the same time.  The varicella infection resolved in 51 days.

1.2.4.2.1.2. Clinical Pharmacokinetics Experience with PF-06651600
The PK parameters from the 5, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg single dose levels are 
summarized below in Table 2.  In general, PF-06651600 area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC
inf) increased in a dose related 
manner over the 5 to 800 mg dose range with a slightly greater than proportional increase observed over the 200 mg to 400 mg dose range.  C
maxincreased with dose in an apparent 
dose proportional manner.

Page 57PF-06651600 was absorbed rapidly following single doses of 5 mg to 200 mg with median 
time after administration of a drug when the maximum plasma concentration is reached
(Tmax) values ≤0.75 hours, and more slowly at the higher doses with a median T maxof 1.0 and 
1.5 hours for the 400 mg and 800 mg doses, respectively.  Following attainment of C max, the 
disposition of PF-06651600 generally showed a monophasic decline at the lower doses of 5 to 200 mg (mean t½ of 1.1 to 1.8 hours) while a biphasic decline observed at doses of 400 to 800 mg (mean t½ of 2.2 to 2.5 hours).  An apparent trend toward longer t½ values at higher doses (400 and 800 mg) is probably due to concentrations remaining above the quantifiable limit for a longer period of time at the higher doses and defining a later terminal phase. 
The PK parameters following administration of 50, 200 and 400 QD and 100 mg and 
200 mg BID for 14 days are summarized below in Table 3.
On Day 14 of multiple-dose administration, PF -06651600 was absorbed rapidly with median 
T
maxvalues of 1 hour or less across the entire range of doses, from a total daily dose of 50 mg 
(50 mg QD) up to 400 mg (200 mg BID or 400 mg QD).  Following attainment of C max, the 
disposition of PF-06651600 was consistent with that observed following single-dose administration, showing a monophasic decline for the lowest doses and a biphasic decline following the 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD dosing regimens and a mean terminal t½ of about 
approximately 1.3 to 2.3 hours.  In general, plasma PF-06651600 AUC

1.2.4.2.2. Clinical Experience with PF-06700841
The B7931001 FIH study is the single clinical trial of PF-06700841 completed to date.  Of 
the 96 subjects randomized, 74 subjects have received at least one active dose of oral PF-06700841 in study B7931001.  This accounts for 41 healthy subjects who participated in the single and multiple ascending dose period of the trial who received active solution/suspension, 12 healthy subjects from the BA study who received suspension/tablet, and 21 subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis who were randomized to receive active solution/suspension over a 28 day treatment period. 
The FIH study was a Phase 1, randomized, double blind, third party open, placebo controlled, 
single and multiple dose escalation, parallel group study in healthy adult subjects and subjects with plaque psoriasis, with a relative bioavailability and food effect assessment of a tablet formulation of PF-06700841 in healthy adult subjects.  During the SAD period, 41 healthy subjects received doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, or 200 mg of PF-06700841 in a dose escalation format.  Twenty-one healthy subjects received doses of 10, 30, 100, or 175 mg QD for 10 days during the MAD period.  Subjects participating in the 100 mg multiple dose cohort returned for a third period to receive 50 mg PF-06700841 BID for 10 days.  Thirty subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis were also randomized into study B7931001, to receive once daily placebo (n=9), 30 mg (n=14), or 100 mg (n=7) PF-06700841 for 28 days, and underwent safety monitoring and clinical efficacy assessments.  An additional healthy volunteer cohort was included to support the evaluation of the relative BA of a tablet formulation of PF-06700841, and assessment of a high fat meal on tablet BA.  Twelve healthy subjects participated in this BA assessment, and received single doses of open label PF-06700841 in a 3-way cross over design (PF-0670841 tablet CCI

1.2.4.2.2.1. Clinical Safety Experience with PF -06700841
PF-06700841 was generally  safe and well tolerated in the Phase 1 clinical study  B7931001, 
which included both healthy  subjects (n=66 randomized) and subjects with plaque psoriasis 
(n=30 randomized).  There were no deaths in the study , no serious adverse events, and no 
severe adverse events.   Subjects reported 11 TEAE sin the SAD phase , 22TEAEs in the 
MAD phase, 39 TEAEs in the psoriasis phase, and 3 TEAEs in the BA phase.  All AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity
.  Dose escalation stopping rules were not triggered at any  dose 
level.
The most commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs acr oss active subjects in both SAD and 
MAD cohorts were blood creatinine increased (reported in 2 subjects during the SAD period 
and 11 subjects during the MAD period ), and neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased 
(reported in 4 subjects during the MAD period), which belong to the Sy stem Organ Class 
(SOC) categories of Investigations and Blood and Ly mphatic S ystem Disorders ,respectivel y.
During the SAD/MAD, t he AEs of blood creatinine increased were reported across dose 
levels from 10 mg up to 200 mg of PF -06700841, and occurred with greatest frequency  in the 
175mgQD and 50 mgBID MAD cohorts.  Neutropenia
(Common Terminology  Criteria for 
Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 3)occurred at the 175 mg QD and 50 mg BI D dose levels 
during the MAD period.  All laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs were mild in severity , 
except for one case of neutropenia which was reported as moderate in severity  (Grade 3 
neutropenia ).  No neutrophil counts reached, or fell below 500 cells/mm3.
Other commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs during the SAD/MAD by  SOC were Nervous 
System Disorders (2 events of headache and 1 event each of dizziness and pres yncope during 
the SAD period, and 1 event each of headache, presy ncope, and s yncope reported during the 
MAD period), and Infections and I nfestations (upper respiratory  tract infection reported in 
2subjects during the MAD period).  The AEs of upper respiratory  tract infection were 
reported in 1 subject who received 10 mg PF -06700841 QD and 1 subject who received 
100mg PF -06700841 QD.  Thes e infections did not require antibiotic therapy  (1subject 
received s ymptomatic treatment), and did not require study  treatment discontinuation. 
The most commonly  reported all causality  TEAEs across active subjects in the psoriasis 
cohorts treated with ei ther 30 mg or 100 mg PF -06700841 were blood creatinine increased 
(reported in 7 subjects in the 30 mg dose group and 6 subjects in the 100 mg dose group), 
neutrophil count decreased ( reported in 1 subject in the 30 mg dose group and 1 subject in 
the 100 mg dose group), which belong in the SOC category  of Investigations.
Other commonly  reported AEs by  SOC in the psoriasis cohorts included Nervous Sy stem 
Disorders ( headache reported in 1 subject in the 30 mg dose group and 1 subject in the 
100mg dose group ,and paresthesia reported in 1 subject in the 100 mg dose group ), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders ( constipation reported in 3 subjects in the 30 mg dose group) , and

Page 60Infections and Infestations (1 report of upper respiratory tract infection and 1 report of herpes 
zoster infection, both in the 100 mg dose group). 
The AE of herpes zoster occurred in a single subject after completing 28-day treatment with 
PF-06700841 at the 100 mg QD dose level.  The subject had non-disseminated, herpetiform rash on the upper left back and left arm that was reported to have presented on Study Day 30 (2 days after the last dose of PF-06700841).  The AE was mild in severity and was treated with acyclovir and Vicodin by the Investigator.
In the BA cohort, the SOCs with subjects reporting AEs were Gastrointestinal Disorders, 
Injury, Poisoning, and Procedural Complications, and Nervous System Disorders, each reported by 1 subject.  The reported AEs were nausea, contusion, and headache, each of which was experienced by 1 subject.  Subjects in the PF-06700841 100 mg oral solution/suspension fasted group reported treatment-related TEAE each of nausea and headache.  All TEAEs were mild in severity. 
Despite the AEs of blood creatinine increased observed in the healthy subjects (n=13 in the 
SAD/MAD cohorts) and psoriasis patients (n=13), the review of clinical laboratory parameters from study B7931001 confirmed there have been no noted clinically meaningful changes in the blood urea nitrogen, serum elect rolytes, urinalysis, or cystatin-c based 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in subjects with elevated serum creatinine. 
Serum creatinine is primarily filtered by the kidney however; approximately 10-20% is 
actively secreted into the renal proximal tubules.  The active tubular secretion is mediated by transporters such as OCT2, organic anion transporter 2 (OAT2), and MATEs.  The proposed mechanism for the observed serum creatinine increases in study B7931001 is inhibition of creatinine transport (ie, transporter-mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity), and is based 
on PF-06700841 potential to inhibit OCT2 creatinine transporter (IC
50=1.1μM; unbound 
Imax/IC 50ratio=0.25).  To differentiate from direct nephrotoxicity, the B7931001 protocol was 
amended (Protocol Amendment 2) to include collection of serum cystatin C.  Serum cystatin C was used to calculate eGFR in order to monitor for nephrotoxicity during the trial.  Elevated serum creatinine in the absence of clinically meaningful changes in serum cystatin C based estimates of GFR during study B7931001 supports the transporter inhibition hypothesis.  Following the implementation of cystatin C-based kidney safety monitoring, no subjects were discontinued from treatment/study due to renal concerns.
Proof of mechanism was achieved in study B7931001.

1.2.5. Study Rationale
This multicenter, multiple-arm, placebo controlled study will be the first determination of 
safety and efficacy of PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 in subjects with AA. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics for PF-06651600 and PF-06700841. In addition this study will provide opportunities for subjects to receive additional study treatment as there are no immunosuppressive medications approved for the treatment for alopecia areata. The current non-clinical toxicology packages 
support treatment duration ≥6 months for the maintenance doses. CCI

Page 63The total sample size for the study  is computed to be approximatel y 132 randomized .
The dose selection strategy  was designed to balance pharmacolog y and safety .  A global PK 
model for each asset was developed using t he data from the FIH studies for PF
-06651600 
(Protocol B7981001) and PF -06700841 (Protocol B7931001), respectivel y.  Pharmacokinetic 
was assumed to be similar between health y subjects and subjects with AA.   The activity of 
the JAK inhibitors was assessed by  measurement of various PD markers and markers of
safet y that 
were collected in the FI H studies and analy zed using indirect response modeling.   
The magnitude of change in these markers required for efficacy  and/or safe ty is poorl y 
understood.
By including two investigational drugs in a single study , the placebo group can be shared b y 
both, resulting in fewer subjects being exposed to placebo and smaller overall study  size.  
The inclusion of these two investigational dru gs is appropriate as the target population for 
both is identical as are the efficacy  outcome measures .  The current non -clinical toxicology  
packages for both 
PF-06651600 and PF-06700841 support the treatment duration.
By including a 4 -week induction period and a 20 -week maintenance period, this 24-week 
treatment 
study  will determine the clinicall y relevant efficacy and safety  of PF-06651600 and 
PF
-06700841 in patients with moderate to severe AA .  The biops y sub -study  will establish
the effects of 
JAK3 and T YK2/JAK1 s uppression on modulation of immune pathway s
involved in AA. 
In the PF -06700841 FI H study  B7931001, serum creatinine elevation was reported across 
dose levels in health y volunteer and psoriasis patients ( Section 1.2.4.2.2.1) but the review of 
clinical laboratory  parameters confirmed there have been no noted clinically  meaningful
changes in the blood urea nitrogen, serum electroly tes, urinaly sis, or cy statin -
c based eGFR 
in the subject s with elevated serum creatinine.   In order to monitor for an y potential cases of 
decreased eGFR during this trial serum cy statin C will be collected to calculate eGFR in 
addition to serum creatinine. 
Currently  there is no medications approved for treatme nt for AA.  The two Extension Period s
will provide an opportunity  for subjects to receive additional active study  treatment and 
active treatment with different MOA . 
This study  includes a Single -Blind Extension P eriod to evaluate additional safet y and 
tolerability  of PF -06651600 and PF -06700841.  After the 4 -week Drug Holiday #1, s ubjects 
who complete the initial 24 weeks of the protocol may  enter the 
upto12 months Single -Blind 
Extension Period.  Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 24 will enter the Fol low Up 
period and will not be eligible for the Single -Blind Extension Period. 
The study  includes a Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period to evaluate thesafet y and 
tolerability  of PF -06651600 and PF -06700841 for initial non-responders to either active 
treatment who will receive the opposite active treatment. Subjects who complete the 
segment for n
on-responders in Single -Blind Extension P eriod may  be evaluated for potential 
entry  into the 
Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period and receive opposite active 
treatment .  Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 52 will enter the Follow Up period and

AUC tau(total) = 4672 ng•h/mL, dog (fu) = 0.82.
The induction dosing period (4 weeks) is supported by  the nonclinical safety  profi le of 
PF-06651600 in dogs in a trial of 8 weeks duration.  The margins during the induction period 
are based on the NOEAL exposure from the highest dose (45 mg/kg).  The NOAEL in the 
9-month toxicity  study  in dogs was 5 mg/kg/day , based on the finding of a xonal dy strophy  
and associated auditory  effects.  The lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was 
20mg/kg/day .  Thus, the data from the 9 -month dog study  represent the limiting exposure for 
chronic dosing. 
The predicted exposure during the induction treatment period at the top dose of 200 mgQD 
for 4weeks is projected to maintain 12 -and 14

reduction of IP-10 levels was 47% and 51%, respectively for 30 and 60 mg QD.  The predicted maximum percent reduction in neutrophils and reticulocytes was 32% and 50%, respectively during the induction period and 30% and 36%, during the chronic dosing period. 
Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis received doses of 30 mg or 100 mg QD or placebo 
for 28 days (B7931001).  Significant psoriasis disease modification as measured by placebo adjusted psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) change from baseline (mean change from baseline >-9 at 30 mg and mean change from baseline >-11 at 100 mg) was observed in the patients. 
Overall, the doses selected in this study are expected to demonstrate clinically relevant 
efficacy in subjects with AA.
1.2.6. Summary of Benefits and Risks
Overall, the safety profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06651600 appears to 
be acceptable at dosages up to 200 mg administered orally.  The safety profile observed during the Phase 1 program for PF-06700841 appears to be acceptable at dosages up to 175 mg administered orally. 
Additional information for these compounds may be found in the single reference safety

Page 76Study B7931005 will investigate the JAK3 inhibitor PF-06651600 and TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor 
PF-06700841 in AA.  This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study with two extension periods. The study will have a maximum duration of approximately 113 weeks. This includes an up-to-5 weeks Screening Period, a 24-week Treatment Period, a 4-week Drug Holiday (#1), an  up to 12 month Single-Blind (investigator 
open, sponsor open and subject blind) Extension Period, a 4-week drug holiday (#2), a 6-month Cross-Over Open Label Extension Period and a 4 week Follow-up Period. The study will enroll a total of approximately 132 subjects.  The study will be conducted at approximately 30 to 40 sites.
Subjects who have moderate to severe alopecia areata ( ≥50% hair loss of the scalp [SALT
score≥50] without evidence of hair regrowth within the previous 6 months; current episode 
of fixed hair loss ≤7 years) present at the screening and baseline visits will be included in the 
study.  Photographs will be taken at the Screening Visit to verify eligibility ( ≥50% hair loss 
of the scalp).  Subjects will be randomized to PF-06651600 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio or to PF-06700841 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  During the data analysis for the initial treatment period, placebo groups will be combined to yield final investigational product: placebo ratios of 1:1:1 for each investigational product.  Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group.  Data will be cleaned, a snapshot of the database will be created, and efficacy and safety data from the 24-week Treatment Period will be summarized in the interim CSR and published once the last subject last visit occurs for the initial 24-week Treatment Period. The interim study report may be shared with the PI when it is available. 
Subjects will be screened within 35 days prior to the first dose of study drug to confirm that 
they meet the subject selection criteria for the study.  The initial 24-week treatment consistsof a 4-week induction treatment period and a 20-week maintenance treatment period.
An induction dose of 200 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 50 mg QD
for 20 weeks of PF-06651600, an induction dose of 60 mg QD for 4 weeks followed by maintenance dosing of 30 mg QD for 20 weeks of PF-06700841, and matching placebo will be investigated.

Page 77Single -Blind Extension Period
Alopecia Areata is a disease with high unmet medical need. Currently  there areno approved 
medications for treatment 
ofAA.  An Extension Period has been added to this study  to
evaluate additional safet
y and tolerability of PF -06651600 and PF-06700841. The Extension 
Period will become single -blind (investigator open, sponsor open and subject blind) upon 
approval of 
Amendment 4.
The Single -Blind Extension Period will provide an opportunity  for subjects to receive 
additional active 
study  treatment .  It will start after a 4 -week Drug Holiday #1.The duration 
of the 
Single -Blind Extension Period can be up to 12 months.  Only  subjects who complete 
Week 24 of the initial treatment period may be considered for eligibility  to enter the 
Single -Blind Extension Period.  Subjects who discontinue during th e initial treatment period 
will enter the 4 -week Follow up Period and will not be eligible for the Single -Blind 
Extension Period. 
All subjects who complete the initial 24-week Treatment Period will be evaluated during the 
Drug Holiday  #1 for potential ent ry into the Single -Blind Extension Period.  After the 
4-week Drug Holiday #1, subjects will enter the Single -Blind Extension Period providing 
none of the Exclusion criteria #9, #10, and #26aremet and the audiogram result does not 
preclude patient’s entrance in the Single -Blind Extension Period.  Subjects who meet 
Exclusion criteria #9, #10 , or # 26will be discontinued and enter the Follow -up Period.
At Week 28 (after the 4 -week Drug Holiday #1that follows completion of Week 24) , 
subjects will be assigned by  the study  designee(s) to receive either active treatment 
(PF-06651600 or PF- 06700841) to start the segment for non- responder or placebo to start the 
Withdrawal/Retreatment segment for responder . The detailed criteria for treatment 
assignment will be described in the SAP. The study  designee(s), who a re independent of the 
study  team, will provide the site with a treatment assignment when IP is being supplied via 
the IRT s ystem post Week 24. A detailed communication plan will be provided to the site.  
The probability  to receive active treatment in the Single -Blind Extension Period is 
approximatel y 33% to 100%. During the Single -Blind Extension Period, all the subjects 
assigned to placebo at Week 28 will have a probability  of 100% to receive active treatment if 
they meet the retreatment criteria outline d in the SAP . 
During the Single -Blind Extension Period, subjects who are assigned to the active treatment 
(PF-06651600 or PF-06700841) at Week 28 will receive the same respective active 
compound ( PF-06651600 or PF-06700841), dose, and treatment duration ( a 4-week 
Induction Period and a 20- week Maintenance Period) as the original Treatment Period to 
start the segment for non -responder. 
Subjects who are assigned to the placebo group at Week 28 to start the 
Withdrawal/Retreatment segment for responder will receive p lacebo for up to 24 weeks until 
they meet the retreatment criteria described in the SAP. These subjects will be assessed 
every  2weeks during the first 8 weeks and then every  4weeks up to 24 weeks by the study  
designee(s). The stud y designee(s) , who are independent of the study  team, will inform the

will receive the same respective active compound (PF-06651600 or PF- 06700841), dose, and 
treatment du ration as the original treatment which consists of a 4- week induction period and 
a 20-week maintenance period, providing none of the Exclusion criteria #9, # 10, and #26 are
met and the audiogram result 
does not preclude patient’s participation (audiogram result 
available within 8 weeks is acceptable).  Subjects who meet Exclusion criterion # 9, #10, or

EOS visit .  Subjects who do not meet the retreatment criteria for initiation of active treatment 
throughout the 24 w eek period (Week 28 to Week 52) will go directly  to the EOS visit.
Subjects who complete the Withdrawal/Retreatment segment will go directly  to the 
Follow -up Period and will not participate Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period .
Any subject that has comp leted the initial 24 weeks of the Protocol B7931005 prior to 
Amendment 3 availability  is eligible for evaluation for potential enrollment into the 
Single -Blind Extension Period. Subjects are to be discussed with the sponsor for possible 
enrollment for the Single -Blind Extension Period.
Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period
A 24 week Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period has been added to this study  to evaluate 
safet y and efficacy of PF -06651600 and PF-06700841 in subjects who complete the segment 
for non -responder in Single -Blind Extension Period and did not respond to the initial active 
treatment . More specifically , subjects who arePF-06651600 non- responder at Week 52 will 
receive PF -
06700841 in the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period. Subjects who are
PF
-06700841 non- responder at Week 52 will receive PF -06651600 in the Cross -Over Open 
Label Extension Period. The subjects who were responders at Week 52 will enter the 
Follow -up Period directly .Non-
responders are defined as subjects who have not ac hieved 
30% improvement in SALT relative to the baseline of the Treatment Period at Week 52. 
All subjects who complete the segment for non -responder in Single -Blind Extension Period 
and are non -responders at Week 52 will be evaluated during the Drug Holida y #2 for 
potential entry  into the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period.  After the 4 -week Drug 
Holiday #2, subjects will enter the Cross -Over Open Label Extension Period providing none 
of the Exclusion criteria
#9, #10, and #26 are met and the audiogram result does not preclude

4.3.Rand omization Criteria 
Subjects will be randomized into the study  provided they  have satisfied all subject selection 
criteria.  This study  will enroll a total of approximately  132 subjects (expect edto provide 
approximatel y 90 completers).  Eligible subjects will be randomly  assigned to a treatment 
group through the sponsor ’
s interactive response technolog y (IRT) s ystem in the allocation 
ratio stratified b y the disease subtype.
Eligible subjects will be randomized to PF -06651600 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio or 
PF-06700841 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio in the 24 week Treatment Period .  For 
analyses purposes, the two placebo arms will be combined during the treatment period.
A biopsy  sub- study  will be performed at selected sites.   Approximately  42subjects will be 
randomized (expect edto provide approximatel y 30 completers).
  Subjects will be 
randomized to PF -06651600 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio or PF -06700841 or matching 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio.   During the data analy sis for the biopsy  sub -study ,placebo groups will 
be combined to yield final investigational product: placebo ratios of 1:1:1 for each 
investigational product during the treatment period .
Eligible subjects will be stratified by  the status of agreeing to participate in the biopsy  
sub-s tudy and the disease sub- type.  Specificall y there will be two strata for disease sub -type: 
AA ( nottotalis/universalis ) and AA (totalis /universalis ).  The study  will be first stratified by  
the status of the biopsy  sub-study  and within each stratum for the status of the biopsy  
sub
-study  it will be further stratified by  the disease sub -type. 
Subjects will be assigned to receive either active treatment (PF-06651600 or PF- 06700841) 
or placebo at Week 28 (after the 4 -week Drug Holiday #1 that follows completio n of 
Week 24) by  the study  designee(s). The study  designee(s), who are independent of study  
team, will provide the site with a treatment assignment when IP is being supplied via the I RT 
system post Week 24.
4.4.Lifestyle Requirements
In order to participate in the study , subjects must be aware of the following lifesty le 
guidelines and restrictions that apply  during and after the study  period. 
On study  visit day s that include fasting lipid panel, comply  with fasting requirement 
for at least 8 hours prior to t
he visit. 
On study  visit day s, do not smoke or ingest caffeine during the 30 minutes prior to 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements. 
On study  visit day s, do not take the dose of study drug until instructed to do so by  the 
investigator or designated study  site staff.

Agree to use appropriate
contraception methods ( Section 4.4.1 ).
Agree to avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not to use tanning booths, sun 
lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study .
For subject swho undergo color application to their hair, it is recommended that the 
color application will be performed within one week prior to the scheduled study  
visits , if possible . This will facilitate the consistency of SALT assessment .
Agree to avoid strenuous exercise during the study , especiall y within one week prior 
to the scheduled stud y visits and maintain adequate hydration , if possible .
4.4.1. Contraception
In this stud y, fertile male subjects a nd female subjects who are of childbearing potential will 
receive PF -06651600 and PF -06700841.  PF- 06700841 has been associated with 
demonstrated teratogenicity /fetotoxicity  in animals.  Subjects who are, in the opinion of the 
investigator, sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy  with their partner(s) must agree to use 
2methods of highly  effective contraception throughout the study  and for at least 28 days 
after the last dose of investigational product.  The investigator or his or her designee, in 
consul tation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected 2 appropriate methods 
of contraception for the individual subject and his/her partner(s) from the list of permitted 
contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in 
their consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities
, the 
investigator or designee will inform the subject of the need to use 2 highl y effective methods 
of contraception consistently  and correctly  and document the conversation, and the subject’s 
affirmation, in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
subject to call immediately  if 1 or both of the selected contraception methods is disco ntinued 
or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or partner. 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal), provided the subject 
or male subject’s female partner plans to remain on t he same treatment throughout 
the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate 
period of time to ensure effectiveness. 
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD).

(ie,foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository ).  For countries where spermicide is not 
available or condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly  effective 
contraception, this option is not appropriate.
4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post vasectomy  ejaculate. 
5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectom y or bilateral tubal occlusive 
procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the 
device’s label).
All sexually  active male subjects mu st agree to prevent potential transfer to and exposure of 
partner(s) to drug through ejaculate b y using a condom consistently  and correctl y, beginning 
with the first dose of investigational product and continuing for at least 28 days after the last 
dose of investigational product.
4.5. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact list located in the study  portal. 
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, 
contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the 
event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
subject’s participation in the study .  The contact number can also be used by  investigator 
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site 
and the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the 
established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems th at may arise during the study .The contact 
number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he 
or she will be directed back to the investigator site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per Inte rnational Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). 
For this study , the investiga tional product(s) are PF -06651600 and PF-06700841.

Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 895.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [I WR]).  The site 
personne l (study  coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select 
information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the 
protocol number, and the subject number. The site personnel will then be provided wit h a 
treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number 
when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem.  The IRT sy stem will 
provide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU 
or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. 
The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further 
details on the use of the IRT system. 
5.2.Breaking the Blind
The study  will be subject and investigator blinded.
At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for 
breaking the blind.  The method will be an electronic process.  Blinding codes should be 
broken onl y in exception al circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is 
absolutely  essential for further management of the subject.  Investigators are encouraged to 
discuss with a member of the study  team if they  believe that unblinding is necessary .  When 
the bli nding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented and entered on the case 
report form (CRF).
Details of unblinding plan for interim anal ysis will be specified in interim analy sis plan.
5.3. Subject Compliance
For self- administration of PF -06651600 or PF- 06700841 at home, subject compliance will be 
verified b y the accounting of investigational product at each visit.  When investigational 
product is administered at the research facility , it will be administered under the supervision 
of study  personnel.
Compliance of the investigational product will be monitored by delegated site personnel by 
the accounting of unused medication returned by  the subject a t the study  visits .  Compliance 
will be documented on the CRF and source document .  If compliance is <80%, the 
investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve 
compliance.  Subjects interrupting investigational product
for more than 4 consecutive day s 
or for a total of more than 7 days between visits are to be discussed w ith the sponsor for 
possible withdrawal from the study .

Blinded PF -06651600 and PF- 06700841 tablets and matching placebos will be provided as 
tablets for oral administration.  The designation “PF-06651600 -15” and “PF - 06700841- 15” 
may appear on labeling and indicates a salt.  They  are equivalent to “PF -06651600” and 
“PF
-06700841” with regard to this protocol.  The PF - 06651600 50 mg tablets and their 
matching placebos will be supplied in blisters a nd labeled according to local regulatory  
requirements.  The PF -06700841 5 mg and 25 mg tablets and their matching placebos will be 
supplied in bottles and labeled according to local regulatory  requirements.  Subjects will 
receive blinded labeled supplies t hroughout the study  including the E xtension Period .
Blinding occurs within investigational products, not across investigational products. The 
Extension Period will become single- blind (investigator open, sponsor open and subject 
blind) upon approval of Amendment 4. The Cross- Over Extension Period is open label.
5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing
The investigational product (I P) will be dispensed using an I RT drug management sy stem at 
each visit according to Schedule of Activities.  A qua lified staff member will dispense the 
investigational product via unique container numbers on the bottles or blister labels provided, 
in quantities appropriate for the stud y visit schedule.  The subject/caregiver should be 
instructed to maintain the produc t in bottles or blisters provided throughout the course of 
dosing and return the bottles or blisters to the site at the next study  visit. 
5.5.Administration
Subjects will receive IP as outpatients.  PF- 06651600 tablets and matching placebo for oral 
administra tion will be dispensed in blisters while PF -06700841 tablets and matching placebo 
for oral administration will be dispensed in bottles .  Subjects will be provided clear dosing 
instructions.
Sites will be trained on how subjects should take tablets at home through an I P manual and/or 
other vehicle(s).  Sites are responsible for communicating this information and site staff 
shoul dreview the dosing instructions with subjects at every study visit .
Subjects should take the medication orall y; Subjects should s wallow the tablets with ambient 
temperature water to a total volume of approximately  240 mL;Subjects will swallow the 
investigational product whole, and will not manipulate or chew the medication prior to 
swallowing
; Subjects will be encouraged to take th e medication after breakfast 
whenever possible even though I P may  be taken with or without food; however, forstudy 
visit days , subjects are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are to take the 
dose in the clinic.
If a dose is missed and th e interval to the next dose is less than 8 hours, the missed dose 
should not be administered.

Page 91Study  treatment may be temporaril y withheld (or adjusted) for a maximum of 4consecutive 
days at the discretion of the investigator.   Subjects interrupting invest igational product for 
more than 4 consecutive day s are to be discussed with the 
sponsor for possible withdrawal 
from the study .
5.6.Investigational Product Storage 
The investigator or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigat ional products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required 
storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements.
Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with 
the labels. 
Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions 
stated on the product label.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum tempe ratures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products).  This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .  Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stem s, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum 
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applic able, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon 
discovery .  The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage 
conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage 
requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a 
protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the 
temperature excursion.   Use of the investigat ional product prior to Pfizer approval will be 
considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routin e handling operations where 
the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not 
considered excursions.
Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home 
investigational products.

Page 925.7.Investi gational Product Accountability 
The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or 
other disposition of the investigational product supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record. 
All study  drug must be returned to the investigator by  the subject at every  visit and at the end 
of the trial.
5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational 
product (eg, at the site).  If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
For all blisters/bottles returned to the investigator by  the subject, the investigator will 
maintain the returned supply  until destruction is authorized.  Pf izer will provide instructions 
as to the disposition of any  unused investigational product.
5.8. Concomitant Treatment(s)
Medications that are taken in the Screening period (after informed consent is obtained and 
before the first dose of study  drug) will be documented as prior medications.  Medications 
taken after the first dose of study drug has been administered will be documented as 
concomitant medications.   All concomitant medications taken during the study must be 
recorded in study  records with indication, daily  dose, and start and stop dates of 
administration.  Subjects will be queried about concomitant medication (including topical 
medications and treatments, over -the-counter and prescription medications and treatments, 
and vaccinations) at each study  visit.  Any  new concomitant medications or dose changes to 
current concomitant medications should be evaluated for potential new or worsening adverse 
events.
The start date, stop date, and indication for all therapies will be recorded on the CRF.
5.8.1. Permitted Con comitant Medications
Acetaminophen may  be used intermittently  (not to exceed 1 g/day ).  For the purposes of this 
protocol, dietary  supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, 
and purified food substances 
with pharmaceutical properties.   Vitamins, minera ls and purified food substances are allowed 
in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as h ypervitaminosis).
A subject who is receiving metformin as concomitant medication must allow at least two 
hours 
to elapse after taking the medic ation and before taking investigational product .

locally -approved medication and dose for the treated indication, and this must be 
documented in the CRF.  Subjects ar e not allowed any  other investigational drugs or 
treatments during the study . 
Subjects should refrain from starting new or changing doses of permitted prescription or 
non-prescription drugs, vitamins, and dietary  supplements within 7 days or 5 half-lives 
(whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 and prior to study  visits throughout the study , unless 
otherw ise noted below.
Subjects should report any  changes to permitted medications during the study  to the 
investigator as soon as they  occur.  Medication changes must be documented in the subject’s 
record and CRF.
Unless a prohibited medication or treatment, subjects may  be administered any
 other 
medications necessary  for the treatment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed 
necessary  by the treating phy sician.  Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications 
or an y change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medicall y essential. 
5.8.2. Prohibited Medications and Treatments
Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medic ations as described in the Inclusion and 
Exclusion sections of the protocol and Appendix 2Prohibited Concomitant Medications. 
Subjects should be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptly  if 
there are an y intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. 
A subject who is receiving simvastatin as concomitant medication should be switch edat 
least 7 days prior to baseline to an alternat ive statin . Treatment with 
simvastatin -containing products should not be initiated during participation in this study . 
All medications and treatments that could affect AA must be discontinued.   Subjects 
must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and a void the use of tanning booths, sun 
lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study .
Herbals supplements are only
 allowed on a case by  case basis; please contact the Pfizer staff.  
Herbal medications with unknown properties or known beneficial e ffects for AA or that are 
known to have an effect on drug metabolism (eg St. John’s Wort )must be discontinued at 
least 1 week or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of investigational

(smallpox) vaccine.  Following vaccination with live component vaccines, the virus may  be 
shed in bodily  fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may  be 
transmitted.
6. STUDY PROCEDURES 
Refer to t he Schedule of Activity for a detailed list of study procedures as they  should be 
conducted at each respective visit. 
Subjects are required to fast for at least 8hours prior to all visits that include fasting lipid
profile panel testing.  During the fasting period, subjects should refrain from all food and 
liquids (water and non -study  medications are permitted). 
Due to possible need for PPD testing and chest radiograph, screening procedures may  be 
performed over more than 1 visit within the 35 days prior to the Day 1 visit .
Visits should occur in the morning and prior to the subject’s dose.  To assure consistency  and 
reduce variability , all study  visits should occur in the morning whenever possible .  On day s 
of study  visits, s ubj
ects will receive their dose at the clinic during their study  visit .
Urine pregnancy  test must be performed prior to dosing with the investigational product for 
female subjects of childbearing potential through end of study  (EOS ).
The patient report outco meassessments should be comp leted before the other evaluations or 
treatments at the clinical visits whenever it is possible. 
Refer to Appendix 6for guidelines on subject safety  monitoring and discontinuation. 
6.1.Screening
Subjects will have up to 35 days of a screening period confirm that they  meet the subject 
selection criteria for the study .  The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the 
investigator site) will obtain informed consent from each subject in accordance wit h the 
procedures described in the Schedule of Activities section.
If the Mantoux PPD tuberculin skin test is given, the subject must return between 
48-72 hours post - injection for induration evaluation.

Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 95Screening laboratory  tests wi th abnormal results may  be repeated once to confirm abnormal 
results (with the same screening number) ; the last value will be used to determine eligibility .  
If results return to normal within the 5-week screening period, the subject may  enter the 
study . 
Sites will be permitted to re -screen subjects (with a new screening number) who initially  do 
not meet eligibility  criteria once .
The following procedures will be completed:
Obtain written informed consent.
Review Inclusion and Exclusion criteria.
Register subject in I mpala.
Demograph y. 
Complete A
A disease history includes collection of details of AA at Screening: AA 
background, AA history , AA diagnosis, pattern of scalp hair loss, body  hair loss, nail 
involvement, the use of topical treatments, s ystemic tr eatments and other treatments 
for AA. 
Complete medical history, in addition to AA history , including history  of drug, 
alcohol, tobacco use , skin rash, skin infection, and any  dermal abnormalities that may  
predispose to infection will be collected at Scree ning.  Smoking status and average 
weekl y alcohol consumption (units/week) will also be collected .
Obtain complete medication history  of all prescription or nonprescription drugs, and 
dietary  and herbal supplements taken within 35days prior to the Screening Visit. 
In addition, p revious drug treatments for AAtaken within the 2 years before the 
Screening visit must be documented including the use of topical treatments,
intralesional treatments, sy stemic treatments and any  other treatments. 
Conduct complete physical examination including dermatological full bod y 
examination .
Obtain vital signs including pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory  rate (after at least 
5minutes of rest) and oral or tympanic temperature.
Audiogram .
Perform single 12- lead electroca rdiogram (ECG).
Obtain weight .

Follow -up contact only  applies to subjects who have the EOS Visit taking place less than 
28days after the last dose. Follow -up contact will be completed at least 28 calendar day s, 
and up to 35 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product to 
capture an y potential adverse events (see the Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE 
Information section) and to confirm appropriate contraception usage (see the Contraception
section).  Contact with the subject may  be done via a phone call.
6.6.Subject Withdrawal/Early Termination
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor fo r safety  (see also the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site. 
Subjects who are request edto discontinue study  treatment from the T reatment Period or 
Extension P eriod swill enter into the Follow -up Period with their first follow-up visit 
occurring 1 week after their last dose whenever possible andcontinue to be followed for 
protocol specified follow- up procedures.  T he procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be 
performed on the last day the subject takes the investigational product or as soon as possible 
thereafter.
See Appendix 6for guidelines on subject safety  monitoring and discontinuation.  The ET 
Visit only  applies to subjects who are randomized, received at least one dose of study  drug ,
and then are prematurel y withdrawn from the study treatment.
If a subject doe s not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
subject.  All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts 
must be documented in the subject’s medical record.  In an y circumstance, every  effort 
should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire 
about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational 
product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if app licable, and follow up with 
the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).
Withdrawal of consent :
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment from the T reatment Period or 
Extension P eriod swill enter the Follow -up Period with their first follow -up visit occurring 
1 week after their last dose whenever possible and continue to be followed for protocol 
specified follow -up procedures.   The procedures scheduled for ET Visit will be performed 
on the last day  the subject takes the in
vestigational product or as soon as possible thereafter.   
The only  exception to this is when a subject specifically  withdraws consent for any  further 
contact with him or her or persons previously  authorized by  the subject to provide this 
information. Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw 
consent from future follow -up, whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be 
explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal i s

Page 132only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or post
treatment study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital 
status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, p ublicl y available information 
should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
Lost to follow- up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing 
status.  This includes follow -up with persons authorized by  the subject as noted above.  Lost 
tofollow -up is defined by  the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented 
phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as l ack of response by  the subject to 1registered mail 
letter.  All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain 
the date and cause of d eath.  I f the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a sponsor
-retained third -party representative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary  to 
complete the follow -up portion of the study .  The site staff and representative will consult 
publicly  available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain 
updated contact information.  I f, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow -up, then 
the last -known- alive date as determined by  the investigator should be reported and 
documented in the subject’s medical reco rds.
Subjects who withdraw from the study  may  be replaced at the discretion of the investigator 
upon consultation with the sponsor. 
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as describe d.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet yand well -being of the subject.  When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior 
to initiation of the study .

Page 1337.1. Pregnancy Testing
Pregnancy tests are required to be done (if applicable) as specified in the Schedule of 
Activities . 
All pregnancy tests used in this study, either urine or serum, must have a sensitivity of at 
least 25 mIU/mL and must be performed by a certified laboratory.  For female subjects of childbearing potential, 2 negative pregnancy tests are required before receiving study treatment(s) (1 negative pregnancy test at screening and 1 at the baseline visit immediately before study treatment administration).  Following a negative pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and the second negative pregnancy test result will then be required at the baseline visit and within 5 days after the first day of the menstrual period (counting the first day of the menstrual period as Day 1) before the subject may receive the study treatment.  In the absence of regular menstrual bleeding, the study candidate should have used 2 forms of contraception for at least 1 month before the second pregnancy test.  Pregnancy tests will also be repeated at every visit and at the end of the study to confirm that the subject has not become pregnant during the study.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period and when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected, and may be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations.  In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product but may remain in the study for follow up.

7.3. Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by the spontaneous reporting of AEs, physical examinations and 
clinical laboratory results in all subjects who receive at least one dose of the investigational product.  Unscheduled safety assessments may be performed at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety concerns.  Investigators and Pfizer Clinicians (or designees) will review individual subject data throughout the conduct of the study to ensure subjects’ well-being.CCI

Page 1357.3.1. Vitals Signs
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory  rates and temperature) will be measured after 5 
minutes of rest as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . 
Vital signs should be performed before laboratory blood collection. 
It is preferred that bod y temperature be collected using the ty mpanic or oral methods and that 
the same method be used consiste ntly throughout the study . 
Blood pressure (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring 
device.  A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes based on the arm circumference is the 
required t ype of device.  The appropriate cuff size for the subject must be used to ensure 
accurate measurement.  The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm 
should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the 
specifications of the BP measuring device .  The same properly  sized and calibrated blood 
pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time. 
Subjects should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such 
as rolled- up sleeves, etc.) and supported at he art level.  Measurements should be taken on the 
same arm at each visit (preferabl y non -dominant).  Subjects should refrain from smoking or 
ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes preceding the measurements.  Measurements should 
begin after at least 5 minu tes of rest. 
Pulse should be measured at approximatel y the same time as BP for a minimum of 
30seconds.  When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a 
blood collection or other study  procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be obtained first.
7.3.2. Medical History, Physical Exam, Height, and Weight
Complete AA disease history includes collection of details of AA at Screening: background, 
AA history , AA diagnosis, pattern of scalp hair loss, body  hair loss, nail involvement, the us e 
of topical treatments, s ystemic treatments and other treatments for AA.  Medical history , in 
addition to AA history , including history  of drug, alcohol, tobacco use , skin rash, skin 
infection, and an y dermal abnormalities that may predispose to infection will be collected at 
Screening and baseline (if applicable) .  Smoking status and average weekl y alcohol 
consumption (units/week) will also be collected .
Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes.  Height (inches or 
centimeters) and weight (lbs or kgs) will be measured and recorded in the source document at 
the Screening visit.  Weight (lbs or kg) will continue to be measured and recorded at various 
timepoints according to Schedules of Activities .
Complete physical examinations must be performed by  the investigator, sub -investigator or a 
qualified health professional per local guidelines.  Complete phy sical examinations consist of 
assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (H EENT); mouth, 
heart; lungs; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologic 
function, back, and l ymph nodes.  In addition, dermatological full body exam must be

Page 136performed b y the investigator, sub -investigator or a qualified health professional per local 
guidelines.
Dermatological examinations should include visual inspection of the breasts and 
external genitalia.
Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by  the investigator, sub -investigator or a 
qualified health p rofessional per local guidelines and should include skin, heart, lung, and 
abdomen and examination of body  systems where there are s ymptom complaints by  the 
subject. 
Complete and Targeted phy sical examinations are performed at various time points, see 
Schedules of Activities .
7.3.3. Chest Radiography
Chest X -ray (posterior -anterior and lateral views are recommended, however local guidelines 
should be followed) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, computed t omograph y[CT] or 
magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ]) with no evidence of abnormalities including but not 
limited to current, active TB or previous inactive TB, general infections, heart failure or 
malignancy  taken at Screening or within 12 weeks prior to Study  Day 1 and read by  a 
qualified radiologist.  Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in 
the source documentation.
7.3.4. Electrocardiogram
Single 12 -lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities . 
Allscheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
10minutes in a supine position and prior to any  blood collection. 
The baseline ECG values will serve as each subject’s baseline values.  To ensure safety  of 
the subject s, a qualified medical personnel at the investigator site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements.  A paper or digital cop y of the ECG should be filed in the subject’s 
chart and must be available to the sponsor upon request.  Any  clinically  signific ant changes 
will be recorded and evaluated further, as clinically  warranted.  In some cases, it may  be 
appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to 
the ECG abnormality . 
7.3.5. Audiogram
All subjects will have an audiogram at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .  
Audiogram testing taken at Screening or within 8 weeks prior to 
Day1must have results 
available prior to Day 1. Audiogram testing at Week 12 must be completed and results 
available b y the Week 16Visit. Audiogram testing at Week 24 must be completed and 
results available b y the Week 28Visit.   For subjects who are assigned to the placebo group 
and meet the pre -spcified criteria during the Single -Blind Extension Period, audiogram 
testing must be completed and results available b y the AT D1Visit unless an audiogram 
testing has been performed within 8 weeks prior to A T D1 Visit. For Cross -Over Open 
Label Extension Period, audiogram testing must be completed and results avail able b y the

Visit. For subjects that terminate early from the study, efforts must be made to complete the 
audiogram testing and obtain the results.
When possible, the subject should have the audiogram performed at the same evaluation 
center during the study . 
If there is a clinicall y-meaningful, treatment- related decline in hearing from baseline, the 
subject will be followed off treatment with appropriate testing at re gular intervals, until 
hearing returns to baseline or is determined to be clinically  stable.
The information from the audiogram will be entered into the data collection tool.
Any de-identified audiogram results/reports and any  additional relevant test results (if 
applicable) may  be requested to be forwarded to Pfizer (and/or designee) at any  time during 
the study .
7.3.6. Tuberculosis Testing
7.3.6.1. Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) Tuberculin Test
Subjects may  be screened for TB using an IGRA per local guidelines.  I nterferon gamma 
release assay  will be tested during screening or within 12 weeks prior to Day 1.  The 
following are acceptable IGRA assay s:  QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT- G), 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube test (QFT -GIT) and T -SPOTTB test.  Site personnel
should follow the processing and anal yses steps based on the assay  chosen.  Ensure 
incubation steps are followed as appropriate.
An IGRA is preferred for subjects with a prior BCG vaccination, but may  be used for any  
subject.  Documentation of IGRA produc t used and the test result must be in the subject’s 
source documentation.
If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may  be repeated, and if a negative result 
is obtained, enrollment may  proceed.   A positive test on repeat is exclusionary . 
Subjects with repeat indeterminate IGRA results may  be enrolled after consultation with 
pulmonary  or infectious disease specialist that determines low risk of infection (ie, subject 
would be acceptable for immunosuppressant (eg, anti
-TNF) treatment without ad ditional 
action).
Subjects who test positive for QFT -G/ QFT -GIT test, but in the opinion of the PI  are at low 
risk of TB infection may  be referred to pulmonary  or infectious disease specialist for 
consultation and potential IGRA test repeated once.   Subjec ts will be eligible if the repeat test 
is negative before the randomization.
Refer to lab manual for any  additional processing information and shipping instructions.

Subjects can be TB screened using the Mantoux/PPD Tuberculin Skin Test.  Mantoux/PPD 
testing can also be performed if there are indeterminate QFT-G test results.  Subjects must have a Mantoux/PPD tuberculin skin test administered and then evaluated by a health care professional 48 to 72 hours later.  A positive Mantoux/PPD tuberculin skin test is exclusionary.
7.3.7. Special Safety Assessment
7.3.7.1. Dermatological Events
All subjects will have a dermatological full body exam at Screening Visit.  Skin lesions will 
be evaluated as defined in the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0) and managed as Appendix 4 . 
7.3.7.1.1. Herpetiform Rash 
For any occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes zoster and herpes simplex), 
specimens for viral DNA analysis will be obtained: A swab of the affected area will be collected for confirmation; a blood sample for viral surveillance will be collected for the analysis of viral load. Details for these collections will be provided in the laboratory manual.
7.3.7.1.2. Drug-Related Rash
All potential drug-related reports of rash will be followed up until resolution or clinically 
stable or in agreement with the sponsor. 
All events of rash should be treated according to International and local guidelines for the 
treatment of rash, eg, where appropriate, topical corticosteroids and/or agents such as antibiotics or antivirals could be prescribed. 
All subjects reporting an unexplained skin rash should undergo a formal comprehensive 
dermatologic evaluation.  A 4 mm punch biopsy will be taken unless there is a clear, non-drug related etiology (eg, infection, pre-existing condition) or other clinical rationale (eg, if the rash is present on the face it may not be appropriate to take a biopsy) or subject refuse to have biopsy performed.  The biopsy will be sent to the local laboratory for histological investigation of the rash in order to gain insight into potential etiology of the rash.  Note: For herpetiform rash, no biopsy is required.  Please see Section 7.3.7.1.1 . 
In addition to a biopsy of suspected drug-related rash, a swab (for microbiological 
assessment) of the affected area will also be taken for culture and sensitivity to assess (at the 
local laboratory) for any bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens, if applicable.  A blood sample 
for viral surveillance will be collected (and sent to the central laboratory) for the analysis of viral load including but not limited to CMV, EBV, HSV1, HSV2, and VZV, if applicable.

All de -identified biopsy  results, culture results, photographs, and any  additional relevant test 
results will be forwarded to Pfizer (or designee) for review within 30 days of receipt by  the 
PI.
An independent dermatologist contracted b y Pfizer will review all relevant data and 
summarize the data at the end of the stud y.
7.3.7.2. Creatinine, Cystatin C, and estimates of Glomerular Filtration R ate (eGFR)
Serum creatinine is the best known standard test for monitoring renal function.   However, 
serum creatinine based estimates of glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) may  be affected b y 
factors other than renal function, including chronic a nd acute illness.
  Serum c ystatin C is a 
test that can be used either as an adjunct to or a replacement for serum creatinine.   The most 
reliable estimates of GFR use both test results.8
Serum c ystatin C is a lo w molecular weight protein that is used as an alternative to serum 
creatinine for monitoring of renal function.   It seems to correlate more closely  with GFR than 
serum creatinine concentration and may  be a more sensitive detector of early  renal 
dysfunction .17
,3  While use of cy statin C has been limited, its independence of demographic 
factors (eg, race) has made it an interesting means of determining changes in renal f unction 
in clinical settings and it is included in the 2012 Kidney  Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes ( KDIGO) guidelines.   Estimated GFR may  be calculated via the 2012 Chronic 
Kidney
 Disease Epidemiology  Collaboration (CKD - EPI) creatinine, cy statin C, or 
creatinine -Cystatin C equations.10
Serum creatinine will be measured as part of serum chemistry  at times specified in the 
Schedule of Activities sectionof the protocol.   Creatinine eleva tions above the ULN will be 
followed until resolution or baseline. Serum creatinine based eGFR will be calculated.
  
Serum cy statin C will be measured and cy statin C based eGFR will be calculated at times 
specified in the Schedule o f Activities section of the protocol. 
The eGFR will be calculated using the 2 sets of equations developed b y the Chronic Kidney  
Disease Epidemiolog y Collaboration (CKD -EPI), which utilize serum creatinine (SCr) and 
serum Cy statin C (S Cystatin C) respect ively.26

7.5.1. Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT)
Severity  of alopecia t ool is a quantitative assessment of AA severit y based on scalp hair loss.  
A visual aid showing the division of the scalp hair into four quadrants, back, top of scalp, and 
both sides, with each of the four quadrants given an accurate determination of the % of scalp 
surface area covered , representing 24% , 40%, 18%, and 18% of the total scalp surface area .  
Score parameters are detailed in Appendix 3.  For any male subject, the male pattern 
alopecia should be permitted to score SA LT 0 at the end of trial . Male pattern alopecia 
scoring may be considered for final adjudication by alopecia areata expert(s
).
Subject should have a SALT score 50% at Screening and Baseline to be eligible for the 
study. 
Theretreatment criteria during t he Single -Blind Extension Period will be specified in SAP. 
The photos may  be reviewed by  an independent consultant to confirm the SAL T scores.
7.5.2. Investigator Global Assessment (
IGA)
The clinical evaluator of AAwill perform an assessment of the overall impr ovement of AA
and assign a n IGA score and category  as described in Table 9.  This takes into account extent 
and density  ofregrowth by  the SALT scoring s ystem. 
For determination IGA, the SAL Tscore would be determined at baseline and each follow -
up 
visit and the percentage change from baseline determined by the following: (SAL Tbaseline –
SAL Tfollow -up)/SAL Tbaseline X 100% = %change from baseline.
Example: 75% hair loss at baseline (SALT score 75%) , 50% hair loss at follow -up(SALT
score 50%) , the percent regrowth = ( 75%- 50% )/ 75% X 100% = 33% regrowth.
The IGA should be permitted to score 0 (no change or fur ther loss) at baseline.

7.10.8. Shipment of Pharmacodynamic Samples
The shipment address and assay lab contact information will be provided to the investigator 
site prior to initiation of the study.
7.11. Skin Biopsies
Biopsy samples will be collected only at pre-selected biopsy sites and only on subjects who 
provide consent to participate in the biopsy sub-study. 
The lesion(s) selected for biopsy will be outlined using a black permanent marker on plastic 
transparency film.  An area will be marked on the transparency film for identification and biopsy.  The film will be identified with the study number and subject’s identification number and retained with subject’s clinic/site source documents.
Biopsies of the lesional and non-lesional scalp (in subjects that have non-lesional scalp) will 
be obtained at each time point as specified in the Schedule of Activities .  In case of early 
termination, a lesional biopsy will be obtained at the ET visit.  All skin biopsies will be approximately 5 mm in diameter.
Biopsy samples will be prepared for histopathology and immunohistochemistry and for RNA 
extraction as described in a separate study manual that will be provided to investigators.  Skin biopsies will be sent to designated laboratories for analysis following a schedule to be determined.
The shipment address and laboratory contact information will be provided to the investigator 
prior to initiation of the study.  Details on the procedure for skin biopsy and sample preparation will be provided to investigators in a separate study manual.

Page 148As skin biopsies may be associated with risk of bleeding or infection, subjects will be 
instructed to contact the investigator or other designated site staff if they experience bleeding, warmth, swelling, tenderness, or erythema at the biopsy site; an unscheduled visit may be required for clinical assessment.  If a wound infection occurs at the site of the biopsy, a bacterial culture will be performed as part of standard of care procedures.
7.12. Rater Qualifications 
Clinical evaluations of alopecia areata will be performed by an experienced and qualified 
dermatologist (board certified or equivalent).  An experienced and qualified non-dermatologist physician or experienced medical professional with experience in the conduct of AA clinical trials may be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of alopecia areata when designated by primary site Investigator.  The evaluator must receive and document protocol specific and applicable efficacy assessment scales training prior to performing these evaluations.  To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same 
evaluator must assess all dermatological clinical evaluations for any individual subject 
throughout the study whenever possible ; a back-up experienced and qualified, 
protocol-trained evaluator will only be allowed and documented in case of emergency or special situations when the designated evaluator is unable to perform the evaluation.
8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.

B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 149All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safety  on the CT SAE Report 
Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be report ed 
regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an 
investigational product under study .  In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, 
notification to Pfizer Safety  must be made immediately , irrespective of t he extent of available 
event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on 
previously  forwarded reports.  I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become 
immediately  aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event 
within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -
up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF.  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible c ausalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to Pfizer Safety .  An y pertine nt additional information must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y
non-serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE.  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  berequested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1.
Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 1508.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subjec t will be questioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal/Early Termination section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished fr om withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on 
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Fo rm, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.
8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a 
minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product.
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the activ e collection period are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to Pfizer Safety .
Follow up by  the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and 
until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and 
Pfizer concurs with that assessment.
8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Foll
ow-up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or 
stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment.

B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 1518.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provi ded for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the deter mination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know w hether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investigator's causality
 assessment is “unknown but not 
related” t o investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study  records. 
In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, 
the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and C RF, and 
report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adve rse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causa l relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in physical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  include signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 152Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional dia gnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of any  protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other thera py; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does n ot require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existi ng hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 153Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic br onchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.2.4. Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equivalent he althcare facility , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit is assessed for medical importance.
Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilit ation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg, caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical 
AE is not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
workup of a persistent pretre atment laboratory  abnormality );
Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep);

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 154Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessmen t
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere w ith subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study.  All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer 
Safety  by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induc ed Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  elevations in 
transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 155serious potential outcome.  These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug- induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a tran saminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by  several 
days or weeks.  The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
individual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definit ively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseli ne value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches 
>3×ULN (whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 156In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood an d an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  
Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Potential Cases of Decreased eGFR 
In the PF -06700841 FIH study  B7931001, serum creatinine elevation was reported across 
dose levels in both healthy  volunteer and psoriasis patients.  The proposed mechanism for the 
observed serum creatinine increases in study  B7931001 is inhibition of creatinine transport in 
the kidney  (ie, transporter -mediated rather than direct nephrotoxicity ) (Section 1.2.4.2.2.1). 
All subjects will have serum creatinine based and serum cy statin -C based eGFR calculated at 
baseline upon entry  into the study . 
Abnormal values in serum creatinine concurrent with absence of increase in blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN ) that meet the below criteria, in the absence of other causes of kidney  injury , 
are considered important medical events. 
Estimated GFR using serum creatinine (2009 CKD- EPI eGFR)14and serum cystatin C (2012 
CKD -EPI eGFR)10will be determined at times specified in the Schedule of Activities .  If an 
individual subject demonstrates a CONCOMITAN T serum creatinine based AND serum 
cystatin C based eGFR decline of 30% compared to the subject’s baseline eGFR , then 
the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, supportive measures and 
immediate evaluation by nephrologist (preferably within 24 hours) with appropriate 
management should be taken for evaluation and treatment as clinicall y indicated.
  If the 
subject cannot be seen by a nephrologist within 24 hours, then then subject should be sent to 
a local emergency  room for assessment of renal function.  Results should be repeated as 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 157indicated b y the nephrologist or weekl y at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline 
15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable b y the nephrologist and/or PI. eGFR 
results will be communicated to the treating ph ysician. 
Subjects should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 24 to 48hours from awareness of the abnormal eGFR ( CONCOMITANT 
serum creatinine based AND serum cy statin C based eGFR decline of  30% compared to the 
subject’s baseline eGFR ) result for a safet y follow -up visit.  This evaluation should include 
laboratory  tests, detailed history , and ph ysical assessment.  I n addition to repeating serum 
creatinine and serum cy statin C, labor atory  tests should also include: serum BUN, serum CK, 
serum electrol ytes (including at a minimum potassium, sodium, phosphate/phosphorus, 
calcium), in addition to urine dipstick, urine microscopic examination, and urinary  indices.  
All cases confirmed on r epeat testing as meeting the above pre- set laboratory  criteria, with no 
other cause(s) of laboratory  abnormalities identified should be considered as important 
medical event irrespective of availabilit y of all the results of the investigations performed to
determine etiolog y of the abnormal serum creatinine. 
All relevant test results will be forwarded to Pfizer for review within 30 days of receipt by  
the PI . 
This requirement applies to all subjects.
8.4.4. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
8.4.4.1. Exposure During Pregnanc y
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposu re) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact 
with a Pfizer produc t in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of c onception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 158If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or 
spillage) to Pfizer Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The 
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -
up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  gross visual inspection (u nless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs .  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the investigational product.
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  the sponsor.  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partne r.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
A special safety concern (SSC), fetal cleft lip, was reported in the B7931004 (investigating 
PF-06700841 to treat psoriasis) trial affecting a singleton pregnancy of a subject on concomitant 
medications including an herbal supplement which carried a pregnancy warning.

B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 1598.4.4.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer 
drug specifically  approved f or use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
8.4.4.3. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.5. Medication Errors 
Other exposures to the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings,
such as medication errors .
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to Pfizer 
Safety Within 24 Hours of 
Awareness
Medication errors All (regardless of whether

SAE
8.4.5.1. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. 
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medicatio n

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
This section outlines the key  planned statistical summaries and analy ses for the data collected 
in this study .  A comprehensive overall Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will b e provided prior 
to the un-blinding of the trial.  The SAP may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; 
however, an y major modifications of planned analyses will be reflected in a protocol 
amendment if it is modified before data un -blinding.   If, after t he trial is un -blinded, changes 
are made to the SAP, then these deviations to the plan will be documented, along with an 
explanation as to wh y they occurred, in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).
Data will be cleaned, a snapshot of the database will be creat ed,and efficacy  and safet y data 
from the 24 -week Treatment Period will be summarized in the interim CSR and published 
once the last subject last visit occurs for the initial 24-week Treatment Period. The interim 
study  report may  be shared with the PI  whe n it is available . 
9.1.Sample Size Determination
The standard deviation of SALT mean change from baseline at Week 24 was calculated by  
simulating subject level data from the summary  data from the open label study  in AA using 
tofacitinib.12  The adjusted standard deviation (SD) for the change from baseline was 
calculated to be ~32.43. 
The sample size is based on the primary  efficacy  endpoint, mean change from baseline in 
SAL T score at Week 24.  The null hy pothesis t o be tested for one compound (PF -06700841) 
is to assess if the difference between PF
-06700841 and placebo is less than or equal to 20 vs 
the alternative h ypothesis if the difference between PF
-06700841 and placebo is greater than 
20.  Using a between- group comparison at Week 24, for PF -06700841 vs placebo and 
PF
-06651600 vs placebo, 30 completers in each arm provides approximately 89.9% power to 
detect a true mean change from baseline in SALT total equal to 15.   This is for a test 
conducted at a one -sided l
evel of significance of 2.5% (adjusted for two active vs placebo 
comparisons).  Assuming a 30% average drop -out in the study  the total sample size would 
be~132.
For the biopsy  sub- study  which will be performed at selected sites, approximately  42subjects 
will be randomized (30 completers; assuming 30% drop out rate.  Subjects will be 
randomized to PF -06651600 or matching placebo in a 2:1 ratio or PF -06700841 or matching 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio.   During the data analy sis for the biopsy  sub -study , placebo gro ups will 
be combined to yield final investigational product: placebo ratios of 1:1:1 for each 
investigational product.   Due to the exploratory  nature of the sub -study , there is no formal 
sample -size calculation performed for the biops y sub-study .

Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 161There is no re -randomization at the start of the Single -Blind Extension P eriod or Cross -Over 
Open Label Extension Period. 
9.2.Efficacy Analysis During the Treatment Period
All subjects who receive at least one dose of randomized study  medication, and have a 
baseline a nd at least one post -baseline measurement (after taking randomized study  
medication) will be included in the efficacy  data analy ses. Alpha adjustments for primary  
and secondary  endpoints will be described in the SAP.
9.2.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint Durin g the Treatment Period 
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is change from baseline in the SAL T score.  The primary  time 
point is Week 24.  Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to randomization (Day 1 
of the Double -Blind Treatment Period).
All othe r collection time points will be considered
secondary .  A linear mixed -effect repeated measures model with fixed effects for treatment, 
time (visit), baseline value of SALT and investigator site, and a random effect for subject, 
will be used to anal yze the change from baseline in the SAL T score (this will be denoted as 
the primary  analy sis).  This model may  also include effects for treatment by  time interaction 
and baseline value of SALT b y treatment interaction and disease sub -type.  The estimation 
method used will be restricted maximum likelihood.   Due to the unknown nature of the 
longitudinal data, different covariance structures among repeated measures will be examined 
based on model diagnostics.   Using this model, adjusted 95% upper confidence bound 
comparing the mean change from baseline in SALT estimates at Week 24 for PF -
06700841 
vs. placebo and PF -06651600 vs placebo will be computed .Alpha adjustments for primary  
and secondary  endpoints will be described in the SAP.
Supplemental anal yses of the pri mary  variable will be performed to support the robustness of 
the conclusions drawn from the primary  anal ysis described above such as, verify  assumptions 
of possible normality  violations, sensitivity  analy ses to account for informative drop -outs.  
Details of these supplemental anal yses will be included in the SAP.
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) will be 
provided for the baseline and change from baseline values b y treatment group and visit.
9.2.2. Analysis of Seconda ry Endpoints During the Treatment Period
The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint is proportion of subjects achieving a 30% improvement 
in SAL T (SALT 30) at Week 24.  The primary  time point is Week 24.  All other collection 
time points will be considered second ary. 
The frequency  and percentage of SALT 30 responders will be presented at all
post-randomization visits as specified in the SoA where SALT is collected.   The SALT 30 
response rate will be analyzed b y a generalized linear mixed model, with fixed factors of 
treatment, visit, treatment by  visit, baseline SALT score.  Within - subject covariance structure 
may be considered by  assessing various models (eg, unstructured, Toeplitz and first order 
autoregressive etc.) and the corresponding results will be compare d for the sake of checking

Week 24 as described by the statistical model above.
Detailed description of analyses for other secondary endpoints will be outlined in the SAP.  
Continuous and discrete modelling techniques will be applied whenever applicable. 
9.2.3. Analysis of Other Endpoints During the Treatment Period
 
 
 
Continuous and discrete modelling techniques will be applied whenever applicable.  
Distribution summaries will be presented by means of summary tables data visualization methods.  Detailed description of analyses for other endpoints will be outlined in the SAP.
 
9.2.3.1. Pharmacokinetic Analysis During the Treatment Period
The PK concentration population is defined as all enrolled subjects who received at least one 
dose of PF-06651600 or PF-06700841 and in whom at least one concentration value is reported.
PK concentrations will be summarized and presented with summary statistics.  A population 
PK model may be developed for the purpose of estimating PK parameters.  Any population PK model developed to characterize the PK data will be reported separately.
Data permitting, the relationship between exposure and clinical responses (efficacy and 
safety) from subjects with AA may be explored using either observed or modeled exposures.  Any population analyses conducted will not be part of the clinical study report (CSR) and may be reported separately.
9.2.3.2. PK/PD Unblinding Plan
A PK/PD unblinding plan approved by the clinical lead, clinical pharmacology lead and 
statistical lead may be in place to describe the procedures to be employed in safeguarding the study blind for members of the study team.  These procedures will be in accordance with applicable Pfizer standard operating procedures (SOPs) for releasing randomization codes and breaking the study blind.  Under this plan a group of statisticians, PK/PD data provider, 
PK/PD analyst and PK/PD support would be unblinded in order to initiate the building of 
statistical models of the PK, dose/response as well as exposure/response analysis models and conduct associated simulations.  The aim of this work would be to facilitate a fuller interpretation of the study upon completion (at appropriate interim milestone).  This group will not serve on the study team during the period of early unblinding.  The unblinding may occur after the last subject has been randomized.  The details of the procedures will be CCI

9.3. Safety Analysis During the Treatment Period
The safety analysis set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of the 
drug or placebo.  Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate.  All safety endpoints will be listed and summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards.  Categorical outcomes (eg, AEs) will be summarized by subject counts and percentage.  Continuous outcome (eg, BP, heart rate, etc) will be summarized using N, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  Change from baseline in laboratory data and vital signs will also be summarized. Categorical summaries will be produced for ECGs.  Subject listings will be produced for these safety endpoints accordingly.
The safety analyses will be carried out in the safety population, detailed analyses will be 
described in the SAP.  
 There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons or 
stratification factor in the analyses unless specified.
 
 
Nominal p-values (Tier 1 events only) and 95% confidence intervals (Tier 1 and Tier 2 
events) will be provided for between treatment differences in the percentage of subjects with events.  Reporting p-values and confidence intervals will follow Pfizer standard practice in the 3-tier approach.CCI

9.4.1. Exploratory Efficacy Analysis During the Single-Blind Extension Period
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the exploratory efficacy analysis. Binary endpoints 
will be summarized with frequency and percentage by time point, and the continuous variables will be summarized with n, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.  These summaries may be provided by the strata of responding status at entry to the Single-Blind Extension Period.
The efficacy will be compared between subjects who enter the Single-Blind Extension Period 
non-responder segment to receive active treatment directly and the subjects who are retreated with active treatment in the Single-Blind Extension Period Withawal/Retreatment segment. Additionally, for subjects who enter the Single-Blind Extension Period non-responder segment to receive active treatment directly and are initially treated with placebo in the Double-Blind Treatment Period, the active treatment will be compared with placebo in the Double-Blind Treatment Period to examine the efficacy. For continuous endpoints (such as SALT,  the change from baseline scores will be analyzed using an Mixed effect Model Repeat Measurement (MMRM) model as described for the Treatment Period primary efficacy analysis. The binary endpoints such as SALT30, SALT50, SALT75, SALT100,  
respectively will be analyzed by generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) on 
observed data, and Chan and Zhang’s exact method applied to non-responder imputation (NRI) data. 
 Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to 
randomization (Day 1 of the 24 week Double-Blind Treatment Period) when deriving the continuous and binary endpoints.
In addition, for subjects on placebo in the Single-Blind Extension Period, to estimate the 
maintenance of the efficacy effect, Kaplan-Meier method will be used to analyze the time to event (re-treatment) endpoint; and the change in SALT from Week 24 will be analyzed by MMRM model to explore the magnitude of efficacy over time after stopping active treatment.
All subjects who have received at least one dose of planned investigational product in the 
Single-Blind Extension Period will be included into the efficacy analyses. Detailed 
methodologies of these analyses will be described in the SAP.

Page 1669.5. Interim Analysis During the Treatment Period 
The statistical anal ysis plan and the interim analy sis plan for this protocol may include an
interim analy sis using SAL T total for both active treatments .  Details regarding the anal ysis 
procedures to be used for the interim anal ysis will be provided in the interim analy sis plan 
(IAP).   The interim anal ysis may be performed when approximatel y 50% of subjects have 
completed or had the chance to complete the Week 12visit. Additional interim analysesmay 
be performed based on emerging data. 
Theobjective of this interim analy sis is to determine if there is evidence of lack of
differentiation (“futility ”) for the active treatments compared to placebo.   Theinterim 
analysis is based on predict ed power conducted on a total of approximatel y 45subjects who 
complete or had the chance to complete Week 12.  A non -informative prior will be used for 
the interim anal ysis.  The decision at the end of the study  is being at least 90% confident that 
active treatment will be superior to placebo (DC1).
The study  will be stopped for futility for that active treatment arm if predictive p ower of 
meeting DC1 at the end of study  is <10% for that active arm . Due to the nature of the 
analyses the overall Ty pe 1 error for the study  is maintained.  If the futility  condition is met 
for both active arms, the study  will be stopped at the interim point.
The interim anal ysis results will be used to facilitate internal decision- making.   The results
will only  be distributed 
to a select list of individuals involved in the internal decision -making
process in order to protect the integrity  of the study .  This list of individuals will be provided
in the interim analy sis plan.   The results of the interim anal ysis will not enable i ndividuals
directly
 involved in running the study  (such as investigators) to identify  treatment
assignments for individual subjects still in the study .  There are no prospective plans to stop
the study  early for success as a result of the interim analyses.
During the interim anal ysis, some members of the study  team may  be unblinded and replaced 
with blinded colleagues.   The subjects, investigators, and individuals from the sponsor (or 
designee) who interact with the investigators and monitor safety will con tinue to be blinded 
to individual study  treatments throughout the follow up period of the study .
9.6.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will use an internal review committee (IRC) . 
The I RC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subject s in the study  
according to the charter.  The I RC will review accumulating renal safet y data and may
propose changes to the protocol as needed to ensure subject safety .  The IRC may also 
review results of an y interim analy ses as described in 
Section 9.5.  The recommendations 
made b y the IRC to alter the conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfizer management 
for final decision.  Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may  include summarie s of 
aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safety data that are not endpoints, to regulatory  
authorities, as appropriate. 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841

Page 167This study  will utilize an independent separate Internal Review Committee to review the 
results of the interim analy sis.Deta ils of the logistics and operational aspects of the IA may
be documented in an IA charter.
The committee will have completed its work and been dissolved once the database lock and 
data release occurs for the initial 24-week Treatment Period and study  team becomes 
unblinded. Unblinded study  team will continue monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the 
study .
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study  conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regula tory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, the investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC, and /or to quality  assurance audits performed by  Pfizer, or companies 
working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate regulatory  
authorities.
The investigator(s) will notify  Pfizer or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection
notification in relation to the study .  Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. 
The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and the subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provide copies of the 
inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory  
authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity  to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/ Data Collection Tools /Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CR Fs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.  The investigator shall ensure that the 

PF-06651600; PF -06700841
B7931005
Final Protocol Amendment 4, 06 June 2018
Page 168CRFs are securel y stored at the study  site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will 
be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access b y unauthorized third 
parties.
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the c ollection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs are true.  An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents mu st be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
In most cases the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician's chart.  I n these cases, 
data collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some case s, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, a document 
should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that 
will be recorded on the CRF ,and for which the CRF will stand as the source doc ument.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs a nd hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minut es, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.  The 
investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are 
retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after com pletion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. 
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, fr om the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accor dance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), IC H Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will comply  with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protec tion of subject personal data.  Such 
measures will include omitting subject names or other directl y identifiable data in an y 
reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required b y applicable laws. 
The personal data will be stored at the stu dy site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form 
and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only  authorized 
study  staff have access.  The study  site will implement appropriate technical and 
organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of 
disaster.  In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study  site shall be responsible 
for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing 
breach notifi cations as required by  law.
To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of 
personal data, when study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized 
parties, subject names will be removed and will be re placed by  a single, specific, numerical 
code, based on a numbering sy stem defined by  Pfizer.  All other identifiable data transferred 
to Pfizer or other authorized parties will be identified by  this single, subject- specific code.  
The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the 
study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data 
transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of subjects’ 
personal data consistent with the Clinical Study Agreement and applicable privacy  laws.

processing of his or her personal data.
The investigat or, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before an y study -specific activity is performed .  The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document.
12.4. Reporting of Safet y Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory  authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately
. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State 
End of trial in a Member State of the European U nion (EU) is defined as the time at which it 
is deemed that a sufficient number of subjects have been recruited and completed the study  
as stated in the regulatory  application (ie, clinical trial application [CTA]) and ethics 
application in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated 
number in the CTA) b y a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is 
considered a normal conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in All Other Participating Count ries 
End of trial in all other participating countries is defined as last subject last visit (L SLV).

that could be used to identify  individual patients has been removed) on www.pfizer.com for 
Pfizer -sponsored interventional studies at the same time the US Basic Results document is 
posted to www.clinicaltrials.gov.
15.2. Publications by Investigators
Pfizer supports the exercis e of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by  the 
principal investigator (PI) of the results of the study  based on information collected or 
generated b y the PI , whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer product.  However, 
to ens ure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected 
inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity  to review any  proposed 
publication or other t ype of disclosure of the results of the study (collectively, “ publica tion”) 
before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed.
The investigator will provide any  publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before 
it is submitted 
for publication or otherwise disclosed.  If any patent action is required to protect intellectual 
propert yrights, the investigator agrees to delay  the disclosure for a period not to exceed an 
additional 60 days.
The investigator will, on request, remove an y previously  undisclosed confidential 
information before disclosure, except for an y study -or Pfizer product -related information 
necessary  to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study  results.
If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the investigator agrees that the first publication is 
to be a joint publication covering all investigator sites, and that an y subsequent publications 
by the PI will reference that primary  publication.  However, if a joint manuscript has not 
been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study  at 
all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separatel y, subject to the other 
requirements of this section.
For all publications relating to the study , the institution will comply  with recognized ethical 
standards concerning publications and authorship, inc luding Section II -“Ethical 
Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, 
established by  the International Committee of Me dical Journal Editors.
Publication of study  results is also provided for in the CSA between Pfizer and the 
institution.  I n this section entitled Publications by  Investigators, the defined terms shall have 
the meanings given to th em in the CSA.
If there is an y conflict between the CSA and an y attachments to it, the terms of the CSA 
control.  If there is an y conflict between this protocol and the CSA, this protocol will control 
as to any  issue regarding treatment of study  subjects, and the CSA will control as to all other 
issues.

* All prohibited drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors requir e at least a 7 day or 5 half-lives (whichever is 
longer) prior to the first dose of study drug.  Note: Amiodarone requires discontinuation at least 290 days 
(~5half-lives, half -life averages ~58 days) prior to the first dose of study drug.
** All prohibi ted drugs that are CYP3A inducers require at least a 28 day or 5 half-lives (whichever is 
longer) prior to the first dose of study drug.
# Noted as potent inhibitors or inducers. 
It is recommended that subjects avoid consumption of grapefruit juice exceeding 8 ounces (~240 ml) total in a 
day while in the study.
In a situation where appropriate m edical care of a subject requires the use of a prohibited CYP3A 
inhibitor or inducer:
Moderate to potent inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A are not permitted in the study EXCEPT in emergency 
situations requiring no more than one day of administration.  Note: Amiodarone and mitotane are not 
permitted for any duration due to their long half -lives.   Topical (including skin or mucous membranes) 
application of antimicrobi al and antifungal medications is permitted.

These guidelines for subject safety  monitoring and discontinuation are to be applied to all 
subjects in study  B7931005.  Additional individual subject monitoring is at the discretion of 
theinvestigator and dependent on any  perceived safet
y concerns.  Unscheduled clinical labs 
may be obtained at any  time during the study  to assess such concerns, and a subject may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator.
Appendix 6.1.Monitoring
Allpotential treatment -related reports of rash will be followed up until resolution or 
agreement with Pfizer. 
The following laboratory abnormalities require re -testing within 1 week until resolution 
or agreement with Pfizer:
Absolute neutrophil count <2000/m m3(2.0 x109/L);
Hemoglobin <9.0 g/dL ;
Platelet count below <100,000/mm3(
100 x109/L);
Lym phocy tes<600/mm3; <0.6x109/L.
CK >3xULN (this also triggers urine m yoglobin) .
Appendix 6.2.Discontinuation
Treatment will be discontinued and the subject withdrawn from this stud y for:
Adverse Events:
Serious infections, defined as an y infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring 
parenteral antimicrobial therap y or hospitalization;
Clinically  meaningful, treatment related decline in hearing from baseline.
Other serious or se vere AEs, at the discr etion of the investigator or sponsor.
Potential Cases of Potential Drug -Related Rash:
Serious or severe drug -
related rash at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor 
(Appendix 4).

then the subject should not be further dosed and adequate, immediate, suppor tive measures 
and immediate evaluation by nephrologist (preferably within 24 hours) with appropriate 
management should be taken for evaluation and treatment as clinicall y indicated.  If the 
subject cannot be seen by a nephrologist within 24 hours, then the n subject should be sent to 
a local emergency room for assessment of renal function .  Result s should be repeated as 
indicated b y the nephrologist or weekl y at a minimum until the eGFR returns to baseline 
15% or the renal parameters are deemed to be stable by the nephrologist and/or P (see

Discontinuation/End of Treat ment Monitoring:
Any subject meeting discontinuation criteria must enter into the Follow -up Period with their 
first follow- up visit occurring 1 week after their last dose whenever possible, until the event 
has returned to normal or baseline levels or is de emed clinically  stable.   The procedures 
scheduled for ET 
Visit will be performed on the last day  the subject takes the investigational 
product or as soon as possible thereafter.   The only  exception to this is when a subject 
specificall y withdraws consent f or an y further contact with him or her or persons previously 
authorized by  the subject to provide this information.   Additional follow -up visits may  occur

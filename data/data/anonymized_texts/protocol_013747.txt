Descript ions of Amendments 1 and 2 are included in Section 9.
Protocol Amendment 3 (dated 23 June 2021)
The principal reason for this amendment is to revise the prot oc
ol to be gl obally applicable, in 
line with the decisio n to expand the study  to include countri es other than Japan, where the 
study  is current ly ongoing. At the time o f the original protocol  and Amendments 1 and 2, the 
study  was pl anned to be conducted in Japan only. By  expanding the study  to addi tional 
countri es and increasing the sample size, immunocompromised children wit h different 
underlying causes from different coun tries can be included in the study , supporting the safet y 
evaluat ion in a diverse popul ation.Addit ionally the increase in sample size aligns with the 
design and number of participants pre -determined for other high risk populat ions under study  
within the program.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6of 74 Template 18.0STUDY DESIGN
Study D5290C00008 is a Phase 2, open -label, uncontrolled, single -dose study, planned to be conducted in 
South Af rica, the U nited States, and the E uropean Union, in addition to Japan, where the study in currently 
ongoing, to evaluate the safety and tolerability, PK, occurrence of ADA, and efficacy of nirsevimab in 
immunocompromised children who are ≤24 months of age at the time of dose administration. Approximat ely 
100 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be followed for approximately 1 year after dose administration.
TARGET SUBJECT POPULATION
Neonates, infants, and young children ≤24 months of age at the time of dose administration, with 
immunodeficiency.
TREATMENT GROUPS AND REGIMENS
Subjects entering their first RSV season will receive a single fixed IM dose of nirsevimab 50 mg if body 
weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if body weight ≥ 5 kg (n = ~ 50), and subjects entering their second RSV season will 
receive a s ingle fixed IM dose of nirsevimab 200 mg (n = ~ 50).
STATISTICAL METHODS 
Sample Size
A total of approximately 100 subjects are planned to receive a single IM dose of nirsevimab to evaluate the 
safety, PK, ADA, and efficacy, which will be assessed descriptively. The originally proposed sample size of 
30 was based on a similarly designed pal ivizumab study in a similar population, and it is expected to be 
sufficient in establishing a PK profile that allows extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2b 
(D5290C00003) and Phase 3 (  studies in healthy preterm and term inf ants to the target 
immunocompromised population. The updated sample size of 100 allows for the collection of data from a 
larger , global cohort of immunocompromised children with different underlying conditions .
 
 
Statistica l Analyses
There are 2 planned analyses for this study: an interim analysis and a final analysis. The interim analysis will 
be conducted when subjects enrolled globally by end of 2021 have been followed through Day 151. For the 
interim analysis, all safety, PK, ADA and efficacy data available at the time of the data cut -off for subjects 
enrolled by end of 2021 will be analyzed. A minimum of approximately of 30 subjects is expected to be 
sufficient in establishing a PK profile for efficacy and safety extrapo lation at the time of the interim analysis. 
The final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed the last visit of the study (ie, Day 361). 
Data will be summarized for the overall study population , as well as for Japan only .
Safety Analyses
Adverse events will be graded according to the current version of the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events where applicable for pediatric assessments. AEs will be coded 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Re gulatory  Activities ,and the type, incidence, severity, and 
relatio nship to investigational product will be summarized. Other safety assessments will include the 
occurrence of AESIs defined as AEs of immediate hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis), 
thrombocytopenia, and immune complex disease (eg, vasculitis, endocarditis, neuritis, glomerulonephritis) 
following investigational product administration, and the occurrence of NOCDs following investigational 
product administration.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7of 74 Template 18.0Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Serum concentrations of nirsevimab at selected time points will be evaluated to confirm that adequate 
exposures for protection from RSV LRTI are maintained for at least 5 months after dosing. Nirsevimab serum 
concentration data will be presented in descript ive statistics. 
Antidrug Antibody Analyses
The incidence of ADA to nirsevimab will be assessed and summarized by number and percentage of subjects 
who are ADA positive. The impact of ADA on PK, and the association with TEAEs and TESAEs ,will be 
assessed, if data permit.
Efficacy Analyses
The incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI (inpatient and outpatient) through 150 days post dose, based 
on RSV test results (performed centrally using RT -PCR) and objective protocol -defined LRTI criteria, will be 
summari zed for all dosed subjects. For subjects with multiple medically attended RSV LRTI events, only the 
first occurrence will be used in the analysis.
The incidence of RSV hospitalization through 150 days after dose will also be summarized. Additional 
analy seswill include summarizing RSV positive LRTI endpoints using results from either the central or local 
laborato ry.
Additional Analyses
 
Healthcare Resource Utilization
The magnitude of HRU (eg, number of admissions to hospitals and ICUs and duration of stay; number of 
subjects who require respiratory support and supplemental oxygen and the duration of use; number and types 
of outpatient visits, eg, ER, urgent care, outpatient clinic; and number of prescription sand OTC medications 
use) will be summarized.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 14of 74 Template 18.01 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Disease Background
Respiratory  syncy tial virus (RSV) is the m ost com mon cause o f lower respi ratory  tract 
infect ion (LRTI) among infants and young children, result ing in annual epidemics worldwide 
(Hall et al, 2009 ; Shay et al, 1999 ; Shi et al , 2017 ; Stockm an et al , 2012 ). All children, 
including healthy term infants, are at risk for severe RSV lower respiratory  illness wi th 
primary  RSV infect ion during infancy . Ninety  percent of children are infected with RSV in 
the first 2 y ears of life, and up to 40 % of those will have LRTI (Greenough et al, 2001 ; 
Meissner, 2003; Parrott et al, 1973 ). RSV LRTI, characterized predominant ly as b ronchi olitis 
or pneumonia, represents a serious illness with acute and perhaps long -term consequences to 
the developing lungs in these y oung children (Blanken et al , 2013 ). It is estimated that RSV 
causes up to 90% of childhood bronchio litis and up to 40% of pediatric pneumo nias (Hall, 
2001) . In 2015, an estimated 33.1 millio n (uncertaint y range, 21.6 to 50.3 millio n) new 
episodes of RSV- associ ated LRTI occurred worldwide in children < 5 y ears of age (28% of 
LRTI epi sodes), wi th approximately 3.2 millio n (range, 2.7 to 3.8 millio n) episodes 
necessitat ing hospi talizat ions, leading to 59,600 (range, 48,000 to 74,500) in -hospi tal deaths 
(Shi et al, 2017) . Children < 1 y ear of age had an estimated 2.3 millio n hospital admissio ns. 
The overall mortalit y due to RSV LRTI was estimated to be as high as 118,200 (uncertaint y 
range, 94,600 to 149,400) (Shi et al, 2017) .
Children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, transplant recipients, and those 
receiving immunosuppressive therapy are at increased risk for severe RSV -associ ated LRTI 
with prolonged vi ral shedding and higher viral loads (Resch et al, 2009 ), resul ting in 
prolonged hospitalizat ions (11.5 to 24 days), admissio ns to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 
the need for mechanical ventilat ion (Asner et al , 2013 ; Manzoni et al, 2017 ; Moyes et al , 
2013) . Am ong immunocom promised children hospitalized with RSV, ICU admissio n rates of 
19% or higher have been reported (Asner et al, 2013 ; Rowan et al, 2018
). In addit ion, 
RSV- associ ated m ortalit y rates can reach 60% in untreated children wit h immunodeficiencies , 
compared to a m ortalit y rate of  less than 0.5% in healthy infants with RSV (Asner et al , 2013 ).
Prevent ion of RSV illness in all infants is a major public healt h priority. However, despite 
many years of attempted vaccine development (Kim H. W. et al , 1969 ), there is no licensed 
vaccine for these children. Current ly, the primary management of RSV -associ ated LRTI 
includes supportive c are such as supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilat ion. Other 
therapi es such as ribavirin and immunoglobulins may be used to treat RSV infect ion in 
immunocom promised patients, but their effect iveness remains unclear (Asner et al, 2013 ; Kim 
E. et al, 2014 ; Rowan et al, 2018) . 
Palivizumab (Synagis®) is the only approved agent for RSV prophylaxis, and its use is limited 
internati onally  to hi gh-risk children: preterm infants ≤ 35 weeks gestational age (GA),

dysplasia), and children wit h hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (CHD). In 
Japan, palivizumab received approval in 2013 for an addit ional indicat ion in children 
≤ 24 months of age with immunocompro mised medical condit ions or Down syndrome. 
Approval o f this new indicat ion was based on an open -label study  that eval uated the efficacy, 
pharmacokinet ics (PK), and safet y of palivizumab in 28 immunocom promised Japanese 
children. In that study , the serum trough concentratio ns were co mparable with 
Western -approved, indicated pediatric populat ions and Japanese -approved, indicated pediatric 
popul ations (preterm infants and children wit h bronchopulmo nary dysplasia or 
hemodynamically significant CHD) (Mori etal, 2014 ). A larger postmarketing surveillance 
study  with 312 Japanese children ≤ 24 months of age with immunocompromised medical 
condi tions or Down syndrom e dem onstrated that palivizumab is generally safe and effect ive 
in this populat ion (Kashiwagi et al, 2018) . However, because its half -life (t 1/2) is 
approxi mately 1 mo nth, infants and young children need to receive monthly intramuscular 
(IM) doses of palivizumab throughout the RSV season to maintain protection. This const itutes 
a significant burden on healt hcare providers as well as the infants/children and t heir families.
1.2 Nirsevimab Background
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) is briefly described belo w. Refer to the current Invest igator’s 
Brochure for details. 
Nirsevimab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 kappa monoclonal ant ibody  
(mAb) di rected against the prefusio n conform ation of the RSV F protein. The ant ibody  has 
been engineered wit h a triple amino acid subst itution (YTE; M257Y/S259T/T261E 
[M252Y/S254T/T256E, according to the European Union { EU numbering system }) in the 
fragment cry stallizable (Fc) region to prolong the t 1/2, whi ch is expected to provide protection 
from serious RSV disease for the duration of the RSV season. Nirsevimab neutralize s RSV by 
binding the prefusion conformation o f the RSV F protein at a site distinct from that bound by  
palivizumab. In nonclinical studies, nirsevimab was > 150-fold more poten t than palivizumab 
in 
vitro and approximately  9-fold more potent than palivizuma b in vivo in the cotton rat model 
(Zhu et al, 2017) . Nirsevimab is current ly under development by AstraZeneca (hereafter, the 
Sponsor) for the passive immunizat ion of all infants entering their first RSV season and
children with CLD or CHD entering their first and second RSV season for the prevent ion of 
LRTI caused by RSV. Nirsevimab may  provide a cost -effect ive opportunit y to protect all 
infants fro m RSV di sease based on an improvement in potency  and the extended t 1/2that is 
expected to support once -per-RSV- season dosing.
1.3 Summary of Nonclinical Experience
The potential clinical ut ility of nirsevimab and dose predictions of the ant ibody  were 
evaluated in the cotton rat model of RSV infect ion. The PK of 1G7, the non -YTE versi on of  
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 16of 74 Template 18.0nirsevimab, was evaluated in cotton rats following a single IM dose of 0.25 to 3.0 mg/kg. 
Serum  concentrati ons increased dose proportionally  across the enti re dose range wi th a 
terminal -phase eliminat ion t1/2of approximately  1 day . In cotto n rats, a serum concentration o f 
6.8 μg/m L resulted in a 3- log reduction in lung RSV titers and for Phase 2b was ident ified as 
the target serum concentration to maintain in children to provide ant iviral activity against RSV 
over the RSV season.
The YTE ami no acid subst itutions introduced into nirsevimab do not impact RSV neutralizing 
activit y when com pared to the parental  mAb, 1G7. Nirsevimab/1G7 showed potent antiviral 
activit y in vitro against RSV A and B laboratory  strains, clinical isolates, as well as 
palivizumab -resistant viruses. Nirsevimab/1G7 was > 150-fold more poten t than 
palivizumab in 
vitro against the laboratory  strains and > 50-fold more potent than 
palivizumab against clinical iso lates based on the median half -maximal inhibitory  
concentration (Zhu et al , 2017 ).
Toxicit y, toxicokinet ics, and immunogenicit y of nirsevimab were evaluated in a Good 
Laboratory  Practi ce-compliant repeat -dose intravenous (IV) and IM toxico logy study  
conducted in cyno molgus monk eys. Cyno molgus mo nkeys represent a pharmaco logically 
relevant m odel for nonclinical  safety  assessment based on similar binding of nirsevimab to 
cyno molgus monkey neonatal  Fc receptor (FcRn) compared to human FcRn. Toxico logy 
studi es in cyno molgus mo nkeys indicate that there is no evidence of nirsevimab toxicit y in 
these animal models. Once weekly IV or IM administration (5 doses total) of nirsevimab to 
monkeys, up to and including 300 mg/kg IV or 300 mg IM dose levels, was not associated 
with any treatm ent-related adverse effects locally or sy stemically. The no -observed -adverse -
effect -level was considered to be 300 mg/kg IV and 300 mg IM. No antidrug ant ibody  (ADA) 
was detected in any  of the m onkeys during the treatment phase. During the recovery  phase, 
4
of 12 animals treated with nirsevimab and 0 of 6 control animals were ADA posit ive with 
variable impact on toxicokinetics. In addit ion, tissue cross -reactivit y against cry osect ions of a 
full panel of adult and a selected panel o f juvenile, neonatal, and fet al human t issues showed 
no staining of any  tissues, as expected, given the target for nirsevimab is a non- endogenous 
viral-specific target. Overall, data fro m nonclinical studies do not reveal any  
nirsevimab -related safet y concerns.
Details o f these studi es are included in the current Invest igator’s Brochure.
1.4 Summary of Clinical Experience
Nirsevimab has been invest igated in 3 completed clinical studies (see the current 
Invest igator’s Brochure for addit ional detail on nirsevimab clinical development).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 17of 74 Template 18.01.4.1 Phase 1a Study D5290C00001
Study  D5290C00001 was a first- time- in-human Phase 1a, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -
controlled, dose -escalat ion study  conducted to evaluate the safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and ADA 
of nirsevimab co mpared to placebo in healt hy adult v olunteers (Griffin et al, 2017) . This study  
was completed in June 2015. A total of 136 subjects were randomized and received a single 
fixed dose of nirsevimab (6 subjects eac h at doses of 300 mg IV, 1,000 mg IV, 3,000 mg IV, 
100 m g IM, and 78 subjects at 300 mg IM) or placebo (34 subjects). All subjects were 
followed for approximately  360 days after dosing.
Safety
The safet y profile of nirsevimab was favorable, with similar pr oporti ons of 
treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported in the placebo (61.8%) group and the 
nirsevimab (62.7%) total group. Two treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs; 
gunshot wound and appendicit is) were reported in 2 nirsevimab subjec ts. TEAEs j udged to be 
related to invest igational product were reported in 29.4% of subjects in the placebo group, and 
17.6% of subjects in the nirsevimab total group. The most frequent TEAEs in the nirsevimab 
total group incl uded upper respi ratory  tract i nfection (URTI; 18.6%); headache (8.8%); 
urinary  tract infect ion (5.9%); and dermat itis contact, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, and 
vomiting (4.9% each). The most frequent ly occurring TEAEs in the placebo group were 
headache (17.6%); URTI (8.8%); and nausea , increased bl ood creatine phosphokinase level, 
and paresthesia (5.9% each). There were no adverse events of special interest (AESIs) or new 
onset chronic diseases (NOCDs). There were no deaths. No safet y signals in this healt hy adult 
popul ation were obser ved. These results demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile for 
nirsevimab, including no observed hypersensit ivity reacti ons, and supported further clinical 
studi es of  IM administrati on of  1 dose of nirsevimab in the target populat ion of infants to 
provi de protecti on for the durati on of  the RSV season.
Pharmacokinetics
A 2-compartm ent PK m odel adequately  described the PK profile following both IV and IM 
administrations. Body  weight was determined to be a significant covariate on sy stemic 
clearance and vol ume of distribut ion with allometric exponents. The mean populat ion 
clearance and vol ume of distribut ion were 42.3 mL/day  and 2.8 L, respectively . The m ean t 1/2
of nirsevimab ranged from 85 to 117 day s across dose groups, and bioavailabilit y after IM 
adminis tration was 77%. The predicted 3
-to 4-fold increase in the t 1/2of nirsevimab com pared 
to a standard IgG antibody  was confi rmed.
Antidrug Antibody
Post-baseline ADA was detected in 13.7% of subjects in the nirsevimab total group and 
15.2% of subjects in the placebo group, wi th a maximum  titer of  1:800 and 1:400, 
respectively . On Day  361, ADA was detected in 5.3% of nirsevimab subjects and 10.7% of 
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 18of 74 Template 18.0placebo subjects. The highest titer at Day  361 was 1:200 for both the nirsevimab and placebo 
groups. The pres ence and titer of ADA had no effect on the PK or safet y profiles.
1.4.2 Phase 1b/2a Study D5290C00002
Study  D5290C00002 was a Phase 1b/2a, rando mized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, single 
ascending -dose study  to eval uate the safet y, PK, and ADA of nirsevimab in healthy preterm  
infants (Domachowske et al , 2018 ). The populat ion enrolled was healt hy preterm infants born 
between 32 weeks 0 day s and 34 weeks 6 day s gestation who woul d not receive RSV 
prophylaxis based on the American Academy of Pediatrics or other national or local 
guidelines. These subjec ts woul d not be receiving palivizumab, allowing for a placebo 
comparator group. A total of 89 infants from  sites in the Uni ted States (US), Chile, and South 
Africa were randomized and received a single IM dose of nirsevimab (10, 25, or 50 mg; 8, 31, 
and 32 subjects, respectively ) or pl acebo (18 subjects) and were followed for approximately  
360days after dosing. 
Safety
A total o f 66 subjects (93.0%) in the nirsevimab group and 17 subjects (94.4%) in the placebo 
group reported at least 1 TEAE. No safet y signals were observed with ascending dose levels. 
The m ajority of the events were mild or moderate in severity; only 2 TEAEs were assessed as 
≥ Grade 3 severit y, and neit her was considered to be related to invest igational product by  the 
Invest igator. There we re no deaths, AESIs, or NOCDs in any  dose group. 
Three nirsevimab subjects (4.2%) had a total o f 5 TESAEs, none of which were considered 
related to invest igational product by  the Invest igator; no subjects in the placebo group had a 
TESAE. One infant who r eceived 25 mg of nirsevimab was hospitalized for LRTI. Real -time 
reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain react ion (RT -PCR) testing fro m the central  laboratory  
was negative for RSV (but posit ive for hum an metapneumo virus [hMPV]); the illness 
resolved. The sa me infant was again hospitalized for LRTI, and subsequent RT- PCR testing 
was posi tive for RSV B; the event resolved. One infant who received 50 mg of nirsevimab 
was hospitalized for febrile convulsio n; the infant recovered. A second infant who received 
50mg o f nirsevimab was hospitalized for febrile convulsio n and a concurrent LRTI. Testing 
for RSV was not performed, and the infant recovered from both events.
The m ost frequently reported TEAEs for the nirsevimab group were URTI (69.0%), 
gastroenterit is (29 .6%), cough (25.4%), py rexia (22.5%), and otit is media (21.1%). There 
were no trends by  dose of ni rsevimab for these events. The most frequent ly reported TEAEs 
in the placebo group were URTI (66.7%), anemia (33.3%), and gastroenteritis, cough, and 
otitis media (22.2% each). Skin rashes (defined as adverse events [AEs] that coded to the 
Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activities [MedDRA] preferred terms o f derm atitis, 
derm atitis allergic, dermat itis atopic, dermat itis contact, dermat itis diaper, dry skin, eczema,

subjects in the nirsevimab group. No skin events were consistent with hypersensit ivity. 
Pharmacokinetics
Nirsevimab exhibited a less -than-dose-proporti onal exposure increase between the 10 -and 
25-mg doses; however, exposure increase was dose proportional between 25 -and 50 -mg 
doses. Following a single IM dose of 10, 25, or 50 mg, the estimated t 1/2of nirsevimab ranged 
from 62.5 to 72.9 days. On Day  151, 87% of the nirsevimab serum concentrations fo llowing 
the 50-mg IM dose were above the 90% effect
ive concentration threshold o f 6.8 μg/m L.
Antidrug Antibody
ADA was not detected in any subject at Day  151. Post -baseline ADA was detected at Day 361 
only in 18/68 (26.5%) subjects, and there were 2 subjects with transient ADA -positive titers at 
Day 50 only who were ADA negat ive at Day 361. Overall, post -baseline ADA was detected in 
20/71 subjects (28.2%) in the nirsevimab group and 0/17 subjects (0%) in the plac ebo group. 
None of the post- baseline nirsevimab ADA -positive subjects were ADA posit ive at baseline; 
only one subject (in the pl acebo group) was ADA positive at baseline. The highest titer 
detected was 1:25,600 (observed in 2 subjects [2.8%]). The 20 subje cts in the nirsevimab 
group who had ADA detected were posit ive for the presence of ADA targeting the YTE 
subst itution and 4 of the 20 subjects with samples available had neutralizing ADA.
There was no impact of the presence of ADA on safet y. ADAs di d not appear to impact PK 
for 150 days after dosing. Serum ant i-RSV neutralizing ant ibody  titers increased 
dose-dependent ly following administration of nirsevimab and were higher than placebo by 
Day 8 and through Day  151. Serum nirsevimab concentrations were cor related with serum 
anti-RSV neutralizing ant ibody  across all the dose levels, confirming ant i-RSV act ivity of 
nirsevimab.
1.4.3 Phase 2b Study D5290C00003
Study D5290C00003 was a Phase 2b glo bal, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, 
single- dose study  toevaluate the efficacy, safet y, PK, and ADA of nirsevimab in healt hy 
preterm  infants, born between 29 weeks 0 day s and 34 weeks 6 days GA, entering their first 
RSV season. Subjects were not eligible for RSV prophylaxis wit h palivizumab based on the 
Joint C ommittee on Vaccination and Immunisation, American Academy of Pediatrics, or other 
local or nati onal guidelines, all owing f or a pl acebo com parator group. Overall, 1,453 subjects 
were randomized 2:1 to receive a single dose of 50 mg IM nirsevimab or placebo . A total of 
1,447 subjects were dosed, including 968 subjects in the nirsevimab group and 479 subjects in 
theplacebo group. Subjects were fo llowed for approximately  360 days after dosing. 
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 20of 74 Template 18.0Efficacy
Based on the analysis in the Intent -to-treat Populatio n,a single dose of 50 mg IM nirsevimab 
resul ted in a 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3%, 81.2%; p < 0.0001) relat ive risk 
reducti on (RRR) in the incidence of medically attended RSV- confirmed LRTI through 
Day 151 when com pared to pl acebo. Addi tionall y, a 78.4% (95% CI: 51.9%, 90.3%; 
p = 0.0002) RRR in the incidence of RSV LRTI hospitalization through Day 151 was seen in 
the nirsevimab recipients when co mpared to placebo. 
Safety
The safet y profile of nirsevimab was similar to that of placebo, with no new identified risks. 
Overall, 86.2% of subjects in the nirsevimab group and 86.8% of subjects in the placebo 
group had at least 1 TEAE. TEAEs ≤1 day  post dose occurred in 2.5% of subjects in both 
groups. In comparison to the placebo group, the nirsevimab group had a numerically  lower 
incidence of TEAEs occurring ≤ 7 days post dose (nirsevimab 12.5%, placebo 15.2%), 
TEAEs ≥Grade 3 in severit y (nirsevimab 8.0%, placebo 12.5%), or TESAEs (nirsevimab 
11.2%, placebo 16.9%). The majorit y of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severit y. The 
most comm on TESAEs, based on the nirsevimab group, were bronchio litis (2.1% nirsevimab, 
4.4% pl acebo), LRTI (1.4% nirsevimab, 2.7% placebo), bronchit is (1.4% nirsevimab, 
2.3% placebo), and pneumonia (1.3% nirsevimab, 2.1% placebo). None of the TESAEs were 
considered related to invest igational product by  the Invest igator. Five deaths were reported 
during the study  through Day  361, including 2 subjects (0.2%) in the nirsevimab group and 
3subjects (0.6%) in the placebo group. Non e of the deaths were considered to be related to 
investigat ional product according to the Invest igator.
Overall, the incidence of treatment -related TEAEs (nirsevimab 2.3%, placebo 2.1%); AESIs, 
including hypersensit ivity, immune com plex disease, and thromb ocytopeni a (nirsevimab 
0.5%, pl acebo 0.6%); and NOCDs (nirsevimab 0.4%, placebo 0.8%) was low and generally 
comparable between the placebo and nirsevimab groups. AESIs were reported in 5 subjects 
(4subjects with rash or rash macular and 1 subject with petechiae) in the nirsevimab group 
and 3 subjects (rash or rash papular) in the placebo group. All events were Grade 1 in severit y. 
The TEAE of petechiae that was reported as an AESI was 1 day  in duration and was reported 
by the Si te Investi gator based on des cription by the parent. There were no laboratory 
assessments for the petechiae.
TEAEs that invo lved the skin and subcutaneous tissues (including diaper rash) were collected 
as skin react ions, with a few except ions for skin reactions that could be definit ively diagnosed 
such as impet igo, varicella, and scabies. Skin reactio ns were reported in a similar percentage 
of subjects in both treatment groups (nirsevimab 32.9%, placebo 30.9%).

Following a single fixed 50 -mg IM dose of nirsevimab, 97.8% of m easurable Day 151 serum 
concentrations were above the nonclinical 90% effective concentration target of 6.8 μg/mL. 
The m ean (% coefficient of variat ion) area under the concentration- time curve from t ime 0 to 
infinit y (AUC 0-∞) and est imated appare nt t1/2were 5,176.3 (35.0) day⋅μg/mL and 
59.3 (9.6) days, respectively. 
Antidrug Antibody
Overall, the rate and titers of ADA were low, and in post- baseline ADA -positive subjects 
there was no apparent effect on PK or safety . Of the subjects who had serum samples 
available for testing, ADA was detected post baseline in 5.6% (52/929) of subjects in the 
nirsevimab group and 3.8% (18/469) of subjects in the placebo group. ADA titers ranged fro m 
1:50 to 1:6,400 in the nirsevimab group and from 1:50 to 1:400 in the placebo group. Of the 
nirsevimab subjects who were post- baseline ADA posit ive, ADA targeting the YTE domain 
was observed in 4/17 subjects (23.5%) on Day  151 and 23/30 subjects (76.7%) on Day  361. 
Three nirsevimab subjects had NAb on Day  361.
1.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
Prevent ion of RSV illnesses in all infants is a majo r public healt h priority; however, despite 
more than 50 y ears of attem pted vaccine development, there are no licensed vaccines. While 
RSV prevent ion exists in the form of a speci fic RSV IgG (palivizumab) requiring 5 once -
monthly inject ions, it is licensed only  for infants who experience the greatest morbidit y and 
mortalit y from RSV: preterm  infants born ≤ 35 weeks GA, children wit h CLD of prematurit y, 
children with hemodynamically significant CHD and ,in Japan, children ≤ 24 months of age 
with immunocom promised condit ions and Down syndro me. Nirsevimab is being developed as 
a cost -effect ive opportunity to protect all infants from RSV disease based on improved 
potency  and an extended t1/2, whi ch is expected to support once -per-RSV- season dosing.
The nirsevimab clinical development program includes 2 pivotal studies for infants entering 
their first RSV season: the completed Phase 2b study  (D5290C00003) and an ongoing Phase 3 
study  (D52 90C00004) in healt hy late term and term infants. Because of the significant 
advantage of one dose per RSV- season that nirsevimab would provide, the Sponsor recognizes 
the potenti ally important benefits for the pediatric populat ion receiving palivizumab who must 
receive mo nthly inject ions during the RSV -season for protection. A Phase 2/3 study  
(D5290C0005) is currently being conducted in the high -risk palivizumab -eligible popul ation 
entering their first and second RSV seasons. In addit ion, this Phase 2 study is planned to 
support an indicat ion for a single dose of nirsevimab at the start of the RSV season in 
immunocom promised children who are ≤ 24 months o f age. 
Primarily , the PK data in this study  will be used to assess whether nirsevimab systemic 
exposure is altered in this populat ion as co mpared to healt hy infants. The effects of immune 
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22of 74 Template 18.0status on exposure will be evaluated using population PK methods. Assuming similar 
exposure -response relat ionship, exposure matching principles will be used to support 
extrapolation of the observed clinical efficacy o f nirsevimab fro m the Phase 2b, and Phase 3 
studi es in heathy infants. 
1.6 Benefit -Risk and Ethical Assessment
The study  will be perform ed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declara tion of  Helsinki and are consistent with Internat ional Council for Harmonisat ion 
(ICH)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
To evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for nirsevimab, nonclinical and clinical data have 
been taken into consideration. Based on the risk of serious RSV disease in infants and 
high-risk children, there is an established unmet medical need for the use of nirsevimab for 
prophylaxis in all infants entering their first RSV season and in high -risk pr eterm  infants and 
children ≤ 24 m onths of age with CLD or CHD. Addit ionally , in Japan, palivizumab is 
approved for use in immunoco mpromised children ≤ 24 months of age. Children in this study  
(ie, ≤ 24 months o f age wi th an immunocom promised m edical condit ion) who receive 
nirsevimab may  potenti ally benefit by  being protected against serious RSV disease. 
Nirsevimab is expected to provide similar efficacy  benefi ts as palivizumab wi th the advantage 
of requi ring a single IM dose instead of the 5 IM doses requir ed for palivizumab.
Nirsevimab has no endogenous targets, and no safety  concerns were ident ified in nonclinical 
studi es. The potenti al risks are based primarily on safet y risks that m ay be observed with any 
immunogl obulin, including mAbs such as palivizuma b. These potential risks include, but are 
not limited to, hy persensi tivity (including anaphylaxis), immune complex disease, 
thrombocy topenia, and injection site react ions. To date, there have been no observed events of 
anaphylaxis, significant hy persensi tivity react ions, immune co mplex disease, or 
thrombocy topenia attributable to nirsevimab in the clinical studies. Nonetheless, subjects in 
nirsevimab clinical studies will cont inue to be monitored for important potential risks, and 
routi ne pharmacovigilance and risk minimizat ion activit ies will be performed accordingly.
The benefit -risk assessment for nirsevimab in prevent ion of RSV disease based on the 
development through Phase 2b is favorable.

Study  D5290C00008 is a Phase 2, open -label, uncontrolled single -dose study  to assess the 
safet y and tolerabilit y, PK, occurrence of ADA, and efficacy of nirsevimab in 
immunocom promised children who are ≤ 24 months o f age at the time of dose administration. 
The study  is plan ned to be conducted in South Africa, the US, and the EU, in addit ion to 
Japan, where the study  is current ly ongo ing. Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled. 
Approximately  50 subjects entering their first RSV season will receive nirsevimab as a single,
fixed IM dose of 50 mg if body  weight < 5 kg or 100 mg if body  weight ≥ 5 kg. 
Approximately  50 subjects entering their second RSV season will receive nirsevimab as a 
single, fixed IM dose of 200 mg. Subjects will be followed approximately 1 year after dos e 
administration. 
Subjects will be mo nitored throughout the study  for LRTI. All subjects seeking medical 
attenti on for a respi ratory  illness (inpat ient or outpatient setting) will be evaluated for the 
occurrence of LRTI. All subjects found to have a LRTI and all subjects who require 
hospi talizati on for a respi ratory  infect ion, even if there is not a diagnosis of LRTI, should have 
respi ratory  samples obtained and respiratory  assessment form s completed. Samples should be 
collected for all o f these respirator y events ,even those not meet ing the protocol -defined 
endpo int of LRTI. Subjects who have a primary hospitalization for a respiratory  infect ion (ie, 
upper or lower respiratory  tract), a respi ratory  deteri oration during a hospitalizat ion, or who 
seek outpat ient medical attention (including emergency room [ER] visits) for a lower 
respi ratory  illness, will be assessed clinically  for the presence of LRTI and for RSV by  central  
laboratory  diagnosti c testing of respiratory  secreti ons.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 74 Template 18.0In addit ion to the clinical assessment of LRTI, there is a protocol definit ion using object ive 
criteria for the determinat ion of a protocol -defined medically attended LRTI. To meet the 
protocol -defined endpo int of medically attended LRTI, subjects with signs of LRTI must have 
docum ented at l east one physical examinat ion finding of rhonchi, rales, crackles, or wheeze 
AND at least 1 of the fo llowing clinical signs:
Increased respiratory  rate at rest (age < 2 months, ≥ 60 breaths/min; age 2 to 6 months, 
≥50 breaths/min; age > 6months, ≥ 40 breaths/min), OR
Hypoxemia (in room air: oxy gen saturati on < 95% at al titudes ≤ 1,800 m eters or < 92% at 
altitudes > 1,800 meters), OR
Clinical signs of severe respiratory  disease (eg, acute hy poxic or vent ilatory  failure, new 
onset apnea, nasal flari ng, intercostal , subcostal  or supraclavicular retractions, grunting) 
or dehy dration secondary to inadequate oral intake due to respiratory  distress (need for IV 
fluid).
Testing for RSV will be performed centrally  using the US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) -cleared and Conformité Européenne or European Conformit y-marked in vitro 
diagnosti c real -time RT -PCR assay  (Lyra RSV + hMPV Assay, Quidel, San Diego, CA; 
www.qui del.com ). A diagnosi s of RSV LRTI requires having a respi ratory  sample posi tive for 
RSV by  the central  laboratory  RT-PCR.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 27of 74 Template 18.03.2 Rationale for Dose, Population, and Endpoints
3.2.1 Dose Rationale
A single fixed 50- mg IM dose was shown to be efficacious in the Phase 2b Study  
D5290C00003 in preterm infants (29 to < 35 weeks GA) in their first RSV season. 
Model -based analyses of the Phase 2b clinical PK and efficacy  data i dentified a projected 
serum  AUC 0-∞of 13.4 day⋅mg/mL as the protecti ve exposure thresho ld. The risk of medically 
attended RSV- confirmed LRTI over the course of the RSV season was significantly lower in 
infants wi th higher proj ected AUC 0-∞. Infants wi th AUC 0-∞above 13.4 day⋅mg/mL had a 
statist ically significant higher prob abilit y of protecti on based on exposure -response analysis 
using Cox proporti onal hazard regressi on. Al though, the fixed 50- mg dose resulted in 
clinically efficacious exposures for 97% of infants weighing < 5 kg in the Phase 2b study, this 
dose was suboptim al for infants wei ghing ≥ 5 kg in this study . Overall, 3% and 59% of the 
infants in groups weighing < 5 kg and ≥ 5 kg, respectively, were in the lowest AUC 0-∞quartile 
(4.5 to 13.4 day ⋅mg/mL) that was determined to be suboptimal. Addit ionally, a cut point 
analysis of the weight -norm alized doses of all treated infants revealed that a 10 mg/kg dose 
was the corresponding clinically efficacious and protective thresho ld dose. Henceforth, based 
on these analyses, a stratified fixed dosing strategy by weight bands is proposed to ensure an 
adequate dose to maintain nirsevimab serum concentrations above the target area under the 
concentration -time curve throughout the RSV season. Based on dose optimizat ion analysis 
designed to m aximize the proportion of infants with clinically  efficaci ous ni rsevimab serum  
exposure, for infants entering their first RSV season a single fixed 50 -mg IM dose is proposed 
for infants with body  weight < 5 kg, while a single fixed 100- mg dose is proposed for infants 
weighing ≥ 5 kg. The body  weight range for the majority  of children entering their second 
RSV season is expected to be approximately 8.5 to 15 kg at the time o f dosing. Therefore, 
with the same rati onale, a single fixed 200 -mg dose of nirsevimab is proposed for subjects 
entering the ir second RSV season to achieve and maintain efficacious exposure during the 
entire second RSV season. There have been no reports that IgG1 kappa mAb compounds 
show obvious ethnic differences. 
3.2.2 Rationale for Study Population
Children with immunodeficiencie s are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, leading to 
prolonged hospitalizat ions, admissio n to the ICU, and mechanical vent ilation (Manzoni et al, 
2017; Welliver, 2003 ). Currently , there i s no specific treatment for RSV infect ion. In Japan, 
palivizumab is approved for the prevent ion of RSV infection in children with 
immunocom promised condit ions. Palivizumab has been found t o be generally  safe and 
effect ive in this populat ion (Kashiwagi et al, 2018; Mori  et al , 2014 ), but because of its t 1/2of 
approximately  1 month, infants and y oung children need to receive monthly IM doses of 
palivizumab throughout the RSV- season to maintain protection.

Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 28of 74 Template 18.0Nirsevimab has the potential to provide significant improvement over palivizumab based on 
its dem onstrated i ncreased potency  and extended t 1/2. Bec ause of the significant advantage of 
one dose per RSV season that nirsevimab would provide, the Sponsor recognizes the 
potenti ally important benefits for the current pediatric populat ion receiving palivizumab. This 
Phase 2 study  is planned to evaluate the safety  and tol erabili ty, PK, ADA, and efficacy  of 
nirsevimab in immunocompromised children ≤ 24 mo nths of age.
3.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints
Nirsevimab is being developed to provide RSV immunoprophylaxis for all infants and y oung 
children, including immunocompromised children ≤ 24 months of age. The primary endpo int 
for this study  is safet y and tol erabilit y. The standard measures of TEAEs/TESAE s, AESIs, 
and NOCDs will be used for this assessment. All subjects will be fo llowed for approximately  
1 year after dosing with nirsevimab. 
Serum  concentrati ons of  nirsevimab at selected time points will be evaluated as a secondary  
endpo int to confirm that serum concentrations are maintained at an efficacious level for at 
least 5 m onths after dosing. PK data will be summarized by  descri ptive statistics. PK data 
obtained in this study  will be com pared to the PK data from the Phase 2b, Phase 3, and the 
Phase 2/3 studi es. For infants and children who require hospitalizat ion for LRTI or any  
respi ratory  infect ion, an addit ional serum sample for measurement of nirsevimab 
concentration and ADA will be obtained contemporaneous with time of hospitalizat ion. 
To deter mine nirsevimab serum levels post dosing and to correlate with the potential 
development of ADA, serum concentrations will be measured up to 360 days post dose. ADA 
to nirsevimab will be measured at selected time points throughout the study  and up to 
360 day s post dose.
This study  will also summarize efficacy of nirsevimab in terms of incidence of RSV LRTI. 
RSV resul ts in a si gnificant burden of disease consist ing of hospitalizat ion, visit s to the ER, 
and visits to outpatient clinics. This endpoint is desig ned to allow the capture of this total 
burden of disease. A separate endpo int of RSV hospitalizat ion will also be evaluated. 
Exploratory  endpo ints will examine

evaluated for the occurrence of LRTI 
(Table 6). All subjects found to have an LRTI and all

of LRTI, shoul d have respiratory  samples obtained and respiratory  assessment forms 
completed. Sam ples shoul d be collected for all of these respiratory  events ,even those not

RSV Hospitalization
An RSV hospitalizat ion is defined as eit her (1) a respiratory  hospi talizati on wi th a posi tive 
RSV test wi thin approximately  2 days of hospi tal admissi on (primary) or (2) a new onset of 
respi ratory  symptoms in an already hospitalized subject, with an object ive measure of 
worsening respiratory  status and posi tive RSV test (nosocomial). Primary and nosocomial 
RSV hospitalizat ion are further defined below. 
Primary RSV Hospitalization
RSV di agnosti c testing will be performed on respiratory  secret ions obtained w ithin 
approximately  2 days before or after admissio n for subjects hospitalized for respiratory  
infect ion (upper or lower respiratory  tract). If the RSV diagnostic test (performed centrally  via 
RT-PCR) is posit ive, the hospitalizat ion will be classified as a primary RSV hospitalizat ion. 
Deaths that can be demonstrated as caused by RSV (by autopsy or clinical history and 
virologic evidence) will also be considered as primary  RSV hospi talizati on endpoints.
Nosocomial RSV Hospitalization
Subjects hospitalized f or a respi ratory  illness or non -respi ratory  illness whose RSV diagnostic 
test i s negat ive may develop nosocomial RSV illness during the study.
If signs (such as retractions, rhonchi, wheezing, crackles, or rales) of a new lower respiratory  
illness occur du ring a hospitalizat ion, whatever the reason for hospitalizat ion, and there is an 
objective measure of worsening respiratory  status (that is, new requirement for supplemental 
oxygen, increase in supplemental oxygen requirement from prior to the onset of sym ptoms, or 
need for new or additional mechanical vent ilation), a specimen will be collected within

hospi tal days will  count as a nosocomial RSV hospitalizat ion. The days of RSV 
hospi talizati on will  be counted beginning wit h the start of the respiratory  deteri oration that 
resul ted in the RSV diagnostic test.
RSV LRTI Outpatient Events
Subjects who seek outpatient medical attention, including ER and urgent care visits, for an 
LRTI should have respiratory  secret ions obtained within approximatel y 2 days after the init ial 
healt hcare provider assessment.
Respiratory Secretions for RSV Detection 
Respiratory  secreti ons f or RSV testing must be collected fro m all subjects wi th LRTIs 
(inpatient or outpatient) and from all hospitalized subjects with any new respiratory  infect ion 
(upper or lower) within approximately 2 days after the init ial healthcare provi der assessment 
and diagnosis. Nasal secretions will be obtained unless the subject is intubated, and then 
tracheal secretions may be obtained.
Respira tory secreti ons will  be tested in a central laboratory  for RSV using the US FDA -
cleared and Conformité Européenne or European Conformit y-marked in vitro diagnostic real -
time RT -PCR assay (Lyra RSV + hMPV assay; Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA). Testing 
may include other respiratory  pathogens.
The respiratory  samples will be retained at AstraZeneca or designee for a maximum o f 15 
years fo llowing the issue of the CSR to properly address potential quest ions from  regulatory  
authori ties.

4.8 Statistical Evaluation
4.8.1 General Considerations
There are 2 pl anned analyses for this study : an interim  analysis and a final analysis. The 
interim analysis will be conducted when subjects enrolled globally  by end of 2021 have been 
followed through Day  151. For the interim analysis, all safet y, PK, ADA, and ef ficacy data 
collected for subjects enro lledglobally in 2021 will be analyzed. A minimum o f 
approximately  of 30 subjects is expected to be sufficient in establishing a PK profile for 
efficacy  and safety  extrapol ation at the time of the interim analysis. Th e final analysis will be 
conducted after all subjects have co mpleted the last visit of the study  (ie, Day  361).
Categorical data will be summarized by the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category . Continuous variables will be summarized by  mean, median, standard deviat ion, 
minimum, and maximum. In general, unless stated otherwise, baseline will be defined as the 
last non -missing value prior to dosing. 
Data will be summarized for the overall study  popul ation, as well as for Japan only.
Data analyses will be conducted using the SAS® System Versio n 9.4 or higher (SAS Inst itute 
Inc., Cary , NC) in a SAS GRID environment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 46of 74 Template 18.04.8.2 Sample Size
A total o f approximately  100 subjects are pl anned to receive a single IM dose of nirsevimab to 
evaluate the safet y,PK, ADA, and efficacy , which will be assessed descriptively . The 
originally proposed sam ple size was based on a similarly designed palivizumab study  in a 
similar populat ion (Mori  et al , 2014 ), and i t is expected to be sufficient in establishing a PK 
profile that allows extrapolat ion of efficacy  and safety  data from  the Phase 2b (D5290C0 0003) 
and  studies in healthy preterm and term infants to the target 
immunocom promised populat ion. The updated sample size of 100 allows for the collect ion of 
PK and safety  data from  a larger cohort of immunocompromised children .Therevised sample 
size of 100 subjects allows for the study  ofimmunocompro mised children and the various 
causes for this condit ion globally. Further ,the data fro m this study  will support the evaluat ion 
of safet y in a diverse populat ion, which could potent ially facilitate the examinat ion of 
subpopulations.
 
4.8.3 Safety
AEs will be graded according to the current version of the NCI CTCAE (or Appendix A) 
where applicable for pediatric assessments. AEs will be coded by MedDRA and the ty pe, 
incidence, severit y, and rel ationship to study  drug will be summarized. Other safet y 
assessments will include the occurrence of AESIs defined as AEs of immediate
hypersensit ivity (incl uding anaphylaxis), thrombocy topenia, and immune com plex disease 
(eg, vasculit is, endocardi tis, neurit is, gl omerulonephri tis) following study  drug administrati on, 
and the occurrence of NOCDs fo llowing study  drug administration.
4.8.4 Analy sis of Pharmacokinetics
Serum  concentrati ons of  nirsevimab at selected time points will be evaluated to confirm that 
adequate exposures for protection fro m RSV LRTI are maintained for at least 5 months after 
dosing. Nirsevimab serum concentration data will be presented in descript ive statistics. 
4.8.5 Analysis of Antidrug Antibody
The incidence of ADA to nirsevimab will be assessed and summarized by number and 
percentage of subjects who are ADA posit ive. The impact of ADA on PK, and the associ ation 
with TEAEs and TESAEs, will be assessed, if data permit.

5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study  
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treat ment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding if judged by the Invest igator as medically significant), 
symptom  (eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The term  AE is used to include both serious and nonserious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no invest igational product has been administered. 
Elect ive treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery  (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enro lled into the study ) for a docum ented pre -existing condit ion that di d not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elect ive procedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
shoul d be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE that:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y 
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect in o ffspring of the subject
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical or scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in this situation. Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment

that do not result in hospitalizat ions; or development of drug depe ndency or drug abuse.
5.3 Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the 
investigat ional product and may  require cl ose m onitoring and rapi d communicat ion by the 
Invest igator to the Sponsor. An AESI may be serio us or nonserious. The rapid reporting o f 
AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and understand 
them in associ ation with the use of this invest igational product.
5.3.1 Serious Hypersensitivity (Including Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex 
Disease)
5.3.1.1 Immediate Hypersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Administrati on of  polyclo nal immunoglobulin preparations and mAbs has been associated 
with immediate (ty pe I) hy persensi tivity (including anaphylaxis) th at occurs during or after 
dosing. An immediate hy persensi tivity react ion is defined as an acute onset of an illness with 
involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both that occurs during or after administration of 
investigat ional product (but does not me et the definit ion of anaphylaxis). Anaphylaxis is a rare 
event, usually  occurring after subsequent exposure to antigen, and it is most commonly 
accompanied by severe systemic skin and/or mucosal react ions. It i s potenti ally a fatal , 
systemic allergic react ion that i s dist inct from simple allergic react ions (eg, rash, pruritus) 
because of the simultaneous invo lvement of several organ systems (Sampson et al , 2006 ). A 
full defi nition of  anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix B. See Secti on5.5for recording AEs.
5.3.1.2 Immune Complex Disease
Immune com plex disease can manifest in the form of a number of condit ions such as 
vasculit is, endocardit is, neurit is, gl omerulonephri tis, serum  sickness, and arthralgias. 
Drug -induced immune co mplex (ty pe II I) hy persensi tivity reacti ons can occur when the host 
immune system generates ant ibodies to drug resulting in so luble circulating ant igen-antibody  
complexes formati on and thei r deposi tion in bl ood vessels. Subsequent ly this init iates ti ssue 
damaging inflammatory  reacti ons m ediated by  complement and/or l eukocy tes and mast cells. 
The pathology  and clinical  manifestati ons are dependent on the tissues/organs invo lved, wi th 
vascular, skin, and renal t issues being commo n sites of injury . Comm on examples of immune
complex hypersensit ivity reacti ons are serum  sickness (systemic) and Arthus react ions (local). 
The clinical manifestations o f serum  sickness include skin rash, fever, malaise, and 
polyarthralgias or polyarthrit is. Symptoms ty pically  devel op 1 to 2 weeks a fter first exposure 
to antigen and usually reso lve in several weeks after withdrawal of the causat ive agent. Serum 
sickness needs to be differentiated from other ‘serum -sickness -like’ react ions that have a 
similar clinical presentation (eg, viral infection s, ant i-seizure drugs), but are believed to have 
different pathogenic mechanisms. Both serum sickness and serum sickness -like react ions have 
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50of 74 Template 18.0been reported with mAbs (eg, rituximab, infliximab). Clinical presentation and t ime to onset 
shoul d be considered f or the di agnosis and differentiat ion of these react ions. Diagnosis of 
these suspected reactions is best confirmed via bio psy of the affected tissues. See Section 5.5
for recording AEs. 
5.3.2 Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocy topeni a is a disorder in which there is an abnormally low platelet count; a normal 
platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per μL. The 3 major causes of low 
platelet counts in clude: 1) insufficient platelet synthesis in the bone marrow; 2) increased 
breakdown of platelets in the bloodstream; and 3) increased breakdown o f platelets in the 
spleen or liver. General symptoms of thrombocy topenia include bleeding in the mouth and 
gums, bruising, nosebleeds, and petechiae (pinpo int red spots/rash). Severe bleeding is the 
major complicat ion, which may  occur in the brain or gastrointest inal tract. Drug- induced 
thrombocy topenia is a reversible form of thrombocy topenia that shoul d be suspe cted in a 
subject who presents with new onset thrombocy topenia or recurrent episodes of acute 
thrombocy topenia, wi thout an obvious alternat ive etiology. It is commo nly induced by  
drug-dependent antibodies that cause platelet destruction or clearance by the
reticuloendothelial  system  (drug -induced immune thrombocy topenia), and l ess comm only by  
drug-induced bone marrow suppression or autoimmune thrombocytopenia that is init iated by  
exposure to the offending drug but persists in its absence. The init ial approa ch to the subject 
with suspected drug -induced thrombocytopenia invo lves confirming thrombocytopenia, 
establishing a temporal relat ionship to a drug, and eliminat ing other causes of 
thrombocy topenia. The di agnosis is m ade clinically  by docum enting prompt re solution of  
thrombocy topenia after discont inuat ion of the suspected drug (ty pically  within 1 week). Most 
subjects wi th drug -induced thrombocytopenia require no specific treatment, as their platelet 
counts will recover prompt ly following withdrawal of the c ausat ive agent. See Section 5.5for 
recording AEs.
5.4 Definition of New Onset Chronic Disease
An NOCD is a newly diagnosed medical condit ion that i s of a chronic, ongoi ng nature. It is 
observed after receiving the investigational product and is assessed by  the Invest igator as 
medically significant. Examples of NOCDs include, but are not limited ,to diabetes, 
autoimmune disease (eg, lupus, rheumatoid art hritis), and neurological disease (eg, epilepsy). 
Events that would not be considered as NOCDs are mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital 
anomaly present at study  entry , or acute illness (eg, upper respiratory  infect ion, oti tis media, 
bronchit is). See Sect ion5.5for recording AEs.
5.5 Recording of Adverse Events
AEs, including SAEs, AESIs, and NOCDs, will be recorded on the eCRF using a recognized 
medical term  or di agnosis that accurately reflects the event. These events will be assessed by  
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 51of 74 Template 18.0the Invest igator for severit y, relationship to the investigational product and study procedure(s), 
possible etio logies, and whether the event meets criteria of an SAE (see Sections 5.2and 5.6), 
or is an AESI or NOCD (see Sections 5.3, 5.4, and 5.7) and therefore requires immediate 
notification to the Sponsor. See Appendix Afor guidelines for assessment of severit y and 
relationship to invest igational product. 
If an AE evo lves into a condi tion that m eets the regulatory  defini tion of  “seri ous,” i t will be 
reported on the AE for m in the eCRF as an SAE.
5.5.1 Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events
AEs and SAEs will be co llected fro m the time of signature of informed consent through 
Day 361.
AESIs and NOCDs will be collected from the time of dosing through Day  361.
5.5.2 Follow- up of Unr esolved Adverse Events
Any AE that is unreso lved at the subject’s last visit  will be fo llowed up by the Invest igator for 
as long as medically  indicated, but wi thout further recording in the eCRF. The Sponsor retains 
the right to request addi tional information for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the 
end of the study , if judged necessary .
5.5.3 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the study , incl uding the protocol -defined fo llow-up peri od, m ust 
be reported as SAEs. A post- mortem (autopsy ) may be helpful  in the assessment of the cause 
of death and, if performed ,a copy  of the post -mortem resul ts shoul d be f orwarded to the 
Sponsor representative(s) within the usual t imeframes (refer to Section 5.6for addi tional 
inform ation).
5.5.4 Potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law
Cases where a subject shows elevat ions in liver biochemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f aspartate aminotranserase (AST)or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT ) ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) together with total bilirubin ( TBL ) ≥ 2 ×ULN may 
need to be reported as SAEs. Please refer to
 Appendix Cfor further instruction on cases of 
increases in liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
5.6 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Prom pt notificat ion of an SAE by the Invest igator to the Sponsor is essent ial so that l egal 
obligat ions and ethical responsib ilities towards the safet y of parti cipants and the safet y of a 
study  interventi on under clinical invest igation are met. 
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 52of 74 Template 18.0The Sponsor has a legal responsibilit y to notify  both the l ocal regulatory  authori ty and other 
regul atory  agencies about the safet y of a study  intervent ion under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will co mply with country -specific regulatory  requi rements relating to safet y reporti ng 
to the regulatory  authori ty, IRBs/IECs, head of the medical inst itution, and Invest igators. 
For all studi es except those utilizing medical devices, Invest igator safet y reports m ust be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local 
regul atory  requi rements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to the head of the medical 
institution and Invest igators as necessary. 
An Invest igator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific 
safet y informat ion (eg, summary  or list ing of SAEs) fro m the Sponsor will review and then 
file it along wit h the Invest igator’s Brochure and/or will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Invest igators or other site personnel must 
inform  the appropri ate Sponsor representative(s) wit hin 1 day, ie, immediately but no later 
than 24 hours after beco ming aware of the event.
The designa ted study  representati ve works wi th the Invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the Sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 
1calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar days 
of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately . Invest igators or other site personnel inform Sponsor 
representatives of any  follow-up inform ation on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar 
day, ie, immediately but no l ater than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the electronic data 
capture (ED C) sy stem , an autom ated em ail alert is sent to inform the designated Sponsor 
representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the Invest igator or other study  site personnel  contacts 
the Sponsor representative by telephone. The Sponsor representa tive will give guidance on 
how to proceed.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53of 74 Template 18.05.7 Other Events Requiring Immediate Reporting
5.7.1 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of invest igational product in excess of 
that specified in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise spe cified in this protocol.
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on a Sponsor investigat ional product occurs during the study, then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel should inform appropriate Sponsor representatives 
immediately , but no l ater than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event.
The des ignated Sponsor representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided to the Sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply; see Sect ion 5.6. 
For other overdoses (ie, those not associated with an AE or SAE), reporting must occur within 
30 day s.
5.7.2 Medication Error
For the purposes of th is clinical study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for a Sponsor invest igational product that either causes harm to the 
subject or has the potential to cause harm to the subject. 
A medicat ion error is not la ck of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human -or process -related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or subj ect.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error: 
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the subject rec eived the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the subject
Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route or wrong site of administration
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54of 74 Template 18.0Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the refrigerator when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong subject received the medicat ion 
Wrong drug administered to subject 
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs, but AEs may occur as a consequ ence of the 
medicat ion error.  
If a medicat ion error occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate Sponsor representatives wit hin 1 day, ie, immediately but 
no later than 24 hours of when he or sh e beco mes aware of it.
The designated Sponsor representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is completed within 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated with the 
medicat ion error (see Section 5.6) and wi thin 30 days for all other medicat ion errors. 
Medicat ion errors should be reported using a Medication Error Report Form.
5.7.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
5.7.3.1 Immediate Hyp ersensitivity, Including Anaphylaxis
Events of immediate (Ty pe 1) hy persensi tivity, including anaphylaxis (as defined in 
Appendix B), requi re that the Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate Sponsor 
study  representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es 
aware of the event. The designated Sponsor study  representative works with the Invest igator 
to ensure th at all relevant informat ion is provided and entered in EDC. If the event is 
considered serious ,it must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.6).
Signs of immediate hypersensit ivity include urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, skin rash, 
difficult y breathing, and wheezing. Parent(s)/legal representatives will be provided a card with 
this informat ion to ai d in prom pt identificat ion and reporting of these signs. Parent(s)/l egal 
representatives will be instructed to immediately report the occurrence of any o f these findings 
to the Site Investigator who should then report the events to appropriate Sponsor study 
representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of 
the event.

must inform appropriate Sponsor representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours of 
when he or she beco mes aware of it. The designated Sponsor stu dy representative works with 
the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant informatio n is provided and entered into EDC. If the 
event i s considered serious ,it must be reported as an SAE (see Section 5.6).
6 STUDY AND DATA MANAG EMENT
6.1 Training of Study Site Personnel
Before the first subject is entered into the study , a Sponsor representative will review and 
discuss the requirements of the protocol and related documents with the invest igational staff 
and also train them in any study -specific procedures and system(s) utilized.
The Principal Invest igator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to 
all of these staff, and that any  new informati on relevant to the performance of this study  is 
forwarded to the staff invo lved.
The Principal Invest igator will maintain a record of all individuals invo lved in the study  
(medical, nursing, and other staff).
6.2 Monitoring of the Study
During the study , a Sponsor representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to:
Provi de inform ation and support to the Invest igator(s)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56of 74 Template 18.0Confirm that the invest igational team  is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that bio logical  samples are handled in 
accordance with the Laboratory  Manual  and that investi gational product accountabilit y 
checks are being performed
Perform  source data verification (a com parison of the data in the eCRFs with the subject’s 
medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study ),
including verificat ion of informed consent of participat ing subjects. This will require 
direct access to all original records for each subject (eg, clinic charts)
The Sponsor representative will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other staff 
at the site needs information and advice about the study  conduct.
6.2.1 Source Data
Refer to the Clinical Study  Agreement for location of source data.
Direct Access to Source Data 
The head of the study  site and the Principal Invest igator/Invest igator will cooperate for 
monitoring and audit ing by the Sponsor (or designee) and accept inspect ion by the IRB/IEC or 
regul atory authori ties. All study  docum ents such as raw data will be open for direct access to 
source data at the request of the monitor and the auditor of the Sponsor (or designee), the IRB, 
or regul atory  authori ties.
The m onitor(s) will  verify data from  the eCRFs against source data before the Principal 
Invest igator signs the eCRFs to ensure accuracy and completeness of documentation and 
assure that the Principal Invest igator has submitted the eCRFs to the Sponsor. If the 
Invest igator wishes to amend the collected eCRFs, the monitor will ensure that the Principal 
Invest igator has recorded the amendment with signature and date and provided this to the 
Sponsor.
6.2.2 Study Agreements
The Principal Invest igator at the site should comply with all the terms, condit ions, and 
obligat ions of the Clinical Study  Agreement, or equivalent, for this study . In the event of any  
inconsistency between this protocol and the Clinical Study  Agreement, the terms o f protocol  
shall prevail wit h respect to the conduct of the study and the treatm ent of subjects and in all 
other respects, not relating to study  conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the Clinical 
Study  Agreement shall prevail.
Agreements between the Sponsor and the Principal Invest igator must be in place before any 
study -related procedures can take place, or subjects are enrolled.

The Investigator fo llows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study  Agreement.
Document File and Period of Retention 
All study  docum ents (including l etters from the Sponsor) should be retained in the study  
docum ent file by  the Principal Invest igator. The monitor will regularly check the file to ensure 
that all relevant documents are retained. The contents of the file may be audited/inspected by 
the Sponsor’s auditor, regulatory  authori ties, or IRB/IEC.
Period of Record Retention 
The study  site (and the Principal Invest igator) will retain the essent ial docum ents as specified 
by GCP (eg, source document such as medical records, contract, signed informed consent
form). Essent ial docum ents shoul d be retained at the study  site for 15 y ears in principle 
following co mpletion of the study , or per regul atory  obligat ions if lo nger, and thereafter 
destroy ed only  after agreement wi th the Sponsor. However, this is not alwa ys applied to th ose 
that are not preservable such as blood samples. In the event of any inconsistency between the 
above -ment ioned contents and the contract with the study  site, the contract shall prevail. 
These documents should be retained for a longer per iod, however, if needed by the Sponsor, 
and the specific period and method of retention will be separately  discussed between the study  
site and the Sponsor (or designee). The Sponsor should notify  the head of the study  site in 
writing when the study -related records are no longer needed. The records must be managed by 
a responsible person appo inted by  the head of the study  site.
6.3 Study Timetable and End of Study
An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject was 
followed t hrough their last protocol- specified visit/assessment. 
Subjects will be considered not to have co mpleted the study  if consent was withdrawn or the 
subject was lost to fo llow-up (see Secti ons 4.1.5 and 4.1.6 ).
The end o f the study  (“study  com pletion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assessment for the last subject in the study .
6.4 Data Management 
Data m anagement will be performed by the Sponsor’s Data Management staff or other party
according to the Data Management Plan.
An EDC system will be used for data collect ion and query  handling. The Invest igator will 
ensure that data are recorded in the eCRFs as specified in the study  protocol  and in accordance 
with the eCRF instructions provided.

of the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study  Agreement. The 
Invest igator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy o f the com pleted eCRFs will be archived 
at the study  site.
6.5 Medical Monitor Coverage
Each subject will be provided wit h contact information of the Principal Invest igator. In 
addition, each subject will receive a toll -free number intended to provide the subject’s 
physician access to a medical mo nitor 24 hours a day , 7 day s a week in the event of an 
emergent situation where the subject’s healt h is deemed to be at risk. In this situation, when a 
subject presents to a medical facilit y where the treating physician or healthcare provider 
requi res access to a phy sician who has knowledge of the invest igational produ ct and the 
clinical study  protocol  and the Principal Invest igator is not available, the treating physician or 
healt h care provider can contact a medical mo nitor through this system, which is managed by  
a third party  vendor.
7 ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY REQUIREMENTS
7.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the Decl aration of Helsinki, the clinical study  
protocol , ICH/GCP, and any  local standard. 
7.2 Subject Data Protection
Each subject will be assigned a SID to ensure that personall y ident ifiable informat ion is kept 
separate from the study  data. Subj ect data that are rel evant to the tri al, eg, dem ographic 
inform ation, physical or mental healt h condit ion, diagnosis, comorbidit ies, l aboratory  test 
resul ts, etc will only be collected wi th the subject’s informed consent. The informed consent 
form will incorporate (or, in some cases, be acco mpanied by a separate document 
incorporating) wording that describes how subject data will be co llected, used, and distributed 
in compliance wi th relev ant data protecti on and privacy legislat ion. 
7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review
The IRB/IEC responsible for the site must review and approve the final study  protocol , 
including the final versio n of the informed consent form and any other written informat ion 
and/or m aterials to be provi ded to the subjects. The IRB/IEC must also approve all advertising 
used to recruit subjects for the study . The head of the medical inst itution is responsible for 
submitt ing these documents to the applicable IRB/IEC and distribut ingthem to the study  site 
staff.

provi de a copy  of the wri tten approval  to the Sponsor before enrollment of any subject into the 
study . 
The Sponsor should approve any substantive modificat ions to the informed consent form that 
are needed to meet local requirements.
If required by  local regulat ions, the protocol must be re -approved by  the IRB/IEC annually.
Before the study  is initiated, the Sponsor will ensure that t he national regulatory authorit y in 
the respective country  has been notified and their approval has been obtained, as required. The 
Sponsor will provide safet y updates/reports according to local requirements, including 
SUSARs where relevant, to regulatory  authori ties, IRB/IEC, and Principal Investigators.
The Principal Invest igator is responsible for providing reports of any serious and unexpected 
adverse drug reactions from any other study  conducted wi th the invest igational product to the 
IRB/IEC via the h ead of the m edical inst itution. The Sponsor will provide this information to 
the Invest igator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements. The head of study site is 
responsible for providing the report and on keeping the IRB apprised of the progre ss of the 
study  and of any  changes made to the protocol but ,in any case ,at least once a y ear.
7.4 Informed Consent
Inform ed consent of each subject will be obtained through a written and verbal explanat ion 
process that addresses all elements required by  ICH/GCP. The Sponsor will develop a core 
inform ed consent form  for use by  all Invest igators in the clinical study. The Sponsor must 
approve any  modificati ons to the informed consent form that are needed to meet local 
requi rements.
The Principal Invest igato r(s) at the site will:
Ensure each subject’s legal guardian is given full and adequate oral and written 
inform ation about the nature, purpose, possible risk, and benefit of the study
Ensure each subject’s legal guardian is notified that they  are f ree to di scontinue from  the 
study  at any  time
Ensure that each subject’s legal guardian is given the opportunit y to ask questi ons and 
allowed time to consider the informat ion provi ded
Ensure each subject’s legal guardian provides signed and dated informed consent b efore 
conducting any  procedure specifically for the study

participat ion, are described in the informed consent form that is approved by an IRB/IEC
7.5 Changes to the Protocol and Informed Consent Form
Study  procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Invest igators and 
the Sponsor. Any  changes m ust be docum ented in a study  protocol  amendment. 
For a substantial change to the protoco l, the Sponsor will distribute amended versio ns of the 
protocol  to the Principal Invest igator(s). Before implementation, amended protocols must be 
approved by  relevant IRB/IEC (see Section 7.3) and reviewed as per local regulatory  authori ty 
requi rements. The IRB/IEC must also approve revisions to the informed consent form, 
advert ising, and any  other wri tten inform ation and/or materials result ing from the change to 
the protocol.
Any non -substant ial changes will be communicated to or approved by  the IRB/IEC.
7.6 Audits and Inspections
Authori zed representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory  authori ty, or an IRB/IEC m ay perf orm 
audits or inspect ions at the cen ter, including source data verificat ion. The purpose of an audit 
or inspect ion is to sy stem atically and independent ly examine all study -related acti vities and 
docum ents, to determine whether these activit ies were conducted, and data were recorded, 
analyzed , and accurately  reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines of the ICH, and 
any applicable regulatory  requi rements. The Investigator will contact the Sponsor immediately 
if contacted by  a regul atory  agency  about an inspecti on at the si te.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 66of 74 Template 18.0Appendix AAdditional Safety Guidance
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from an adverse event 
(AE) as it occurred, or it is suspected that use or cont inued use of the product would result in 
the subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does no t mean that had an AE occurred in a more 
severe form ,it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalization
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it maybe (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deterio rate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi talizat ion, disabilit y, or incapacit y but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These 
shoul d usually be considered as serious .
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.
Examples of such events are:
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
Hepato toxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n) or conv ulsions 
that do not result in hospitalizat ion
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Assessment of Severity
Assessment of severit y is one of the responsibilit ies of the Invest igator in the evaluat ion of 
AEs and SAEs. The determinat ion of severit y should be m ade by  the Invest igator based upon 
medical judgment and the severit y categori es of  Grade 1 to 5 ,as defined below.
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 67of 74 Template 18.0Grade 1 An event of mild intensit y that is usually transient and may  require only 
minimal treatment or therapeutic intervent ion. The event does not 
generally interfere with usual act ivities of daily living.
Grade 2 An event of moderate intensit y that i s usually alleviated with addit ional 
specific therapeut ic intervent ion. The event interferes with usual 
activit ies o f daily living, caus ing disco mfort but poses no significant or 
perm anent ri sk of  harm  to the subject.
Grade 3 A severe event that requires intensive therapeutic intervent ion. The 
event interrupts usual act ivities of daily living, or significantly affects 
the clinical status o f the subject.
Grade 4 An event, and/or its immediate sequelae, that is associated with an 
imminent ri sk of death.
Grade 5 Death as a result of an event.
It is important to dist inguish between serious criteria and severit y of an AE. Severit y is a 
measure of intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by  the cri teria in Sect ion5.2. A Grade 3 
AE need not necessarily be considered an SAE. For example, a G rade 3 headache that persists 
for several  hours may  not meet the regulatory defini tion of an SAE and woul d be considered a 
nonseri ous event, whereas a Grade 2 seizure resul ting in a hospital admissio n would be 
considered an SAE.
Assessment of Relationship
A Guide to Interpreting the Causalit y Quest ion
The Investigator is required to provide an assessment of relationship of AEs and SAEs to the 
investigat ional product. The fo llowing factors shoul d be considered when deciding if there is a 
“reasonable possibilit y” that an AE may have been caused by the investigational product.
Time Course. Exposure to suspect investigat ional product. Has the subject actually  
received the suspect investigational product? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect investigational product?
Consistency wit h known invest igational product profile. Was the AE consistent with the 
previous knowledge of the suspect invest igational product (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) 
or products of the sam e pharmacol ogical class? OR could the AE be ant icipated fro m its 
pharmaco logical properti es? 
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose 
of the suspect invest igational product?
No al ternative cause. The AE canno t be reasonably explained by another etio logy such as 
the underlying disease, other drugs, or other host or environmental factors.
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 68of 74 Template 18.0Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected invest igational product was 
reintroduced after having been stopp ed? The Sponsor would not normally reco mmend or 
support a re -challenge.
Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship?
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered ,such as:
Is this a recogni zed feature of overdose of the investigat ional product?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individ ual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data incl uding enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relat ionship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreat ment-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration o f investigational product) as well as treatment -emergent 
SAEs. A protocol -related SAE m ay occur as a result of a procedure or intervent ion required 
during the study  (eg, bl ood collect ion,washout of an exist ing medicat ion). The fo llowing 
guidelines shoul d be used by  Invest igators to assess the relat ionship of SAEs to the protocol:
Protocol  related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for wh ich there i s no al ternat ive et iology  present in the 
subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etio logy other than the procedure/ 
intervent ion that was described in the protocol (the alternative et iology 
must be documented i n the study  subject’s m edical record).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 70of 74 Template 18.0Appendix CActions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver Biochemistry 
and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
C 1 Introduction
This appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report potential Hy’s Law cases and Hy’s Law cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of elevated liver biochemistries. 
During the course of the study , the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry . The Investigator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria at any  point during the s tudy.
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of potenti al Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other visi ts 
including all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if collected outsid e of the study  visit s. For 
example, potenti al Hy’s Law criteria coul d be m et by  an elevated ALT from  a central  
laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from  a local laboratory .
The Investigator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevat ions 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible potenti al Hy’s Law events.
The Investigator participates, together with Sponsor clinical project representatives, in review 
and assessment of cases meeting potential Hy’s Law criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law 
criteria are met. Hy ’s Law cri teria are m et if there is no al ternative explanat ion for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry  other than drug- induced liver injury caused by the 
investigat ional product.
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to potenti al Hy’s Law/Hy’s Law 
cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line wit h standard safety  reporting processes.

2 Definitions
C2.1 Potential Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of investigational product irrespective of an increase in alkaline 
phosphatase.
C2.2 Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than 
the invest igational product, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases; eg, elevated 
alkaline phosphatase indicating cho lestasis, viral hepatitis, or another drug.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 71of 74 Template 18.0For potential Hy’s Law and Hy’s Law, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be 
coincident with (ie, on the sa me day ) the el evation in TBL, but there is no specified t imeframe 
within which the elevat ions in transaminases and TBL must occur.
C
3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of potential  Hy’s Law, i t is important to perform a com prehensive 
review of laboratory  data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria 
in isolation or in co mbinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
AST ≥ 3 × ULN
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
The Investigator will ,without del ay,review each new laboratory  report and,if the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met ,will:
Notify  the Sponsor study representative
Repeat the test (new blood draw) without delay
Determine whether the participant meets potenti al Hy’s Law criteria (see Section C 2for 
definit ion) by  reviewing any laboratory  reports from all previous visits
Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  case report form (CRF) module(s) with 
the original l ocal laboratory  test result .
C 4 Follow -up
C4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the subject does not meet potential Hy’s Law criteria the Invest igator will:
Inform  the Sponsor study  representative that the participant has not met potential Hy’s 
Law criteria.
Perform  follow-
up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts, as applicable.
C4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the subject does meet potential Hy’s Law criteria the Investigator will:
Notify  the Sponsor study representative who will then inform the study team
Within 1 day of potential Hy’s Law criteria being met, the I nvest igator will report the 
case as an SAE of Potential Hy’s Law; serious criteria ‘Important medical event’ and 
causalit y assessment ‘yes/related’ according to clinical study  protocol  process for SAE 
reporting .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72of 74 Template 18.0The m edical  monitor contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree on an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the 
continuous review of data. 
Subsequent to this contac t the Invest igator will:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Complete fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the et iology of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the m edical m onitor. 
Com plete the rel evant CRF Modul es as informat ion beco mes available .
C 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul dbe followed for all  cases where potenti al Hy’s Law 
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the m edical 
monitor will  contact the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting potent ial Hy’s Law cri teria other than 
drug-induced liver injury caused by the invest igational product, to ensure timely analysis and 
reporting to health authorit ies per l ocal requi rements from  the date potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria 
were m et. The m edical m onitor and Gl obal Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this 
review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, update the previously submitted potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new information (reas sessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the Sponsor’s standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the invest igational product:
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73of 74 Template 18.0Send the updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to the Sponsor’s standard 
processes.
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causalit y assessment 
of ‘related’ should be assigned .
If, there i s an unavo idable delay of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for Hy ’s Law, then it is assumed 
that there is no alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi de any further update to the previously  submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law (report 
term now ‘Hy’s Law case’), ensuring causalit y assessment are related to the 
investigat ional product and seriousn ess criteria is medically important, according to the 
clinical study  protocol  process for SAE reporting
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to de termine 
whether Hy’s Law criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted potential Hy’s 
Law SAE report fo llowing clinical study  protocol  process for SAE reporti ng, according to 
the outcom e of the review and am end the reported term if an alternat iveexplanat ion for 
the liver biochemistry  elevati ons is determined .
C 6 Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential Hy’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a subject meets potent ial Hy’s Law criteria on study  treatm ent 
and has already met potential Hy’s Law cri teria at a previous on study  treatment vi sit.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
potenti al Hy’s Law is based on the nature of the alternat ive cause ident ified for the previous 
occurrence.
The i Ivestigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of potential Hy’s Law 
criteria being met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f potenti al Hy’s Law cri teria being 
met found to be the dis ease under study  eg, chronic or progressing malignant disease, 
severe infect ion, or liver disease? 
If No: follow the process described in Sect ion C4.2, for reporting potential Hy’s Law as an 
SAE .
AstraZeneca Protocol D5290C00008
Nirsevimab (MEDI8897) 23 June 2021; Final
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74of 74 Template 18.0If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant change in the subject’s condit ion compared 
with when potenti al Hy’s Law criteria were previo usly met:
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change fo llow the process described in Section C4.2, for reporting 
potenti al Hy’s Law as an SAE .
A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolat ion or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  releva nt change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator; this 
may be in consultat ion with the medical  monitor if there i s any  uncertaint y.
C 7 Laboratory Tests
To evaluate the underlying et io
logy of potenti al Hy’s Law cases, relevant laboratory  tests m ay 
be perform ed as clinically  indicated.

Protocol Body
1.0 Background
Since the introduction  of the first laryngeal mask airway, the Classic LMA®, the use of supraglottic airway devices (SGADs) have 
experienced a remarkable evolution and are now routinely used in clinical  anesthesia practice. One of the SGADs on the market 
is the LMA Protector™ (Teleflex Medical Europe Ltd., IDA Business and Technology Park, Dublin  Road, Athlone, Co. 
Westmeath, Ireland),  which is a single-use modification of the older, reusable LMA Proseal™ (Teleflex).  The LMA Protector™ has 
a pre-curved,  rigid airway tube similar  to the Ambu AuraGain™ (Ambu A/S-Copenhagen, Demark).  The concept of a curved 
airway tube is to imitate the airway anatomy during device placement,  thus making insertion relatively easy  and smooth. Like 
some of the newer SGADs, they have  a built-in gastric  drainage channel to facilitate efflux of gastric  fluid and gas, and allows 
for the insertion of a gastric tube. These devices are  referred to as second generation  SGADs.
Due to the similarities between the AuraGain™ and the LMA Protector™, a randomized, prospective clinical study with a detailed 
evaluation of the performance of these two devices will be conducted. The AuraGain™ is Ambu’s 3rd generation  laryngeal  mask, 
satisfying 3 fundamental airway management needs by integrating gastric access  and intubation capability in an anatomically 
curved single-use  device that facilitates rapid establishment of a safe airway. The LMA® Protector™ is a next-generation, single-
use laryngeal mask  with a dual gastric drainage channel and pharyngeal chamber designed specifically  to channel high volume, 
high pressure gastric contents  away from the airway. A clinical evaluation  will be performed on elective patients with normal  
airway anatomy for device insertion,  function  as a ventilatory device and as an intubation conduit,  functionality of the gastric 
drainage channel, oropharyngeal leak pressure  (OLP). Also, a fiberoptic assessment, utilizing the Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim, of the 
glottic view via the SGAD device and signs of airway morbidity will be investigated.
2.0 Objectives and Hypothesis
The purpose of this study is to estimate the ratio or difference in success rate of both the Ambu® AuraGain™ and Teleflex® LMA 
Protector™ during insertion and placement  into an airway.  Other findings  include ease of supraglottic airway device (SGAD) 
insertion, anatomical fit of the SGAD (i.e. SGAD displacement, bloodstaining),  rate of successful ventilation and intubation, 
functionality of gastric drainage channel (via orogastric tube insertion through each  SGAD;  to ensure  easy insertion), 
oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP;  measured  by a portable, handheld manometer), and postoperative  complications in elective  
surgical patients who are not expected to have a difficult airway. Also, a fiberoptic assessment (with the Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim) 
of the glottic view via the SGAD device and signs of airway morbidity will be investigated.
2.1 Primary:  The ratio or difference in success  rates of either the Ambu® AuraGain™ or Teleflex® LMA Protector™ during insertion 
and placement into an airway.
2.2 Secondary: Rate of successful ventilation and intubation (by utilizing the SGAD as an intubation conduit  guided by the 
Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim), ease of SGAD insertion (based on a numerical subjective rating scale), anatomical fit of SGAD (i.e. 
SGAD displacement, bloodstaining), OLP (measured by a portable, handheld manometer), functionality of gastric drainage 
channel which  will be inserted through the appropriate channel of the SGAD,  and postoperative complications
2.3 Exploratory : Fiberoptic assessment  of the glottic view via the SGAD device  and signs  of airway morbidity
3.0 Device Description
The AuraGain™ is Ambu’s  2nd generation laryngeal mask, which satisfies three fundamental airway management  needs by 
integrating gastric access and intubation capability in an anatomically curved single-use device that facilitates rapid  
establishment of a safe airway. AuraGain™ is the only anatomically curved  SGAD with integrated gastric access  and intubation 
capability. The integrated gastric  access channel is designed  with a low friction inner  surface to facilitate easy placement of a 
gastric tube. The AuraGain also provides intubation capabilities in case of an unexpected  difficult airway, or a ‘Cannot Intubate,  
Cannot mask Ventilate’  (CICV) situation.  The AuraGain™ can be used as a conduit  for direct endotracheal intubation assisted by 
a flexible scope  (such  as the Ambu® aScope3).
The LMA® Protector™ is a next-generation, single-use laryngeal mask with a dual gastric drainage channel  and pharyngeal  
chamber designed  specifically to channel high volume, high pressure gastric  contents away from the airway. The 
LMA® Protector™, with its 100% silicone cuff and airway tube , is designed to be gentle to one’s airway anatomy. The elongated  
cuff integrates two technological advancements for facilitating esophageal seal and indicating cuff pressure levels. This enables  
clinicians to monitor pressure levels  at a glance  and adjust when necessary. The LMA® Protector™also allows for intubation with 
compatible sizes of endotracheal tubes to provide a safer and more effective  option for airway replacement.
The Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim is an ultra slim, single-use, flexible scope that once and for all solves the problem of accessibility, 
simplifies set-up procedures and eliminates the need for complex  cleaning procedures thus releasing valuable resources for 
other procedures as an alternative to reusable scopes. The Ambu® aScope™ 3 Slim’s distal end contains a camera  with two LED 
light sources, a maneuverable tip with a bending  angle  of 130°/130°, as well as, suction and channel  ports (including an ETT 
connection). When connected to the aView  monitor,  the Ambu® aScope™  3 Slim provides high quality  images of anatomical 
landmarks that are suitable for various airway procedures such as intubation, airway inspection, double  lumen  tube placement, 
bronchial blocker placement, and even Aintree catheter placement.

6.0 Subject Identification, Recruitment and Consent
Discussion of Subject Population
Patients that elect to have surgery typically  require general anesthesia and tracheal intubation. Tracheal intubation is usually 
acheived, traditionally,  by direct or indirect  laryngoscopy, and  is the preferred method when  securing an airway. SGADs are the 
recommended alternative to laryngoscopy via laryngoscopes if failed  or not possible,  to aid in sufficient oxygenation and 
ventilation of patients according to difficult airway algorithms.Therefore, SGADs are constantly  studied for significance and 
adequacy as a rescue  device for emergent  scenarios or when laryngoscopy  fails. 
Method Of Subject Identification And Recruitment
Eligible subjects will receive a detailed  explanation of the study, its purpose, their role, and study  procedures in relation to 
what’s considered  research and standard  of care (SOC); as well as the potential  risks, benefits and alternatives prior to study 
enrollment. They will be given  a consent form to read and if they so choose, to discuss  with friends, family,  and other clinicians. 
They will be invited to ask questions and, after all questions  are answered to their satisfaction, invited to sign the consent form 
in accordance. The Principal Investigator  (or delegate) will participate in the consenting process to ensure the subject has full 
understanding of the procedure and risks. No study-specific procedure  will be  performed before  the consent form is signed.

8.0 Study  Intervention and Data Collection
This study involves the placement and usage  of a laryngeal mask airway on a human subject for adequate airway management, 
oxygenation, and ventilation. The intervention directly  related to this study is that of airway  management, airway  
device/equipment, oxygen administration, mechanical ventilation,  fiberoptic  assistance, and tracheal intubation. The subject will 
have a surgical procedure that is incidental to his or her study participation, along with tracheal intubation. Besides the principal 
investigator and co-investigator,  listed collaborators (anesthesiologists) will be involved in managing enrolled patient airways  in 
accordance to the protocol.  Randomization of the anesthesia practitioner is not necessary  and will not occur.  All patients will be 
recruited and enrolled based on the availability  of the 8 study anesthesiologists during the study  period.
Patient Preparation Procedures
Prior to the surgical procedure, patient  demographics and airway assessment will be recorded, as well as the selected 
randomized SGAD  that will be used  to secure the airway. The patient will be monitored  with 5-lead ECG, pulse oximetry, non-
invasive blood pressure (BP) and end-expiratory gas analysis. Vital sign measurements will be taken and recorded at the 
following time points:  Pre-oxygenation, pre-induction,  post-induction, post-SGAD insertion,  10 minutes after SGAD insertion, on 
admission to the post anesthesia recovery  unit (PACU),  and every 30 minutes until discharge from PACU. The patient will be 
positioned supine on the operating table  with the head resting on a foam cushion and/or pillows and blankets (if needed).  The 
patient will be pre-oxygenated via full facemask for a minimum of 3 minutes. Prior  to pre-oxygenation, the circle system  will be 
filled with 100% oxygen. The flow of oxygen  will be set  at 10 liters  to obtain  the highest end tidal concentration of oxygen (EtO 2).
General anesthesia will be induced via traditional methods  as requested  by the anesthesiologist. Appropriate doses of propofol,  
fentanyl, and rocuronium will be administered  as recommended by the anesthesiologist’s  discretion. A mixture of sevoflurane or 
desflurane will be utilized for maintenance of anesthesia. Vital signs will be recorded throughout. Lungs  will be mechanically  
ventilated with a semi-closed  circle  system to maintain an end-tidal CO 2 near 35mmHg.  Once  there  are no twitches  on the train 
of four (ToF)  twitch  monitor, following rocuronium administration, insertion of the randomized SGAD will then be performed. The 
size of the SGAD device used  will be based  on the manufacturers’ recommendations or by clinical evaluation of the patient  the 
anesthesiologist.
SGAD Preparation Materials
The following materials will be ready on a preparation table before  the anesthesia procedure is commenced: tablecloth, water-
soluble lubricant,  correct size of SGAD and one size bigger and one size smaller, 20 & 50 ml syringes, pressure  gauge, silk tape 
for fixation of the SGAD, 16 Fr. gastric  tube (max. size gastric tube recommended  by the manufacturer – is listed in the CRF),  5 
gauze wipes, and a timer.   
aScope Preparation  Procedures
Prior to its use, the Ambu  aScope3 Slim, and compatible Ambu aScope monitor, will be inspected for: visual harm  to the scope, 
mechanical performance by tip manipulation, in which the distal end should  be bent to a maximum in both directions while the 
scope is held in a straight position  (The bending degree  should  be at least 110°), and aScope3  to aScope  monitor connection.  
The quality of the monitors’ standard installation should be evaluated. If the picture is not acceptable from the beginning, the 
quality will be adjusted  via the contrast button and light button. When the picture  quality  is evaluated, the aScope3 Slim will be 
placed 1 cm from black letters placed  on a white background  to secure  picture quality.  When preparing the aScope3 Slim,  the 
insertion cord should be well lubricated.  When  the aScope3 Slim has fulfilled the functional criteria, it should be placed on the 
preparation table and turned  off. If flaws  or errors are detected  with the aScope3 Slim or the aScope monitor, either should  be 
replaced and a new aScope3 evaluation will be performed with the new device. An alcohol  wipe shall be used to thoroughly 
clean the lens if the image is not clear. Antifog should not be  used for cleaning  the aScope™ 3 Slim lens.
1. Insertion of the SGAD 
The patient will be placed in the sniffing position to optimize the oropharyngeal angle. The SGAD will be lubricated on  the 
posterior surface of the cuff prior to insertion.  Timing  will begin  when  the tip of the cuff of the device  touches the patient’s lips. 
During insertion, the tip of the cuff will be pressed upwards  against the hard palate and the cuff will be flattened  against it. Jaw 
lift technique will be used on all patients.  A jaw lift is performed by using the index finger and thumb of the non-dominant hand  to 
lift the chin while  the device is passed along the hard palate with  the dominant  hand. Additional  maneuvers performed to  
optimize positioning  or ventilation, such  as adjusting head/neck position,  additional jaw lift, adjusting depth  of insertion,  lateral  
insertion technique, or changing  size of the SGAD.  For the SGAD to be considered as placed correctly, the teeth  of the patient 
should be between the teeth-marks indicated on the proximal end of the airway tube designed  as a bite absorption area. The 
appearance of the first square  end tidal carbon  dioxide trace will indicate establishment of effective ventilation, and T1 (watch 1) 
will be stopped.  Once successful placement has been  confirmed, the cuff of SGAD will be inflated with air to attain an intra-cuff 
pressure of 60 cm H2O, measured  with a handheld aneroid  manometer (pressure gauge). The volume  of air will be recorded. 
The SGAD  will be taped  to the participant’s  cheek with adhesive tape. 
 
Unsuccessful appearance of CO2 curve suggests incomplete placement of the SGAD, and the device will be removed 
completely and another  insertion  attempt  should  be performed  while the recording of time continues.  An insertion attempt is 
defined as, when the SGAD touches  the patient’s lips. Only three attempts  shall be made for proper device placement.  The first 
two attempts will be made by either attending anesthesiologists or certified registered nurse  anesthetists (CRNA) and the final  
attempt by the attending anesthesiologist.  In case of failure  of both SGAD and bag-mask  ventilation, the airway will be secured 
according to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. 
 
2. Fiberoptic Evaluation of the SGADs Anatomical Position 
Once ventilation  is achieved, the laryngeal view will be  determined, thus illustrating the anatomical positioning of the device. The 
investigation will be performed with the aid of the flexible  scope, the Ambu  aScope3  Slim,  which will be introduced into the 
airway tube and guided  through the SGAD until it is possible to view the vocal cords.  Description  of the maximal optical view will 
be measured by the Percentage Of Glottic Opening  (POGO).1 The POGO score and any presence of blood will be recorded. 
If the epiglottis is down-folded obscuring the optical view, a jaw lift will be performed and another POGO score will be obtained. 
In case of secretions  or blood, the channel of the aScope3  Slim will be used for removing the debris. If this fails, the aScope3 
Slim will be withdrawn and a suction  catheter will be used,  and the lens of the aScope3  Slim will be cleaned  using an alcohol  
wipe, before a new attempt  is commenced. 
 
3. Investigation of the Functionality of the Gastric  Drainage Channel of the SGADs  
A size 16 Fr. gastric  tube will be pre-lubricated with a water-soluble lubricant and will be passed  through the gastric drainage 
channel, of either  SGAD, until depth  mark of 40-50  cm. The female gastric  drainage channel will be used on the Protector. 
Confirmation of gastric  tube placement  will be obtained by aspiration  of 2 ml of gastric content and/or auscultation  of inflated  air 
at the epigastrium.
An insertion  attempt  is defined as when  the tip of the gastric tube touches the proximal channel.  Insertion failure is defined as 
inability to pass a gastric  tube until appropriate depth mark, lack of confirmation of correct  placement by auscultation, and 
inability to evacuate any gastric content.  
 
Additionally, the ease  of insertion of gastric tube, number  of insertion attempts, volume of air evacuated, volume  of gastric 
content, and fluid observed in gastric  drainage channel will be recorded.
4. Measurement of Oropharyngeal Leak Pressure (OLP) 
The measurement of OLP will be performed, with an Ambu cuff pressure gauge, prior to surgical incision  and at the end of 
surgery; this measurement will be performed  by closing the adjustable pressure-limiting valve, with a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min,  
and noting the airway  pressure at equilibrium. The maximum  pressure allowed is 40 cmH2O. The epigastrium will not be 
auscultated when measuring  leak pressure with the purpose  of detecting any possible air entrainment into  the stomach 
intraoperatively. Moreover, OLP and any audible leak into the stomach or over the mouth will also be recorded.
5. Use of SGAD as an Intubation Conduit  
1)Intubation Procedure
An intubation procedure  will be performed by placement of an ETT over  the Ambu  aScope3  Slim. A standard  use Parker Flex  
Tip™ ETT of maximum recommended  size will be used depending  on SGAD size  for both female and male patients.  ETTs of 
6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 mm will be paired  with the AuraGain, sizes 3, 4, and  5 respectively. An ETT of 6.0 mm will be paired with the 
LMA Protector size 3, and ETTs of 7.0 and 8.0 mm will be paired  with the LMA Protector, sizes 4 and 5 respectively.
The airway  tube of the SGAD will be lubricated  and the aScope3 Slim will be passed through the airway  tube until  carina is 
visualized. Once the aScope3  Slim is at the carina, the ETT will be passed  down the insertion cord of the aScope3 Slim and 
correct placement of the ETT will be verified. Once the ETT is placed correctly,  the cuff of  the ETT will be inflated  and the 
aScope3 Slim will be removed.
An intubation attempt will be defined as from when the tip of the ETT is touching  the SGAD connector and advanced  through  
the SGAD. If an unsuccessful attempt occurs, and the ETT is  withdrawn from the SGAD, the next attempt will be considered a 
new attempt.  No more than 3 intubation attempts shall be  made for  proper ETT placement.  If unsuccessful after 3 attempts with 
at least 2 different  size SGAD devices used, standard tracheal intubation will be performed.
Intubation time will be measured from when the tip of  the aScope3  Slim is touching the SGAD connector until endoscopic 
confirmation of correct ETT placement. End-tidal capnography will be  used to confirm  successful intubation. In addition, size of 
SGAD, size of ETT, and number of intubation attempts  will also be recorded.  Qualitative assessment of ease of intubation, and 
will be based on an analog scale from 1-4: 1: Easy 2: Resistance 3: Difficult  4: Unsuccessful.
9.0 Risks and Benefits
Risks
In general, subjects will be a part of a study  that may potentially affect how anesthetic providers practice  and manage difficult  
airway patients. As a specific benefit, subjects will be  intubated using  a new video  laryngeal  mask airway. Risks  are similar to a 
regular laryngeal  mask airway, including but not limited  to, device  malfunction and airway adverse events.  
As with use of all medical devices, complications may occur.  Recognized risks  associated  with the use of the study intervention 
include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Allergic reactions: although the materials being used are hypoallergenic  and the risk is small, there remains a risk for an 
allergic reaction that may result in hives,  swelling, or anaphylaxis.
•Oropharyngeal injury: although the both LMAs  were designed  for supraglottic placement,  some bleeding/bloodstaining may 
occur upon placement
•Oropharyngeal pressure: over inflation of the both LMAs  can occur that  can cause an increase in pressure
Risk Minimization
•To minimize the risk of allergic reactions,  both Auragain and LMA Protector have undergone  and successfully passed 
biocompatibility testing.
•To minimize the risk of an oropharyngeal  injury, it is recommended  that all clinicians be properly trained on how to use the 
both LMAs and be familiar with the Instructions For Use (IFU).
•To minimize the risk of increased  pressure, it is recommended that all clinicians be  properly trained  on how to both LMAs 
and the recommended  inflation pressure.  There  will also be a recording  of the both LMA cuffs when inflated measured by the 
OPL testing, to aid in adequate cuff inflation.
Potential Benefits to Subject
•Improved  oxygen delivery, administration, and oxygenation
•Potentially  able to reduce post-op respiratory complications
Alternatives to Participation
The alternative for not participating in this study would result in not using either SGAD for tracheal intubation. Therefore, a 
traditional alternative (the standard  of care) such as a laryngoscope would be utilized for tracheal intubation. 
10.0 Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics such as the mean (standard deviation) or median (range) will be used to summarize continuous variables 
as appropriate.     Frequencies and percentages  will be  used to summarize  categorical variables,  such as success rates.   
Independent samples t-tests or Wilcoxon  rank-sum tests (if more appropriate)  will be used to compare differences in continuous  
variables between study arms.  Fisher’s exact  test or Chi Square test will be used to  compare  categorical variables between 
study arms.  Correlations and regression  will be used to estimate  associations of interest, primarily for exploratory analyses and 
further hypothesis  generation.
11.0 Sample Size
The AMBU® AURAGAIN™ and TELEFLEX® LMA PROTECTOR™ are FDA approved SGADs that can be used for ventilation, and 
as a conduit for intubation. For patients in the general hospital setting, each device  has exhibited a relatively high success rate 
of at least  90% as a ventilatory device.3,4 Success is defined as the insertion  and placement  of a SGAD on the first attempt. 
Success rates will be computed as proportions for each  study arm. Taking the ratio of the success rates  for each study arm will 
derive the relative risk. A two-sided  95% confidence interval  will have the following  lower and upper limits:  (0.945, 1.255)  
assuming a relative risk of 1.089 (ie. success  rate for study arm 1 = 0.90 and success rate for study arm 2 = 0.98) and 25 
patients in each treatment arm.

Any photos taken  during the study will make every effort not to include subject faces or other identifying marks such as scars  or 
tattoos.
In order to ensure  compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), all subjects enrolled  in the 
study will be required to provide authorization to disclose Protected Health Information  (PHI).  This authorization will be included 
in the informed consent document as required by the IRB. In all study  reports and in any resulting  publications, subjects will not 
be referred to by their initials  and/or study  identification number.
13.0 Reporting Requirements
Adverse Events
For study conduct purposes, adverse  events  will be categorized  at the investigative site into  two groups: Serious Adverse  
Events, and Non-Serious Adverse Events. The Investigator as either related to the device or its deployment, or not related to the 
device or its deployment will assess  the causal relationship of each  adverse event. Each Adverse  Event assessed as being  
related to the device or its deployment will also be assessed  by the Investigator  as being  anticipated or  unanticipated.
Adverse Events Definitions
Adverse Event (AE): An Adverse  Event  is any undesirable  clinical event  occurring to the subject during clinical study, whether or 
not it is considered related to the investigational  product. This includes a change in a subject's condition or  laboratory results, 
which has or could have a deleterious  effect on the subject's  health  or well-being. An Adverse Event that is related to the 
investigational device may be referred  to as an Adverse Device  Effect (ADE). 
An adverse  event does  not include:  
•Medical or surgical procedures; the condition that  leads to the procedure is  not an adverse event
•Pre-existing  disease, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present at the start of the study that do not worsen in frequency  
or intensity
•Situations  where  an untoward medical  occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalizations for cosmetic or  elective surgery  or 
social/convenience admissions)
•Expected  post-operative course
Unanticipated Adverse  Device Effect  (UADE): Any device related adverse event, the nature or severity of which is not consistent 
with or listed in the applicable product information (e.g., instructions  for use, subject informed  consent document, subject 
information brochure [if applicable], promotional literature)  or any  other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device  
that relates  to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
Reporting of Adverse Events
All adverse events, whether observed by the Investigator, elicited from or volunteered by the subject, should be  documented. 
Each adverse event  will include  a brief description of the experience, the date of onset, the date of resolution, the duration and 
type of experience, the severity, the relationship to investigational product  (i.e., drug or device),  contributing  factors, and any 
action taken with respect to the study drug/device.
Investigators and research coordinators will be instructed that all AE and corresponding relevant information  should  be recorded 
on the Adverse Event Form. In addition, the clinical site will be responsible for notifying Sponsor within  24 hours  of any UADE. 
All relevant information regarding an UADE  should be recorded  on the Adverse Event Form and reported  to Sponsor via Fax 
within 24 hours of the event. In addition to the event form, copies of adverse device  effect related source documents should be 
forwarded to the Sponsor.
The Principal Investigator is responsible for reporting AEs to  the IRB of record  in accordance with IRB procedures. The Sponsor 
is responsible for informing the appropriate regulatory authorities  and other Investigators of any  UADEs that  have occurred.
Responsibilities for Reporting  Serious Adverse Events
The Principal Investigator will record all serious adverse experiences that occur during the study period in the appropriate 
source documents and/or AE log as applicable.  
14.0 Data Monitoring  Plan
Training of Clinical Site Personnel
The training  of clinical site personnel will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. To ensure  uniform  data collection and protocol 
compliance, personnel from Sponsor  will review the investigational plan, techniques for the identification of eligible subjects, 
instructions on data collection, methods for soliciting  data from alternate sources, and schedules  for follow-up, as necessary,  
with the research coordinator.
Data Reporting
All data will be recorded on the site's standard  source documentation. The Investigator or designee is responsible for 
transferring the information  to the appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs)  supplied by the Sponsor. The Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring the forms are accurately completed at the time of, or as soon as possible after, the subject procedure  
or the availability of test results. The Investigator is required  to sign the CRF  on the appropriate  page(s) to verify  that he/she has 
reviewed the recorded data. 
Data Review
The Sponsor will review all deidentified CRFs for completeness and  clarity upon  receipt. Missing or unclear data will be 
requested as necessary throughout the study. The Sponsor will request  further documentation such as physician  procedure 
notes when UADEs  and/or malfunctions  are observed and reported.
The Sponsor will provide clinical monitoring including comparison of CRFs to source documentation for accuracy and 
appropriateness, review of/for adverse  events, prompt evaluation of  UADE, and site compliance. To this end, the Principal  
Investigator will permit inspection of the study files and subject CRFs  by Sponsor  representatives and/or responsible  
government agencies.
Prior to initiation of the study,  sites will be trained on the clinical protocol, accepted clinical practices  and Federal regulations  
pertaining to clinical research. Study sites will receive interim  monitoring, as needed,  and a final visit prior to study closure.
15.0 Deviation and Compliance
Compliance
It is expected that sites (Investigators,  study coordinators, ancillary  site personnel, and study subjects) will be  compliant with the 
study protocol. Should  it be determined that the site is non-compliant, reasonable efforts will be made to secure compliance. 
These efforts/actions  shall be documented in writing and maintained within the study administration file at the Sponsor’s  
location.
Should the site continue to remain non-compliant, the study Sponsor may restrict device availability and/or  notify the governing  
IRB. Should efforts to bring the site into compliance fail, the site may be  suspended from study participation until the 
noncompliance is resolved. Federal regulations  require the Sponsor to report  non-compliances in the study to the appropriate  
regulatory authorities. Therefore, in the event  of an Investigator or site suspension, the governing IRB  and other appropriate  
regulatory authorities shall be notified.
Protocol Deviations
Protocol Deviations (PDs) will be documented on a Protocol Deviation Case Report Form.  PDs are reportable  to the institution's  
governing IRB and regulatory agencies during the annual reporting process,  unless  otherwise directed by the individual  
governing IRB requirements  or as the specific circumstance dictates.  
Every attempt shall be made to adhere to the study protocol. However,  should an Investigator be required  to deviate from the 
protocol to protect the life or physical well-being of  a study subject  in an emergent  circumstance, such  notice shall be given to 
the study  Sponsor  as soon as possible, but no more than 5 working  days from the date the event occurred. With the exception 
of an emergent circumstance, prior approval  from Sponsor and the appropriate  regulatory authorities is required for any change 
in, or deviation from, the study  protocol as such changes may affect the soundness of  the investigation or the rights,  safety, and 
welfare of study subjects.
16.0 Investigator Responsibilities
Investigators are responsible for ensuring  the investigation  is conducted  in accordance with the study  protocol and applicable  
Federal regulations  (21 CFR, Part 812, Subpart E). Investigators are  also responsible for:

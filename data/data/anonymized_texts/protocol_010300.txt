Version 2.0, 09 November 2022  Current version  
 
Key changes in the current version of the protocol are summarized below.  
Change and Rationale  Affected Sections  
Added postdose ECGs at additional study visits and provided 
instructions on withholding a study drug dose on these days if 
needed.  Section 3 and Section 9.6 
Added exclusion criteria for history of QT prolongation or 
standard 12 -lead ECG demonstrating median QTcF >450 msec 
at screening or baseline.  Section 8.2, Exclusion Criteria 4 and 30 
Added study dr ug interruption and stopping rules.  Section 9.8 
Based on available  clinical data from Study VX21-548-011, 
updated to allow study drug to be taken  with or without food  
after the first dose . Section 3 (Table  3-4), Section 9.4, and 
Section  9.6 
Added telephone contact on Day 4 to assess the subject’s 
status, any adverse events, concomitant medications, 
treatments, and procedures at an additional time point.  Section 3 ( Table  3-4) 
Updated E nd of Dosing Visit to occur as soon as possible after 
pain resolution criteria are met  instead of as soon as possible 
after the subject decides to stop study drug treatment.  Section 3 ( Table  3-4) 
Clarified that discharge assessments should be completed f or 
all surgical subjects and for any non -surgical subjects who 
required inpatient admission.  Section 3 (Table  3-4)

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Study Design  This is a Phase 3, single -arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of 
VX-548 in treating acute pain ( Figure 2-1 [surgical subjects] and Figure 2-2 
[non-surgical subjects]).  
Figure 2-1 VX22 -548-107 Study Design (Surgical Subjects)  
 
NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; VRS:  verbal categorical rating scale  
Notes: After surgery completion, a subject will be assigned to treatment if (1) the subject 
requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate 
or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does 
not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within  the protocol -specified, procedure -specific 
time period, the subject will not be eligible for this study. Figure is not drawn to scale.

Notes: After completion of scr eening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, a subject 
will be assigned to treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the 
VRS, and (2) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. Figure is not drawn to scale.  
Surgical Subjects  
On Day  1, subjects will undergo a scheduled ambulatory surgical procedure with 
pain that is expected to last for at least 72 hours and that is expected to require no 
more than a short -term (i.e.,  <24-hour) admission. After surgery completion, a 
subject will be assig ned to treatment if (1) the subject requests the first dose of 
study drug for pain relief, (2)  the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, 
and (3)  the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS 
and NPRS criteria within th e protocol -specified time period for the surgical 
procedure they underwent (e.g., 4 hours for most procedures), the subject will not 
be eligible for this study.  
 

Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 6 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Non-surgical Subjects  
On Day  1, after completion of screening assessments and confirmation of 
eligibility, a subject will begin treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or 
severe on the VRS, and (2) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. For a subject to 
be eligible, their pain must have been ongoing for ≤48 hours at presentation.  
All Subject s 
Approximately 250  subjects will receive VX -548 (100 mg first dose, then 50 mg 
every 12  hours [q12h]). Subjects will continue to receive VX -548 for 14  days or 
until their pain resolves, whichever occurs first. An acetaminophen/ibuprofen 
combination may be  used as a rescue medication for pain relief as needed (prn), 
starting any time after the first dose of study drug through Day 14, completion of 
study drug treatment due to pain resolution, or study drug discontinuation, 
whichever occurs first. Subjects wi ll be permitted to take acetaminophen 
650 mg/ibuprofen 400  mg every 6  hours (q6h) prn, up to a maximum of 
2600  mg/1600  mg in any 24 -hour period.  
The following approach will be used to define pain resolution and completion of 
study drug treatment:  
1. Pain is c onsidered to be resolved  and the study drug treatment will be 
considered completed if  
a. a subject takes no study drug during a 48 -hour period (i.e., skipped at 
least 4  consecutive doses due to pain resolution ); and  
b. a subject takes no more than 1 dose of acetaminophen/ibuprofen during 
each 24 -hour period within the 48 -hour period (i.e., no more than 2 doses 
in 48 hours ). 
2. If a subject stops taking study drug per Criterion 1a but does not meet 
Criterion 1b, they will be instructed to restart study drug (and prn rescue 
medication).  
3. If a subject stops and restarts study drug (Criterion  2 above) and subsequently 
believes their pain is resolving and stops study drug a second time, they will 
be instructed to not restart study drug, regardless of whether the above 
criteria are met.  
4. If a subject stops study drug a second time after the restart of dosing 
(Criterion 3 above) and then fulfills  both Criterion 1a and 1b, the pain is 
considered resolved and study drug treatment will be considered completed. 
If the subject fulfills only Criterion 1a but not Criterion 1b after the restart of 
dosing, the pain is considered not resolved and study drug will be considered 
discontinued.  
Note: If subject stops study drug due to pain resolution less than 48 hours before 
the last sch eduled dose of study drug (i.e., stops after the second dose on Day 12) 
and therefore cannot meet Criterion 1a by Day 14, the subject will be considered 
to have completed study drug dosing  as long as they  also meet Criterion 1b.  
  
Assessments  Safety : adv erse events (AEs); clinical laboratory assessments; clinical evaluation 
of vital signs, standard 12 -lead ECGs, and physical examinations; and 
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Effectiveness : PGA of study drug

5.1 Background  
Pain is one of the most common symptoms for which patients seek medical attention. Current 
treatment options for pain are limited by poor efficacy and high rates of adverse events (AEs),  
leaving many patients without adequate pain control. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) pose a potentially serious risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with acute and chronic use, 
hematologic toxicity with acute use, and nephrotoxicity with chroni c use.1 Opioids are 
significantly limited by safety and tolerability issues and have a high abuse liability. 
Opioid -associated deaths have increased in frequency over the past 2 decades.2 Opioids were 
involve d in more than 70,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2020 and in approximately 76% of 
fatal drug overdoses in the EU in 2019.3, 4 
Given the limited  treatment options, combined with the risks and constrained utility of current 
treatments, the development of new analgesics with improved efficacy and safety profiles is vital 
for better pain management and patient health outcomes. Despite the need for ne w analgesics, 
clinical development has exhibited a considerable lack of recent progress and innovation of new 
medications to treat pain.5 Over the last decade, the  majority of approved analgesic drugs either 
act on the opioid receptor system or are NSAIDs6; few  new molecular entity drugs for moderate 
to severe pain have been approved.7, 8 The majority of research activity focuses on developing 
abuse -deterrent refor mulations of existing narcotic pain drugs, or combinations with NSAIDs. 
The resultant compounds do not have substantially improved efficacy or safety.  
Voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) plays a critical role in pain signaling.9, 10 Support for 
this assertion arises from (1)  evaluation of the r ole Na V1.8 plays in normal physiology11-15, 
(2) pathological states arising from mutations in the Na V1.8 gene (SCN10A)16, 17, (3) animal 
models18-21, and (4)  pharmacology of known Na V1.8-modulating agents.22-24 In addition, because 
NaV1.8 expression is restricted to peripheral neurons, particularly those that sense pain (e.g.,  the 
dorsal root ganglia [DRG])11, 13, Na V1.8 inhibitors are less likely to be as sociated with the side 
effects commonly observed with other sodium channel modulators and the abuse liability 
associated with opioid therapies. Therefore, targeting the underlying biology of pain through 
selective Na V1.8 inhibition represents a novel appro ach to analgesic drug development that has 
the potential to address an urgent unmet need for safe and effective acute and chronic pain 
therapies. These therapies include treatment where the primary mechanisms underlying pain are 
nociceptor hyperexcitabilit y. 
5.2 Study Rationale  
This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of up to 14  days of treatment with VX -548 
for acute pain.   
6 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX -548 
6.2 Secondary Objective  
To evaluate the ef fectiveness of VX -548 in treating acute pain

 Confidential Information  7 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
7.1 Primary Endpoint  
Safety and tolerability based on treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory test 
results, vital signs, and ECGs  
7.2 Secondary Endpoint  
Subject perception of VX -548 effectiveness in treating pain at the end of treatment as measured 
by the proportion of subjects reporting good, very good, or excellent on a patient global 
assessment (PGA)  
8 STUDY POPULATION  
Eligibility will be reviewed and documented by an appropriately q ualified member of the 
investigator’s team before subjects are enrolled.  
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible.  
8.1 Inclusion Criteria  
All Subjects (Before Surgery, If Applicable)  
1. Subject will sign and date an informed consent form (ICF).  
2. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, study restrictions, 
laboratory tests, contraceptive guidelines, and other study procedures.  
3. Subjects (male and female) between the ages of 18 and 80 years, inclusive.  
4. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18.0  to <40.0  kg/m2. 
5. Surgical subjects: Scheduled to undergo an ambulatory orthopedic, plastic, breast, 
otorhinolaryngologic, colorectal, gynecologic, urologic, or general surgical procedure with 
pain that is exp ected to last for at least 72 hours and that is expected to require no more than 
short -term (i.e., <24 -hour) admission (additional details on ineligible procedures are provided 
in Appendix A ). 
Non-surgical subjects:  Present to medical facility with pain of new origin (not related to a 
prior known condition) that is moderate or severe on the verbal categorical rating scale 
(VRS) and ≥4 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), has been ongoing for ≤48 hours, is 
expecte d to last for at least 72  hours, and is expected to require no more than a short -term 
(i.e., <24 -hour) admission, if any. Representative conditions include traumatic and atraumatic 
acute musculoskeletal pain, orofacial pain, burns, and cutaneous and soft t issue pain 
(additional details on ineligible conditions are provided in Appendix A ). 
After Surgery (Surgical Subjects Only)  
6. Subject reported pain at the surgical site that is moderate or severe on the VRS and ≥4 on the 
NPRS within the following procedure -specific time periods:  
o Procedures performed with regional anesthesia: within 12  hours after surgery 
completion  
o All other procedures: within 4  hours after surgery completion

9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase  3, single -arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of VX -548 in treating 
acute pain ( Figure  9-1 [surgical subjects] and Figure  9-2 [non-surgical subjects]).  
Figure  9-1 VX22 -548-107 Study Design (Surgical Subjects)  
 
NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; VRS:  verbal categorical rating scale  
Notes: After surgery completion, a subject will be assigned to treatment if (1) the subject requests the first dose of 
study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is 
≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within the protocol -specified, 
procedure -specific time period, the subject will not be eligible for this study. Figure is not drawn to scale.

treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (2) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the 
NPRS. Figure is not drawn to scale.  
Surgical Subjects  
On Day 1, subjects will undergo a scheduled ambulatory surgical procedur e with pain that is 
expected to last for at least 72 hours and that is expected to require no more than a short -term 
(i.e., <24 -hour) admission. After surgery completion, a subject will be assigned to treatment if 
(1) the subject requests the first dose of  study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is 
moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. If a subject does 
not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria within the protocol -specified time period for the surgical 
procedure th ey underwent (e.g., 4 hours for most procedures; Section  8.1), the subject will not be 
eligible for this study.  
Non-surgical Subjects  
On Day 1, after completion of screening assessments and confirmation of eligibility, a subject 
will begin treatment if (1) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (2) the 
subject’s pain is ≥4 on the NPRS. For a subject to be eligible, their pain must have been ongoing 
for ≤48 hours at presentation.  
All Subjects  
Approximately 250 subjects will receive VX -548 (100 mg first dose, then 50 mg every 12  hours 
[q12h]). Subjects will continue to receive VX -548 for 14 days or until their pain resolves, 
whichever occurs first. An acetaminophen/ibuprofen combination may be used as a rescue 
medication for pain relief as needed (prn), starting any time after the first dose of study drug 
through Day 14, completion of study drug treatment due to pain resolution, or study drug 
discontinu ation, whichever occurs first. Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen 
650 mg/ibuprofen 400  mg every 6 hours (q6h) prn, up to a maximum of 2600  mg/1600 mg in 
any 24 -hour period.  

Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 29 of 62

 Confidential Information  The following approach will be used to define pain resolution and completion of study drug 
treatment:  
1. Pain is considered to be resolved and the study drug treatment will be considered completed 
if 
a. a subject takes no study drug during a 48 -hour period (i.e., skipped at least 4  consecutive 
doses due to pain resolution ); and 
b. a subject takes no more than 1 dose of acetaminophen/ibuprofen during each 24 -hour 
period within the 48 -hour period (i.e.,  no more than 2 doses in 48 hours ).  
2. If a subject stops taking study drug per Criterion 1a but does not meet Criterion 1b, they will  
be instructed to restart study drug (and prn rescue medication).  
3. If a subject stops and restarts study drug (Criterion 2 above) and subsequently believes their 
pain is resolving and stops study drug a second time, they will be instructed to not restart 
study drug, regardless of whether the above criteria are met.  
4. If a subject stops study drug a second time after the restart of dosing (Criterion 3 above) and 
then fulfills both Criterion 1a and 1b, the pain is considered resolved and study drug 
treatment wil l be considered completed.  If the subject fulfills Criterion 1a but not 
Criterion  1b after the restart of dosing, the  pain is considered not resolved and study drug 
will be con sidered discontinued.  
Note If a subject stops study drug due to pain resolution  less than 48 hours before the last 
scheduled dose of study drug (i.e.,  stops after the second dose on Day 12) and therefore cannot 
meet Criterion 1a by Day  14, the subject will be considered to have completed study drug dosing  
as long as they also  meet Cr iterion 1b.   
9.1.1  Screening  
Surgical Subjects  
Assessments from screening through admission (pre -procedure) are listed in Table  3-1. 
The Screening Visit will occur within 28  days before the scheduled surgical procedure and may 
occur in the clinic or as a home health visit with a qualified visiting nurse if permitted by local 
regulations. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee at the study site) will obtain 
informed consent from each subject in person or remotely (Section  13.2.3 ) before performing 
any study -related procedure. If needed, Screening Visit ass essments may be performed on 
different days within the screening period (e.g., informed consent may be obtained before the 
home health visit, if applicable).  
Non-surgical Subjects  
Assessments from screening through treatment assigned are listed in Table 3-3. 
The Screening Visit will occur on Day  1 after the subject presents with pain at a medical facility. 
The investigator (or an appropriate authorized d esignee at the study site) will obtain informed 
consent from each subject before performing any study -related procedure. However, previous 
test results from the facility’s local laboratory may be used to establish eligibility if collected 
within 2  hours be fore ICF signing. All screening assessments must be completed , confirming 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 30 of 62

 Confidential Information  subject eligibility,  before treatment assignment may occur, including VRS and (if the subject’s 
pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS) NPRS.  
All Subjects  
To prepare for study p articipation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4). 
Subjects will be instructed during screening on appropriate expectations around their 
participation in a clinical study and the importance of accurately reporting their post -procedural 
pain. At the Screening Visit, subjects will receive trainings on accurate pain reporting, clinical 
study participation, and use of the electronic diary (e -diary) for recording study drug 
administration, rescue medication use, and the PGA. On Day  1 (pre -procedure), these trainings 
will be repeated for surgical subjects; for non -surgical subjects, only 1 training is required 
because the  Screening Visit is on Day 1 . Additional review of  these educational materials may be 
repeated for some or all subjects, as needed.  
9.1.1.1  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g.,  hemolysis of sample, equipment error).  
In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting.  
9.1.1.2  Rescreening (Surgical Subjects Only)  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria  may not be rescreened, with the following 
exceptions:  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respiratory 
infection with fever) in the 5  days before the first dose of study drug that was properly 
evaluated an d which resolved fully  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation 
within the allotted screening window  
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to 
commit t o all study procedures  
• Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any 
exclusion criterion, with the exception of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version 
of the protocol  
Any subject who is rescreened for a ny of the exceptions listed above may have the screening 
window extended by 1  week before needing to undergo any rescreening assessments. If more 
than 35  days have elapsed from the Screening Visit before first dose of study drug, all screening 
assessments need to be repeated.  The medical monitor must approve all rescreening and/or 
screening window extension requests before these occur.  
9.1.2  Surgical Procedure Through Treatment Assignment (Surgical 
Subjects)  
Assessments to be completed after the surgical procedur e through treatment assignment are listed 
in Table  3-2.  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 31 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  Use of drains for all relevant procedures will be at the discretion of the surgical team.  
In the perioperative period, pain management agents will be used according to Section  9.4.1.1 . 
All other standard -of-care agents (e.g., anti -emetics) are allowed except those which are 
specifically restricted ( Table  9-1). Section  9.4 provides additional details on allowed and 
restricted agents.  
Treatment assignment may not occur until at least 15  minutes after the last administration of 
supplemental analgesia (i.e., fentanyl; Section  9.4.1.1 ).  
In the postoperative period before treatment assignment, VRS will be completed upon request for 
the first dose of study drug for pain relief. NPRS will be completed after VRS only if the 
subject’s pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and 
NPRS criteria within the protocol -specified time period for the surgical procedure they 
underwent (Section  8.1), the subject will not be eligible for this study.  
9.1.3  Treatment Period  
Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table  3-4 (surgical and non-surgical subjects).  
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section  9.1. Dosing details are in Section  9.6. 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the time that they meet 
discharge/leaving criteria from where the surgical procedure was condu cted or non -surgical 
condition was treated (e.g., hospital, clinic, or ambulatory center), the medical monitor (or 
authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain (e.g., in the 
hospital, clinic, or ambulatory center) until su ch abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or 
unwilling to remain, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the 
investigator will make every effort to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to 
document the course of the abnormalities.  
Although the inpatient period, if any, is generally expected to be <24 hours (Section  8.1), 
subjects who turn out to require a stay of ≥24 hours do not need to discontinue study drug 
treatment or the study.  
Subjects who complete or discontinue study drug treatment before Day  14 wi ll remain in the 
study from the time of stopping study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and 
complete assessments for all study visits, as described in Section  9.1.5 . 
9.1.4  Follow -up 
Subjects will have a Safety  Follow -up Visit approximately 28  days after the first dose of study 
drug (Day  28 ± 2 days). Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table  3-4.  
9.1.5  Study Drug Completion or Discontinuation  
Subjects will receive VX -548 for 14 days or until their pain resolves, whichever occurs first, 
with pain resolution and study drug trea tment completion as defined in Section  9.1. Subjects may 
also choose to discontinue study drug for other reasons.  
If a subject discontinues or compl etes study drug treatment for any reason before Day  14, 
including AEs (considered treatment discontinuation) or reaching pain resolution (considered 
treatment completion), an End of Dosing Visit (EDV) should be scheduled to occur  as soon as 
possible after treatment discontinuation or after pain resolution criteria are met  (as applicable) , 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 32 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  and the Day  14 Visit will not be required. If the EDV occurs within or prior to the Day  7 visit 
window, the Day 7 Visit will also not be required. The EDV should ideally o ccur within 
72 hours after the last dose of study drug.  
Subjects who discontinue or complete study drug treatment before Day 14 will also be required 
to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit (Section  9.1.4 ). In the unlikely event that the EDV is 
delayed and occurs 28  days or later following the first dose of study drug, then a separate Safety 
Follow -up Visit will not be required.  
If a subject withdraws  consent for the study, no further assessments will be performed; the study 
data and samples collected will remain part of the study (Section  9.8). 
9.1.6  Home Health Visits  
Home health visits are only an option if permitted by local regulations. Any visits that occur via 
home health must have a consultation (i.e.,  telemedicine video conference or telephone contact) 
between the subject and investigator or q ualified delegate (licensed independent practitioner 
[LIP]) within 2 business days after the home health visit in order to check -in and collect AEs, 
and may also include a separate follow up with the study coordinator.  
9.1.7  Completion of Study Participation  
Com pletion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as one of the following:  
• For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safety Follow -up Visit  
• For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit: the d ate of last contact  
The end of study is defined in Section  13.2.9 . 
9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
This is an open -label study.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design and Population  
The study is designed to evaluate longer -term safety and sustained effect of VX -548 after 
multiple kinds of surgeries and non -surgical conditions resulting in acute pain; broad categories 
of surgeries and non -surgical acute pain conditions were included to obtain comprehensive safety 
data. Moreover, the use of VX -548 will be primarily in an outpatient setting as the selected 
surgeries/conditions generally require no more than a short -term (i.e., <24 -hour) admission. For 
the surgical subjects, the procedures and postoperative care, including methods for acute pain 
management, follow standard of care with minimal restrictions on the surgical and anesthetic 
parameters for the specified procedures. Clinician s may generally use what they consider to be 
standard of care in the US, while remaining within protocol specifications. Given that the study 
is intended primarily to collect safety information, an open -label, single -arm study design is 
appropriate.  
The gu iding considerations for the eligible surgical models and non -surgical pain conditions are 
that (1) they result in at least a moderate level of pain that lasts between 7 and 14 days; and 
(2) the surgical procedures (where applicable) historically are perfo rmed on an ambulatory basis. 
Consistent with the FDA requirements for premarketing safety databases, the proposed 
population adequately represents the target population (i.e.,  patients with moderate to severe 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 33 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  acute pain).27 To approximate use in a “real -world” setting, inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
designed to enroll a clinically diverse population that is more generalizable to clinical practice. 
The eligible surgical procedures and  non-surgical conditions support an evaluation of VX -548 in 
subjects with sufficiently diverse sources of acute pain (e.g., both bony and soft tissue) for the 
expected duration of use. The surgical procedures represent the broad categories of general, 
orthopedic, otolaryngology, breast, colorectal, gynecologic, urologic, and plastic and 
reconstructive surgery. The non -surgical conditions include traumatic and atraumatic acute 
musculoskeletal pain, orofacial pain, burns, and cutaneous and soft tissue pain.  
Following the scheduled surgical procedure or presentation at a medical facility with acute pain, 
subjects will be assigned to treatment after their pain meets threshold criteria using both a VRS 
and an NPRS. The pain threshold criteria are designed to ensu re subjects have moderate to 
severe pain. A 4 -point VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included as part of the pain 
threshold inclusion criterion to allow rapid assessment of subjects’ baseline pain on a repeated 
basis in the immediate postoperative period. The NPRS, a frequently used, valid pain intensity 
measure recognized by the FDA28, is included at baseline to further define and quantify subjects 
as having moderate to severe pain (i.e., ≥4 on a n 11-point [0 to 10] scale).  
Ibuprofen and acetaminophen were selected as the rescue medications because they are 
commonly used, short -acting, standard -of-care treatments for acute pain.  
9.3.2  Study Drug Dose and Duration  
The VX -548 dosing regimen of 100 mg firs t dose (loading dose), then 50 mg q12h was selected 
based on favorable safety and pharmacokinetic data from healthy subjects and subjects with pain 
after bunionectomy or abdominoplasty. Exposures at the selected VX -548 dose are predicted to 
achieve Na V1.8 inhibition levels of approximately 90% by 2 hours after administration of the 
100 mg loading dose. Exposures corresponding to approximately IC 90 are sustained with the 
administration of 50 mg q12h maintenance doses starting 12 hours after the loading dose.  
The dosing duration for each subject will be determined by the clinical need for postoperative  
analgesic therapy. In current practice, analgesics are used as needed for at least several days and 
up to approximately 2 weeks for acute pain.  
9.3.3  Rationale for St udy Assessments  
PGA of study drug:  The PGA captures subjects’ perceptions of the study drug’s effectiveness in 
treating pain using a validated, single -item questionnaire.29 This study will use a 5 -point Likert 
scale (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent) for the PGA evaluation.30

Rescue medication may be used per the following guidelines:  
• Rescue medication for pain relief may be used prn any time after the first dose of study drug 
through Day 14, completion of study drug  treatment due to pain resolution, or study drug 
discontinuation (e.g., due to AE), whichever occurs first.  Subjects will continue to document 
rescue medication use through Study Day 14 or the EDV, whichever occurs first.  
• Subjects will be permitted to take  acetaminophen 650 mg/ibuprofen 400 mg q6h prn, up to a 
maximum of 2600 mg/1600 mg in any 24 -hour period.  
• No other analgesic medications (e.g., NSAIDs other than ibuprofen, opioids) are allowed 
from the start of the treatment period through the last dose of study drug.  
• A record (date and time of administration) will be kept of all rescue medication use.  
9.4.2  Additional Dietary Restrictions  
Surgical s ubjects  will abstain from all food and drink (except ≤8 fluid ounces per hour of water)  
from the time of surgery completion through 2 hours after the first dose of study drug ( Table  3-2 
and Table  3-4). After this period, study drug may be taken with or without food . 
Non-surgical subjects  will abstain from all food and drink (except ≤8 fluid ounces per hour of 
water) for 1 hour before through 2 hours after the first  dose of study drug  (Table  3-4). After this 
period, study drug may be taken with or without food . 
9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
• Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in the exclusion criteria 
(Section  8.2) and study restrictions (Section  9.4). 
• All medications taken within 14  days before the Screening Visit through completion of study 
participation will be recorded with indication, route of administration, and start and stop 
dates of administration. All medications administered in -clinic will  also be recorded with the 
time of each administration. Non-surgical subjects should provide the estimated time of 
administration for any medications taken on Day 1 before arriving at the medical facility.  All 
subjects will be questioned about medications at each visit or telephone contact . 
9.6 Administration  
VX-548 will be administered to all subjects q12h.  
Study drug will be administered according to the following guidelines:  
• Study drug will be administered orally with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water.  
• Subjects will swallow the study drug whole and will not chew it before swallowing.  
• The date and time of administration of each dose of study drug will be recorded.   
• Study drug must be administered following the dietary restrictions outlined in Table  9-1 and

without food.  
• Study drug will be administered after baseline vital signs and ECGs are performed.  
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 37 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  • Study  drug should be administered q12h , with a window of  ± 1 hour with respect to the most 
recent dose . For example, if the first dose of study drug is administered at 10:00 on Day 1, 
the next dose  should be administered between 21:00 and 23:00 on Day  1; if the second dose  
is taken at 21:00  on Day  1, the next dose  should be taken between 8:00 and 10:00  on Day  2. 
Depending on the timing of their visit and initial dose, t he subject may take either 1 or 
2 doses on Day 1 .  
o If a subject forgets a dose and exceeds the suggested window but remembers within 
an additional 4 hours beyond the +1-hour window , they will take the dose at that 
time.  
o If a subject forgets a dose and more than 5 hours have elapsed, they are to skip that 
dose and resume at the next scheduled dose  (i.e., a window of 24 hours ± 1 hour with 
respect to the prior dose before the one that was mi ssed) . 
• On the date of the Day 7 Visit and on Study Day 14  (if applicable ; Table  3-4), administration 
of a study drug dose should be timed so as to complete 4 -hour postdose ECGs at the visit 
(clinic or home health, as applicable). The visit should ideally be scheduled to occur  within 
approximately 4 hours after either the first or second planned daily dose of study drug, 
whichever is more convenient. If necessary for scheduling reasons, the subject may withhold 
a study drug dose for up to 3 hours after the planned dosing time p oint in order to align 
postdose ECGs with the scheduling visit timing.  
• Subjects who choose to  stop study drug before Day  14 may restart and stop 1  additional time 
per Section  9.1. For subjects who remain on treatment at Day 14, only 1 dose of study drug 
should be taken on that day, and it will be the last dose of study drug for these subjects.  
Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual . 
9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity  
No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual 
subjects will discontinue dosing (Section  9.1.5 ).

10.4 Drug Accountability  
The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information about the dates and 
amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug 
returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials 
associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to 
instructions provided by Vertex  or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug 
records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability 
system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, 
the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the 
drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly 
communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site.  
10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug  
The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until 
the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the 
materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional 
policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately 
documented.  
The principal investigator, study site staff, including pharmacy personnel will as sist Vertex with 
any recall activities (as applicable) and place impacted investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
in quarantine when requested.  
10.6 Compliance  
To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing 
that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel or approved home nurse will review that the 
subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing 
requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug co unt in the clinic or 
checked by home nurse during home visits.

Clinical laboratory assessments during screening must have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by the investigator, for a subject to receive study 
drug on Day  1. For non -surgical subjects, local laboratory results will be use d during screening; 
previous test results from the facility’s local laboratory may be used to establish eligibility if 
collected within 2 hours before ICF signing.  
Additional Screening Tests : The following additional tests will be performed at the Screenin g 
Visit and/or pre -procedure to assess eligibility:  
• Serology (surgical subjects only) : Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus 
antibody (HCV Ab), HCV RNA, and antibodies against human immunodeficiency viruses 1 
and 2 (HIV -1/HIV -2 Abs). Subje cts with detectable viral load will be excluded (Section  8.2). 
• Serum Follicle -stimulating Hormone (FSH) : Serum FSH will be tested at the Screening Visit 
for female subjects who are suspected to be postmenopausal (as defined in Section 11.5.6.1 ). 
For a subject to be considered of non -childbearing potential, the  serum FSH levels will be 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 42 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  within the laboratory range for postmenopausal females. For non -surgical subjects, a test 
result is not required for eligibility; however, until the test result is received, a subject will be 
considered to be of childbearing poten tial and must follow contraception requirements 
(Section 11.5.6.1 ) until postmenopausal status is confirmed.  
• Pregnancy Testing : Surgical subjects: All biologically female subjects will have a serum 
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) test during the S creening Visit. Female subjects 
of childbearing potential ( Section 11.5.6.1 ) will also have a urine β -hCG test before 
admission on Day 1. Both the serum and urine β -hCG test must be negative to receive study 
drug. Non-surgical subjects: All biologically female subjects will have a urine β -hCG test 
during the Screening Visit, which occurs on Day 1; the test must be negative to receive study 
drug.  
• Drug  and Alcohol Screening:  Drug screening for opioids, methadone, cannabinoids, cocaine, 
amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines will be assessed by a 
urine test at the Screening Visit and before admission on  Day 1; for non -surgical s ubjects, 
only 1 test is required because the Screening Visit is on Day 1.  Alcohol screening will be 
assessed before admission (surgical subjects) or treatment assignment (non -surgical subjects) 
on Day 1 by a urine, blood, or breath test. Subjects may under go random urine drug screen 
and alcohol testing if deemed appropriate by the investigator. Drug and alcohol screen results 
must be negative for a subject to receive study drug; a positive marijuana screen will only be 
exclusionary on Day  1. A positive drug  screen for a known prescribed concomitant 
medication that is not otherwise exclusionary (e.g.,  benzodiazepines) will not disqualify 
subjects.  
Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used, 
with the following exceptions:  
• Day 1 (pre -procedure, if applicable) drug and alcohol tests and urine β -hCG pregnancy tests 
will be a ssessed by staff onsite.  
• For non-surgical subjects , local laboratories will be used for safety laboratory tests at 
screening.  
• For surgical subjects , local laboratories may be used to repeat a screening assessment to 
determine eligibility on  Day 1 (pre -procedure)  if there is clear evidence of laboratory error 
(Section  9.1.1.1 ) in the central laboratory assessment.  
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of 
urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically 
significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator 
beco mes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the 
central laboratory (e.g.,  the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the 
assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value.  
11.5.3  Physical Examinatio ns and Vital Signs  
A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select 
study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs and symptom -directed vital signs assessments 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 43 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  can be performed at the discretion of the inve stigator or healthcare provider . If the Screening 
Visit occurs via home health (surgical subjects only), an abbreviated PE will be performed at 
screening and a complete PE will be performed on Day 1 . 
A PE includes a review of the following systems: head, n eck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and 
neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically 
indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as 
AEs.  
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: general; 
cardiovascular system; respiratory system; skin; and abdomen.  
A focused PE of the operative site (surgical subjects only) will be performed in order to assess 
wound healing.  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, respiration 
rate, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The subject will be instructed to rest (seate d or supine) for at 
least 5  minutes before vital signs are assessed.  
If there is an abnormal clinical assessment during a home visit, depending on its severity and at 
investigator discretion, the subject may be instructed to have a PE or other evaluation in the 
clinic.  
11.5.4  Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate using a machine with printout. Additional 
standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The 
performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  
• The ECG will be done before blood draws or any other procedures that may affect heart rate.  
• The subject will be instructed to rest (supine) for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG.  
• The test should be performed in the supine po sition.  
The acceptable window for the 4 -hour postdose ECG is ±  30 minutes relative to the scheduled 
nominal time.  
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained 
with source documentation. All traces will be c entrally evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. 
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety 
Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs.   
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will  make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the median  QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or the 
median  absolute QTcF value is ≥500  msec for any scheduled or unscheduled  ECG s (performed 
in triplicate) , 2 additional ECGs (performed in tripli cate)  will be performed approximately 2  to 
4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If the median  QTcF value from either of  
these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60  msec from baseline or ≥500  msec), 
the subject should  disconti nue dosing. For safety monitoring after discontinuation,  a single ECG 
will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below the 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.

The effects of VX‑548 on conception, pregnancy , and lactation in humans are not known. Refer 
to the VX‑548 Investigator’s Brochure for additional details.  
11.5.6.1  Contraception  
Study participation requires compliance with the contraception guidelines outlined below . 
Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  
• True abstinence for the subject. The subject must confirm that they will practice true 
abstinence from the Screening Visit through 30  days after the last dose of study drug. True 
abstinence is important to differentiate from p eriodic abstine nce (e.g.,  calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal , which  are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
• If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through 
examination of a semen s pecimen.  
• If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non -childbearing potential, 
the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria:  
o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH 
level within the laboratory ’s reference range for postmenopausal females  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy  
• Same biological sex relationships.  
For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived , study participation 
requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method  of contraception,  as 
outlined in  Table  11-2, is used as a couple  from the Screening Visit through 30  days after the last 
dose of study drug.

• Female hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least 60  days before the 
first dose of study drug, throughout study drug treatment, and until 3 0 days after 
the last dose of study drug  
• Male or female condom (with or without spermicide )c 
• Female barrier contraception (such as diaphragm, cervical cap, or sponge) with 
spermicide  
a Applicable to subjects and their non -study partners of the opposite biological sex for whom the contraception 
requirement is not waived. 
b Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not required. The subject must 
confirm that their partner has documented proof, and the subject’s confirmation should be documented.  
c Female condom cannot be used with male condom due to risk of tea ring.  
Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive methods listed in 
Table  11-2. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, 
and for 30  days following the last dose of study drug.  
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually  active at the time of screening must agree to 
follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a 
partner of the opposite biological sex.  
• Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not req uired.  
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.  
Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the 
Vertex medical monitor or designee on an individual basis.  
11.5.6.2  Pregnancy  
Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study 
treatment and for 90  days after the last dose of study drug.  
If a subject, or the female partner of a male subject, b ecomes pregnant while participating in the 
study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will

12.3.1  General Considerations  
All individual subject data for subjects who have received at least 1  dose of study drug will be 
presented in individual subject data listings.  
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptiv e summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most  recent non -missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For 
ECGs, the baseline value will be defined as the average of the non -missing pretreatment 
measurements (triplicate) on Day  1 before the first dose o f study drug.  
Change (absolute change) from baseline  will be calculated as Post-baseline  value  − Baseline 
value . 
Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  will include the time from the first dose of study drug to the 
Safety Follow -up Visit or to the completion of st udy participation (as defined in Section 9.1.7 ), 
whichever occurs first.

CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity 
Grading, and Reporting  
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
13.1.1.1  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly 
occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g.,  increase in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  13.1.2.1 .  
13.1.1.2  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline wi ll be documented as an 
AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the 
abnormal test result alone (e.g.,  urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 48 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  the abnormal study assessment itsel f will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin).  
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1  or more of 
the following:  
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study asses sment  
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study  
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the 
study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator.  
A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4  laborato ry value 
will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  
13.1.1.3  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected in source documents from the time the ICF is signed until completion 
of study participation (Section  9.1.7 ). 
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each 
study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs a nd/or symptoms will be identified as 
1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in source documents. 
AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be recorded only in the 
subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  
• Description of the event  
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
13.1.1.4  Adverse Event Severity  
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version  5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
May 2022). The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will 
be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.

ADL: activities of daily living; AE: adverse event  
Note: A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
13.1.1.5  Adver se Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table  13-2. 
Table  13-2 Classifications for AE Causality  
Classification  Definition  
Related  There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational 
study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational 
study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational stud y drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be 
related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative eti ology, 
such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.6  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-3.  
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 50 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  Table  13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE  
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Section 9.7 for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
13.1.1.7  Adverse Event Outcome  
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table  13-4. 
Table  13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE  
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or sy mptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
13.1.1.8  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will 
describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given 
in response to an AE and may include tre atments such as other medications, surgery, or physical 
therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE.  
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
13.1.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal (d eath, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study 
drug)  
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of de ath from the reaction as it 
occurred  
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 51 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption 
of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent  1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g.,  an allergic bronchospasm req uiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home)  
If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g.,  surgery) for an event or condition that 
occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned 
before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to 
indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner 
or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizat ions clearly not 
associated with an AE (e.g.,  social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE.  
Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “sev ere” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above and is usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not 
severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory repo rting obligations.   
13.1.2.2  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow -up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS within 24 hours o f 
identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of 
identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through  the Safety Follow -up Visit, the 
SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it 
becomes available to ensure ti mely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: globalpatientsafety@vrtx.com  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -617-341-6159  
For technical issues related to submi tting the form, contact telephone: +1 -617-341-6677  
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s)  will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred 
to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the 
event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relat ionship to the investigational study 
drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed 
Protocol VX22 -548-107, Version 2.0 Page 52 of 62 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  
 Confidential Information  only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity 
assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of 
regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to reso lution and 
report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form.

sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct  information in the CRFs on the 
subjects for which they are responsible.  
A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator’s responsibility to 
ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in t he subject’s 
CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’s participation in 
the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, 
and subject status.  
The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after 
information is collected.  
The audit trail entry will show the user’s identification information and the date and time of any 
correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all t he information in the CRFs, 
including any changes made to them, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for 
whom the investigator is responsible.  
Vertex will retain the CRF data  and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF  
will be placed in the investigator’s study  file. 
13.6 Confidentiality and Disclosure  
Any and all scientific, commercial, and technical information disclosed by Vertex in this 
protocol or elsewhere will be considered the confidential and proprietary property of  Vertex. The 
investigator shall hold such information in confidence and shall not disclose the information to 
any third party except to such of the investigator’s employees and staff as have been made aware 
that the information is confidential and who are bound to treat it as such and to whom disclosure 
is necessary to evaluate that information. The investigator shall not use such information for any 
purpose other than determining mutual interest in performing the study and, if the parties decide 
to proceed  with the study, for the purpose of conducting the study.  
The investigator understands that the information developed from this clinical study will be used 
by Vertex in connection with the development of the study drug and other drugs and diagnostics, 
and therefore may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators, business partners and 
associates, the FDA, and other government agencies. The investigator also understands that, to 
allow for the use of the information derived from the clinical stud y, the investigator has the 
obligation to provide Vertex with complete test results and all data developed in the study.

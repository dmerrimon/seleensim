If the participant’s HIV status is documented by an outside 
physician, the protocol team strongly recommends obtaining a copy of the HIV 
laboratory reports from this physician. All confirmatory tests and the physician’s note 
must be on file before the p articipant is enrolled. In the rare circumstance where only an 
outside physician’s note with no supporting laboratory documentation is available, the 
local site should have additional tests performed to verify the participant’s HIV status. 
One of the follo wing additional tests should be performed:  
 A rapid HIV test  
 ELISA and Western blot  
 Chemiluminescence immunoassay and Western blot  
 HIV RNA > 2000 copies/mL  
 HIV antigen test

AMC-072: Protective Effect of Quadrivalent Vaccine in Young HIV -positive Males  
who have Sex with Males  
 
 
DESIGN:  Open -label, phase 2, single -arm study  
DURATION:  2 years  
SAMPLE SIZE:  150 
POPULATION:  HIV-positive males who have sex with males 13 to 26 ye ars of age 
without AIN  
REGIMEN:  All participants will be vaccinated with the Quadrivalent Human 
Papillomavirus Recombinant  vaccine (0.5 mL Gardasil®) by 
intramuscular injection at Day 1, Weeks 8 and 24.  
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:  1) To determine the protective  effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 
vaccine in preventing penile/scrotal condyloma and HPV -6, -11, 
-16, -18- associated perianal/anal disease in HIV -positive males 
who have sex with males (MSM) age 13-26 years by comparing 
the incidence of these lesions am ong those naïve to the relevant 
HPV type(s) at baseline to those who are not naïve at baseline.  
2) To determine the protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 
vaccine in preventing persistent anogenital infection with HPV -
6, -11, -16, or 18 in HIV -posit ive MSM age 13 -26 years by 
comparing the incidence of persistent infection   among those 
naïve to the relevant HPV type(s) at baseline to those who are 
not naïve at baseline.  
3) To determine the protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 
vaccine in preventing anogenital lesions associated with HPV 6,-11,-16, -18 and persistent infection with these types, in HIV -
positive MSM age 13 -26 years by comparing the incidence of 
lesions and persistent infection among those naïve to the relevant 
types at baseline to  incident lesions and infection among MSM 
naïve to these HPV types who participated in the Merck 020 
protocol and who received placebo as part of the protocol.

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:  1) To define the safety of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in HIV -
positive MSM age 13 -26 years  
2) To evaluate the levels and persistence of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 
Ab titers after the vaccination series among subjects who are 
seropositive and seronegative f or those HPV types at baseline.  
3) To examine whether the protective effect and antibody titers 
vary as a function of the following at the time of initial 
vaccination: Subject age, HAART treatment status, HIV viral 
load, CD4 + T cell count, nadir CD4 level . 
 
TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:  1) To quantify anogenital HPV DNA viral load prior to and after 
receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
2) To identify and quantify HPV types in the oral cavity of HIV -
positive MSM prior to and after receipt of the quadrivalent HPV 
vaccine.  
3) To identify HPV strain variants among HIV -positive participants 
prior to and after receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
4) Assess the prevalence and incidence of urinary gonorrhea and 
Chlamydia trachomatis infection at baseline and their 
relationship with prevalent and incident anogenital HPV 
infection and anal condyloma or AIN. 
5) To characterize young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis after HPV vaccination.  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    13 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Human  papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus of which over 100 types have been identified. 
Approximately 30 types are sexually transmitted and infect the anogenital area of both men 
and women.(1) The lifetime risk for anogenital HPV infection among sexually active men and 
women is at least 50%. (2) 
 Anal HPV, AIN and anal carcinoma  
Anal carcinoma is strongly related to infection with high-risk types of HPV, as has been seen for cervical, vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancer.
(3) The incidence of anal cancer in men who  
have sex with men is estimated to be 35 cases/100,000 person-years.(4) This incidence is 
comparable to that observed for cervical cancer before the introduction of routine Papanicolaou screening. The rate of anal cancer is estimated to be twice as high in  HIV-
positive as in HIV -negative men who have sex with men.
(5) Several studies suggest that the 
incidence of anal cancer in HIV -positive men who have sex with men has increased in the era 
of highly -active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).(6,7) 
 Similar to ce rvical cancer, anal cancer is preceded by high- grade anal intraepithelial 
neoplasia (HGAIN). AIN is readily detected by anal cytology, and abnormal cytological results should prompt high resolution anoscopy and biopsy of areas suspicious for AIN. Areas of HGAIN can be treated with ablative therapy in an attempt to reduce the incidence of 
invasive cancer. The prevalence of cytological abnormalities among HIV -1-infected MSM 
has been estimated at 65%, and the prevalence of high-risk HPV at 78%.
(8) Approximatel y 
30% are positive by HPV DNA PCR for type 16, 20% for type 18, and 10% for both (Wilkin, 
personal communication). The majority of HIV -1-infected MSM have multiple types of high -
risk HPV detected by PCR. Among HIV -positive women, the prevalence of anal cyt ological 
abnormalities has been estimated at 26%, and the prevalence of HPV at 76%.(9) 
 
Response to recombinant protein vaccines in HIV -positive populations 
As the availability of potent antiretroviral regimens has increased the life expectancy and 
quality  of life of HIV -positive patients, vaccinations for preventable infections have 
increased significance. Poor responses to standard vaccination series have been documented 
in HIV -positive patients.(10-14) Meta -analysis of eight studies designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of hepatitis A vaccination in HIV -positive patients using the standard vaccination series 
revealed a low response rate.(13) The overall response rate for HIV -positive patients was 64% 
in a combined total of 458 subjects. Individual studies have yielded a lower proportion of 
patients achieving adequate hepatitis A antibody titers. In a small retrospective analysis, the 
hepatitis A vaccination response rate was only 48% compared with reported rates of 100% in 
HIV-negative patients.(15) 
 Compared with success rates of greater than 90% in immunocompetent hosts, HIV -positive 
patients respond to hepatitis B vaccination at rates of 17.5% – 56
%(11, 14, 16, 17) Strategies to 
improve the vaccination response rate include increasing the amount of the dose, the use of a 
four-dose  schedule, and the administration of booster vaccinations.(18, 19) In the HIV 
population, there is evidence to suggest that an adequate antibody response may not be 
sustained over time as expected. The use of a six -dose strategy that produced initial antibody

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  titers comparable to the immunocompetent population found that adequate hepatitis B 
antibody was maintained for only 59% of subjects one year after completion of the modified 
series .(20) 
 Investigators have analyzed patient -specific predictors associated with responders to both 
hepatitis A and B vaccination. The presence of low -level viremia has been consistently 
associated with failure to respond to hepatitis vaccination. In a logistic regression model, 
Overton, et al. showed that only HIV RNA level below 400 copies/mL at the ti me of hepatitis 
B vaccination was associated with a protective antibody response, while CD4+ count at time of vaccination was not found to be statistically significant.
(17) In HIV -positive children, an 
undetectable plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4+ T -cell percent greater  than 20% predicted 
response to hepatitis A vaccination.(21) Nadir CD4+ count has not  been shown to predict the 
development of protective antibody in HIV patients for either hepatitis A or B vaccination in 
any study to date.  
 
Gardasil® 
Gardasil® (Merck &  Co., Inc.) was approved by the FDA in June 2006 and is indicated in 
girls and women 9-26 years of age for the prevention of cervical cancer, genital warts, and genital precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 
11, 16, and 18. Gardasil protects recipients against 4 types of HPV, including the two types 
that cause most cervical cancers and the two types that cause most genital warts. It consists of virus -like particles generated by the expression of the major capsid pro tein L1 from HPV 
types 6, 11, 16, and 18 with an aluminum adjuvant. This vaccine targeting HPV types 6, 11, 
16, and 18 can substantially reduce the acquisition of infection and clinical disease caused by 
these types. The ACIP recommends that Gardasil be routinely given to girls when they are 11 
or 12 years of age, before people become sexually active (i.e., before women are exposed to the viruses). Gardasil can be administered as early as age 9 years, and can also be given to 
women 13 to 26 years old. Garda sil is to be given as a three dose series completed over 6 
months.  
 
For many viruses, an infection induces neutralizing antibodies that are a correlate of immune 
protection. HPV cannot be cultivated in tissue culture and true neutralization assays are not 
commercially available. Instead, capsid proteins of HPV produced in non-mammalian cells 
self-assemble into virus -like particles (VLP) and can be used as reagents in enzyme 
immunoassays.
(22) These VLP -based immunoassays and the scales for these assays are highly 
type-specific and thus, comparison across types and to other assays are not possible. (See  
Appendix III, Merck Gardasil Product Information ). 
 
Natural HPV infection induces a low level of antibody production that for most types does 
not seem to confer complete protection against subsequent type -specific HPV infection. 
Furthermore, it has not been possible to establish minimum antibody levels that protect 
against clinical disease. Viscidi, et al. evalu ated the prevalence of serum antibodies to HPV 
types 16, 18, 31, 35, and 45 in 829 HIV -positive and 413 HIV -negative risk -matched women 
enrolled in HERS and analyzed the association of seropositivity with risk of detection of 
HPV DNA in the genital tract d uring follow up. The seroprevalence of HPV 16 antibodies 
was 51.8% in HIV -positive women compared with 45.5% in HIV -negative women, and that 
of HPV 18 was 52.0% and 35.6% in HIV -positive and -negative women respectively.(23) 
There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of a new infection with the 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    15 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  homologous HPV type between HPV -seropositive and HPV seronegative women.(23) This 
suggests that natural HPV infection does not confer complete immunoprotection for most 
HPV types.  
 Almost all HIV -negative girls and women w ho received the Gardasil vaccine became HPV 6, 
11, 16, and 18 seropositive one month after the third vaccine dose (99.8%, 99.8%, 99.8%, 
and 99.5% respectively). The titers peaked at month 7 and stabilized through month 36 at 
levels above baseline. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the new quadrivalent HPV 
vaccine induces detectable serum titers against the HPV types included in the vaccine among 
HIV-positive adult men and to establish its safety in this population.  
 
Immunogenicity and efficacy r esults for quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and women 
Immunogenicity results of Protocol 007 showed that administration of a 3-dose regimen (0, 
2, 6 Months) of quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 VLP vaccine 20/40/40/20 mcg 
(Gardasil) generates robust anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses 4 weeks after the 
completion of the vaccination regimen and durable anti -HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses 2.5 
years following completion of the vaccination regimen. Efficacy results of Protocol 007 
showed that adminis tration of a 3 -dose regimen of Gardasil substantially reduced the risk for 
acquisition of persistent HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related infection or HPV 6-, 11-, 16-, or 18-related genital disease and substantially reduced the risk for development of a compos ite 
endpoint of HPV 6-, 11-, 16- or 18-related CIN or EGL.  
 Immunogenicity results of the Protocol 016 adult/adolescent substudy showed that for each 
of the 4 HPV types, the vaccine induced numerically higher HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 geometric 
mean titers (GMTs) 4 weeks Postdose 2 (Month 3) and 4 weeks Postdose 3 (Month 7) in 10 - 
to 15-year -old male and female subjects than in 16- to 23-year -old female subjects. 
Immunogenicity results of the Protocol 016 end expiry substudy showed that lower dose 
formulations of G ardasil induced anti -HPV responses at Month 7 that were statistically non-
inferior to those generated following administration of a 3-dose regimen.  
 Immunogenicity results from Protocols 013 and 015 have been consistent with Protocols 007 and 016 and have demonstrated ongoing vaccine immunogenicity for at least 24 Months 
post-vaccination that has correlated with demonstrable vaccine efficacy.  
 
In clinical trials, administration of a 3 -dose regimen of Gardasil to women naïve to the 
relevant vaccine HPV types , at Day 1 and the through the completion of the vaccination 
regimen, was over 90% efficacious in preventing the development of:  
• HPV 16 - and 18-related CIN 2/3 and adenocarcinoma in situ (obligate cervical cancer 
precursors);  
• HPV 16 - and 18-related vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) 2/3 and vaginal 
intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) 2/3 (obligate precursors to HPV -related vulvar and 
vaginal cancer, respectively;  
• HPV 6 - and 11-related external genital lesions (including condyloma acuminata);  
• HPV 6 -, 11-, 16-, and 18-related CIN; and  
• HPV 6 -, 11-, 16-, and 18-related persistent infection  
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    16 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  Efficacy studies of Gardasil in young HIV -negative men  
The FDA recently extended the approval of Gardasil for use in males ages 9 to 26 for the 
prevention of anal cancer c aused by HPV types 16 and 18, genital warts (condyloma 
acuminata) caused by HPV types 6 and 11, and anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grades 1, 2, and 3. However, data on the efficacy of Gardasil in young HIV -positive men is limited.  In 
bridging studie s the antibody response in adolescent boys appears similar to that of 
adolescent girls. In a recent clinical trial of Gardasil in HIV -negative boys and men aged 16 -
26 (Merck 020), unpublished data show that among those naïve to vaccine -specific HPV 
types, the vaccine was effective to prevent development of external genital condyloma 
acuminatum with an efficacy of 90%, and protection against persistent external genital 
infection with HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 ranged from 79% to 96%.  Nearly 100% of boys and 
men s eroconverted and the vaccine was well tolerated.   
Safety and tolerability results for quadrivalent HPV vaccine in women  
In clinical studies of GARDASIL™ about 25,900 people  received at least one shot of 
GARDASIL™. About 2000 people received at least one shot of a similar vaccine at higher or 
lower doses than GARDASIL™. Fourteen studies are still ongoing. In these studies, 
GARDASIL™ has been generally well tolerated. Among the reported serious vaccine -related 
side effects:  
 
Eight (8) people had serious side effects judged by the study doctor to be related to 
GARDASIL™.  
• Wheezing and shortness of breath (1 subject)  
• Upset stomach with vomiting or diarrhea (1 subject)  
• Disease of t he large bowel (called ulcerative colitis) starting 389 days after the third dose 
(1 subject)  
• Muscular weakness (1 subject)  
• Facial paralysis (1 subject)  
• Pain and joint stiffness (limiting movement) at the place where the study vaccine was 
injected (1 subje ct) 
• Vaginal bleeding that lasted on and off for up to 2 ½ months after each of two study 
vaccinations (1 subject)  
• Severe headache with high blood pressure on the day of a study vaccination that lasted 5 days and 1 day, respectively (1 subject)  
 
Common side effects occur in 1 or more out of 100 subjects.  The side effects judged to be 
related to study vaccine or placebo and seen more commonly among subjects who received GARDASIL™ than subjects who received placebo include:  
• Fever  
• Nausea  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Pain in extremity (pain in arm or leg)

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  Safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in HIV -positive  males and 
females  
A few studies have been performed of the safety and immunogenicity of the quadrivalent 
HPV vaccine in HIV -positive males and females.  The PACTG P1047 study has reported 
preliminary data indicating that the vaccine is well tolerated in adolescent HIV -positive boys 
and girls, with high HPV seroconversion rates, although the titers to HPV 6 and were lower 
than historical HIV -negative controls.  The vaccine has also been shown to be well -tolerated 
among HIV -positive MSM in AMC -052.   
 
1.2 Rationale  
The men most likely to benefit from this vaccine are those who are seronegative to HPV 6, 
11, 16 and 18, and who do not have those types detected by HPV DNA PCR. In addition, men who are seropositive to those types and PCR negative may benefit by “boosting” the 
humoral response to those types and preventing re -infection. Prior studies in HIV -positive 
women suggest that the humoral response associated with natural infection was not protective 
against re -infection. There are few data on the seropreva lence to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 
in HIV -positive MSM; none of which used the Merck assay. A study of 59 HIV -positive 
MSM found that 36% and 27% were seropositive for types 16 and 18, respectively.
(24) A 
second study of 154 HIV -positive MSM found that 42% were seropositive for type 16.(25) In 
the AMC 052 study of HIV -positive MSM, most of whom were over the age of 30 years, at 
baseline, 29% were positive for HPV 16 antibodies, 19% were positive for HPV 18  
antibodies, 38% were positive for HPV 6 antibodi es and 30% were positive for HPV 11  
antibodies.  Among HIV -positive women, approximately 50% were seropositive to type 16 
and 50% to type 18. Anal infection with high-risk HPV is extremely common among HIV -
positive MSM older than 20 years of age with a prevalence of 80%.   
 Not surprisingly, the prevalence of anal HPV infection and disease was lower among younger 
HIV-positive MSM.  In one study of young HIV -positive MSM, (Moscicki AB AIDS. 
2003;17:311 -20), 14% had anal HPV 16, none had HPV 18 DNA and 23% had HPV 6 and/or 
HPV11.   
 
Although the quadrivalent vaccine appears to be immunogenic and well tolerated in HIV -
positive individuals, no studies have been done yet on the protective effect of the vaccine in 
these populations regardless of their age.  The vaccine has been shown to be highly efficacious in HIV -negative populations to date, but the efficacy is restricted to those who are 
sero- or DNA-negative to a given HPV type.  Efficacy studies in HIV -positive individuals are 
hampered by the high prevalence of prior exposure to vacc ine HPV types, and an efficacy 
study among HIV -positive individuals would be best performed in a HIV -positive population 
with relatively limited prior exposure to HPV, but with a high risk of incident infection and 
disease within the period of the study.  The optimal study population to determine the 
protective effect of the vaccine among HIV -positive individuals is young (age 13-26) HIV -
positive MSM, and this group is the focus of the present study.  This study will evaluate the 
protective effect of develo ping type 16-, 18- 6- or 11-associated AIN or anal condyloma, as 
well as persistent infection with these types.  Because the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 
recently approved for use in boys by the FDA, a placebo control arm is not practical.  
Therefore in this study, all participants will be vaccinated, and the incidence of HPV 
infection and disease will be compare d between those with and without exposure to HPV at

1.3 Study Design  
A Phase II open-label, single arm study of the  safety and immunogenicity of HPV 
vaccination directed against types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in HIV -positive MSM aged 13 to 26 
years. Individuals will be screened with a liquid-based anal cytology and HPV DNA PCR. Eligible subjects must have no history of anal ca ncer or high-grade anal intraepithelial 
neoplasia.  Subjects are excluded if they have an anal cytology showing high-grade squamous 
intraepithelial lesion(s) (HSIL), atypical squamous cells cannot rule out HSIL (ASC-H) or 
cytology suggestive of carcinoma. At study entry, subjects will give samples for HPV DNA 
PCR, and HPV type -specific serologies. Subjects will receive the HPV vaccine on Day 1, 
Week 8 and Week 24. Subsequently, subjects will be seen for study visits through 24 months after entry (18 months after vaccination). HPV DNA PCR, liquid based anal cytology, high 
resolution anoscopy with biopsy and HPV serologies (types 6, 11, 16 and 18) will be 
obtained during study follow -up. 
 Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of grad e 3 or 4 events (Section 7.0). Routine liver 
function tests and chemistries will be obtained at screening and at Week 28, 4 weeks after 
completion of the vaccination series. Plasma HIV -1 RNA, CD4 cell count will be obtained at 
Baseline (study entry) and at Week 28. The immunogenicity will be assessed by comparing 
antibody titers to the four types at screening, 7 months, 12, 18 and 24 months post -
vaccination.

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  2.0 HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Hypothesis 
The protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in preventing anogenital disease 
associated with vaccine types will be significantly higher in HPV -seronegative and DNA -
negative HIV -positive MSM age 13 to 26 years vs. men who have evidence of prior exposure 
to vaccine HPV types, i.e. who are HPV -seropositive and/or DNA-positive for those types.   
 
2.2 Primary Objectives  
2.2.1 To determine the protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in preventing 
penile/scrotal condyloma and HPV -6, -11, -16, -18- associated peri anal/anal disease 
in HIV -positive males who have sex with males (MSM) age 13-26 years by 
comparing the incidence of these lesions among those naïve to the relevant HPV 
type(s) at baseline to those who are not naïve at baseline.  
 
2.2.2 To determine the protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in preventing  
persistent anogenital infection with HPV -6, -11, -16, or 18 in HIV -positive MSM age 
13-26 years by comparing the incidence of persistent infection  among those naïve to 
the relevant HPV type(s) at baseline to those who are not naïve at baseline..  
 
2.2.3 To determine the protective effect of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in preventing 
anogenital lesions associated with HPV 6,-11,-16, -18 and persistent infection with 
these types, in HIV -positive MSM age 13-26 years by comparing the incidence of 
lesions and persistent infection among those naïve to the relevant types at baseline to 
incident lesions and infection among MSM naïve to these HPV types who 
participated in the Merck 020 protocol and who received placebo as part of the protocol.  
  
2.3 Secondary Objectives  
2.3.1 To define the safety of the HPV -6, -11, -16, -18 vaccine in HIV -positive MSM age 
13-26 years.  
 
2.3.2 To evaluate the levels and persistence of HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 Ab titers after the 
vaccination series among subjects who are seropositive and seronegative at baseline.  
 2.3.3 To examine whether the protective effect and antibody titers vary as a function of the 
following at the time of initial vaccination: Subject age, HAART treatment status, 
HIV viral load, CD4 + T cell count, nadir CD4 level.  
 
2.4 Tertiary Objectives  
2.4.1 To quantify anogenital HPV DNA viral load prior to and after receipt of the 
quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
 
2.4.2 To identify and quantify HPV types in the oral cavity of HIV -positive MSM prior to 
and after receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    20 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  2.4.3 To identify HPV strain variants among HIV -positive participants prior to and after 
receipt of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
 
2.4.4  Assess the prevalence and incidence of u rinary gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis 
infection at baseline and their relationship with prevalent and incident anogenital 
HPV infection and anal condyloma or AIN. 
 
2.4.5 To characterize young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis  
after HPV vaccination.

persons). 
 
3.1.2 HIV-1 infection as documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV test 
performed in conjunction with screening (ELISA , Western blot or other approved 
test). Alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician 
has documented that the patient has HIV based on prior ELISA and western blot, or 
other approved diagnostic tests. If the participant’s HIV status is doc umented by an 
outside physician, the protocol team strongly recommends obtaining a copy of the 
HIV laboratory reports from this physician. All confirmatory tests and the physician’s note must be on file before the participant is enrolled. In the rare circu mstance where 
only an outside physician’s note with no supporting laboratory documentation is 
available, the local site should have additional tests performed to verify the 
participant’s HIV status. One of the following additional tests should be performed:  
 A rapid HIV test

3.4 Study Enrollment Procedures 
Prior to implementation of this protocol, sites must have the protocol and protocol informed 
consent form(s) approved by their local institutional review board (IRB).  
 
This study will be available for enrollment at all interested AMC and ATN sites that have 
been approved by the HPV Working Group. Approval will be based on the capacity to 
perform HRA. Sites must be registered with the AMC Operations and Data Management 
Center (ODMC) before they may enroll subjects.  
3.4.1 Registration for Screening  
After an informed consent form has been signed by the subject, the subject must be 
registered for screening (AMC-072, Segment A) on-line via the AMC 
AdvantageEDC
SM Internet Data Entry System. After successful registration into 
screening, the subject will receive a nine -digit subject ID and will then enter the 
screening process (Screening and Pre -entry visits).  
 
3.4.2 Enrollment  
After the screening evaluations have been obtained and the subject is determined to be eligible, the participating site will complete the protocol-specific eligibility 
checklist and enroll the subject into AMC-072 Segment B (on- line via the AMC 
Internet Data Entry System). Enrollment should occur no more than 72 hours prior to 
the initiation of vaccination. (Enrollment 1 day prior to or on the day of treatment is strongly encouraged). Once the eligibility checklist is submitted, a system generate d 
confirmation email will be sent to the enroller upon successful completion of the 
subject enrollment. If the on-line system is inaccessible, the site should notify the 
AMC ODMC (via email at amcpm@emmes.com
 or via phone at 301-251-1161) for 
further instructions.  
 
Subjects must be enrolled into AMC -072 Segment B prior to receiving the first 
vaccination.

antibody titers (i.e., screening and Weeks 28, 52, 78 and 104).  
 
Note:  If a prohibited medication is taken after completion of all HPV vaccination 
visits, contact the Protocol Chair(s) first to discuss premature discontinuation.  
 
4.4.3 Precautionary Medications  
It is encouraged that standard of care vaccinations are not offered during the 2 weeks 
preceding plasma HIV -1 RNA measurements, and that standard of care vaccinations 
are not administered at the same time as the study vac cine. Routine vaccinations other 
than influenza vaccine that are administered after enrollment in the study should be 
given 1 month before or after HPV vaccination (or any visit where antibody titers are 
measured) during the study period. Influenza vaccina tion may be given within 1 week 
before or after HPV vaccination visits.  
 
Initiation of antiretroviral therapy is not prohibited in this protocol for subjects who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy at study entry. Subjects should not be enrolled 
if they have known plans to initiate antiretroviral therapy prior to Week 28.

 5.0 CLINICAL AND LABORATORY EVALUATIONS  
5.1 Schedule of Evaluations 
Please see Appendix I, Schedule of Evaluations . 
 
5.2 Timing of Evaluations  
5.2.1 Screening and Pre -Entry  
Screening evaluations must occur prior to the subject starting any study medications, 
treatments, or interventions. 
 
Screening and pre -entry evaluations to determine eligibility must be completed 
within 45 days prior to study entry unless otherwise specified. The screening and pre -
entry visit may be combined.  
 
In addition to data being collected on subjects who enroll into the study, demogra phic, clinical, and laboratory data on screening failures (that are available) 
will be captured in a screening log.  
 
ACSR Samples  
Although it is optional, blood and fresh-frozen tissue obtained before the start of therapy and at Week 104 will be requested whenever possible for research purposes. 
This should be sent to the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) for 
donation (
Appendix XV ) and REQUIRES a separate consent form (and assent, if 
applicable). (See Appendix XIII  and Appendix XIV  for ACSR consent and ACSR 
assent forms).   
The ACSR tissue biopsy may be collected at week 104 even if a baseline ACSR 
tissue biopsy donation was not collected. The ACS R tissue biopsy may only be 
collected with the participant’s consent, if there are suspected lesions observed during HRA (i.e., not from normal areas), and must be a separate speci men from the 
diagnostic biopsy. 
 
It is expected that anal tissue donated to ACSR may be evaluated for HPV detection and typing, gene expression by microarray analysis and potentially other research 
assays as additional correlative science studies are developed. These evaluations will 
not be done in real time.  
 
5.2.2 On-Study Evaluations  
Evaluations must occur after subject registration. Study visits must be scheduled on 
the weeks indicated in the Schedule of Evaluations (
Appendix I ) ±7 days through 
Week 8. Study visits scheduled for Weeks 24 and 28 must be scheduled ± 10 days. 
Study visits scheduled for Weeks 52, 78 and 104 must be scheduled ±28 days. 
Telephone follow -up (Section 5.3.11) must occur within 24-48 hours post vaccination 
at Day 1, Week 8, and Week 24.  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    28 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  Effort should be made to keep subjects  on the proper vaccination schedule (Day 1, 
Week 8 ± 7 days, and Week 24 ± 10 days). If subjects cannot be seen within the 
protocol specified windows, then these visits may be conducted outside the window 
and the subsequent vaccination visit should be adjust ed. For example, if vaccine dose 
#2 is delayed from Week 8 to Week 10, all subsequent visits should be delayed by 2 weeks so that vaccine dose #3 will occur at Week 26 (Week 24 + 2 weeks). The Protocol Chair(s) and AMC ODMC should be notified of these prot ocol deviations 
and the site must complete a Protocol Deviation Form documenting all protocol deviations.  
 The Week 28 visit will collect samples for the primary immunogenicity endpoint. This visit should be conducted 30 days (+/ - 10 days) after the third vaccination. If a 
subject’s third vaccine (i.e., Week 24 visit) was delayed until Week 27, then the Week 28 visit should be conducted 30 days after the third vaccine (approximately 
Week 31 in this example). All subsequent visits after the primary immunogenicity 
endpoint (Weeks 52, 78 and 104) should occur according to the original planned schedule.  
 
Study Entry  
Entry evaluations must occur at least 24 hours after screening evaluations and within 45 days of screening evaluations. Evaluations must be done pri or
 to the subject taking 
any study treatment. Subjects must begin study treatment within 72 hours after 
registration.  
 
5.2.3 Evaluations for Subjects Who Do Not Start Study Treatment  
Registered subjects who withdraw from the study prior to starting study t reatment 
should have screening, study entry, and off -study forms completed and keyed. No 
further follow -up is required for these subjects. 
 
5.2.4 Premature Treatment Discontinuation Evaluations  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment will be a sked to continue in 
the study in an off -treatment/on -study status and receive all study evaluations per the 
schedule of evaluations through to completion of the study. No extra evaluations are 
required at the time of the treatment discontinuation. The Off -Treatment Form should 
be completed.  
 
5.2.5 Premature Study Discontinuation Evaluations  
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study will have the premature study 
discontinuation evaluations indicated in the schedule of evaluations performed prior 
to being taken off the study. The Off -Treatment and Off -Study Forms should be 
completed.  
 
5.3 Special Instructions and Definitions of Evaluations 
All clinical and laboratory information required by this protocol is to be present in the source 
documents. All data requested by the study should be recorded in the source documents. All

outside physician, the protocol team strongly recommends obtaining a copy of the 
HIV laboratory reports from this physician. All confirmatory tests and the physician’s 
note must be on file before the participant is enrolled. In t he rare circumstance where 
only an outside physician’s note with no supporting laboratory documentation is 
available, the local site should have additional tests performed to verify the 
participant’s HIV status. One of the following additional tests should be performed:

5.3.5 Nadir CD4+ Cell Count  
The subject’s prior nadir CD4+ cell count (absolute value and date) should be 
documented, when possible, with a copy of the nadir CD4+ cell count report and 
entered on the CRF. If this documentation is not available, then subject recollection will suffice. For subjects who do not know the exact nadir value and for whom there 
is no source documentation, then recal l of the categorical nadir (e.g., <50, <100, <200 
cells/mm
3) will suffice.  
 
5.3.6 Complete Physical Exam  
This should be documented in the source documents only. This examination includes 
at a minimum an examination of the skin, head, mouth, and neck; auscultation of the 
chest; cardiac exam; abdominal exam; examination of the lower extremities for 
edema; and Karnofsky performance test. The complete physical exam will also include signs and symptoms, height, weight, diagnoses, and vital signs (temperature, 
pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure).  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    31 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  5.3.7 Clinical Assessments  
Targeted Physical Exam  
This should be documented in the source documents only. A targeted physical 
examination is to include vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood 
pressure) and is to be driven by any previously identified or new signs or symptoms 
including diagnoses that the subject has experienced since the last visit. The 
vaccination site should be examined for erythema, swelling, tenderness or lumps up 
to Week 28. Staff should inquire about symptoms and examine the relevant areas, as 
indicated. Staff should inquire specifically about signs and symptoms of muscle aches, skin rashes, pruritus or redness.  
 
The penis, scrotum and perianal area will be examined for signs of HPV -related 
lesions. The presence or absence of penile/scrotal/perianal condyloma will be 
recorded on the CRFs. Anal cytology and HRA with biopsy of visible disease will be 
performed to assess anal HPV -associated disease. Sampling of the penis /scrotum, 
perianal area and the anal canal for HPV DNA and other sexually transmitted agents 
will be performed. HRA and anal cytology are required assessments at baseline and 
Week s 28, 52, 78, and 104. Only v isual inspection of the penis, scrotum, and pe rianal 
area are required  at Week 8 and Week 24.  
 Staff should inquire about symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases such as genital 
ulcer, dysuria, penile discharge, rectal pain or discharge, rash or sore throat. Staff 
should provide subjects  with counse ling and condoms to avoid acquisition of sexually 
transmitted diseases or new strains of HIV, and to avoid spread of HIV infection at each visit.  
 
Signs and Symptoms  
All signs and symptoms that begin during or after the entry visit should be recorded 
in the CRF regardless of grade. Any signs and symptoms that began prior to the entry 
visit should be recorded only if there is a significant worsening of the sign or 
symptom. After Week 32, only signs or symptoms ≥ grade 3 or signs and symptoms 
that are possibl y, probably or definitely related to st udy vaccine should be recorded.  
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE Version 4.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event reporting) for grading of clinical or laboratory events. (See Section 
7.0) 
 
Diagnoses  
Record all diagnoses identified by the CTCAE  Version 4.0 criteria (see Section 7.0 
for details) for clinical events and other diseases. Furthermore, any diagnosis of a 
cellulitis, abscess , or other infection at the vaccination site should be recorded.  
 
Vaccine Report Card  
Subjects should be given a Vaccine Report Card ( Appendix XI ) to take home and fill 
out after each vaccination. The subject should record an oral temperature 4 hours 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    32 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  after vaccination and then daily for 4 more da ys.  They should indicate whether 
redness, swelling, or pain or tenderness has occurred 4 hours after vaccination and 
then daily for 4 more days. They should record any adverse event for up to 15 days 
after vaccination to include local and systemic reactio ns. They should be instructed to 
contact the study nurse for any fever or moderate/severe symptoms. The nurse will 
call them within 24 -48 hours of vaccination. The subject should be instructed to 
return the Vaccine Report Card at the next visit following e ach vaccination (Weeks 8, 
24 and 28).  
 
5.3.8 Laboratory Evaluations (See Appendix I  for timing of evaluations.)  
This study will utilize the CTCAE Version 4.0 for Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event reporting. Record all Grade ≥  2 laboratory values (except for CD4 cell 
counts) as AEs. All laboratory toxicities that led to a change in treatment, regardless 
of grade, must be recorded. 
• Hematology - CBC with differential  
• Liver Function Tests - AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and total bilirubin  
• Anal cytology (See Appendix V , Anal Cytology Sampling Procedures)  
• Anal HPV DNA PCR (See Appendix VI , HPV DNA PCR Specimen Collection 
and Shipping)  
• HPV strain variant analysis among those who are positive for these types in more 
than one sample at any visit or over time.  
• HPV 16, 18, 31, 6 or 11 DNA quantitation using quantitat ive PCR before and 
after vaccination among those who are HPV -positive at baseline.  
• High resolution anoscopy (HRA) (See Appendix VII ) 
• Oral testing for HPV DNA (See Appendix VIII ) 
• Urine specimens for GC and Chlamydia using nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (performed locally at sites)  
• Penile, scrotal and perianal area sampling for HPV DNA PCR  
• AIN or condyloma biopsies diagnosed during the study will be analyzed for the presence of HPV DNA using PCR.  
 
5.3.9 Immunologic Studies  
To document eligibility for those subjects who are not on antiretroviral therapy, CD4+ level must be equal or greater than ≥350 cells/mm
3 within 90 days prior to 
study entry from a laboratory that possesses a CLIA certification or equivalent. CD4+/CD8+ will be obtained from all subjects within 90 days prior to study entry 
and at Week 28. 
 
Serum HPV antibody testing  
A serum sample will be drawn for HPV antibody testing as well as storage for future 
testing. The HPV  antibody test will be performed by the Merck Research Laboratory. 
Please refer to Appendix IX  for information regarding HPV antibody specimen 
collection and shipping procedures.  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    33 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  5.3.10 Virologic Studies  
Plasma HIV -1 RNA  
On-study plasma HIV -1 RNAs will be done in real time. Plasma HIV viral load will 
be obtained within 90 days prior to study entry and at Week 28.  
 
5.3.11 Telephone Follow -Up 
Each subject (or legal guardian) will be contacted by the study nurse by telephone 24 
to 48 hours following each vaccination to determine if any side effects have occurred. 
Information from the telephone contact will be recorded. If a subject experiences any 
side effects (including fever) that are grade 3 or 4, or if he has edema (swelling), 
erythema (redness), or induration of grade ≥ 2, the subject should be scheduled to 
come into the clinic as soon as possible, for an evaluation that includes a targeted 
physical examination focused on the area involved.  
 
5.3.12 Smoking Status/Recent Sexual History /Ri sk Perception And Knowledge 
Questionnaire  
Each subject will be given a Questionnaire to determine their smoking status, recent 
sexual history and risk perceptions about HPV after  receiving each vaccination (Day 
1, Week 8 and Week 24) and at Weeks 52, 78 and 104 (See Appendix I ). Sites should 
ensure that the Questionnaire includes the subject’s 9-digit study number prior to 
giving the Questionnaire to the subject. Subjects will fill out the Questionnaire, place 
the completed Questionnaire in an envelope and seal it. Site should mail completed 
Questionnaires to:

5.4 Dose Modification/Toxicity Management 
5.4.1 Management of Injection Site and Allergic Reactions  
 Local and systemic reactions will be graded according to the CTCAE Version 4.0 for 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event reporting. 
 
5.4.1.1 Injection Site Reactions  
• Swelling or redness at the injection site  
• Pain or tenderness, or other reactions at the injection site  
 
For injection site reactions judged to be severe, the safety review team should 
be notified within 24 hours and further vaccines should not be given to that 
subject prior to consultation with Protocol Chair/Co -chairs. 
 
For injection site reactions judged to be life -threatening, the safety review 
team should be notified within 24 hours and no additional va ccinations shall 
be given to that subject.  
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    34 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014   
5.4.1.2 Systemic Reactions occurring within 48 hours after vaccination  
• Fever or chills  
• Malaise or fatigue  
• Headache or pain (e.g., myalgias or arthalgias)  
• Nausea or vomiting  
• Allergic reactions  
 
The safety review team should be contacted within 24 hours for any systemic 
grade 3 or 4 reactions (e.g., elevated temperatures following vaccination) 
thought definitely, possibly, or probably related to vaccination. Further 
vaccines should not be given to that subject prior to consultation with the 
Protocol Chair/Co-chairs.  
 Subjects who are allergic to yeast or to any component of the vaccine 
should not receive quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
 Clinically significant adverse reactions and other problems related to vaccines 
will be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), 
which is maintained by the FDA and CDC (http://vaers.hhs.gov/). 
 
5.4.2 Other Adverse Events  
For toxicities not specifically addressed above, the following guidelines should be 
used for the  management of AEs:  
 
Grade 1 or 2 Toxicity/AE  
Subjects who develop a grade 1 or 2 AE may continue study vaccine. For instructions 
regarding subjects experiencing grade 1 or 2 AEs who choose to permanently 
discontinue study treatment or study participation, see Sections 5.2.4 and 5.2.5. 
 
Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity/AE  
Subjects who develop a grade 3 or 4 AE should be reevaluated for that toxicity until 
the AE returns to grade ≤ 2. The study vaccine may be given at the discretion of the 
site investigator. If the same grade 3 or 4 AE recurs and is considered by the investigator to be possibly related to the study vaccine, the study vaccine must be permanently discontinued. If, in the investigator’s opinion, the AE has NOT been 
caused by the study vaccine or if the eve nt is an asymptomatic laboratory 
abnormality, study treatment may continue.  
 
For instructions regarding subjects experiencing grade 3 or 4 AEs that result in permanent discontinuation of study vaccine or study participation, see Sections 5.2.4 
and 5.2.5. T hese subjects should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE. 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    35 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  6.0 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUATION

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
The CTEP Version 4.0 of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTEP Version 4.0 of the CTCAE is 
identified and located on the CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocol  
Development/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. All appropriate treatment areas should have 
access to a copy of the CTEP Version 4.0 of CTCAE. 
 
This study will be mo nitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS). Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  
 
7.1 Classification of AEs by Severity and Relationship to Study Vaccine Administration  
Adverse Event  
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom 
or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or  procedure regardless 
of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event  
Any AE that places the patient or subject, in view of the investigator, at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -
threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospit alization, a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, in the Investigator’s opinion, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Please note for hospitalization –  All hospitalizations (or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization) for medical events equi valent to CTCAE Grade 3, 4, 5 must be reported 
regardless of the requirements for Phase of study, expected or unexpected, and attribution. For example, do not report an admission for pharmacokinetic sampling, but do report an admission for a myocardial inf arction.  
 Toxicity  
Toxicity is a term NOT clearly defined by regulatory organizations. Toxicity has been described as an AE that has an attribution of possibly, probably or definitely related to 
investigational treatment. To minimize confusion the NCI would recommend that the term 
toxicity NOT be utilized for AE reporting purposes. The CTCAE continues to use the term ‘toxicity’ because of familiarity.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
Any AE that is not listed in the package insert, protocol, or informed consent f orm.

An electronic system for expedited submission of AE reports. 
 
Attribution  
The determination of whether an AE is related to a medical treatment or procedure. 
Attribution categories:  
Definite  The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent(s). 
Probable  The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
Possible  The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s). 
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s).  
 
7.2 Routine Reporting of AEs with Investigational Agents/VAERS  
An investigational agent is one being studied under an Investigational New Drug Application 
(IND). In some instances, a  commercial agent may also be considered investigational when 
used under an IND.  
 
All AEs, regardless of severity, and whether or not ascribed to the study vaccine 
administration, will be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF. After Week 32, only 
SAEs and AEs or symptoms >  grade 3 or symptoms that are possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to the study vaccine should be recorded. Subjects withdrawn from the study due to 
AEs will be followed by the Investigator until the outcome is determined and , when 
appropriate, additional written reports and documentation will be provided.  
 
AEs reported through CTEP -AERS  must also  be reported in routine study data submissions.  
 Clinically significant adverse reactions and other problems related to vaccines wil l be 
reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is maintained by the FDA and CDC (http://vaers.hhs.gov/ ). 
 
7.3 Expedited AE Reporting  
7.3.1 Expedited AE Reporting through CTEP -AERS  
Expedited AE reporting for this study will occur via CTEP -AERS  (Adverse Event 
Reporting System) accessed via the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) 
home page. (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Expedited reporting requirements are outlined in 
the table below. CTEP -AERS  is programmed for automatic electroni c distribution of 
reports to the following individuals: Protocol Study Chair, Principal Investigator at 
the local AMC treating institution, and AMC Operations Center. CTEP -AERS  
provides a copy feature for other e -mail recipients. All reported SAEs will be 
reviewed by the Protocol Chair to determine if further action is necessary.  
 
A 24 -hour notification is to be made to the AMC ODMC by telephone at 301-251-
1161, only when Internet connectivity is disrupted.  Once Internet connectivity is 
restored, an AE report submitted on a paper template must be entered electronically into CTEP -AERS  by the original submitter at the site.

AMC #072 (Version 5.0) 05 /02/2014   39 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 8.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
8.1 General Design Issues 
The sample size considerations are based on estimation of the incidence of HPV 
infection/anogenital disease. This is an open-label trial in which the beneficial effects of the 
vaccine are expected to be limited to those who are naive to one or more of the HPV vaccine types.  Analyses will be conducted for HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 separately. The study will 
evaluate the impact o f vaccination on anogenital disease associated with vaccine HPV types: 
anogenital disease is defined as intra -anal and external ano-genital lesions further defined as 
low-grade (condyloma/intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1) and high-grade lesions 
(intraepit helial lesions grades 2-3)  
 
The incidence of HPV infection/anogenital disease will be estimated in four groups based on 
all four types combined and on a type -specific basis:  
1) Seronegative/DNA negative 
2) Seronegative/DNA positive  
3) Seropositive/DNA nega tive 
4) Seropositive/DNA positive  
 Our plan is to administer the vaccine to all study participants. The power estimates are based 
on an anticipated incidence of HPV -associated disease without vaccine and determining 
whether we can detect a lower rate with the vaccine. If we assume hypothetically that the 
incidence of persistent HPV infection w/o vaccine is 10 per 100 PY and the expected 
incidence of HPV -associated disease is 5 per 100 PY, then the attached table shows the effect 
size and associated lower ra te of infection that can be detected with the anticipated numbers 
of patients for a “per protocol” population for each HPV type. No adjustments were made for the fact that we are looking at four distinct HPV types.  
 
8.2 Endpoints  
8.2.1 Primary Endpoints  
• Any incident AIN or anal/perianal condyloma associated with HPV 16, 18, 6 or 
11 DNA (as determined by PCR analysis of the anal tissue biopsy). No biopsies 
will be taken of penile/scrotal lesions and incident penile/scrotal condyloma will 
be considered an e ndpoint if associated with a positive penile/scrotal sample for 
HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18 DNA at the same visit.  
• Diagnosis of HGAIN related to vaccine HPV types at any time during the study is also a study endpoint.  Subjects with HGAIN should be treated but should remain 
in follow -up during the study per the routine study calendar.  
• Any persistent anogenital infection with HPV 16, 18, 6 or 11 DNA, defined as 
having positive PCR results with a specific HPV type at 2 or more consecutive 
visits. Persistent HPV DNA  positivity is defined as detection of the same HPV 
type in any of the samples at a given visit over at least 2 consecutive visits.  To be considered eligible for analysis at least one of the specimens at a given visit must 
be positive for beta -globin DNA.   
 
8.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    40 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  • Occurrence of grade ≥ 3 AEs that are possibly, probably or definitely related to 
the vaccine.  
• Longitudinal changes in plasma HIV -1 RNA and CD4+ cell count from Baseline.  
• Level of HPV antibodies to types 6, 11, 16 and 18, at Bas eline, one month after 
the completion of HPV vaccination series and Weeks 52, 76 and 104.  
 
8.2.3 Tertiary Endpoints  
• Level of HPV DNA before and after vaccination.  
• Type and level of HPV DNA in the oral cavity  
• HPV strain variation before and after receipt of  the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.  
• Baseline prevalence and incidence of penile gonorrhea and Chlamydia infection.  
• Change in young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis 
after HPV vaccination.  
 
8.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
Based on the existing literature among young HIV -positive MSM (Moscicki AB AIDS. 
2003;17:311 -20) it was assumed that the baseline prevalence of HPV 16 DNA would be 14% 
DNA-positive, and an additional 14% was estimated to be seropositive.  Therefore 72% would be eligible for PPE analysis.  For HPV18, we assumed 0% to be DNA -positive and 
10% to be seropositive, therefore 90% would be eligible for PPE analysis.  HPV 6 and HPV 
11 were presented combined in the paper at a total of 23%.  We can assume for our purposes 
that each was found at 16% for 6 and 8% for HPV 11.  Assuming another 16% and 8% to be 
seropositive for 6 and 11, respectively, therefore we assume that 68% would be available for 
PPE analyses for HPV 6  and 84% for HPV 11.  
 
Data on incidence HPV inf ection or disease are available on the placebo group from the 
Merck 020 study. The vaccine will be considered to have a preventive effect if it reduces the 
anticipated incidence of HPV infection/anogenital disease by 75% overall in the study 
population.  
 
It is anticipated that 150 patients will be recruited and followed for two years for a total of 
300 person-years.  The ITT Merck placebo rates were used to determine the number of events 
(HPV -type specific AIN or persistent infection) that are expected wit h 200 person-years.  If 
the vaccine has a 75% efficacy rate, then the number of events expected on the vaccine would be 25% of that expected using the Merck rates.  Using the normal approximation to the Poisson distribution with the standard deviation base d on the Merck rate (conservative 
approach), there will be 99% power to detect the following differences at the one -sided 0.10 
significance level with 150 patients followed for 2 years.

 It is anticipated that there will be 100 HPV -type naïve patients for each HPV type.  If the 
vaccine has a 75% protective effect, then the following table shows the upper the estimated 
upper bound of the 90% confidence interval for the incidence of HPV -specific AIN and 
persistent infection.

To determine if there will be sufficient numbers of HPV -naïve patients for each type, the 
study team will review the distribution of HPV types after a total of 100 patients have enrolled in the study.  If it appears that for any of the HPV types, that there will be fewer than 
67% of the patients that are naïve to that type, an amendment may be submitted to increase 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    42 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  the number of patients to ensure that there are 100 naïve patients  per type. At the time of the 
amendment the scientific rationale for the sample size increase (including the use of the 
Merck Placebo data as historical control) will be re -evaluated.  
 
8.4 Safety Analysis  
Regarding safety, the adverse event rate will be as sessed for the combined groups, and will 
include all subjects who receive at least one dose of study vaccine. We will report the adverse 
event rate as defined by 8.2.2 with a corresponding upper bound of a one -sided 95% 
confidence interval. With 100 evalua ble patients, if no more than eight patients experienced 
an adverse event as defined by Section 8.2.2, the upper bound of the one -sided 95% 
confidence interval for the AE rate would be below 15%. There is 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the AE  rate is 6.5%. All safety endpoints will be reviewed by a team of 
AMC and ATN medical monitors. The final adjudication for the relationship to vaccine 
(unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite) will be made by this team. We will also 
report the  adverse event rate and corresponding confidence interval for adverse events 
regardless of attribution to study vaccine.  
 We will also report injection site reactions and systemic reactions specified in Section 5.4.1.1 
and 5.4.1.2 of all grade.   
 
8.5 Mon itoring  
The study will be reviewed at least quarterly by a team of AMC and ATN medical monitors . 
The study team will receive monthly reports on accrual and study conduct, and the NCI Clinical Representative will review a safety report every 3 months. 
The first AMC/ATN Medical Monitor team review will be after the first 30 subjects have 
reached Week 28. The AMC/ATN Medical Monitor team will be provided data on accrual, 
retention, and occurrence of adverse events as defined by the secondary endpoints.  
 
The occurrence of at least two adverse events as defined by Section 8.2.2 or a single grade 4 
or 5 adverse event that is at least possibly related to study vaccine will cause the study to halt enrollment and further vaccinations. The study will restart only af ter a review of available 
safety data and SAE reports by the safety review team.  If consensus about restarting the study is not reached among these members, then the decision will be made by the AMC Executive Committee. This process will be repeated after  every 2 adverse events as defined 
by Section 8.2.2 or after each grade 4 or 5 adverse event that is at least possibly related to study vaccine.  
 
8.6 Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Analyses  
8.6.1 Primary  
The primary analysis of the study on incident AIN or condyloma will be performed among those who are naïve to a given HPV type and who complete the vaccination series per protocol, compared with subjects who are not naïve. Specifically, we will 
report the prevalence of anal condyloma or AIN at weeks 28, 52, 76 and 104. To be 
counted as a case, the anal biopsy must be positive for HPV 6, 11 16 or 18 DNA. No 
penile/scrotal biopsies will be taken and a case of incident penile/ scrotal condyloma 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    43 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  will be defined as clinical diagnosis of condyloma along with a positive HPV DNA 
result from the penile/scrotal specimen on the same day for one or more of the four 
HPV vaccine types. One set of primary analyses will be performed combining all 
cases positive for HPV 16, 18 and 6 or 11.  Another set of analyses will be done on 
HPV 16, HPV 18 and HPV 6- or 11-associated lesions individually.   
 
The primary analysis on prevention of persistent anal HPV infection will be 
performed among those who are naïve to a given HPV type and who complete the 
vaccination series per protoc ol, compared with subjects who are not naïve.  A 
combined endpoint of persistent HPV 16, 18, 6 or 11 will be analyzed, as will 
persistent anal HPV 16, HPV 18 and HPV 6 or 11 individually.   
 We will obtain all available abnormal cytology and histology slid es (pre -entry and 
post-entry) and 10% of normal cytology slides for central pathology review.  A 
revised rate of incident condyloma or AIN after vaccination will be reported excluding those subjects with pre -existing high grade AIN at pre -entry or week 28 as 
judged by central review.  
 
Using the incidence rates of HPV 6/11/16/18 - related AIN and anal cancers, 
persistent infection and DNA detection from the placebo group of a recently 
completed study (REF) in a Poisson distribution, the probability of detecting the 
results from the current trial will be estimated to determine if they are consistent with 
the previously reported placebo rates.  It is anticipated that these analyses will be 
done for each HPV type. For the analysis of AIN and anal cancers, analyses will also 
be performed by lesion type.  A one -sided significance level of 0.10 will be used for 
this analysis.   No adjustments for multiple testing are planned.  
 
8.6.2 Secondary  
The safety analysis on the study AEs described in the primary endpoint will be performed according to section 8.4. For a safety analysis, the rate of AEs of grade 2 or higher will be estimated with a one -sided 95% CI. In addition, the changes in HIV 
RNA and CD4+ count from baseline at the scheduled measurement times will be  
summarized for all the subjects.  
 Detectable Ab response at Week 28 will be performed by HPV type (6, 11, 16 and 18) on the subjects who are seronegative and HPV DNA PCR-negative for that type 
at baseline and complete the vaccination series per protocol. The type-specific Ab 
response rates will be estimated with one -sided 95% CI’s to specify the lower 
bounds. A secondary analysis will include only those subjects who are HPV DNA PCR negative at entry and Week 28.  
The antibody response will also be analyzed on all study subjects who are 
seronegative for that type at baseline, as an intent -to-treat analysis. In addition, the 
Ab titer (as a continuous measure) at the scheduled times will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics for the subjects who are seron egative at baseline, for each HPV 
type (6, 11, 16, 18). Also, the Ab titer changes from baseline will be summarized for each of the four HPV types, for the subjects who are seropositive for that type at  
 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    44 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  baseline. We will also describe the antibody response among subjects who are HPV 
DNA PCR positive at baseline.  
 
A logistic regression model will be developed to assess the effect of baseline and 
nadir CD4+ count, and age on Ab response to type 16 or 18 - depending on the 
baseline serostatus - using all stu dy subjects. Note that subjects who initiate, 
discontinue, or modify antiretroviral therapy during the trial will not be excluded from these analyses.  
 
8.6.3 Tertiary  
Incident infections will be defined as HPV infections found after Week 28 with no 
evidenc e for prior infection: the type was not present at screening, entry or Week 28; 
and subjects were seronegative for that type at entry. We will also report 
reactivations/reinfections defined as HPV infections found after Week 28 that were 
not present at Wee k 28 among subjects with a prior history of that HPV type: 
presence of that type at screening or entry; or seropositivity at entry. For each HPV 
type, the proportion of study participants were develop a new HPV infection and the proportion who report react ivations/reinfections will be estimated using the binomial 
proportion and its 95% confidence interval. We will also describe the cytological and 
histological abnormalities observed at baseline.  
 
In tertiary analyses, we will the use descriptive statistics  to characterize changes in 
the level of anogenital and oral  HPV types 16, 18, 31, 6 and 11 at screening, entry 
and at all other time points at which DNA is collected. Significant changes will be 
defined as those more than one -half log difference from the  previous specimen. 
 
We will also describe the ongoing sexual exposure to HPV in the study population. 
Specifically, we will report the total number of sex partners (male and/or female), 
receptive anal sex partners, and active oral sex partners at study entry and every 6 
months thereafter. In exploratory analyses, we will correlate these variables with incident HPV infections in the mouth and anus.   
 
We will perform HPV strain variant analysis of samples positive for HPV 16, 18 and 
31 at more than one visi t to determine if the same variant is present in different 
anatomic locations and over time at the same location.   
 
We will assess the prevalence of urinary gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis 
infection at baseline and at all visits where samples are coll ected for GC and 
Chlamydia, and their relationship with prevalent and incident anogenital HPV infection and anal condyloma or AIN. 
 
We will determine the effect of vaccination on young men’s risk perceptions, sexual behaviors, and STI diagnosis. Participants will fill in the risk perceptions and 
knowledge survey (
Appendix XII ).  Descriptive analyses will characterize subjects’ 
risk perceptions, knowledge about HPV, sexual behaviors (e.g., condom use with 
sexual interco urse, number of sexual partners over prior 3 months) at study entry 
(immediately after vaccine dose #1), Week 8 (after vaccine dose #2), Week 24 (after 
vaccine dose #3), Week 52, Week 78, and Week 104. 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    45 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014   
Univariate analyses will be conducted to determine wh ether subject characteristics 
and HPV knowledge are associated significantly with risk perceptions after vaccine 
dose #1, and also whether knowledge and risk perceptions immediately post -
vaccination are associated significantly with sexual behaviors or STI  diagnosis at 
each of the follow -up visits.  
 
In order to determine whether attitudes immediately post -vaccination are associated 
with behaviors and STI diagnosis at the four follow -up time points, we will use 
correlated logistic regression or generalized e stimating equation (GEE) models with 
attitudes as the independent variables and behaviors or STI diagnosis as the dependent variables.  GEE is a useful technique for dealing with repeated categorical 
data and is commonly used in situations where an identic al measurement (behaviors 
or STI diagnosis) is repeatedly taken on the same subject.  Repeated measurements induce a variance/covariance structure that can be utilized in the analysis, for example, the most general (unstructured) variance/covariance struct ure.  Therefore, in 
addition to the odds ratios, the 10 variance/covariance parameters of the 4x4 variance/covariance matrix (since we have 4 time points) will be estimated.  
 If these parameters were found to be inestimable, then a Toeplitz structure (equi  
variance/covariance parameters along the diagonals), with four variance/covariance 
parameters, would be used. 
 
We will also use linear mixed models to examine trends in sexual behaviors over 
time, and to compare trends in sexual behaviors over time in subjects who hold specific attitudes immediately post- vaccination vs. those who do not, taking into 
account all time points after vaccination.  These models will also control for variables associated in univariate analyses with sexual behaviors or STI diagnos is.  Linear 
mixed models take into account the repeated measures which also induce a variance/covariance structure that can be utilized in the analysis.  Similar models will 
be used with STI diagnosis as the outcome variable.

NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  9.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING  
9.1 Records to Be Kept  
CRFs will be provided for each subject via the AMC AdvantageEDCSM Internet Data Entry 
System upon enrollment. Subjects must not be identified by name on any study documents. 
Data will be recorded on the CRFs using the unique subject identification number assigned at 
registration. Sample CRFs will be available on the AMC ODMC web site 
(www.amcoperations.com ). 
 
9.2 Role of Data Management 
Instructions concerning the recording of study data on CRFs will be provided by the AMC 
ODMC. The AMC Internet Data Entry System User’s Guide can be found on the AMC 
ODMC web site (www.amcoperations.com). Each site is responsible for keying the data in 
and submitting the forms according to the target submission dates set forth by the 
Advantag eEDCSM system.  
 
It is the responsibility of the AMC ODMC to assure the quality of computerized data for each AMC study. This role extends from protocol development to generation of the final study databases.  
 
9.3 Clinical Site Monitoring and Record Availab ility 
This protocol will follow the AMC Data Safety Monitoring Plan (see 
Appendix X ). 
 
AMC #072 ( Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    47 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  10.0 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review and Informed Consent  
This protocol and the informed c onsent documents and any subsequent modifications will be 
reviewed and approved by the IRB or ethics committee responsible for oversight of the study. 
A signed consent form will be obtained from the subject (or parent, legal guardian, or person 
with power of attorney for subjects who cannot consent for themselves, such as those below 
the legal age of consent). The consent form will describe the purpose of the study, the 
procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. A copy of the consent 
form will be given to the subject, parent, or legal guardian, and this fact will be documented in the subject’s record. A signed assent form will be obtained from all subjects < 18 years of 
age. 
 
10.2 Subject Confidentiality  
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will 
be identified by coded number only to maintain subject confidentiality. All records will be 
kept locked. All computer entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers 
only.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, 
except as necessary for monitoring by the IRB, the NCI, the NICHD, the OHRP, or the 
pharmaceutical supporter(s) or designee.  
 
10.3 Study Discontinuation 
The study may be  discontinued at any time by the IRB, the NCI, the NICHD, the 
pharmaceutical supporter(s), the OHRP, or other government agencies as part of their duties 
to ensure that research subjects are protected.  
 
10.4 Women and Minorities  
This study is being conduct ed by the NCI -sponsored AIDS Malignancy Clinical Trials 
Consortium (AMC) and the NICHD -sponsored Adolescent Trials Network (ATN). As part of 
their contractual obligations, each participating site within the AMC/ATN and the AMC/ATN as a whole is required to  assure that the participation of minority subjects reflects 
the percentage representation of these populations in their geographic region and, for the 
AMC/ATN, the United States as a whole. As such, it is expected that the representation of 
subjects on this trial will reflect the constitution of the respective populations. Women are not 
being studied in this protocol. The safety and immunogenicity of Gardasil in HIV -positive 
women is being studied in ACTG 5240, AMC-060 and ATN 064.

 APPENDIX IV: PENILE/SCROTAL SCRAPING PROCEDURES  
 
To collect penile and scrotal cells for HPV testing, the foreskin will be retracted if present and the 
penile (shaft, glans and corona) skin and scrotal skin will be gently abraded with 600 grit emery 
paper followed by swabbing with a Dacron swab moistened with sterile saline.  The swab from the 
Digene Female Swab Specimen Collection Kit (Catalog #5123-1220, 1 -800-426-8157) will be 
inserted into a tube containing 1 mL of Sample Transport Medium (Digene). The swab should be placed in the collection vial and the end snapped off at the pre -scored line.  Then the cap should then 
be replaced securely.  
 
Sample  Labeling  
Each sample should be labeled with the following information:  
• Nine (9) Digit Subject ID:  “072-XXX -XXX”  
• Date of Sample Collection  
• Specimen Type :  "Penile/Scrotal Swab”

 APPENDIX V: ANAL CYTOLOGY SAMPLING PROCEDURES  
All anal cytology specimens will be examined at the local institution . 
Procedure for obtaining an anal cytology : 
The subject should undress from the waist down, and either bend over the exam table or lay on his 
side in the fetal position. The examiner should use one hand to spread the buttocks and expose the 
anoderm. A Dacron swab moistened in sterile saline will then be inserted as far as is comfortable into 
the anus, a minimum of 2-3 inches. If there is difficulty inserting the swab, the subject should also 
retract their buttocks. With pressure on the distal end of the swa b rotate it gently and slowly in a 
circular fashion as it is withdrawn over 15 to 30 seconds. Do not retract the buttocks when the swab 
is close to the verge to ensure that it is sampled as well. Immediately immerse the swab in a liquid -
cytology vial agita ting vigorously over 10 to 15 seconds to disperse the cells and then discard the 
swab.  
All cytological specimens should be processed and examined locally . If insufficient or inadequate 
cytology results are obtained, the cytology assessment  should be repeated if possible . Cytological 
slides from subjects who enter the trial should be available for central review upon request.  
 After the first swab has been immersed in the liquid cytology vial, a second moistened Dacron swab 
will be inserted and sample collected for HPV DNA testing (same procedure described above). 
Please see 
Appendix VI  for processing and shipping of the second sample  collected for HPV 
DNA.

 APPENDIX VI:  HPV DNA PCR SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND SHIPPING  
All HPV DNA PCR specimens (penile/scrotal, perianal, and anal) will be collected at the local 
institution and shipped to the Palefsky Laboratory. 
High resolution anoscopy is performed at screening and weeks 28, 52, 78 and 104. Biopsies are 
obtained if a lesion is suspected. One of the study outcomes is any incident AIN or anal/perianal 
condyloma associated with HPV 16, 18, 6 or 11 DNA as determined by PCR analysis of the anal 
tissue biopsy. Biopsies are fixed in formalin and sent to the local pathology la b for interpretation. We 
are requesting that the cassettes containing the biopsy be sent to the Palefsky lab. After the 
procedures described below are performed, the Palefsky lab will ship the remaining specimens back 
to the pathology lab that sent them.  
Specimens may be shipped to the Palefsky lab quarterly and will be returned to the pathology lab 
within 1 month.  
Procedure for obtaining perianal HPV DNA PCR sample  
The perianal skin will be will be gently scraped with 600 grit emery paper followed by swabbing 
with a Dacron swab moistened with sterile saline . The wetted swab will then be placed into a 
container of STM (Specimen Transport Medium, DIGENE, Gaithersburg MD). The swab should be 
placed in the collection vial and cut with sterile or single -use scissors to allow the swab to fit in the 
vial.  Then the cap should then be replaced securely.  
 
Procedure for obtaining intra -anal HPV DNA PCR sample : 
The procedure described above (in Appendix V ) for collection of anal cytology  should be repeated 
using a second Digene Female Swab Specimen Collection Kit (Catalog #5123-1220, 1-800-426-8157). The swab will be inserted into a tube containing 1 mL of Sample Transport Medium (Digene). 
The swab should be placed in the collection vial and cut with sterile or single -use scissors to allow 
the swab to fit in the vial.  The cap should then be replaced securely.  
 
Note: Specimens will be processed for HPV DNA PCR, not  Digene HCII.  
 
Specimens obtained for HPV testing (perianal, anal, and penile) should be stored at -80 C until 
shipment.  All specimens can be shipped in batches. Specimens should be shipped quarterly  on dry 
ice to the laboratory.  Specimens should be shipped on Mondays and Tuesdays only . 
 
Sample Labeling  
Samples must be labeled with the bar -coded labels provided. Each sample should be labeled with the 
following information:  
• Nine (9) Digit Subject ID:  “072-XXX-XXX”  
• Specimen Type:    “Penile/Scrotal Swab”, “Perianal Swab” or "Anal Swab”  or “Anal biopsy”  
• Specimen Purpose:   “HPV DNA PCR”

Preparation and disposition of thinsections of anal biopsy tissue
 
 
The following procedures will be performed at the Palefsky Laboratory.  The procedures will be 
performed according to the laboratory's SOP. The histotechnologist will ensure that the microtome 
and work areas are clean and free of contaminants.  All Thinsec
tion microtomy for PCR will be 
performed at a time when all other routine work has been completed, so potential contaminations can 
be minimized. Prior to sectioning each block, a new blade will be installed in the microtome. The 
blade will only be position
ed so that it is at the left margin of the block surface. Technicians 
sectioning study blocks will utilize “biologically clean” gloves while handling the blocks (new 
gloves for each block). First, the technologist will face the block by removing two 4
-
micr
on sections 
from the face of the block. These sections will be discarded. Using sterile plastic forceps, the next 
two 4
-
micron paraffin sections are collected and floated in a water bath for the preparation of 1 H&E 
slide (Slide 1, with 2 sections). The fo
rceps are discarded and a new blade is inserted into the 
microtome. Nine more 4
-
micron sections are cut and using the clean, central part of the microtome 
discarded after placing the cut section in each tube. Each tube is then placed inside a plastic sleev
e 
and sealed. Slides and tubes should be labeled with subject’s allocation number. 
 
 
Two additional 4
-
micron sections are cut and 2 sections each are placed on 1 slide (Slide 2, with 2 
sections) for H&E staining. Both H&E slides (Slides 1 and 2) will have 
a histopathologic review by 
the central laboratory's pathologist.
 
 
The microtome is cleaned in preparation for the next block and the process above is repeated. The 
microtome blade is replaced with a new blade and adjusted for each new biopsy block and the
 
same 
procedure is to be followed. A new pair of clean gloves and a new pair of clean, disposable forceps 
will be used for each block being sectioned. The “used” blade may be retained for cutting non
-
PCR 
blocks. The total number of sections to be cut from 
each block is 13. A total of 2 slides and 9 tubes:
 
 
Slides 1, 2 (H&E), with 2 sections each, stained.
 
Tubes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (HPV PCR Analysis), 1 section per tube.
 
 
HPV PCR will be performed to detect HPV vaccine types as well as non
-
vaccine types according to 
the Palefsky Laboratory SOP.

 APPENDIX VII:  HIGH RESOLUTION ANOSCOPY (HRA)  
 
Procedure for performing HRA:  
High resolution anoscopy should only be done after  the anal cytology and HPV DNA PCR are 
collected. The patient should undress from the waist down and lay on his side on the exam table in 
the fetal position. A mixture of 2% lidocaine jelly and water-soluble lubricating jelly should be used 
as a lubricant. A compound pharmacist can make the 2% lidocaine jelly. A digital rect al exam should 
be performed noting any masses or areas of induration. The procedure for HRA is as follows:  
1. Insert the plastic disposable anoscope, remove stylet, place a cotton swab wrapped in gauze 
soaked in 3% acetic acid into anus, remove the anoscope over the swab and leave in place for 1 
to 2 minutes.  
2. Remove the swab and re -insert the anoscope. Carefully examine the anal canal with a 
colposcope.  
3. Re-apply acetic acid as necessary to ensure adequate detection of lesions.  
4. If acetowhitening is noted, note vascular characteristics, if present.  
5. Lugol’s solution (iodine) may be used as desired to identify areas of AIN near the 
squamocolumnar junction.  
6. Biopsy up to six of the most abnormal appearing areas. 
7. Apply acetic acid to perianal area and examine carefull y with colposcope.  
8. If planning to biopsy an external lesion, infiltrate areas with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine using 
a 30-gauge needle, if possible.  
9. Biopsy  area if a lesion is suspected . 
10. A genital exam should be performed to note the presence of condyloma  
11. Subjects with signs or symptoms consistent proctitis or sexually transmitted infections other than HPV should be referred for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.  
 Biopsies will be processed and read locally at the institution.  
The tissue block, along with a copy of the surgical pathology report should be available for central 
review upon request. If the block is not available, a representative H & E stained section and six 
stained slides should be submitted. All materials will b e retained unless return is specifically 
requested. Tissue will be evaluated for histology as demonstrated by H & E staining. 
 
All slides should be sent to the following address for central pathology review:

 APPENDIX X: AMC DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
(Version 5.0  January. 28. 2014) 
 
Monitoring the Progress of Trials and the Safety of Participants  
 
All AMC protocols that collect safety data follow the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/guidelines/index.html).  All adverse events that meet the NCI’s expedited 
reporting requirements are reported to the Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI via the 
CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS ) web application.  All expedited adverse event 
reports are also required to be submitted to the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the reporting institution.  If NCI holds the IND or no IND is required for a study, the AMC site reports 
serious adve rse events directly to the AMC Operations and Data Management Center (ODMC) via 
CTEP -AERS .  In some instances, the AMC sites may report serious adverse events directly to a 
commercial sponsor holding the IND, who will then report the event to the AMC ODMC.  Most 
AMC protocols require sites to report all serious adverse events via CTEP -AERS  and the AMC 
ODMC to forward a copy of the report to the sponsor.  The AMC ODMC also distributes all IND 
safety reports to all investigators upon receipt, and makes these reports available on the password-
protected section of the AMC Operations web site.  Unless an AMC protocol specifies an alternate 
plan for the review and submission of serious adverse events, all serious adverse events received by 
the AMC ODMC will be rev iewed by the AMC Medical Monitor at the AMC ODMC prior to 
submission to NCI and the sponsor.  For protocols for which the IDB does not have an assigned drug 
monitor to review serious adverse event reports, in the event of disagreement between the reporting  
physician and the AMC Medical Monitor regarding the attribution of the event to the investigational 
agent(s) (i.e., determination of whether the relationship is unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite), the AMC Medical Monitor will provide th e final determination of the relationship.  
 
The AMC ODMC provides listings of all reported adverse events and serious adverse events to the 
Protocol Chair and Co-chair(s) for review on a regular basis.  The AMC ODMC compiles these 
events in a tabular format and posts them on the password-protected section of the AMC web site where these reports are updated nightly.  The AMC web site is accessible to all AMC investigators, 
co-investigators, and their staff.  Email notification that this information is a vailable on the web site 
will be sent to all site PIs.  It is the responsibility of each site to provide this information to their 
respective IRBs, if required by their IRB.  For blinded studies, the serious adverse events are 
reviewed and tabulated without treatment assignment.  The AMC Medical Monitor will review listings of all reported adverse events on a quarterly basis for safety concerns. 
 
Accrual summaries for each AMC trial are updated nightly on the password-protected section of the 
AMC web site.  The progress of each AMC trial is reviewed regularly by the Protocol Chair and also 
by the appropriate disease -oriented Working Group during scheduled conference calls.  For phase I 
dose escalation trials, dose escalation (or dose de -escalation) is based on the rules in the protocol and 
the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and Group Statistician determine whether these criteria 
have been met.  For phase II trials, stopping the trial for toxicity or efficacy, or suspending 
enrollment pending observation of responses in a multi -stage phase II trial, is based on meeting 
criteria stated in the protocol, and the Protocol Chair, AMC Medical Monitor, and Group Statistician 
determine whether these criteria have been met.  
 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    70 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 For phase III trials, the AMC has forme d an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB).  Voting members of the DSMB are physicians, a statistician, and a patient advocate.  All 
voting members are from outside the AMC.  Nonvoting members are the AMC Group Statistician, 
the Statistician listed on the protocol, an AMC Operations Center staff member, two representatives 
(normally a clinician or statistician) from the Office of HIV AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) or from the 
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosi s, of the National 
Cancer Institute (NCI).   The AMC Data Safety and Monitoring Board reviews AMC phase III 
studies in accordance with the National Cancer Institute’s Policy for Data Safety and Monitoring.  
Confidential reports of all phase III trials are prepared by the AMC Group Statistician with support 
from the AMC ODMC. A written report containing the current status of each trial monitored, and 
when appropriate, any toxicity and outcome data, are sent to DSMB members by the AMC ODMC 
within the timeline s specified by the AMC DSMB Charter.  This report addresses specific toxicity 
concerns as well as concerns about the conduct of the trial.  The report may contain 
recommendations for consideration by the DSMB concerning whether to close the trial, report t he 
results, or continue accrual or follow -up. 
 
The results of each DSMB meeting are summarized in a formal report sent by the DSMB Chair to the 
Group Chair and AMC ODMC. The DSMB report contains recommendations on whether to close 
each study reviewed, whet her to report the results, and whether to continue accrual or follow -up. A 
primary recommendation (e.g., continue with no change; recommended or required modification; 
stop) must be included in the document. The Group Chair is then responsible for notifyin g the 
Protocol Chair and relevant Disease -oriented Working Group Chair before the recommendations of 
the DSMB are carried out. In the unlikely event that the Protocol Chair does not concur with the 
DSMB, then the NCI Division Director or designee must be i nformed of the reason for the 
disagreement.  The Study Chair, relevant Disease -oriented Working Group Chair, Group Chair, 
DSMB Chair, and NCI Division Director or designee will be responsible for reaching a mutually 
acceptable decision about the study.  CT EP approval of a formal amendment will be required prior to 
any implementation of a change to the study.  
 
Following a DSMB meeting, a summary of the serious adverse events reported to the DSMB is 
posted to the AMC web site.  It is each site’s responsibilit y for conveying this information to its IRB. 
 
Plans for Assuring Compliance with Requirements Regarding the Reporting of Adverse Events 
(AE) 
 
For trials monitored by the NCI’s Clinical Data Update System (CDUS), adverse event information 
is transmitted ele ctronically to NCI on a quarterly basis.  For trials monitored by NCI’s Clinical 
Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS), adverse event information is transmitted electronically to NCI 
every two weeks.  
 
The Protocol Chair, AMC Group Chair, and the AMC ODMC share responsibility in assuring that 
participating investigators comply with the protocol requirements for adverse event reporting.  All AMC investigators certify compliance with NCI and FDA requirements for adverse event reporting 
by signing the AMC Adherence Statement for site membership, the protocol signature page for each 
protocol active at the site, and Form FDA -1572 for CTEP investigator registration and IND studies 
sponsored by AMC investigators.  Investigators are responsible for identifying and reporti ng all 
adverse events to the AMC ODMC, CTEP -AERS , and/or sponsors according to the protocol 
requirements, and assuring compliance with reporting to the local IRB.  Protocol compliance with 
adverse event reporting requirements is assessed by the AMC ODMC during routine site monitoring 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    71 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 visits by reviewing the site’s source documentation.   
 
The data entry system used for AMC studies, AdvantageEDCSM (a web -based data entry and 
enrollment system), is programmed to notify the site investigator, protocol chair, a nd AMC ODMC 
via email in the event that a site reports an adverse event that meets expedited reporting criteria to 
NCI and/or FDA.  If the site does not follow with a CTEP -AERS  report, the AMC ODMC contacts 
sites to request an expedited report.  Additional ly, the protocol chair, AMC ODMC, and the AMC 
Medical Monitor review reported adverse events on a routine basis to identify adverse events 
reported by sites that require expedited reporting via CTEP -AERS .  The Protocol Chair, AMC Group 
Chair, and IND spons ors have general oversight for assuring that routine and expedited adverse 
reporting requirements are met by the responsible parties.  
 
Plans for Assuring that any Action Resulting in a Temporary or Permanent Suspension of an 
NCI-Funded Clinical Trial is Re ported to the NCI Grant Program Director Responsible for the 
Grant  
 
In the event that termination of the trial or major modification to the protocol is under consideration, 
the Protocol Chair will convene the AMC Data Coordinator and Disease -oriented Worki ng Group 
Chair by conference call to discuss the options.  For phase I and II trials, the Protocol Chair also has the option of asking the AMC DSMB to review the study.  The AMC ODMC will inform the CTEP 
Protocol Information Office (PIO) when studies are t emporarily or permanently closed.  The Cancer 
Treatment and Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) must approve all 
protocol amendments prior to distributing to the AMC sites.  
 
Plans for Assuring Data Accuracy and Protocol Compliance  
 
All study data for AMC clinical trials are entered directly by AMC site staff into AdvantageEDC
SM.  
During data entry, the system performs validation checks on many fields and performs consistency 
checks between select fields.  Range checks are placed  on each field to eliminate entry of out -of-
range values.  Edit check programs are run on the database on a set schedule to identify and resolve 
inconsistencies between forms or data collected at different points in time.  AMC ODMC staff routinely interact s with site staff to resolve any data problems. 
 
In accordance with NCI guidelines, the AMC ODMC conducts monitoring visits at the AMC sites to 
evaluate compliance with regulatory issues, and to review data for specific cases by checking source 
documents.  These reports are sent to the site Principal Investigator and to the NCI.  In the event that 
major violations are identified, sites are asked to provide a plan to correct deficiencies within 30 
days.  If needed, a repeat site visit is conducted.  In the e vent that a site does not correct deficiencies 
in a pre -determined time frame, the AMC Executive Committee has the option of taking action 
against the site.  Possible actions include, but are not limited to, suspending enrollment of new 
patients to AMC tri als until deficiencies are corrected; recommending a decrease in funding to the 
site; and requiring specific training for site investigators or staff members.

The next few questions will ask about any women that you have had sex with in the past 6 months. 
Let's s tart with reviewing some words so that we agree on what we are talking about.  By "having 
sex" we mean vaginal sex, oral sex or anal sex.

APPENDIX XIII:  ACSR INFORMED CONSENT FORM – AMC -072 
 
RESEARCH STUDY  
AIDS AND CANCER SPECIMEN RESOURCE (ACSR)  
 
A. INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to donate specimens (tissues and/or blood) for research.  Before you 
decide to be a part of this research study, you need to understand the risks and benefits so that 
you can make an informed decision.  This is known as informed consent.  
 
This consent form provides information about the research study, which has been explained, 
to you. Once you understand the study and the tests it requires, you will be asked to sign this form if you want to take part in the study. Your decision to take part in the study is voluntary.  
This means that you are free to choose if you will  take part in the study.  
 
B. PURPOSE  
The National Cancer Institute has set up a Biorepository for tissues and biological fluids from 
HIV-positive and HIV -negative individuals in order to have specimens available for 
scientists studying cancers and pre -cancers associated with HIV disease.   
 
Biopsy Tissue and Blood Donation  
Individuals who are having high resolution anoscopy (HRA)  as part of this research study are 
being asked for permission to donate an additional anal tissue specimen to the Biorepository. 
If it turns out that your physician needs more of your tissue for additional studies, the 
Biorepository will release all of your tissue back to your doctor.  
 
It is expected that the biopsy tissues may be evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) 
detection and typing, and potentially other research assays as additional science studies are 
developed. This may also involve genetic testing. These evaluations will not be done in real 
time and you will not receive the results of these tests.  
 
In addition, you are  being asked permission to donate some of your blood (up to 20 
milliliters) to the Biorepository so that scientists can better understand factors that may affect 
your risk of developing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related anal pre -cancers or other 
diseases that may occur in HIV -positive men . These evaluations will not be done in real time 
and you will not receive the results of these tests.  
We will also ask you if you will let any leftover tissue or blood that is not used during the 
study be donated to ACSR  at the end of the study.  
 
Donation of blood or biopsy specimens is not a requirement to participate in the study and 
you may withdraw your approval for the storage of these specimens at any time.  You may 
also choose to donate blood but not tissue, or vice -versa.

 C. PROCEDURES  
You are being asked for consent to place additional tissue and a blood sample in the ACSR.  
If you agree to allow the ACSR to have some of your tissue and/or blood, the following 
procedures will occur:  
• Procedure for tissue donation:  At the time you are se en for high resolution anoscopy 
(HRA), a swab moistened with acetic acid (i.e. diluted vinegar) is placed in your anus. 
Vinegar helps pre -cancers and warts in the anus show up.  The doctor or nurse then re -
inserts the plastic speculum into your anus. A col poscope (a machine similar to a 
magnifying glass) is used to see the skin inside the anus. Then biopsies of any areas 
worrisome for pre -cancer or anal warts may be performed. To do a biopsy, a small bit of 
skin about the size of a sesame seed is cut off. I odine may also be used to help make pre -
cancers show up, and an injection of lidocaine may be given to numb the skin before a 
biopsy.  
• Procedure for blood donation: Two tubes (up to 20 milliliters) of blood will be drawn.  
 
If you agree to make a tissue and/or blood donation to the ACSR, we would also like to 
confidentially obtain some clinical information from your medical records that could be 
useful to research investigators. The report of the information retrieved from your medical record that is give n to research investigators will not have your name, or include any 
information which could personally identify you.  
It is possible that you may not qualify for the study, based on the results of your screening visit.  If you agree to donate tissue and/or blood, but do not qualify for the study, we would 
still be interested in sending the specimens to the Biorepository.  
 
You will be asked if you are willing  to make  a tissue and/or blood donation to the ACSR at 
two time points: at the first visit and again about 2 years later. You may agree to donate specimens at either or both visits. 
 
D. POSSIBLE RISKS 
Some anal bleeding occurs with every biopsy.  Serious bleeding is rare, about 1 in 1000 
biopsies. If serious bleeding occurs, a simple procedure may be nece ssary to stop the 
bleeding such as burning or cauterizing the area.  An injection of lidocaine may be given 
prior to a biopsy.  It is possible that you can experience pain or dizziness from the injection.  Rarely, you can experience an allergic reaction su ch as itching or swelling.  Iodine may be 
used to help identify pre -cancerous areas of the anus. It is possible that you may have an 
allergic reaction.  
 There is a possibility of a bruise and slight pain at the time the blood samples are taken.  
There is a lso the possibility of fainting and infection at the site of the blood draw.   
 
Risks of genetic testing include the  possibility that the information will not remain private or 
confidential. All personnel who will have access to genetic information about y ou are 
ethically and legally obligated to maintain the confidence of that information. However, there 
can be no absolute guarantees. In rare cases where information has not remained private, this 
has caused problems for persons related to their employment and/or their life and/or health

 insurance and other benefits or entitlements.  
 
E. POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
It may be that there will be no direct benefit to you by consenting to allow the ACSR to have 
your tissue and blood.  However, there may be possible benefit s to medical knowledge and 
HIV-infected individuals in the future.  
 
F. COSTS 
There will not be any additional costs to you for consenting to participate in the AIDS and 
Cancer Specimen Resource.  
 
G. PAYMENT FOR INJURY OR HARM  
As the lists of risks shows, t aking part in this research study may result in injury or harm to 
you. If you require immediate medical care, you should go to an emergency room.  
Otherwise, the doctor in charge of the study will take care of you or help you get the care you need.  You wi ll be sent a bill for whatever medical care you receive.  No funds have been set 
aside to compensate you in the event of injury. However, you are not giving up your right to seek to collect compensation for injury related to malpractice, fault, or blame on the part of 
those involved in the research.  
 [ATN SITES: PLEASE USE THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE:]

APPENDIX XIV:   ACSR ASSENT FORM – AMC 072  
 
RESEARCH STUDY  
AIDS AND CANCER SPECIMEN RESOURCE (ACSR)  
 
A. INTRODUCTION  
You are being asked to donate specimens (tissues and/or blood) for research.  Before you 
decide to be a part of this research study, you need to understand the risks and benefits so that 
you can make an informed decision.  This is known as informed consent.  
 
This consent form provides information about the research study, which has been explained, 
to you. Once you understand the study and the tests it requires, y ou will be asked to sign this 
form if you want to take part in the study. Your decision to take part in the study is voluntary.  
This means that you are free to choose if you will take part in the study.  
 
B. PURPOSE  
The National Cancer Institute has set up  a place where tissues and blood are kept so that 
these specimens can be available for scientists studying cancers and pre-cancers associated 
with HIV disease in the future. This place is called the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource 
Biorepository (ACSR).  
 
Biopsy Tissue and Blood Donation  
You are having high resolution anoscopy (HRA) as part of this research study that involves 
taking an anal biopsy. Individuals in the study are being asked for permission to donate an 
additional anal tissue specimen to the Biorepository described above. In addition, you are also being asked permission to donate some of your blood to the Biorepository. We will also 
ask you if you will let any leftover tissue or blood that is not used during the study be 
donated to ACSR at the end of the study.  
 
Any tissue and blood collected may be tested for types of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 
other research tests might be performed so that scientists can better understand HPV -related 
anal pre -cancers and other diseases that may occur in H IV-positive men . These future tests 
may also involve genetic testing. These tests will not be done now, so you will not receive the results of these future tests.  
Donating tissue or blood specimens is not a requirement to participate in the study and you 
may withdraw your approval to store these specimens at any time.  You may also choose to 
donate blood but not tissue, or vice -versa.   
 
C. PROCEDURES  
You are being asked to place additional tissue and a blood sample in the Biorepository.  If 
you agree, the  following procedures will occur:  
• Procedure for tissue donation:  At the time you are seen for high resolution anoscopy 
(HRA), a swab moistened with acetic acid (i.e. diluted vinegar) is placed in your 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    91 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 anus. Vinegar helps pre -cancers and warts in the anus show up.  The doctor or nurse 
then re -inserts the plastic speculu m into your anus. A colposcope (a machine similar 
to a magnifying glass) is used to see the skin inside the anus. Then biopsies of any 
areas worrisome for pre -cancer or anal warts may be performed. To do a biopsy, a 
small bit of skin about the size of a se same seed is cut off. Iodine may also be used to 
help make pre -cancers show up, and an injection of lidocaine may be given to numb 
the skin before a biopsy.  
• Procedure for blood donation: Two tubes (up to 2 tablespoons) of blood will be 
drawn.  
 
If you agree  to make a tissue and/or blood donation to the Biorepository , we would also like 
to confidentially obtain some clinical information from your medical records that could be 
useful to research investigators. This report that is given to research doctors will  be coded, 
that means it will not have your name, or include any information which could personally 
identify you.  
It is possible that you may not qualify for the study, based on the results of your screening 
visit.  If you agree to donate tissue and/or blood, but do not qualify for the study, we would still be interested in sending the specimens to the Biorepository.  
 
You will be asked if you are willing  to make  a tissue and/or blood donation at two different 
times: at the first visit and again about 2 yea rs later. You may agree to donate specimens at 
either or both visits.  
 
D. POSSIBLE RISKS 
Some anal bleeding occurs with every biopsy and there is a risk of infection. An injection of 
lidocaine may be given prior to a biopsy to numb the area and it is possi ble that you can 
experience pain or dizziness from the injection, or an allergic reaction.  Iodine may be used to 
help identify pre -cancerous areas of the anus and it is possible that you may have an allergic 
reaction to iodine.  
 There is a possibility of a bruise and slight pain at the time the blood samples are taken.  
There is also the possibility of fainting and infection at the site of the blood draw.    
Risks of genetic testing include the  possibility that the information will not remain private or 
confidential, even though people who have this information are legally required to keep the 
information private.  If this information were released, there is a chance problems will occur 
in your job, or with your health insurance, or other benefits you might  have. It is unlikely that 
this information would be released, but there can be no absolute guarantees.  
 
E. POSSIBLE BENEFITS  
There may be no direct benefit to you by consenting to allow the ACSR Biorepository to 
have your tissue and blood.  However, there may be possible benefits to medical knowledge and HIV -infected individuals in the future.

blood to the Biorepository. 
 
G. PAYMENT FOR INJURY OR HARM  
It is important that you tell your study doctor, if you feel that you have been hurt because of 
taking part in this study. As the lists of risks shows, taking part in this research study may 
result in injury or harm to you. You will be sent a bill for whatever medical care you receive.  
No funds have been set aside to compensate you in the event of injury. However, you are not 
giving up your right to seek to collect compensation for injury related to malpractice, fault, or 
blame on the part of those i nvolved in the research.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLOOD SPECIMENS COLLECT ED ON FRIDAY  
 
Preparation of Plasma and Mononuclear Cells  
It is preferable that separation occurs as soon as possible. If necessary, whole blood in ACD (yellow top tubes) can be held at room temperature for no more than 24 hours.  
 
Materials  
• Lymphocyte Separation Medium (LSM Solution, Ficoll -Hypaque - sterile)  
• 15 ml conical centrifuge tubes (sterile)  
• PBS (sterile)  
• 1, 5 ml and 10 ml serologic pipettes (sterile)  
• NUNC tubes  
• Alcohol -saturated, control rate freezer container  
• DMSO freezing media:  
• 50% Cryoprotective  Medium, Cambrex (catalog no.:12-132A)  
• 50% Heat Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum  
 
Preparation of Plasma Samples  
• The 8.5 ml tubes of whole blood in ACD should be rotated gently two or three times 
before being centrifuged. Do not transfer before centrifugation. 
• The cells are separated by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 minutes.  
• 0.5 ml aliquots of plasma are removed and put into separate 1.5 ml screw top tubes (NUNC) and transferred to liquid nitrogen storage. 
 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    97 
NCI Version Date 0 5/02/2014  
 PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELL (PBMC) SEPARATION AND 
FREEZING  
• The cells and plasma remaining from the previous step are transferred into a 15 ml 
conical tube or 50 ml centrifuge tube depending on volume.  
• Sterile PBS should be added to the suspended cells whole blood cells in an equal volume 
and pipetted up and down to mix (1:1).  
• The whole blood -PBS mixture should be carefully overlaid onto 4-5 ml of room 
temperature LSM or Ficoll -Hypaque solution in a sterile 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. A 
sharp interface should exist between the LSM and the whole blood  mixture. (If the layer 
of LSM gets mixed with the blood-PBS, the tube should be gently rotated to mix the 
blood, PBS, and LSM, and transfer to a 50 ml sterile conical tube. An equal volume of PBS is added, and the cells are separated at 600 g for 15 minut es. After removal of LSM -
PBS supernatant, return to Step b).  
• Centrifuge the 15 ml conical tube for 30 minutes at 900 g at room temperature. The 
mononuclear leukocytes (principally lymphocytes and monocytes) will band at 
plasma/LSM interface.  
• The fluffy whi te layer just below the plasma layer should be aspirated off and transferred 
to an appropriately labeled 15 ml sterile conical centrifuge tube. Be careful to remove only the interface and a minimum amount of the LSM or Ficoll -Hypaque.  
• Add three volumes of PBS to the cell suspension and or enough to fill conical and mix by 
pipetting up and down.  
• Centrifuge at 500 g for 10 minutes.  
• Aspirate off and discard supernatant, taking care not to disturb pellet.  
• Resuspend in 12 ml of PBS.  Take 10 µ l of suspension for cell counting (dilute 
accordingly whether using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter). Centrifuge again for 10 minutes at 500g to wash cells. 
• Using a 1 ml pipette, the *DMSO freezing mixture should be added dropwise to the cell pellet suspension. Gen tly finger -tap between drops to resuspend cells. If the cell pellet is 
small, only 0.5 ml of freezing media is added (and only one aliquot of cells is frozen). If 
the cell pellet is large, up to  
2 ml of freezing media can be added in a drop wise fashion. 
(Cell densities of 1 -  10 million PBMC/ml are best for cryopreservation. If a 
hemocytometer is available, the optimal concentration is 5 x 106 PBMC/ml).  
 
*Important: Do not put the DMSO containing media on the cell button all at once . 
 
• Freeze the cell suspension in 0.5 ml aliquots in sterile NUNC vials by placing the NUNC 
tubes in a room temperature, alcohol saturated, control rate freezer container and store in 
the -80°C freezer overnight. Transfer the cell suspension into the liquid nitrogen 
temperature freezer for long -term storage the next working day.  
 ***PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK PACKAGING OF SHIPPER AND DO NOT 
DEVIATE FROM REQUESTED LABELING. Shipping frozen aliquots requires 
the use of packaging acceptable for dry ice and Class 9 label with weight of dry ic e 
written on package. 
 
 PREPARATION OF TISSUE SAMPLES  
Tissue specimens to be fresh frozen should be placed in OCT and then on dry ice 
 
AMC #072  (Version 5.0) 05/0 2/2014    98

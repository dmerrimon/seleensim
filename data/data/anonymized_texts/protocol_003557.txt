 Confidential and Proprietary Infor mation of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 7 of 73 Number of Subjects 
Planned  Approximately 89 subjects with PD P will be screened and 53  subjects 
are expected to be enrolled, assuming a screen failure rate of 40%. 
Approximately 42 subjects are expected to complete the study, assuming a 20% drop- out rate.  
Test Product, Dose, 
and Administration  Pimavanserin 34 mg (provided as 1×34 mg capsule ), administered 
orally, once daily 
Study Design  This study will be conducted as a 16-week, multi -center, single -arm, 
open- label  study. Pimavanserin (ACP-103) will be administered at a 
dose of 34 mg to  approxi mately 50 subjects  with PDP .  
The study will have 3 periods: 
• Screening period (3-35 days)  
• Treatment period ( 16 weeks)  
• Safety follow-up period (30 [+4] days) 
The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis with visits performed  at Screening , Baseline (Week 0), Week 2 , Week 4, Week 8 , 
Week 12 , Week 16 (end of Treatment Period) and  Follow-up ( at least 
30 days and not to exceed 34 days after last dose of study drug). 
Screening Period (3 -35 Days) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued. 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for 
the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
Treatment  Period ( 16 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit ( Week 0 ) may occur as soon as screening 
procedures are completed and subject eligibility has been confirmed. Treatment with  pimavanserin 34 mg once daily (QD) will begin on the 
morning of the day after the Baseline visit. Additional a ssessments will 
be conducted at Week 2 , Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 , Week 16  (end of 
treatment [EOT])/ early termination [ ET]). Subjects who are withdrawn 
will not be replaced.  
Safety Follow- up Period ( 30-34 Days) 
A follow- up safety assessment telephone call will be conducted at least 
30 days  and no more than 34 days after the last dose of study drug. 
The schedule of assessments is pr ovided in Table S –1.

Sample Size 
Calculations   
 This is an exploratory study and is not powered for statistical 
significance. Formal sample size calculations were not used to determine sample size.  
Statistical Methods  Analysis Sets  
The Safety Analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The Full Analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 
1 dose of study drug, and have both baseline and at least one post -
baseline value for the mFSQ  total score . 
Primary Analysis  
The pri mary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to Week 16 in the 
mFSQ total score, will be evaluated using a mixed- effects model for 
repeated measures (MMRM). The response variable is the change from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 and the fixed  effects i nclude visit 
(Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16), corresponding Baseline score, and the Baseline score -by-visit interaction.  
Summary statistics for the mFSQ total score (observed and change 
from Baseline), least -squares (LS) means and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval will be presented.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Infor mation of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 13 of 73 Secondary Analyses  
Each of the secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the MMRM 
model similar to that described for the primary analysis. For CGI- I the 
baseline CGI -S score will be used as the covariate in the MMRM 
model. 
Safety Analyses  
Adverse events will be classified into standard terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities  (MedDRA) . All adverse 
events (AEs) will be listed and TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs after the first dose of study 
drug and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Summaries by maximum severity and by relationship to study drug as assessed by the investigator will also be provided. Serious TEAE s, fatal AEs, and 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation will also be summarized.  
The serum clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis results at each time point will be summarized. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized.  
The number and percentage of subjects with PCI post- Baseline values 
will be summarized at each post- Baseline visit and overall 
post- Baseline f or selected parameters. The PCI criteria will be 
specified in the statistical analysis plan.  
Vital signs, body weight, and BMI at Baseline and  each post -Baseline 
visit will be summarized. Change from Baseline values will also be summarized.  
The results of the physical examinations at each visit will be tabulated.  
Electrocardiogram parameters at study visits will be summarized. Change from B aseline values will also be summarized. Categorical 
analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
For the C-SSRS, the number and percentage of subjects w ith suicidal 
ideation or suicidal behavior during the study will be tabulated.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol and the International Council f or Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) Guideline.  
1.1 Background Information 
More than 10 million people worldwide have Parkinson’s disease (PD) ( Parkinson’s Disease 
Foundation 2019). Parkinson’s disease is a synucleinopathy resulting in progressive 
neurodegeneration marked by motor dysfunction and non- motor symptoms including 
psychosis. More than 50% of patients with PD  have psychosis at some time. Psychosis 
affects up to 75% of patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia, and symptoms are more 
intractable in this group. Such psychosis is expressed primarily as hallucinations and 
delusions, which can cause great distress for patients and their caregivers. These episodes present a major  challenge for treatment and care, increase the likelihood of placement in 
nursing homes, and are associated with increased mortality ( Aarsland et al. 2001; 
Starkstein  et al. 2012). 
1.2 Investigational Product 
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is present  in the investigational product (IP) as 
pimavanserin  tartrate salt with  the chemical name, urea, N -[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl]- N-(1-
methyl-4-piperidinyl)- N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methyl]- ,(2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1). In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the United States for the treatm ent of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease 
psychosis (PDP). 
Pimavanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic 
neurotransmission media ted by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5- HT [serotonin] ) 2A (5 -HT
2A) 
receptor . At higher doses, pimavanserin may block 5- HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et al. 2006).  
Pimavanserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic  receptors . Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of dose-
limiting side effects associated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cognitive dulling 
(Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004; Peretti et  al. 1997) and an increased risk of mortality 
in elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor 
binding profile, pimavanserin may have benefits with  regard to overall tolerability relative to 
other antipsychotic agents.

Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treatment of hallucinations 
and delusions associated with PDP ( Mathis et al. 2017). Studies have also been conducted in 
Alzheimer’s disease agitation, Alzheimer’s disease psychosis (ADP) and depression in PD, 
and studies are ongoing in schizophrenia, m ajor depressive disorder, and dementia related 
psychosis. The clinical program for PDP is reviewed below as the study population (elderly 
subjects) is most closely aligned with the intended study population of this protocol. A more 
complete discussion of these studies, other pimavanserin clinical studies, overall benefit/risk assessment , and the most current and accurate information on metabolism, pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy, and safety is available in the pimavanserin Investigator’s brochure (IB). 
1.3.1 Parkinson’s Disease Psychosis Program 
The scope of the development program for pimavanserin is the largest ever conducted in 
PDP. At the time of approval, 616 mostly older, late- stage PDP subjects had been evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years. Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in Study ACP -103-020, a 6- week , placebo-controlled Phase 3 study ( Cummings et al. 2014). 
This efficacy was supported by data from additional short-term Phase 2b/3 studies. In ACP -103-020, pimavanserin 34 mg consistently demonstrated statistically significant 
efficacy across multiple an d independent endpoints, subject subgroups, and sensitivity 
analyses. Improvements in sleep and daytime wakefulness were also observed. These clinical benefits were achieved without worsening of PD motor symptoms and without a number of other safety concer ns associated with atypical antipsychotics. 
Pimavanserin is considered to be generally safe and well tolerated in patients with PDP. Across all clinical studies of pimavanserin, the most frequently reported treatment -emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were in  the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and 
psychiatric systems. Most events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most common 
CNS  TEAEs included dizziness (including post ural), headache, and somnolence 
(drowsiness). Common gastrointestinal disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, 
constipation, and vomiting. Severe nausea and vomiting were dose limiting in a few cases. Reported psychiatric conditions included agitation, insomnia, and confusional state. 
Clinical and nonclinical safety pharmaco logy studies of pimavanserin suggest a potential risk 
for QT interval ( QT) prolongation. The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a 
thorough QT study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68 mg. In the Phase 3 PDP 
program, an average prolongation of approximately 5 to 8 ms was observed with 
pimavanserin 34 mg.

1.4 Study Rationale 
Onset and progression of disability are major factors in the diagnosis and management of PD 
(Shulman 2010; Shulman et al. 2008). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines 
disability as “any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity within the range 
considered normal for a human being due to an impairment”  (World Health Organization 
1980). In this context, “disability” is an umbrella term for the negative aspects of the 
interaction between an individual with a health condition and environmental and personal factors, in contrast to “functioning,” an umbrella term for the positive aspects of this 
interaction ( World Health Organization 2001). Accurate assessment of disability is important 
given that the onset of functional limi tations triggers changes in clinical management, 
including adjustment of medications or referral for deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery. 
Neurological examination of PD-related impairments, including tremor, bradykinesia, gait, 
and cognitive function, does not provide adequate insight into the capacity for performance of daily activities because there is a broad range of compensato ry strategies and support 
based on socioeconomic status. Patient insight into daily function also varies with PD 
patients tending to understate their level of disability  (Shulman et al. 2006). Therefore, 
integrating  data from multiple sources (examination,  disability  assessment, and patient and 
caregiver reports)  is important.  
In a 6 week study evaluating pimavanserin in the treatment of PDP  (Cummings et al. 2014), a 
decrease from baseline in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) Parts II+III 
score was observed across both placebo and pimavanserin and the magnitude of the treatment 
difference (pimavanserin minus placebo) was 0.29 (95% confidence interval [ CI], -2.14 to 
2.72). Since the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the treatment differ ence was ≤5, 
non-inferiority of pimavanserin 34 mg compared to placebo was concluded for the change from baseline to Day  43. This non- inferiority treatment difference suggests that there was no 
clinically meaningful difference in the activities of daily living and the motor examinations of the subjects taking pimavanserin 34 mg when compared with the subjects taking placebo. 
Howev er, the post-baseline UPDRS was only measured once on Day 43, and this variable 
was considered a measure of safety and function r ather than efficacy. These assessments were 
to be conducted in the “on” state. In addition it is  known that the UPDRS measurements do 
not provide adequate insight into the capacity for performance of daily activities due to broad 
range of compensatory stra tegies  (Shulman et al. 2006).  
Therefore an activities of daily living ( ADL ) study in patients with PDP  is needed to evaluate 
pimavanserin in subjects with  PDP  using scales that measure disability, and patient and

more patients and to improve the value of trial results  (Beyer -Westendorf et al. 2011). In a 
systematic review , it was noted that  most ADL studies were performed over a minimum of 
3 months with many lasting for 12 months ( Al Thomali et al. 2017). The rationale for the 
current study for 16 weeks is to allow adequate time for pimavanserin to demonstrate a 
measurable effect on ADL  scales in patients experiencing PDP. 
The currently approved dose for the treatment of PDP of 34 mg per day is being utilized in this study. 
1.5 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
In this open- label study, pimavanserin is being used in its approved indication, PDP . Hence,  
the benefit/risk for the patients is as would be expected from the approved prescribing 
information label  for NUPLAZID (pimavanserin) ( Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2020) . There 
is no placebo group. The study will examine a range of symptoms in order to explore the 
correlation of the benefit on psychosis with functional improvement.

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION 
3.1 Overview of Study Design 
This study will be conducted as a 16-week, multi- center, s ingle-arm, open-label study. 
Pimavanserin (ACP -103) will be administered at a dose of 34 mg to approximately 
50 subjects with  PDP . Approximately 89 subjects with PDP will be screened and 53 subjects 
are expected to be enrolled, assuming a screen failure rate of 40%. Approximately 42 subjects 
are expected to complet e the study, assuming a 20% drop-out rate.  Approximately 25 sites in 
the US will participate in this study.  
The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 26 weeks, consisting 
of the following 3 periods ( Figure S–1):

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 31 of 73 3.1.1 Screening  Period  (3-35 Days) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited 
medications will be discontinued if medically appropriate. Subject eligibility will be assessed 
by the site and the Sponsor through an eligibility review process. 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications should only be discontinued if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the treating physician. 
3.1.2 Treatment  Period  (16 Weeks)  
The Baseline visit (Week 0) may occur as soon as screening procedures  are completed and 
subject eligibility has been confirmed. Treatment with pimavanserin 34 mg once daily (QD) 
will begin on the morning of the day after the Base line visit. Additional assessments will be 
conducted at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16 (end of treatment [EOT])/early 
termination [ET]). Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced. 
3.1.3 Safety Follow- up Period  (30 Days)

• Use of prohibited medication 
• Other (e.g., positive COVID -19 PCR or antigen test,  loss of caregiver /study partner, 
inability to complete study procedures) 
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for any reason. Such 
reasons may be any of, but not limited to, the following: 
• Occurrence of AEs unknown to date in respect of their nature, severit y, and duration or 
the unexpected incidence of known AEs 
• Medical, ethical , or business reasons affecting the continued performance of the study 
Regulatory authorities  also have the right to terminate the conduct of the study in their region 
for any reason. 
4.4.1 Handling of Subject  Discontinuation During the Treatment Period  
Unless the subject has withdrawn consent from all components of the study, every reasonable 
effort should be made to complete Visit 7/ET  and the safety follow-up visit (as outlined in 
Table S –1) if a subject discontinues prematurely during the treatment period of the study. All 
information will be reported on the applicable pages of the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) . 
If a subject i s discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 of 73 be chronic or stable. For su bjects who continue to be followed for safety, serious adverse 
events ( SAEs ) should continue to be reported as described in Section 7.4.2 . All SAEs will 
continue to be followed until such events have resolved or the Investigator deems them to be 
chronic or stable. 
4.5 Subject Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if they fail to attend a scheduled visit 
(including the safety follow-up visit) and are unable to be contacted by the study site. Every 
reasonable effort should be made to contact the subject and will include a minimum of 
3 documented phone calls  (each performed at  different times of the day) and, if necessary, a 
certified letter to the subject’s  last known mailing address or local equivalent methods. All 
contact attempts are to  be doc umented  in the source documents. 
4.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All medications used from study screening until completion of the safet y follow-up visit are 
to be recorded.  
4.6.1 Prior Medication  
Prior medications is  defined as any medication taken before the date of the first dose of study 
drug. 
4.6.2 Concomitant Medication 
Concomitant medication is  defined as any medication taken on or after the date of the first 
dose of study drug. 
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essenti al that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency). 
The Investigator may prescribe appropriate medication to treat AEs. 
4.6.2.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and r estrictions for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial screening  visit and Visit 7/ EOT/ ET as specified in Appendix A  and Appendix B . These 
appendices do not constitute an exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and 
restricted medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. 
Use of medications that could interfere with study conduct or any questions regarding 
prohibited and restricted concomitant medications should be reviewed and/or discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee.

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 38 of 73 Medications that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the 
Medical Monitor) as specified in Appendix A . 
Permitted concomitant medications should remain at a stable dose throughout the study.  
If a subject is on a medication restricted by the protocol, the medication should be adjusted if 
it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically appropriate (e.g., if the subject's symptoms ar e not well -controlled or if the subject cannot tolerate the current medication) in 
consultation with the treating physician. 
Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Subjects who have taken a prohibited medication during the study will be withdrawn from 
the study unless: 
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued, AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject who has taken a prohibited medication  to continue in 
the trial will be made by the Sponsor /Medical Monitor,  with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be 
reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver. 
5 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 39 of 73 5.1.2 Product Storage and Stability  
Investigational product must be stored between 20°C and  25°C (68°F and  77°F) in a secur e 
area with restricted access and according to local and national regulations . Excursions are 
permitted between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F) [See USP Controlled Room 
Temperature].  
5.1.3 Dosing and Administration 
Study drug will be dispensed to the subject to t ake home. Each daily dose consists of one 
capsule to  be taken orally, once daily . The capsules may be taken with or without food. The 
first dose should be taken on the morning of the day after the Baseline visit.   
5.1.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
All subjects will be in the 34 mg pimavanserin treatment group. 
5.1.5 Blinding  
This is an open- label st udy. 
5.1.6 Study Drug Compliance  
If a subject misses one dose of study drug, he or she should not t ake an extra dose the next 
day. 
If a subject shows significant undercompliance (<80% compliance) between any two 
scheduled visits, the Medical Monitor should be notified to determine if the subject remains 
eligible for the study and whether the incident should be considered a protocol deviation. 
In the event that a subject is permanently unable to return study drug to the site (i.e., drug is 
lost, destroyed, or discarded), the subject/caregiver testimony is to be used in determining 
compliance.  
5.1.7 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported, irrespective of outcome, 
even if toxic effects were not observed ( Section 7.4.4). All events of overdose are to be 
captured as protocol deviations. 
5.2 Investigational Product Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator or designee will keep current and accurate records of the study drug product 
dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to assure the regulatory authority and the 
Sponsor that the study drug is being handled appropriately. Subjects should be instructed to return all packaging and unused study drug to the Investigator at regularly scheduled clinic

used for any other purpose. 
At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation will be performed by the 
Sponsor (or designee) who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unused packaging to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction. 
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. 
Final study drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction.  
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in Table S –1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times. All references to performing assessments, procedures, and evaluations at the clinic, both in 
Table S -1 and in other parts of this protocol, should be understood as including the option of 
performing these at the subject’s home in the presence of a member of the clinical site staff 
and the subject’s caregiver.  
6.1 Screening  Assessments 
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State  Examination 
The MMSE is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas: the time and place of testing, repeating lists of words, a rithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing. Only subtraction of serial 7s will be used in this study; spelling the word ‘world’ backwards option should not be used. The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for cognitive impairment. 
6.1.2 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  
The NPI was developed to assess psychopathology in dementia patients ( Cummings et al. 
1994). The original NPI evaluated 10 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: 
delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, 
disinhibition, and aberrant motor behavior. Two other domains, nighttime behavior 
disturbances and appetite and eating abnormalities, were subsequently added to the NPI (Cummings 1997).

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 41 of 73 At Screening  (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2 ), the degree of the patient’s neuropsychiatric 
symptoms will be evaluated using two  of the domains of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI), Domain A (Delusions) and  Domain B (Hallucinations). 
6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
All scales should be conducte d in the “on” state.   
6.2.1 Functional Status Questionnaire  
The Functional Status Questionnaire is a self -administered questionnaire that provides an 
assessme nt in ambulatory patients of physical, psychological, social, and role function 
(Jette et al. 1986). It comprises 34 core items that produce 6 summary scale scores :  
• Basic activities of daily living (eating, dressing, bathing, moving in and out of bed or 
chair, walking indoors e.g., in the home)  
• Intermediate activities of daily living  (walking several blocks; walking one block or 
climbing one flight of stairs; house cleaning, yard work, or home maintenance; doing 
errands e.g., grocery shopping; driving a car or using public transportation; doing vigorous activities e.g., running, lifting heavy objects , participating in strenuous 
sports) 
• Psychological function and mental health (been a very nervous person ; felt calm and 
peaceful; felt downhearted and blue; be en a happy person; fe lt so down in the dumps 
that nothing could cheer you up) 
• Social/role function  
o Work performance ( done as much work as others in similar  jobs, worked  
for short periods or taking frequent rests because of your health, work ed 
your regular number of hours, done your job as carefully and accurately as others with similar jobs,  work ed at your usual job but with some changes 
because of your health, feared  losing your job because of your health)  
o Social activity (h ad difficulty  visiting with relatives an d friends, had 
difficulty participating in community activities [e.g., religious services, social activities, volunteer work ], had difficulty  taking care of other people 
[e.g., family members]) 
o Quality of interaction (isolated yourself from people around you, acted 
affectionate toward others, acted irritable toward those around you, made 
unreasonable demands on family and friends, gotten along well with other 
people).

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 42 of 73 It also includes 6 single- item scores (work situation ; days per month in bed due to illness or 
injury; days per month when illness injury reduced activities normally performed for half a 
day or more ; satisfaction with sexual relationships; satisfaction with own health; frequency of 
social interaction).  
6.2.2 Schwab and Engla nd A ctivities of Daily Living  Scale (Caregiver and Patient 
Version)  
The Schwab & England ADL Scale is widely used in PD. It is rated by physicians, patients, 
or staff using a 0% to 100% scale with 10% intervals, where 100% is “Completely independent. Unawa re of difficulty” and 0% is “Vegetative functions...Bedridden” 
(Schwab  and England 1969; McRae et al. 2000 ). 
6.2.3 Movement Disorders Society – Unified Parkinson’ s Disease Rating Scale Parts I 
and II (Caregiver and Patient Version)  
The MDS -UPDRS is a comprehensive battery of motor and behavioral indices derived from 
the Columbia Scale ( Fahn et al. 1987). The MDS -UPDRS Parts I and II will be used to assess 
Non-Motor Aspects of Experiences in Daily Living (nM- EDL)  (Part I) and Motor Aspects of 
Experience of Daily Living (M- EDL)  (Part II) and consist of 13 items  each  (Goetz et al. 
2008).  
Part I has two components: Part IA concerns a number of behaviors that are assessed by the 
Investigator with all pertinent information from patients and caregivers, and Part IB is 
completed by the patient with or without the aid of the caregiver, but independently of the Investigator. These sections can, however, be reviewed by the rater to ensure that all 
questions are answered clearly, and the rater can help explain any perceived ambiguities. Part II is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part IB, but can be reviewed 
by the Investigator to ensure completeness and clarity.  
6.2.4 Clinical Global Impression – Improvement - Hallucinations  and Del usions  
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the improvement in the 
subject’s symptoms at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at Baseline 
(Guy 1976).  Severity ratings should be based on the behavioral domains of clinical concern , 
namely hallucinations and delusions. 
6.2.5 Clinical Global Impression – Severity - Hallucinations and Delusions  
The CGI –S scale is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the severity of the 
subject’s neuropsychiatric symptoms at the time of assessment using the Investigator’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder (Guy 1976).

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 43 of 73 Severity  ratin gs should be based on the behavioral domains of clinical concern, namely 
hallucinations and delusions. 
6.2.6 Patient Global Impression of Improvement - Hallucinations and Delusions  
The PGI -I is a global index used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy . It is a 
simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to subjects and clinicians. 
The PGI -I asks the patient to rate their symptoms now, as compared with how it was at 
Baseline before beginning treatment, ranging from 1=very much better to 7=very much worse. Severity ratings should be based on the behavioral domains of clinical concern, namely hallucinations and delusions. 
6.2.7 Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool  
The VRFCAT is a tablet -based assessment that simulates key  instrumental activities of daily 
living ( iADL s) in a realistic and interactive virtual environment. With demonstrated 
sensitivity to basic functional capacity deficits, the VRFCAT was developed to improve 
clinical trials by detecting functionally meaningf ul improvements in patients’ everyday lives 
(Ruse et al . 2014). The brief  (VRFCAT shorte ned-list) version will be utilized for this study.  
6.2.8 Caregiver Strain  Index  
The Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) is a tool that can be used to quickly identify families with potential caregiving concerns. It is a 13- question tool that measures strain related to  care 
provision. There is at least one item for each of the following major domains: Employment, Financial, Physical, Social and Time. Positive responses to seven or more items on the index indicate a greater level of strain. This instrument can be used to  assess individuals of any age 
who have assumed the role of caregiver for an older adult ( Robinson 1983; Pe arlin et al. 
1990).   
6.2.9 Neuropsychiatric Inventory  – Questionnai re Nighttime  Behavior Domain  
The NPI -Q was developed and cross-validated with the standard NPI to provide a brief 
assessment of neuropsychiatric symptomatology ( Kaufer et al. 2000). The NPI -Q is a 
self-administered questionnaire completed by informants abo ut patients for whom they care. 
Of the 12 domains in the full questionnaire, only the Nighttime Behavior domain will be completed by informants in this study. 
6.2.10 Geriatric Depression Scale (Short Form)  
The Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) (Short Form) may be used with healthy, medically ill 
and mild to moderately cognitively impaired older adults. It has been extensively used in 
community, acute care, and long-term care settings. The GDS was found to have a 92% 
sensitivity and an 89% specificity when evaluated against diagnostic criteria. The validity and

validation study comparing the Long and Short Forms of the GDS for self-rating of 
symptoms of depression, both were successful in differentiating depressed from non-
depressed ad ults with a high correlation (r = 0.84, p <0.001) ( Sheikh and Yesavage 1986; 
Yesavage et al. 1983;  Stanford/V A/NIA Aging Clinical Resource Center, 2019) . 
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Columbia -Suicide Sev erity Rating Scale 
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
determine risk ( Posner et al. 2011). The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of ideation, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The C -SSRS will be used to assess suicidal ideations and behaviors. The Baseline/Screening 
version will be administered at Visit 1 (Screening), and the “Since Last Visit” version will be administered at all other designated visits. The C -SSRS result s for each subject should be 
reviewed by the Inves tigator at each visit. If at any time the C -SSRS results for a given 
subject reveal potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical significance of such results. If a clinically sign ificant risk of suicidality is identified for a 
subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate 
treatment ( Section  4.4).  
This assessment is to be completed at all clinic visits.  
6.3.2 Physical Examinations 
A physical examination including neurological exam (cranial nerves, motor, sensory, reflexes, 
gait, and coordination) will be conducted. 
6.3.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature, resting respiration rate, sitting  or supine systolic  
and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. Blood pressure should be measured after the 
subject has been sitting or supine for ≥ 3 minutes.  
6.3.4 Height , Weight, and Body Mass Index  
Height and weight will be measured and reported . 
Body m ass index will be calculated using the following formula: 
Weight (kg) / [height (m)]

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 45 of 73 6.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be complete, standardized recordings. All ECGs will be centrally read; 
the interpretation by the central cardiologist is c onsidered the official interpretation. Each 
ECG will  be recorded continu ously for 5 minutes.  
The five minutes of ECG data will be converted into a Summary ECG (simulated 10-second 
ECG) for each subject. The summary ECG is created by first calculating a me dian beat for 
each lead based  on all normal, good-quality beats in the lead, using standard methods and 
then linked together with an intervening RR interval equal to the average for the entire 
record. The full ECG will be evaluated algorithmically  and over- read by a cardiologist. The 
over- reading cardiologist will review the entire 5 -minute recording for arrhythmias and , if 
present, will add them to the interpretation of the summary ECG  
The following conditions apply: 
• If the  QTcF value from the ECG done at Screening is prolonged due to an identifiable 
cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat ECG may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. In this case, the 
repeat ECG will be used in determination of subject eligibility.  
• At Ba seline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by the central cardiologist indicates 
QTcF outside of the allowable range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, 
but enrollment of the subject will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
The subject must rest in a supine position for at least 3 minutes before the ECG is obtained. 
ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF and QTcB intervals) will be 
included and summarized in the subject's study records. 
6.3.6 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA
1c at Screening  only) is encouraged,  but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory evaluations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Clinical chemistry serum tests  
o Sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), 
magnesium (Mg), carbon dioxide (CO 2), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine 
(CR), uric acid  
 Mg should only be performed at Visit 1 (Screening)

o Glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA 1c) 
 HbA 1c should only be performed at Visit 1 (S creening ) 
o Glucose 
o Albumin (ALB), total protein  
o Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4, if TSH is out of range 
 TSH/free T4 should only be performed at Visit 1 (Screening) 
o Creatine kinase (CK)/creatine phosphokinase (CPK)  
o Lipid panel 
 Total cholesterol,  high-density lipoprotein ( HDL )-cholesterol, trig lycerides, 
low-density lipoprotein ( LDL )-cholesterol, c holesterol/HDL ratio, non- HDL 
cholesterol  
• Pregnancy test  
o A serum  pregnancy test should only be performed at Visit 1  (Table 6–1) for 
women of childbearing potential 
o A urine pregnancy test should be performed at Baseline and all subsequent visits 
(except Visit  3) up to and including EOT  (Table 6–1) for women of child- bearing 
potential  
 If urine cannot be obtained in women of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test should be done in its place  
• Hematology tests  
o Complete blood count (CBC) including: 
 White blood cell (WBC) count 
 Complete differential (relative and absolute)  
 Hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin, red blood cells (RBC), platelets

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 47 of 73 • Urinalysis  
o Blood, RBCs, WBCs, protein, glucose, ketones, specific gravity, pH 
o Reasonable efforts should be made to collect a urine sample from all subjects. 
Where collection of a urine sample proves impractical or impossible (e.g., because 
the subject is in continent), failure to collect a urine sample should be recorded in 
the subject’s CRF, and will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
• Urine toxicity screen  
o Urine toxicity screen will test for controlled substances at screening . The 
following controlled s ubstances may  be tested with a urine toxicity screen 
according to the schedule presented in Table 6–1: a mphetamine , barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, cocaine, methadone, morphine/opiates, methampheta mine, 
marijuana (THC), phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy ( 3,4-methylenedioxy-
methamphetamine  [MDMA ]). Negative drug screens are required for study 
eligibility . 
o Subjects who test positive and have a valid prescription for a controlled substance 
may be retested i f they agree to abstain from the medication for the length of their 
participation in the study. The repeat test, and any other tests, must be negative for 
them to participate in the study.  
Laboratory evaluations will be completed according to the schedule presented in Table 6 –1 
and procedures detailed in the study laboratory manual. Additional safety testing may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator or designee.

6.4 Safety Follow- up 
A 30- day safety follow -up telephone contact is to be completed for subjects who complete 
the treatment p eriod  of the study as well as those who discontinue prematurely from the 
study. Subjects should have the following complet ed at least 30 days  after last dose of study 
drug: 
• Assessment of concomitant medications/treatments  
• Assessment of AEs  
6.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator and may include any safety 
evaluations deemed by the Investigator to be clinically indicated. The following safety 
assessments will typically be performed; however, these are not required and other 
assessments besides the following may be performed  as needed: asses sment of AEs, 
assessment of concomitant medicat ions/treatments, me asurement of vital signs, and 
suicidality assessment.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporal ly associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered 
related to study drug”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 49 of 73 judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., 
off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
A suspected advers e reaction is any A E for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at 
Baseline. 
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject 
is hospitalized for observation 
• Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is immediately life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospitalization  
• Prolongs existing hospitalization 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring) 
• Is medically significant  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 50 of 73 Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject  at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it oc curred i n a more severe form, might 
have caused death. 
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined by the Sponsor as a full  admission to the hospital for diagnosis and 
treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospitalization.  
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization 
include: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures  
• Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may requi re medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 51 of 73 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3- point scale and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
• Severe:  incapacitating and/or p reventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE s hould be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if there is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
• Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge 
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of concomitant me dications 
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
7.2.2.1 Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the fol lowing criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
• Stop : Date when AE either ceased  permanently or changed in severity  
7.2.2.2 Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 52 of 73 • Recurrent : More than one discrete episode with the same severity  
7.2.2.3 Action Taken With Study Drug  
• Dose not changed:  No change in study drug 
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily  stopped 
• Drug withdrawn : Study drug discontinued permanently 
• Not applicable 
• Unknown  
7.2.2.4 Therapy  
• None : No new treatment instituted  
• Medication : New treatment initiated as a direct result of AE  
• Other: Other action required  
7.2.2.5 Outcome 
• Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Recovered or resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved : Not recovered or not resolved  
• Fatal : Death due to an AE 
• Unknown: Unknown 
7.2.2.6 Seriousness  
• Not serious  
• Serious  
7.2.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severit y of which is not consistent with the information  provided in the 
Reference Safety Info rmation section of the current pimavanserin Investigator’s brochure. 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
Adverse events will be recorded from th e time informed cons ent is  obtained through the 
safety follow-up period. All AEs must be either resolved or stable at the end of the safety 
follow-up period. If ongoing at the end of the safety follow-up period, the subject should be referred for appropria te treatment.  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 53 of 73 In the event that a subject discontinues and has an ongoing AE at the time of discontinuation 
(Section 4.4.1) or is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject should be 
followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new chronic baseline has been established. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must re cord all observed AEs and all reported AEs . At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the last report  or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication  page.  
All AEs, seriou s and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropria te 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms 
(e.g., “cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor or designee to the regulatory authorities is a regulatory 
requirement . Each regulatory authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs ba sed 
upon established criteria. 
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee ; use 
the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting. At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible Institutional Review Board ( IRB), as per applicable regulatio ns. These will be provided by 
the Sponsor after their assessment.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these 
expedited reports, and any new and significant information,  to the responsible IRB. 
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 of 73 When an SAE occurs, Investigators will review all documentation related to the event and 
will complete the paper SAE form (for initial and/or follow -up information) and fax or email  
(within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact information provided on t he SAE  form. 
Subjects will be followed through the safety follow -up period for 30 days after last dose of 
study drug for any SAEs and/or other reportable information  until such events have resolved 
or the Investigator, in conjunction with the Sponsor, deems them to be chronic or stable. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject  will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the informed consent form 
(ICF). All subjects  experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon 
as is feasible following the report of the SAE. 
Serious AEs occurring greater than 30 days after last dose of study drug should be reported if 
in the judgment of the Investigator there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have 
been caused by the product. 
SAEs should also be reported to the institutional review board/ethics com mittee  (IRB/EC) 
according to local regulations. 7.4.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the Pregnancy form within 
24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee. Any female subject  who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the pregnancy outcome. 
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
should also be repor ted via the SAE form . 
7.4.3.1 Reporting Paternal Drug Exposure 
Paternal drug exposure is defined as a father’s exposure to a medicinal product before or 
during his partner’s pregnancy. Any paternal drug exposure cases must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the Pregnancy form. Any AEs that are the 
consequence of paternal drug expos ure and which meet the criteria for serious must also be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the SAE form . 
7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to the Sponsor or designee on the Overdose form within 24 hours of discovery. In addition, all events of overdose are to be captured as protocol deviations.

Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section 11 . 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human 
subjects are protected, t hat the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements. Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan 
document. 
9 STATISTICAL  METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be 
approved by the Sponsor prior to database lock. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
No formal testing of efficacy or safety hypotheses is planned. Efficacy and safety outcomes 
will be summarized descriptively.  
9.3 Sample Size Determination  
This is an exploratory study and is not powered for statistical significance. Formal sample size calculations were not used to determine sample size.  
9.4 Subject Populat ions for Analysis 
The Safety Analysis Set  will consist of all subjects who have taken at least 1  dose of study 
drug. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The Full Analysis Set  will consist of all randomized subjects who have taken at least 1  dose 
of study drug and have both a Baseline value and at least 1 post-B aseline v alue for the m FSQ 
total score. The Full Analysis Set will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
9.5 Statistical Analyses 
All safety and efficacy measures will be summarized  using descriptive statistics.  
For continuous variables, the following summary statistics will be provided: number of 
subjects, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
median. For categorical variables, summaries will in clude the number and percentage of 
subjects in each category, using the number of subjects with non-missing values as the denominator for the percentages (unless otherwise specified).

Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 56 of 73 All efficacy analyses will be based on the Full Analysis Set. All confid ence intervals will be 
2-sided  95% CIs , unless stated otherwise. 
Baseline is defined to be the last non-missing value prior to the first dose of study drug. 
9.5.1 Primary  Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to Week 16 in the m FSQ total s core, 
will be evaluated using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The response 
variable is the change from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 and the fixed  effects include 
visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16), corresponding Baseline score, and th e Baseline score -by-visit 
interaction. The mFSQ total score will be calculated as the unweighted mean of the subscale 
scores  (Basic ADL, Intermediate ADL, Psychological Function, Social Activity and Quality 
of Social Interaction ). The Work Performance  subs cale will be excluded , given the age and 
non-employment status of the intended patient population.   Summary statistics for the mFSQ total score (observed and change from Baseline), least-
squares (LS) means and the corresponding 95% CI  will be presented.  
9.5.2 Secondary Analyses 
The change from Baseline  to Week 16 in the secondary endpoints measured at scheduled 
visits, including Schwab & England ADL Scale (Patient and Caregiver), MDS- UPDRS Part I 
(Patient and Caregiver), and MDS- UPDRS Part II (Patient and Caregi ver) will be 
summarized usin g an MMRM model similar to that described for the primary analysis, 
except that the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed will be included in the model instead of the Baseline m FSQ total score.  
For CGI- I the response var iable is the observed score at Week 16  and the MMRM will 
include fixed effects for visit (Week 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16), Baseline CGI- S score, and Baseline 
CGI-S score-by- visit interaction.  
For PGI -I the response variable is the observed score at Week 16 and t he MMRM model will 
include a fixed effect for visit (Week 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16). 
9.5.3 Exploratory Analyses 
The change from Baseline to Week 16 in the exploratory endpoints measured at scheduled 
visits, including individual m FSQ subscales , Caregiver Strain Index total score , NPI -Q 
Nighttime Behavior domain  severity  and caregiver distress, Geriatric Depression Scale (Short 
Form), and the VRFCAT (to tal time to complete, total number of errors, and total number of 
forced progressions), will be summarized using an MMR M model similar to that described 
for the primary analysis, except that 1) the Baseline value of the endpoint being analyzed will 
be incl uded in the model instead of the Baseline mFSQ total score; and 2) VRFCAT is not

exploratory analyses may be conducted on the VRFCAT data to adjust for deficits of 
cognition. 
In addition to the Week 16 timepoint, each of the primary, secondary, and exploratory 
endpoints will also be assessed at all other timepoints  (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) using the 
MMRM models described in Sections 9.5.1, 9.5.2, and 9.5.3. These additional timepoints will 
be considered exploratory. 
9.5.4 Safety Analyses 
Safety results will be summarized using descriptive statistics using the Safety Analysis Set.  
9.5.4.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be classified into standard terminology using the M edical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . All AEs will be listed.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that started after the first administration of study drug and no 
later than the last administration of study drug plus 30 days. All TEAEs, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by maximum severity, fatal TEAEs,

10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION 
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities. 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors ), regulatory authorities (including inspectors), 
and the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records). Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study. The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was derived. 
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation). T his data will be  entered into  a validated electronic data 
capture (EDC ) database by trained site personnel  and/ or transferred electronically into ED C, 
as applicable. The source documentation may consist of source notes captured by site 
personnel as well as laboratory reports, ECG reports, and electronic source data.  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 of 73 10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC system on eCRFs and/or 
transferred electronically and securely for data review . The Investigator and his or her site 
personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The Investigator is responsible for 
the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on the eCRFs. All information 
requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject  identification  data, visit 
date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will require explanation . All 
information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation (unless the eCRF is considered the source) at the site.  
10.4 Conf identiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymity is maintained as described below . 
On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects  must be 
identified by a s ubject  identification number only. Subject identifiers uniquely identify 
subjects within the study and do not identify any person specifically. Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or designees (e.g., signed ICFs, medical records submitted with SAE reporting) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or ot her applicable laws or ICH guidance on GCP. Data collection 
and handling should comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation  
(EU GDPR ), where applicable. A cadia has assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) as per 
the EU GDPR . 
10.5 Study Rec ords Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH GCP guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject- related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug. Investigators should maintain all essential study documentation, for a period of at least 2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can 
notify an Investigator or vendor  when any records may be discarded. Investigators should 
contact  the Sponsor before destroying any files. 
10.6 Protoco l Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed ; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study . 
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 61 of 73 Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any c ircumstances . 
If, during the course of a subject’s post-enrollment participation in the trial it is discovered 
that the subject did not meet all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unless the 
discontinuation presents an unacceptable medic al risk . The justification to allow the subject 
to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major 
protocol deviation and not a waiver. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed  and 
documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.4). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB /EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as eith er an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative  aspects of the trial . 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes 
methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the 
trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s ri sk management approach includes the following 
activities:  
• Critical Process and Data Identification: during protocol development, risks of processes and data that are critical to ensure human subject protection and the 
reliability of trial results  are identified and assessed . 
• Risk Identification: risks to critical trial processes, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified. 
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by considering the followi ng factors: (a) 
likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data integrity, 
and (c) detectability of errors.  
Study: ACP -103-063  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amend ment 1   Date: 20 May 20 21 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 62 of 73 • Risk Control: risks that can be reduced (e.g., mitigating) or can be accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and 
implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality 
tolerance li mits are to be defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject 
safety or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for 
issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided.  
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk management activities during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the clinical study report (CSR).  
11.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or designees and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contacting 
and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, 
inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, a certain percentage 
of sites participating in this study will be audited. T hese audits may include a r eview  of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related 
records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the protocol, 
ICH guidance on GCP, and appli cable regulatory requiremen ts. 
The Sponsor’s or designee ’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject  
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with appli cable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 72 of 73 Appendix B  Prohibited and Restricted Concomitant Medications: Inhibitors and 
Inducers of Cytochrome P 450 Enzyme 3A4 
The information presented here is intended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP 3A4 enzyme ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors and inducers. Any questions 
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or appropriate designee.  
Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Subjects who have previously taken a prohibited medication during the study will be 
withdrawn from the study unless:  
• the prohibited medication h as been discontinued AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject to continue in the study will be made by the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor with medical input from the Investigator, and will be documented. 
If allowed to remain in the study, this will be reported as a major protocol deviation and not a 
waiver.  
The metabolism of pimavanserin is affected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in an increase in maximum plasma concentration (C
max) and area under the plasma concentration-
time curve (AUC) of approximately 3- fold. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are to be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half- lives  prior to 
investigational product administration, whichever is longer. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are to be stopped 30 days or 5 half -lives  prior to investigational product administration, 
whichever is longer. Moderate inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are allowed but should be used with caution.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration -, dose -, and preparation -
dependent . Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain 
preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, s ingle strength) . (FDA Drug Development and Drug Interactions

5 INTRODUCTION
5.1 Study Rationale and Background
HYDRAGL YDE (poly oxyethylene-polyoxybutylene), developed by  Alcon Laboratories, Inc., 
is a proprietary  surfactant with a large h ydrophilic component that brings moisture to lens 
surfaces. HYDRAGL YDE technology  is used in premium lens care solution products from 
Alcon, including OPTI -FREE PUREMOI ST MUL TI-PURPOSE DI SINFECTI NG
SOL UTION, and AOSEPT  PLUS with HYDRAGL YDE Cleaning and Disinfecting Solution 
(marketed as CLEAR CARE PL US with HYDRAGL YDE Moisture Matrix in the US). These 
lens care products are speciall y designed to improve the wettability of reusable SiHy lenses; 
which are particularly  prone to surface de -wetti ng (Keir 2013).
The AIR OPTIX brand of SiHy contact lenses (lotrafilcon B with plasma surface technology ) 
has been shown to resist lipid deposition better than other SiHy contact lenses and maintain 
good surface wettability  even after 30 day
s of wear (Nash 2014). However , switching to 
HYDRAGL YDE containing lens care products has been shown to significantly  improve 
patient -reported comfortable lens wear time when used to clean and disinfect AIR OPTIX 
Aqua contact lenses (TDOC -0051 197 CSR for Protocol L CD913 -P001 and TDOC -0013454
CSR for Protocol C -09-074).
In order to provide the benefits of this surfactant on the first day  of wear , HYDRAGL YDE 
(0.04% EOBO -41 poly oxyethylene-polyoxybutylene) has been added to the packaging 
solution of AIR OPTIX Aqua lenses. Th e addition of HYDRAGL YDE to the packaging 
solution of AIR OPTIX plus HYDRAGL YDE lenses has shown to interact with the lens 
surface and significantl y improve the wetting substantivity  of the lens (Lemp 2016), 
providing a longer lasting moisture ef fect.
Theoverall objective of this clinical study  is to compare the on -eye performance of a 
HYDRAGL YDE regimen of lenses and lens care with a regimen of marketed SiHy lenses 
and marketed multipurpose solutions that do not contain HYDRAGL YDE .

8 SUBJECT POPULA TION
The study  population includes approximately  256 subjects to be randomized at approximately  
8 sites, with approximately  14 to 50 subjec ts randomized per site . To participate in the study , 
subjects must be 18 y ears old or older , current full -time wearer  
 of samfilcon A, comfilcon A, senofilcon C 
monthly  replacement or senofilcon A 2
-week replacement spherical lens eswithin the power 
range of lens power savailable for the test AOHG , and currently  using (during the past 
1month) a MPS (excluding 
OFPM) to care for their lenses. Approximately  64 subjects per 
habitual lens ty pe will be randomized and recruitment of brands b y sites will be competitive.
Subjects must sign the informed consent form. Subjects must be willing to discontinue 
artificial tears during the study  and rewetting drops on the day s of study  visits ,
 
 
 The complete inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Section 1.
The enrollment for the study  is planned for approximately  8 weeks. The expected duration of 
subject participation in the study  isup to 40 day s and treatment will be 30 (+3) day
s for all 
subjects  
An advertisement may  be used to aid recruitment. If an advertisement is required, the 
advertisement will be submitted to the I RB for approval.

9 TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED
Upon signing the informed consent , subjects will be considered enrolled in the study  and a 
subject identification (ID) number will be assigned by entering the subject into the electronic 
data capture (EDC) s ystem by  a designated staff member at the investigational site(s). The 
qualified subject will be randomized and assigned to either AOHG or Habitual SiHy  lenses in 
a 1:1 ratio. Subjects in the AOHG lens group will be further randomized and assigned to 
either OFPM or CCP  in a 1:1 ratio. 
Throughout the stud y, the designated unmasked site personnel will be responsible for the 
accounting of all stud y products and will ensure that the study  products are not used in any  
unauthorized manner .

11 Review inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine if the subject qualifies to be 
randomized in the study . The unmasked site personnel must confirm 
randomization by  entering applicable details of eligibility  in the EDC s ystem 
and obtain assignment of study  lens/lens care treatment group.
12 Schedule Visit 2 (Day  1 Insertion) within 1- 7 day s of Visit 1 (Screening).
13 Remind subjects that spectacles or habitual contact lenses/lens care solutions 
can continue to be used until the day  prior to Visit 2. Habitually  worn lenses 
can be returned or a new pai r dispensed.   
 
 
Subjects randomized to habitual SiHy /MPS must have a new bottle of the 
HMPS, identif ied during screening, read y fordispensing at Visit 3 . This can be 
accomplished in two ways for the study : 
1) The subject purchases a new bottle of the HMPS and brings it to 
Visit 2. In this case the subject will be reimbursed for their purchase. 
The unma sked coordinator must confirm the solution purchased was 
the HMPS identified during screening and that it is not expired. 
The 
unmasked coordinator will dispense the purchased HMPS at Visit 3.
2) The site purchases the subject’s HMPS and the unmasked coordinator
dispenses to the subject at Visit 3 .

10.4 Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study  after being 
randomized. Subjects may discontinue from the study  at any  time for an y reason. Subjects 
may also be discontinued from the study  at any  time if, in the opinion of the Investigator
, 
their continued participation poses a risk to their health. Dis continued subjects will not be 
replaced (ie, their subject numbers will not be re assigned/re- used).
If a subject is identified not to fulfill the eligibility  criteria for study  inclusion during the 
Screening visit , the subject will be screen failed and will not participate an y further 
in the study . The EDC s ystem will be updated to confirm the subject is a screen failure. The 
Investigator will explain to the subject the reason(s) why  eligibility  was not met and provide 
appropriate information/tre
atment, if required. The Exit form will be completed for all 
discontinued subjects and screen failures.
Should a subject exhibit any  clinically  relevant signs, s ymptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly  could be associated with suspected sensit ivity or intolerance to one 
of the study  treatments, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form. 
Observations must also be reported for occurrences not associated with an y study  treatment 
(see Section 12.3, Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs).
Any subject who exits early  from the study  should undergo all procedures outlined at 
/Exit. Additionally , the Exit Form must be completed and the reason for 
discontinuation must be identified and captured in EDC. 
Finally , to ensure the safety  of all subjects who discontinue earl y, Investigators should assess 
each subject and, if necessary , advise them of an y therapies and/or medical procedures that 
might be needed to maintain their health.
10.5 Clinical Study Termination
If the clinical study  is prematurely  terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will inform the 
Investigator and the regulatory  authorities of the termination/ suspension and the reason(s) 
for the termination/suspension. The Investigator should promptly  notify  the IEC /IRB of the 
termination or suspension and of the reasons. The Sponsor reserves the right to close the 
investigational site or terminate the study  in its entirety  at any  time, for reasonable cause. 
Reasons for the closure of an investigational site or termi nation of a stud y may include:

Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicable portions of the subject’ s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
12.4 Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below :
Intensi ty (S everity):
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is m oderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject’ s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject’ s inability  to work or engage in t heir usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definition s, as shown below :
Causality:
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasona ble possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related .

12.5 Return product a nalysis
Study  Sponsor representatives and their contact information are provided in theMOP that 
accompanies this protocol. 
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # w hich will be provided by  Study  Sponsor after the 
case is entered in the Study  Sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management Sy stem .
12.6 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y (see Section 9). If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of 
subject safet y, the Investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate Study  Sponsor 
representative prior to unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon 
the individual circumstances (ie, medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to 
contact with the Study  Sponsor . The Stud y Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which 
the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Addition ally, the Study  Sponsor may  
be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory  reporting 
requirements .
12.7 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects duri ng the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously  reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, da tabase lock). 
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to 
the medical device’ s manufacturer as per local requirements.
The Inv estigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.

corrective and preventive action should be identified, implemented, and documented within 
the study  records.
13.2 Data Review and Clarifications
The CRF data will be reviewed against the subject’ s source data b y the study monitors to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After monitoring has occurred at the clinical sites and the 
CRFs have been submitted, additional data clarifications and/or additions may  be needed. 
Data clarifications and/or additions are documented and are part of each subjec t’s CRFs.
13.3 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention
The Investigator is required to maintain up- to-date, complete regulatory  documentation as 
indicated by the Sponsor and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as part of the ongoing 
study  monitorin g. Financial information is not subject to regulatory inspection and should be 
kept separately . 
Additionally , the Investigator must keep study records and source documents until the 
Sponsor provides written approval for their destruction. If the Investiga tor retires, relocates, 
or for an y other reason withdraws from responsibility  of keeping the study  records, the 
Sponsor must be notified and suitable arrangements made for retention of study  records and 
source documents needed to comply  with national and i nterna tional regulations (generall y 
2years after discontinuing clinical development or after the latest marketing approval).
13.4 Clinical Trial Results

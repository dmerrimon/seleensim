Study design  This  is an open, single  arm  phase  II study.  
 
The study will open  in three  sites  in the U.S. Prostate  Cancer Clinical  Trials  Consortium  
(PCCTC).  
 
This  is a two-phase  design  such  that  in the first phase,  27 patients  will be accrued.  If 6 
or more  patients  achieve  a pain response  (defined  as a 30%  decline  in the BPI worse  
pain item  from  baseline  to week 8, with  a confirmed reduction at  week  12 without an  
escalation of the subjects  pain regimen from  Step 1 to Step 2 or  Step 2 to Step  3 of the 
WHO  analgesic  ladder.),  then an additional 36 patients  will be enrolled.  If fewer  than 6 
patients  achieve a pain palliation r esponse,  the study will  be terminated.  
 
Treatment  period : From  first  intravenous  administration  of study drug  to 4 weeks  
after  the last administration  of study drug.  
 
Safety  Follow -up Visit : Patients  will be evaluated  1 month  (±7 days) after  they have  
completed  treatment with  6 doses  or the patient is  prematurely discontinued  from  
treatment.  
 
Follow -up period : Patients  will be evaluated every 3 months  (± 1 week)  until  6 months  
after  the safety follow -up visit  for a total  of 2 visits.  
 
End of study : Last follow -up visit for the last patient  on study.

Statistical  
method  Primary  Analysis  
The primary  objective  of this phase  II study is  to determine  the effect of Radium -223  
on pain improvement for patients  with  symptomatic  metastatic  castration -resistant  
disease.  The primary endpoint of the study is a 30%  decline  in the BPI worst  pain item  
from  baseline  to week 8, with  a confirmed reduction at week 12, without an  escalation  
of the subject's  pain regimen from  Step 1 to Step  2 or Step 2 to Step 3 of the WHO  
analgesic  ladder. We define  this event as  a response  and propose  declaring the  
treatment effective  if the probability of a response  in the  population exceeds  0.20.  
 
A maximum  of 63  patients  will be entered  onto  the study.  A two-stage  design  that  
differentiates  between response  rates  of 0.20  and 0.35  will be used  to assess  treatment  
efficacy.  In the  first  stage  of the study 27 patients  will be enrolled.  If at most 5 patients  
respond,  accrual  will be terminated.  If at least 6 patients  respond,  an additional  36 
patients  will be entered  onto  the study.  At the  conclusion of this second  stage,  if at least  
17/63 patients  respond, the  treatment will be declared  effective.  The probability          
of declaring the  treatment  effective  is 0.10  when the  response  rate  in the population is  
0.20  and increases  to 0.90  when the  response  rate  is 0.35.  
 
Secondary  Analysis  
Descriptive  statistics  will be used to report the proportion of patients  with  various  
changes  in fatigue  scores  compared to baseline  according to  the worst fatigue  item  
(Item  #3) of the Brief  Fatigue  Inventory,  at weeks  8 and 12. Descriptive  statistics  will 
also  be used  to report  the proportion of patients  with  changes  in pain interference  
scores  compared  to baseline  based  on the interference  with  activities  item  of the BPI,  
at weeks  8 and 12.  
 
The time  to radiographic  progression will  be summarized using  the cumulative  
incidence  function.  
 
The percent  change  in PSA and bone turnover  markers  from  baseline  to 12 weeks  will 
be summarized  with  descriptive  statistics.  
 
Metabolic  response  will also  be determined  using FDG PET/CT  to assess  for treatment  
effect in bone.  
Safety analysis  Standard  safety  summaries  will be provided for treatment exposure,  patient  
  disposition, adverse  events  leading  to discontinuation, serious  adverse  events, and all

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Disease  Background  
Metastatic  prostate  cancer  is characterized by a unique  predilection for bone;  80-90%  of 
patients  with  advanced  disease  have  radiographically detectable  osteoblastic  metastases.  
With  bone  metastases  comes  significant clinical  sequelae  including bone pain,  fractures,  
epidural  disease  and cord  compression. Collectively  these  events  can cause  significant  
detriment to  patient quality  of life.  The prevalence  of baseline  bone pain in contemporary  
trials  of patients  with  metastatic  castration -resistant prostate  cancer  is estimated  between  
2-54%3; however,  there  is variability in instruments  used  to assess  pain,  many  of which  
have  not been validated  in this disease  and the study populations  have varied s ignificantly.  
Despite  the prevalence  of bone pain,  contemporary  clinical  trials  have  not addressed  an 
agent’s  ability to  palliate  pain  in a fashion that  could be  used for regulatory approval  for this 
indication.  
Establishing pain relief is a regulatory pathway  for drug  approval  in oncology,  although  the 
last agent to  do so was  in 1996 with  mitoxantrone/prednisone.  Historically,  the other  
agents  that are  FDA  approved  for use in palliating painful  bone  metastases  are both beta - 
emitting bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals,  Strontium -89 and Samarium -153 EDTMP.  
These  agents  however have  been limited for  concern for bone marrow toxicity.  For this 
reason, the  development  of novel alpha  emitting radiopharmaceut icals  that  offer  less 
hematologic  toxicity  is an appealing strategy.  
 
1.2 Treatment  Background  
Alpha  Emitting  Bone  Seeking  Radionuclide  Radium -223 dichloride  (Xofigotm) 
Radium -223,  , is a first in class  alpha -emitting radiopharmaceutical  that offers  substantially  
less marrow toxicity and  has been developed for use in metastatic  castration -resistant  
prostate  cancer  (mCRPC)  patients  with  bone  metastases.  It is unique  in that  the alpha  
radiation range  is limited to less than 100  micrometers  and therefore  highly localized with  
less damage  to the  surrounding marrow.  This  induces  double  strand breaks  in DNA  in 
contrast to  beta -emitters  that  exert lower  energy and induce  single  strand breaks  that  may  
be more amenable  to cell  repair.  
 
1.2.1 Description  
 
Clinical studies  
Based  on promising pre -clinical  data,  Radium -223  was  introduced  into  clinical  
development in 2001  and has subsequently advanced  through  the stages  of drug  
development,  culminating in a recently completed,  international randomized  phase  
III trial  (known as  the ALSYMPCA  trial)  that demonstrated  a 30%  survival  
advantage  in comparison  to placebo.  The drug is  now  FDA  approved  for men  with  
symptomatic  mCRPC  with bone metastases .4 
Initial  clinical  trials  (AT1 -BC-1) studied  31 patients  with  bone  metastases  from  
breast or prostate  cancer  and evaluated  escalating single  doses  of 46, 93, 163,  213  
and 250  kBq/kg b.w.  corresponding to  51, 103,  180,  235,  and 276  kBq/kg,  
respectively,  after  implementation of NIST  update)  as well as with  multiple  doses

 (50 kBq/kg at 3 wk intervals  x 5 corresponding  to 55kBq/kg after implementation  
of the NIST) or 125 kBq/kg  b.w.  corresponding to  138kBq/kg after implementation  
of the NIST  at 6 wk intervals  x 2). Decreases  in total  alkaline  phosphatase  were  
observed as well as preliminary pain efficacy .5 
A second  clinical  trial  of 64 patients  treated with  either 4 doses  of 50 kBq/kq  (to 
55kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST)q  4 weeks  or placebo  confirmed  
significant decline  in alkaline  phosphatase,  as well as declines  in PSA  and an  
increase  in survival  from  46 to 65 week s.6   In study  BC1 -03 of 100  patients  that  
received  single  doses  of 5,  25, 50 or  100  kBq/kg  (corresponding to  6, 28, 55, and 
110 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST  update] an ad -hoc analyses  of pain  
palliative  response  was  performed  and found to  demonstrate   pain relief  at 8 weeks  
in 40%, 63%,  56%,  and 71%,  respectively.   There  was  suggestion that  pain relief  
was  improved  at higher dose  levels.  However, the measures  utilized  to assess  pain  
were not  standard and therefore  require  prospective  evaluation with  a priori - 
preservation of statistical  power.   Single  dosing did  not appear  to induce  PSA  
declines .7   Another trial  (BC1 -04) of 122 patients  who  received 3 doses  of either  25, 
50, or 80  kBq/kg q 6 weeks  (corresponding  to 28, 55 and 88kBq/kg after  
implementation of the NIST  update) did find  that  the lower dose  group had fewer  
PSA  responders and alkaline  phosphatase  responder .8 
Collectively,  this data  led to double -blind,  randomized,  multiple  dose,  phase  III 
multicenter  trial  of Radium -223  50kBq/kg administered  every  4 weeks  for 6 doses  
compared to placebo in mCRPC (ALSYMPCA).  The primary  endpoint of this trial  was  
overall  survival,  and a 2.8  mo survival  advantage  or 31% reduction  in the risk of 
death  was  demonstrated.4 The results  of both  the interim  and updated  analysis,  
revealed  that  OS was  significantly longer  in patients  treated with  Radium -223 plus  
best  standard of care  compared to  patients  treated  with  placebo plus  best  standard  
of care.  
The ALYMPCA  trial  however  did not  address  the effect of pain palliation  in a 
rigorous  manner  or one in which  this agent could  be used for a pain label.  
Radiographic  imaging was  also  not systematically addressed.  These  are two of the 
most compelling unanswered  questions  about this  agent that can be  addressed  in 
the current  trial.  
Initial  prospective  data  about pain response  is available  from  a prior  phase  2, 
double -blind,  randomized,  multinational study  that  evaluated  the pain relief  of a 
single  injection of Radium -223  at dose  concentrations  of 5,  25, 50, or  100 kBq/kg  
corresponding to  6, 28, 55 or 110 kBq/kg after implementation of  the NIST  update)  
for CRPC  patients  with  painful  bone  metastasi s.7 The primary endpoint was  to 
measure  the pain -relieving  effect  of a single  dose  of Radium -223 based  on pain  index  
composed  of visual  analogue  scale  (VAS) and analgesic  use.  The secondary   
endpoints  included:  change  in BPI pain severity index (worst,  least and average  pain  
and pain experienced  at current time) from  baseline; BPI  functional interference  
index (general a ctivity,  mood,  walking ability,  and work,  relations  with  other people,  
sleep and enjoyment of life)  and pain relief  from  medication; duration of pain  relief,  
OS and safety.7

 Patients  (n=100) with  progressive  CRPC  with  testosterone  levels  <50  ng/dL after  
orchiectomy or on androgen ablation  therapy who  have  bone pain  ≥2 on the BPI 
were assigned  to 1 of 4 single -dose  groups  of 5 kBq/kg ( corresponding  to 6kBq/kg  
after  implementation of the NIST)  (n=26), 25 kBq/kg   (corresponding  to 28kBq/kg  
after  implementation of the NIST)  (n=25), 50 kBq/kg  (corresponding  to 55kBq/kg  
after  implementation of the NIST)  (n=25), or 100 kBq/kg  (corresponding  to 
110kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST)  (n=24) of Radium 223  administered  
IV.7 Follow -up visits  were  conducted at  2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks  post -injection to  
access  the palliative  response.  At Week 8, patients  with  no palliative  response  could  
be withdrawn from  the study. Additionally,  patients  were  evaluated annually  for up 
to 2 years  after dosing for long -term  safety and survival.  
A statistically significant  dose response  occurred  at Week 2 (P=0.035  [Jonckheere - 
Terpstra  test]).6  At Week  8 there  were  40%,  63%, 56%,  and 71%  pain responders  
(pain  index  ≤4) in the 5, 25, 50, and 100 kBq/kg groups   (corresponding to  6,28,55  
and 110kBq  groups  after implementation of the NIST) , respectively. Of  the 
responders,  6/20  (30%),  8/19  (42%), 8/18  (44%),  and 11/21  (52%)  reached  
complete  (pain index  1) or marked pain response  (pain index  2), respectively.  
At Week 8, the mean  daily  diary pain decreased  by 30 mm  average  in the responder  
group,  remained  unchanged  in the stable  group,  and decreased 12 mm  in the pain  
prog ression  group.7 The pain progression group was  allowed  to increase  analgesics.  
Up to week  8, fewer patients  in the higher dose  groups  (50 and 100  kBq/kg)  
(corresponding to  55 and 110 kBQ/Kg after  implementation of the NIST)  required  
in increases  in analgesia  compared  to lower  dose  groups.  
Mean pain relief  duration  of 44 days  for higher -dose  (50 and 100 kBq/kg)  
corresponding to  55 and 110 kBQ/kg after implementation of the NIST)  groups,  28 
days  for 5 kBq/kg  (corresponding to  6kBq/kg after  implementation of the NIST,  and 
35 days  for 25 kBq/kg (corresponding to  28kBq/kg after implementation of the 
NIST)  dose  group s.7 There  was  not a significant  dose -response  for pain relief  
duration.  
BPI data  showed  significant  dose -dependent treatment effect at  the 8-week point  
(P=0.040 [Jonckheere -Terpstra test]).7 For patients  with  a pain response,  there  was  
a significant decrease  in BPI pain severity for all 4 dose  groups  (P=0.05,  P=0.001,  
P=0.002,  and P=0.0006  [Wilcoxon signed  rank test]).  
Post -hoc analysis  showed  a significant dose -response  among  pain responders  in 
mean  daily pain at  Week  8 (P=0.008,  P=0.0005,  P=0.002,  and P<0.0001).7 Improved  
BPI functional interference  index was  also  found for  pain responders  across  all 
doses  (P=0.04,  P=0.01, P=0.002,  and P=0.02 [Wilcoxon  signed  rank test]).  
AEs were  reported for  97%  of all participants,  with  approximately half  reporting at  
least  1 serious  AE.7 No trends  were  found with  the increase  of dose  in the number,  
nature,  or seriousness  of AEs.  Differences  in AEs were  not found across  treatment  
groups.  Disease  progression was  the most frequent AE  with  an outcome  of death.  
Non -hematological  AEs most frequently reported across  all groups  were  nausea,  
fatigue,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  bone pain,  urinary tract  infection, and peripheral  edema.

 The most common hematological  AEs reported were  anemia  (11%)  and hemoglobin  
decrease  (15%), but  neither  was  dose  dependent.  
 
Clinical safety  summary  
The pharmacokinetics,  biodistribution, and dosimetry  in humans  have been  
established  (Appendix D).  When intravenously administered,  this agent is  
eliminated  from  blood quickly and taken up by bone. It is excreted  via the 
gastrointestinal  tract with  minimal  exposure  to the kidneys  and bladder  (less  than  
1-5% at 48 hours).  
Most  common hematologic  adverse  events  all grades  were  anemia  (31.2%),  
neutropenia  (5%)  and thrombocytopenia  (11.5%). Most  common non -hematologic  
all grades  adverse  events  occurring in more  than 15%  of patients  were: bone pain,  
diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting and co nstipation.  In the  ALSYMPCA randomized  trial,  2% 
of patients  in the Xofigo  arm  experienced bone marrow  failure  or ongoing  
pancytopenia,  compared  to no patients  treated with placebo.  There  were  two deaths  
due to bone  marrow failure.  For 7 of 13 patients  treated  with  Xofigo  bone  marrow  
failure  was  ongoing at the  time  of death.

1.3 Rationale  
 
1.3.1 Rationale for conducting  the study  
The prevalence  of baseline  bone pain in contemporary  trials  of patients  with  
metastatic  castration -resistant prostate  cancer  is estimated  between 2 -45%.  Despite  
the prevalence  of bone  pain,  contemporary  clinical  trials  have  not addressed  an 
agent’s  ability to  palliate  pain  in a fashion that  could be  used for regulatory approval  
for this indication.  The last agent to  establish  pain relief  was  in 1996  with  
mitoxantrone/prednisone.9 Other  agents,  such  as Strontium -89 and Samarium -153  
EDTMP,  are approved  to palliate  painful  bone metastases.  However,  both  agents  are 
beta -emitting bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals  and therefore  have  been limited  
for concern of bone  marrow toxicity.  The phase  II trial  would label  Radium -223 FDA  
approved  for use in palliating pain with  minimum  damage  to surrounding bone and  
substantially less marrow  toxicity,  allowing  better quality of life. 
 
Anticipated  benefits of the treatment  include  the following:  
 
-Palliation of bone pain with  associated  improvement in QOL  
 
- Prolongation of overall  survival,  most definitively  demonstrated  in the 
randomized  phase  II trial  
 
-Anti -tumor efficacy as measured  by chemical  parameters  of bone turnover  
 
- Minimal  toxicity  
 
Anticipated  risks  attributed  to Ra -223:  
 
- AEs: Gastrointestinal  events  (transient diarrhea,  nausea  and vomiting)

 - Transient reduction in neutrophil  count.  Mild  to moderate reversible  
myelosuppression may occur.  
 
- Ra-223  is a radioactive  drug, and may,  in the longer  term  (over  several  years),  
induce  other  primary cancers  and bone marrow  changes.  From  the data  
derived  so far  up to 2 years,  there  are no reports  of long term  toxicity.  
 
The risk profile  attributed  to Ra-223 is favorable  compared with  available  products  
in prostate  cancer.  
 
1.3.2 Rationale for dosage selection  
The dose  selected for this agent is (50 kBq  (0.00135  mCi) (55kBq  (.0015  after  NIST  
update)  administered  every 4 weeks  for 6 doses.  This  was  selected based  on prior  
studies,  including the  dose  used in the randomized; phase  III study that  
demonstrated  a 31% reduction in the risk of  death  in comparison to  placebo.  This  is 
the FDA -approved  dose.  
 
1.3.3 Rationale for correlative studies  
 
A. Imaging  
Routine  imaging studies  were  not mandated  by the  ALSYMPCA trial.  It is therefore  
not known what impact,  if any,  treatment with  Radium -223  has on standard imaging  
studies,  or the nature  of the relationship between changes  in standard  imaging  
studies  and cancer  outcomes.   Post -treatment  changes  on standard  bone  
scintigraphy and cross  sectional  imaging will  be systematically examined  in this 
study, using PCWG2  criteria.  1 
 
Unfortunately, bone scintigraphy does  not demonstrate direct changes  in metastatic  
disease,  but rather  on the surrounding bone. FDG has  the capacity to  demonstrate  
post -treatment  changes  in underlying tumor,  even  in bone,  for patients  with  CRPC.10 
Recently,  CMS  has reviewed  the evidence  of using FDG as  a post -treatment indicator  
of treatment effects  in CRPC,  concluded  that  it has utility as  a post -treatment  
indicator  of treatment effects,  and that  use of FDG PET results  in significant  changes  
in management.   Based  on studies  at MSKCC,  CMS  found that “FDG PET  CT could  be 
valuable even  for assessing  activity of bone  metastases  of prostate  cancers  in a large  
majority  of patients ”.11,12 
 
Consequently,  CMS  proposed  that  use of FDG PET/CT  when used  to guide  
subsequent anti -tumor  treatment strategy for patients  with  cancer of the prostate  is 
reasonable and necessary  under  § 1862(a)(1)(A).12 
 
Little  is known about the  anti-tumor  effects  of Ra- 223  in prostate  cancer  in regards  
to glucose  metabolism  evaluated  by FDG PET/CT.  However,  twenty patients  with  
metastatic  breast cancer  receiving Ra -223  were  recently evaluated  by FDG PET.  
Analysis  revealed  that a third of  the target  lesions  defined  as the standard uptake  
value (SUV max)>twice  normal  liver  uptake and a diameter  >15mm  on PET  CT 
showed a significant  metabolic  decrease ( >25%  reduction in SUV max  from  baseline  
or complete  disappearance  of lesions) after  2 treatment  doses.  13 FDG PET/CT  will

 be performed  on patients  in centers  where  such  imaging  is feasible,  and in patients  
who  consent to  such  additional imaging.  
 
B. Serum  Biomarkers  
The primary  serum  biomarker  that  appears  to be altered  with  Radium -223  are 
markers  of bone turnover,  more  so than  PSA.  In study  BC1 -02 (33 patients  received  
4 doses  of 50 kBq  (0.00135  mCi) corresponding to  (55kBq  (.0015  after  NIST  
update)  . at 4 week  intervals,  31 patients  received placebo), results  showed a 
significant decline  in serum  bone markers  i.e. bone -ALP (the study primary efficacy  
endpoint), PSA  response  and a delayed  time  to PSA  progression.  Overall  survival  
was  prolonged  in the Ra-223  group,  with  an increase  in median survival  time  from  
46 to 65 weeks  (full  analysis  set).  At 2 years,  10 of 33 of patients  (30%)  treated  
with  Ra-223  were  alive  compared to 4 of 31  of placebo  patients  (13%).   The results  
obtained  with  the biochemical  markers  for bone -turnover  (bone -ALP, CTX -1, 
Procollagen Type I N-Propeptide  (PINP)) and tumour  load  (PSA)  support  the 
presence  of a treatment effect during the  treatment  period  and for one  to two 
months  after  the end of treatment.  These  data  suggest that  increasing treatment to  
six injections  at 4 week  intervals may further delay disease  progression.  A 
beneficial  trend in the survival  data  supported  a treatment effect,  although  survival  
data  in 64 patients  should  be interpreted with  caution.6   However,  the ALSYMPCA  
trail  which  was  a randomized  phase  III placebo controlled trial  did show a survival  
advantage  or 31% reduction in the risk of death  with  Radium -223.  
 
C. Tiredness and  Pain  Interference  
Tiredness  will be measured  via the worst fatigue  item  (item  #3) of the Brief  Fatigue  
Inventory (BFI),  which  asks  patients  to “Please  rate  your fatigue  (weariness,  
tiredness) by indicating the  one number  that best  describes  your  WORST  level  of 
fatigue  during the  past 24 hours,”  with  rating via  an 11-point numerical  rating  scale 
anchored by zero demarking “No fatigue”  and 10 demarking  fatigue  “As bad as you 
can imagine.”   The BFI is a well -established  and validated tool  that has  been used  in 
myriad  prior  cancer  trials .14 (See  Appendix  E for a  copy of the Brief  Fatigue  
Inventory,  item  #3) 
 
Interference  with  general  activity and sleep related to  pain will  be assessed  by the 
item  from  the Brief  Pain Inventory that asks  patients  to “Circle  the one numbe r that  
describes  how pain  has interfered  with  your general  activity (or  sleep) ” using  an 
11-point numerical  rating scale  anchored by zero  demarking “Does  not interfere”  
and 10 demarking  “Interferes  completely”  (Appendix F).  This  item  demonstrates  
strong  psychometric  properties  in prior  research.15

3. PATIENT  SELECTION  
3.1 Target  Population  
Men with  symptomatic  metastatic  castration -resistant prostate  cancer.  
 
3.2 Inclusion  Criteria  
To be included  in this study,  patients  should  meet all of the following criteria:  
• Males   aged   18 years  of age and above  
• Histological  or cytological  proof  of prostate  adenocarcinoma  
• Castrate  serum  testosterone  level: ≤50 ng/dL  (≤1.7  nmol/L)

by orchiectomy or by using  a GnRH agonist in combination with  an anti -androgen, must  first  
progress  through  anti- androgen withdrawal  prior  to being  eligible.  The minimum  
timefra me to document failure  of anti-androgen withdrawal will be four  weeks.  Patients  on 
second -line (or beyond)  hormonal  maneuvers,  and patients  who  had no PSA  decline  on 
combined  androgen blockade  as first  line therapy,  need  not progress  through  AAW  in order  
to be eligible.  
• Known  progressive  castration -resistant disease,  defined  as: 
• Serum  PSA progression defined as two consecutive  increases  in PSA  over  a 
previous  reference  value  within 6 months  of first treatment,  each  measurement

or 
 
• Documented  appearance  of new lesions  by bone scintigraphy  
• ECOG Performance  Status of 0-2 (Appendix A: Performance  Status Criteria ) 
• 2 or  more  bone metastases  demonstrated  on bone  scintigraphy  
• Pain  at baseline  as measured by a BPI worst pain  score  average  of ≥ 3. The BPI worst  pain  
score  average  will be based  on the worst pain scores  completed  by the  patient  in the 7 
consecutive  pretreatment  days.  A minimum  of 4 days  of pain  scores  must be  completed  by 
the patient in the 7 day window in order  to calculate  the average  worst pain score.  The 
investigator  will optimize  the subject’s  pain regimen prior  to study entry.

 5.1 Screening/Pretreatment  Assessment  (Day  -28 to Day  -1) 
Before  initiating any screening  activities,  the scope  of the study should be  explained  to each  
patient.  Patients  should be advised  of any known risks  inherent  in the planned  procedures,  
any alternative  treatment  options,  their right  to withdraw from  the study at any time  for 
any reason,  and their right  to privacy.  After this explanation,  patients  should  be asked to  
sign and date  a research  authorization/HIPAA form  and an IRB -approved  statement of 
informed  consent that meets  the requirements  of the Code  of Federal Regulations  (Federal  
Register Vol.  46, No. 17, January 27, 1981,  part 50. 
The screening visit will  determine  patient eligibility  according to  the inclusion  and 
exclusion criteria.  The following assessments  will be performed  at this  visit:  
• Obtain in formed consent  and research  authorization  
• Record demographics  (including age) and medical  history (including prior  treatment for 
prostate  carcinoma)  
• Physical  exam  
• ECOG performance  status  
• Vital  signs  [body temperature,  blood pressure,  pulse,  respiratory rate,  weight,  height]  
• Obtain histologic  and radiologic  confirmation of disease  
• Confirm  eligibility according to  the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Perform  laboratory tests  [hematology,  serum  biochemistry,  PSA,  testosterone  level,  
bone markers]  
• ECG  
• Baseline  imaging assessments: Bone  scan, FDG PET  (in consenting patients  at centers  
that  agree  to perform  FDG  PET scans),  CT scan or MRI  of the abdomen and  pelvis  and CT 
scan of  the chest or Chest X -ray]  
Relevant information  should be  documented.  The institutional registration  should be  
finalized,  and appropriate  documents  (i.e.,  signed  informed  consent,  research  
authorization/HIPAA form,  and supporting  source  documentation for  eligibility questions)  
email ed to the  lead  site/sponsor.  
Information for patients  who  do not meet the eligibility criteria  to participate  in this study  
(i.e.,  screening failures)  should  be captured  in consortium  database  at the pretreatment  
assessment.  
5.1.1 Run -In Period (Day  -7 to Day  -1 +/- 5 days)  
During the  Run -In Period,  subjects  will self-report  pain and fatigue  using a PRO  
instrument  daily for 7 days  and record  analgesic  medication information on a paper  
pain medication diary  to establish  that their BPI  average  baseline  pain  score  is >3 as 
measured  for a  minimum  of 4 of the 7 days  (See  Appendix I for instructions).  This  
data  will be used  to confirm  eligibility based  on pain experience.   Upon  confirmation  
of eligibility,  the subject’s  registration will  be completed  and the subject  must  start  
treatment within 5 days  of registration.

 If run-in requirements  are not met  with  respect to pain score,  subjects  may be  
eligible  to rescreen at  a later  time.  
 
5.2 Treatment/Intervention  Period  (Week  1, Day  1 to Week  25, Day 169  (treatment  visits  
have  a window  of ±3days))  
Unless  otherwise  specified,  all visit procedures  are to be performed  prior  to Radium -223  
administration on the day of the visit.  Radium  -223  will be administered  every 4 weeks  for 6  
doses  at a dose  of (50 kBq  (0.00135  mCi) (55kBq  (.0015  after  NIST  update)   Because  
ALSYMPCAa  did not assess  radiographic  assessments  during treatment,  neither  
radiographic  progression  nor PSA progression should  be used to discontinue  treatment.  
However,  patients  are permitted, per FDA  labeling, to be maintained  on other  anti-cancer  
thera pies  in addition to  Radium -223  provided that  these  are not changed  in the midst of 
pain assessments.  Other -cancer therapies  must be  initiated 4 weeks  prior  to the run-in 
period.  Patients  with  an increase  in pain of 2 points  on their BPI  worst pain item  compared  
to baseline  and confirmed  at least 2 weeks  later  will be considered to  be treatment failures  
and will  be taken off trial.  In the  absence  of clinical  progression, patients  will continue  to 
receive  all six treatments,  and will  continue  treatment until  clinical  progression,  
unacceptable  toxicity,  or any criteria  in Section 5.6 Removing Patients  from  the Protocol.  
Patients  will return to  the clinic  every  4 weeks  for the  following assessments:  
• Physical  exam  
• ECOG performance  status  
• Vital  signs  [body temperature,  blood pressure,  pulse,  respiratory rate,  weight]  
• ECG (as clinically indicated  – not required at  every visit)  
• Lab tests  [hematology,  serum  biochemistry,  PSA,  bone markers  (to be done  at the Wk 9 
and Wk 13 visit)]  
• Clinician reported  adverse  events  and concomitant  medications  will be monitored  
continuously throughout  the study  
• Imaging assessments  will be performed  every 12 weeks  ± 1 week  during treatment  
period  (Week 13,  Week 25 [Safety Follow -Up Visit]): Bone scan, FDG PET  (in consenting  
patients  at participating centers),  CT scan or MRI  of the abdomen and pelvis  and CT scan  
of the chest or Chest X -ray]  
• During the  treatment period,  as outlined  in the table  above,  subjects  will self-report  
information on pain,  fatigue  and health -related quality of life via a PRO  instrument (See  
Appendix I for instructions).  Data  will be entered by the  subject daily during the  7 day 
reporting  period  according to  the scheduled  outline  in the above  table. Subjects  will also  
update  their analgesic  dairy during this  7 day  period as  well.   All PRO entries  should be  
done  at home  prior  to visits  to the clinic  for either regularly scheduled visits or imaging  
appointments.  If for any reason  PRO entrie s are done  while  the subject is  at the  clinic,  
the staff  should not  provide  any input  or assistance other  than technical  help  on using  
the system.

 5.2.1 Safety Follow -Up Visit  (Week  25±7  days)  
Once  a patient has  completed treatment with  6 doses  of Radium -223,  or the patient  
is prematurely  discontinued  from  treatment for any reason  specified  in Section 5.6 
Removing  Patients  from  the Protocol,  the patient will  complete  a safety follow -up 
visit  including the  following assessments:  
 
• Physical  exam  
• ECOG performance  status  
• Vital  signs  [body temperature,  blood pressure,  pulse,  respiratory rate,  weight]  
• ECG (as clinically indicated  – not required at  every visit)  
• Pain  scale  (BPI  Short  Form  using a PRO instrument)  
• Fatigue  scale  (BFI  item  using  a PRO instrument)  
• Analgesic  diary  
• Lab tests  [hematology,  serum  biochemistry,  PSA]  
• Adverse  events  and concomitant  medications  will be monitored  continuously

Testosterone level  (TEST)  
 
 
BPI short  form (pain  scale)  
A Patient Reported Outcome  (PRO) instrument will be performed  by patients  to assess  level  
of pain which  includes  a change  in BPI worst pain item  from  baseline  (See  Appendix I for 
instructions).  BPI functional  interference  index (general activity,  sleep) will be collected.  
 
Measure  of fatigue  
Patient Reported  Outcome  (PRO) instrument will be performed  by patients  to assess  fatigue  
using the  Brief  Fatigue  Inventory (BFI).  Patients  will be asked  to “Please rate  your fatigue  
(weariness,  tiredness) by circling the  one number  that best  describes  your  WORST  level of 
fatigue  during the  past 24 hours,”  with  rating via  an 11-point numerical  rating  scale  
anchored by  zero demarking “No fatigue”  and 10 demarking  fatigue  “As bad as you can 
imagine.”  
 
Analgesic  diary  
Records  daily intake  of analgesic  medications.  A question confirming that  subject's  pain  
medication diary has  been completed is  included  in the  PRO instrument.  
 
Tumor  Assessment  and  Bone  Scan  
 
Radiographic  disease  assessment will be obtained every 12 weeks  during active  treatment  
and every 3 months  during  the long -term  follow -up portion using PCWG2  criteria  as 
described  in Section 8.3 Therapeutic  Response.  
 
5.5 Dosing  Delays and  Dose  Modifications for Toxicities  
At each  study visit for  the duration of their participation in the study,  patients  will be 
evaluated  for adverse  events  (all grades),  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  and adverse  even ts 
that  require  study drug  interruption or discontinuation.  Patients  discontinued  from  the 
treatment phase  of the study for any reason will  be followed for  toxicity until  approximately  
4 weeks  after  the last dose  of the study drug  or until  all study  drug -related  toxicities  resolve,  
stabilize,  return to  baseline  or are deemed  irreversible,  whichever is  longer.  
Every  effort  should be  made  to administer the  full dosing regimen of  Ra-223  dichloride.  
Adjustment of dose  level  is not permitted.  
Study visits  during the  treatment period  should occur  at 4 weeks  intervals  (within a 
window of +/- 7 days).  Dosing delays  may be  instituted  under the  following  circumstances:  
Disease  progression  
The Investigator  should  delay cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  other  systemic  radi oisotope,  
hemibody external  radiotherapy  or other investigational drug until  the follow -up period.   If 
such  treatments  have  to be given during the  treatment period,  further  study drug  
administrations  must be  discontinued.   Patients  may be  on other  non-chemotherapy  anti- 
cancer  treatments,  per FDA  labeling of Radium -223,  provided  that  these  are not changed  
during the  period  of pain  assessments.

 Patients  with  a rising  PSA should not  be considered to  have  progressive  disease,  as a rising  
PSA  does  not imply lack of  clinical  benefit with  treatment radium -223.  
 
Patients  with  radiographic  progression are  not required to discontinue  treatment or to be 
defined  for this trial  as having disease  progression,  as there  are no known data  associating  
such  radiographic  findings  with  a lack of clinical  benefit with  radium  223.  
 
Patients  with  unequivocal  clinical  progression should be  considered  treatment failures,  and 
treatment under the  auspices  of the protocol  will be discontinued.  
 
Myelosuppression  
If a patient experiences  Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse  Events1 (CTCAE)grade  
3-4 neutropenia  or thrombocytopenia  lasting > 14 days,  further  study drug administrations  
must be  discontinued.  
If a patient experiences  CTCAE grade  3-4 neutropenia  the study drug administration  should  
be delayed  until  recovery  to grade 2 (minimum  1.0 x 109 /L) or better.  
In case  of thrombocytopenia  grade 3 -4 the stud y drug  administration should  be delayed  
until recovery  to CTCAE  grade 2 (minimum  50 x 109 /L) or better.  
In case  of hemoglobin CTCAE grade 3 -4, the value  needs  to recover to  CTCAE  grade 2 
(minimum  8.0 g/dL)  or better before  next study drug administration. Blood  transfusion is  
acceptable  between study  drug administrations.  
Gastrointestinal  events:  
Diarrhea:  
No prophylactic  treatment  for diarrhea  is recommended. Antidiarrheals  can be used when  
needed.  A further dose  of study medication should  not be given before  recovered  to CTCAE  
grade 2 or baseline.  
Nausea/Vomiting:  
No prophylactic  treatments  for nausea  or vomiting  are recommended,  but anti-emetic  drugs  
can be  used  when needed.  A further  dose  of study medication should  not be given before  
recovered  to CTCAE  grade  2 or baseline.  
Constipation:  
Patients  can continue  laxative  as concomitant  medication, but  start of prophylactic  
treatments  before  study drug injection are  not recommended.  Laxative  can be used when  
needed.  A further dose  of study medication should  not be given before  recovered  to CTCAE  
grade 2 or baseline.

 Patients,  who  experience  spinal  cord  compression and require  treatment with  XRT  in the 
treatment period prior  to week  8, will be taken off -study and declared  non-evaluable.  
Surgical Intervention  
If surgery  is required,  the patient should  continue  with  study treatment,  if this is considered  
safe  in the treating Investigator’s  opinion.  The surgeon needs  to be notified  that the  patient  
has been given radioactive  drug, and needs  to follow the  guidelines  for radioactive  
protection.  
Any Other  Toxicity  
If a patient experiences  any non-hematological  grade CTCAE grade 4 toxicity  lasting > 7 
days  despite  adequate  treatment,  further  study drug  administration  must be  discontinued.  
 
 
5.6 Removing  Patients from  the Protocol  
Patients  will receive  a maximum  of 6 doses  of Radium -223  on study unless one of the 
following criteria  applies:  
• Patient decides  to withdraw  from  the study  
• Symptomatic  disease  progression at  any time  
• Objective  clinical  disease  progression  
• Intercurrent illness  that prevents  further administration  of treatment  
• Unacceptable  adverse  event(s)  that may or may  not be directly related to treatment but 
that,  in the judgment of the treating physician,  makes  it dangerous  for the patient to  be 
retreated  
• General or specific  changes  in the patient’s  condition that render the patient  
unacceptable  for further treatment,  in the judgment  of the investigator  
Because  an excessive  rate  of withdrawals  can render  the study  uninterpretable,  
unnecessary withdrawal  of patients  should  be avoided. When a patient di scontinues  
treatment early,  the investigator  should  make  every  effort  to contact the  patient and to  
perform  a final  evaluation.  The reason(s) for  withdrawal  should  be recorded.  
5.6.1 Withdrawal  of subjects  from study  
Subjects  must  be withdrawn  from  the trial  (treatment and procedures)  for the 
following reasons:  
• Subject withdraws  consent from  study treatment and study procedures.  A subject  
must be  removed  from  the trial  at his/her own  request or at the request of  his/her  
legally acceptable  representative.  At any  time  during  the trial  and without  giving  
reasons,  a subject  may decline  to participate  further.  The subject will  not suffer  
any disadvantage  as a result.  
• Subject  is lost to  follow -up. 
• Death.  
Subjects  may  be withdrawn from the study for  the following reasons:

 • The subject  is non-compliant with  study drug,  trial  procedures,  or both; including  
the use of anti-cancer  therapy  not prescribed  by the  study protocol.  
• If, in the investigator's  opinion, con tinuation of the trial  would be  harmful  to the 
subject's  well -being.  
• The development of a second  cancer.  
• Development of an intercurrent illness  or situation  which  would,  in the judgment  
of the investigator,  significantly  affect assessments of clinical  status  and trial  
endpoints.  
• Deterioration of ECOG  performance  status  to 4. 
• Use of illicit drugs  or other substances  that  may, in the opinion of the investigator,  
have  a reasonable  chance  of contributing to  toxicity  or otherwise  skewing trial  
result.  
In all  cases,  the reason for withdrawal  must be  recorded in the CRF  and in the subject's  
medical  records.  
Patients  who  are withdrawn from the protocol  per reasons  stated  above will  be 
replaced,  unless  they are  evaluable  by criteria  specified  in Section 10.2.1  Analysis  
Populations.  
 
5.7 Concomitant  Medications  
Because  of the potential  for drug -drug interaction, the  concurrent use  of all other  drugs,  
over -the-counter medications,  or alternative  therapies  taken within 2 weeks  prior  to the 
start of the study must be  documented  on the case  report form  (CRF).  
Patients  receiving bisphosphonates  or denosumab  (RANK -L inhibitor)  may continue  on 
these  agents  as standard  practice  throughout the study.  
Patients  who  enter the trial  receiving prednisone  or steroids  must continue  on the  same  
dose they were  receiving at the  time  of baseline  assessment.  
Permitted  
• Pain  Regimen Modification  Guidelines:  
o An attempt to  optimize  a pain regimen should  be made  prior to  subject  
enrollment.  The investigator  will optimize  the subject's  pain regimen under  
advisement/guidance  of the 2.2014  NCCN  Adult Cancer  Pain guidelines.  Opioid  
rotation,  use of adjuvants, institution of a sustained  release  medication to  
minimize  frequent  prn dosing will  be utilized  depending on the severity of pain,  
degree  of opioid tolerance  and side  effects  under advisement/guidance  of the 
NCCN  guidelines.  Use and optimization of  short  acting  opioids  followed,  if 
needed,  by adding an extended -release  or long -acting  formulation described  in 
the protocol  reflect NCCN  guidelines.  The patient will usually be  allowed rescue  
doses  of short -acting opioids  of 10% to 20% of 24-h oral  dose  (mg) as needed  as 
per the  NCCN  guidelines.  
o At the  time  of enrolment,  the subjects  pain regimen  will be graded according  to 
the WHO  analgesia  ladder:

 ▪ Step 1- non-opioid analgesics  
▪ Step 2- weak opioid (tramadol,  codeine,  hydrocodone)  
▪ Step 3- strong opioid analgesic  (morphine,  oxycodone,  fentanyl,  
oxymorphone, levorphanol,  and methadone).  
▪ NSAIDs,  steroids  and other adjuvant non-opioid  analgesics  can be  
included  at each  step of the analgesics  ladder.  
• Treatment with  non-conventional  therapies  (e.g.,  herbs  [with  the exception of  St. John’s  
Wart],  acupuncture)  and vitamin/mineral  supplements  is acceptable  provided that,  in 
the opinion of the investigator,  such  treatment will  not interfere  with  the trial  
endpoints.  
• Subjects  may receive  standard of care  for any  underlying illness.  
• In the  event of neutropenia,  anemia,  or thrombocytopenia,  subjects  may receive  
appropriate  supportive  care  (e.g., transfusion, biologic  response  modifiers  such  as G- 
CSF or GM-CSF,  prophylactic  antibiotics,  antifungals and/or antivirals , hematopoietic  
growth factors).  
• Blood transfusions  and erythropoietin are allowed during the  study period  but not 
within 4 weeks  prior  to first dose  of study drug.  
• If surgery  is required  during study  drug treatment,  the surgeon needs  to be notified  that  
the patient has been  treated  with  a radioactive  product and adequate precautions  for 
radioactive  protection should  be applied  during the  surgical  procedure.  The patient  
should continue  with  study treatment if  considered  safe  in the treating Investigator's  
opinion.  
Concomitant treatments  other than chemotherapy  for prostate  cancer  are permissible,  
provided  that they  are started before  the patient’s  pain assessments,  and are not changed  
during the  pain assessments.  These  agents  will be recorded  in the CRFs.  These  treatments  
may include,  but are not necessarily limited to: Luteinizing -Hormone -Releasing hormone  
(LHRH) analogs,  surgery,  flutamide,  bicalutamide,  nilutamide,  estramustine,  ketoconazole,  
corticosteroids,  estrogens,  abiraterone, and enzalutamide.

 radioactive  concentration of 1,100  kBq/mL  after  implementation of the new  NIST  standard  
at the reference  date.  The product  has a pre-calibration of 14 days.  
Radium -223 is an alpha  particle  emitter with  a physical  half-life of 11.4  days.  The product  is 
isotonic  and has  a pH of 6.0 - 8.0. The radioactive  concentration at  the reference  date  is 
1,100  kBq/mL after implementation of the NIST. The product has  a pre-calibration of 14 
days.  When administered  in a day other  than the  reference  day,  the volume  should  be 
corrected according to  the physical  decay table  supplied  with  each  shipment.  
Radium  Ra 223  dichloride  is manufactured  in Norway at  a Bayer -contracted  manufacturing  
site,  IFE (Institute  for Energy  Technology),  a specialized  facility with  a long history of 
manufacturing radiopharmaceuticals.  The product  is produced  according to  Good  
Manufacturing Practice  (GMP).  
Radium  Ra 223  dichloride  is then  shipped  to Cardinal  Health  for distribution  in the  United  
States.  Cardinal  Health  prepares  individu alized  patient ready  doses  based  on patient weight  
and intended  time  of administration. The  product  is delivered  in a glass  vial,  ready -to-use 
with  a certified  activity.  Radium  Ra 223  dichloride  is shipped  in a lead  container  with  Type  
A radioactive  packaging according to  international  transportation guidelines  for radioactive  
materials.  Patient ready  doses  to be utilized  within  study  14-098/c13 -124 will  be over - 
labeled with  an “investigational  use only”  label  at Cardinal  prior  to distribution to 
administering sites.  
All study drugs  will be labeled according to  the requirements  of local  law and  legislation.  
For all study  drugs,  a system  of numbering in accordance  with  all requirements  of GMP will  
be used,  ensuring that each  dose  of study drug  can be traced  back  to the respective  
bulkware  of the ingredients.  
 
6.2 Dosage  Selected, Preparation, and  Schedule  of Administration  
If the vials  have  been  stored  in a refrigerator,  they should be  left at room  temperature  for 
1 hour  prior  to use. Ra-223 should  not be diluted  or mixed  with  any solutions.  
The dose  of Ra-223  is (50 kBq  (0.00135  mCi) (55kBq (.0015  after  NIST  update)  (unless,  
following discussions  between  the investigator(s)  and sponsor,  additional cohort(s) are  
added  at intermediate  Ra-223  dose  levels  between  25 and 55 kBq/kg).  Radium  Ra 223  
dichloride  will be administered  as a bolus  intravenous  (IV) injection (up to 1 minute) at  
intervals  of every  4 weeks for up to 6 cycles.  
The dosage  of Radium  Ra 223 dichloride  after  implementation of the new 2015  NIST  
standard  is 55kBq/kg  body weight  The patient dose  is calculated  based on date  of injection,  
a decay correction (DK)  factor  specific  to number  of days  from  reference  date  applied  to 
correct for physical  decay of radium -223  , and patient weight. A table with  DK values  
according to  physical  decay  of the study medication  will be provided  with  every shipment of 
Radium  Ra 223  dichloride.  Radium -223  is an alpha  particle  emitter with  a physical  t1/2 of 
11.4  days.  After implementation of the NIST  the radioactive  concentration at  the reference  
date  is 1,100  kBq/mL  
The volume  to be  administered  for dosing  is calculated  as follows:

Filling of the syringe  should  take  place  in a fume  cupboard  or safety bench  in the 
Radiopharmacy/Nuclear  Medicine  department.  Personnel  should wear  medical  gloves  and 
eye protection during syringe  filling to  prevent contamination of  the radioactive  solution to  
skin and eyes.  The individual  responsible  for study drug preparation will  draw the  correct  
volume  of study drug into  a syringe.  Data  regarding  activity and volume  to be  injected for  
the various  patients  should be  recorded  on the study drug administration CRF page.  
To maintain traceability,  there  is one syringe  label  set per injection, with  three  identical  
removable  stickers  with  a unique  serial  number,  in addition to  information of the 
radioactive  material.  One  sticker with  the serial  number  should  be attached to the drug  
preparation page,  the other  on the syringe  and the  third to the CRF  study drug  
administration page.  
The syringe  should be  handed  over  to the individual  who  will perform  the administration.  
There  is no need  for shielding from alpha  particle  radiation during preparation and  
administration of the patient doses.  Alpha  particle s from radioactive  decay of Radium -223  
and progeny  are easily stopped  by the  thickness  of a sheet  of a paper  or the walls  of a glass  
vial.  
Aseptic  technique  should  be used  in the administration  of Ra-223.  The investigational drug  
will be administered  as a slow  bolus  intravenous  injection.  After  administration, the  
equipment used  in connection with  the preparation and administration of  Ra-223,  is to be 
treated  as radioactive  waste  and should  be disposed  of in  accordance  with  hospital  
procedure  for the handling  of radioactive  material.  Written  information about Ra-223 and 
instruction about  handling  and administration of  radioactive  material  will be given to  study  
personnel.  
Treatment will be administered  on an outpatient basis.  
 
6.2.1 Supply, storage requirements, and special  handling  
A dedicated  person, who  has the responsibility delegated  from  the Principal  
Investigator,  will have  the overall responsibility for handling and storage  of study  
drug  at the  centre;  i.e., that the  vials  with  study  drug  are correctly received  and 
recorded, handled  and stored safely  and properly,  and used  in accordance  with  this 
protocol.  A deputy person should  also  be nominated.  The study drug  is a 
radiopharmaceutical  and should be  handled  by individuals  who  are qualified  by 
training and experience  in the  safe  handling of radiopharmaceuticals.  
 
The Ra-223  vials  must be  stored  inside  their lead  container  (of approximately  4 mm  
thickness) in a secure  facility.  The study drug should be  used within the designated  
expiration date  by manufacturer.  The radioactivity of Ra-223  is measured  by use of 
a radioisotope dose  calibrator,  calibrated  for the isotope  Radium -223.  The 
radioactivity in the vial will be controlled  at the  hospital  as part of the drug  
accountability,  upon receipt of Ra-223 and after  dispensing.  The radioactivity  of the 
syringe  will be controlled  before  and after  administration.

 6.2.2 Radiation protection  
In general, the  administration  of radioactive  drugs  involves  a potential  risk for third  
persons  due to radiation from  the patient and possible  contamination by spilt  urine,  
feces,  blood,  etc. An advantage  of using Radium -223 is that  once  injected,  both  alpha  
and beta  particles  are stopped  by the  patient’s  tissue.  Some  gamma  radiation is 
emitted from  Radium -223 and its  daughters.  However,  due to the low activity  
injected and attenuation in the  patient’s  body  mass,  the gamma  radiation outside  
the patient’s  body is  minimal,  and therefore  the product  can be administere d on an 
outpatient basis.  The patient  and his  caretakers  will receive  instructions  in 
accordance  to regulatory  requirements  regarding hygiene precautions  after  
receiving the  radioactive  drug,  to minimize  the risk of contamination.  The exposure  
rate  constants  from  patients  receiving Ra-223 or  from  handling vials  or syringes  
with  Ra-223  have  been measured  and are  felt to not be of clinical  concern.  
 
6.3 NIST  Standardization  
The quantification  of radium -223  radioactivity in Xofigo  (radium -223  dichloride;  BAY 88 - 
8223)  is based  on the primary  standardization performed  by the  US NIST.   National   
Institute  of Standards  and Technology  prepares  the standard reference  material  (SRM) using  
an official  dial setting (primary standardization)  as published.16 The NIST  SRM  is used           
to calibrate the  instruments  in production and quality  control  for both  the drug  substance  
and drug product.  Additionally,  the NIST  SRM  is used  to prepare the  NIST  traceable Ra-223  
reference  materials  which  are then sent  to the end-users  (e.g., nuclear  medicine  laboratory  
physicians  or technicians)  for dial-setting of their dose  calibrators,  to allow verification of  
the patient dose.  In 2014,  NIST  performed  a re-assessment of the primary  standardization  
based  on preliminary information suggesting a potential  discrepancy of approximately 8 - 
10%  between the  published  NIST  primary  standardization16 and results  obtained  by other  
national  metrology institutes  (United Kingdom,  Germany,  Japan).  After completion of the re- 
assessment, NIST  reported their findings17 and had issued a revised  NIST  SRM  in 2015.  The 
discrepancy in the NIST  standardization was determined  to be −9.5%  between activity  
values  obtained  using the  old reference  standard relative  to the  new primary  
standardization.  Consequently the  current numerical  values  need  to be  corrected by approx.  
+ 10.5%.  
 
The change  in the numerical  description of the patient’s  dose,  product  strength  and labeled  
vial activity does  not impact the  safety or efficacy of Xofigo.  The change  in the NIST  radium - 
223 standard has  no impact on subjects; dose subjects  are receiving,  and will  continue  to 
receive.  
 
Subjects  will receive  the same  actual  dose  and volume  that  was studied  in Study 15245  
(BC1 -06 dosimetry study)  and is associated  with  the proven safety and efficacy of radium - 
223 dichloride,  though  the stated nominal  radiation dose received  has been  updated  to 
reflect the  new standard.  
 
7. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  (AE)

IRB#: 14 -098  A (5) 
39 of 75  
 An adverse  event is  any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a research  patient  during a 
clinical  study  or within  4 weeks  post treatment,  regardless  of causality.  This  includes  
adverse  clinical  or laboratory  findings,  any adverse  drug reaction (ADR),                  
and an  illness  with  onset  during the  study,  or an exacerbation of preexisting illness  
or condition.  
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
The investigator  must assess  each  event to  determine  if it meets  the criteria  for 
classification as an SAE or serious  adverse  drug reaction.  
 
All SAEs  that  occur  any time  a patient is  on study (i.e.,  as soon as  the informed  
consent has  been signed) or within 4 weeks  of the last dose  of Radium -223  must be  
recorded, regardless  of the suspected relationship to the investigational agent.  Any  
SAE  occurring more  than  4 weeks  after  the last dose  of Radium -223  must be  
recorded  if a causal  relationship to  the investigational  agent is suspected.  
 
An SAE/ADR  as defin ed in the Code  of Federal  Regulations  (21CFR312.32) is any 
event that:  
• Results  in death  
• Is life-threatening  
• Results  in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation  of existing hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results  in congenital  anomaly or birth  defect  
• Is medically  significant in the opinion of the investigator  
 
7.1.3 Progression of malignancy  
Progression of a patient’s  malignancy should  not be considered  an AE, unless in the  
investigator’s  opinion, study treatment resulted  in an exacerbation of the patient’s  
condition. If disease  progression results  in death  or hospitalization while  on study  
or within 4 weeks  of the last dose,  progressive  disease  will be considered  an SAE. 
 
7.1.4 Life-threatening events  
A life-threatening  event is  any AE  that  places  the patient at immediate  risk of death  
from  the reaction as  it occurs.  It is not a reaction that,  had it occurred in a more  
severe  form,  might  have  caused  death.  
 
7.1.5 Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  
Hospitalization encompasses  any inpatient admission  (even for less than 24 hours)  
resulting from  a precipitating,  treatment -emergent  adverse  event.  For chronic  or 
long -term  patients,  inpatient admission also  includes  transfer  within the  hospital  to 
an acute  or intensive  care  inpatient unit.  Hospitalizations  for administrative  reasons  
or a  non-worsening preexisting condition  should not be  considered AEs  (e.g.,  
admission for workup  of a persistent pretreatment  laboratory  abnormality,  yearly  
physical  exam,  protocol -specified admission, elective  surgery).  Preplanned  
treatments  or surgical  procedures  should be  noted  in the baseline  documentation.  
Hospitalization because  of an unplanned  event will  be deemed  an SAE.

 Prolongation of  hospitalization is  any extension of an inpatient hospitalization  
beyond the  stay anticipated  or required for  the original  reason for admission.  
 
7.1.6 Significant  disability  
Disability is a substantial  disruption of the patient’s  ability to  conduct normal  life 
functions.  
 
7.1.7 Congenital  anomaly  
If the female  partner  of a male  patient becomes  pregnant  during the  course  of the 
study,  the treating physician must be  notified  immediately. All  confirmed  
pregnancies  must be  immediately reported to Bayer  and PCCTC  and recorded in 
PCCTC  Caisis  EDC.  All pregnancies  will be followed until  resolution (i.e., voluntary  or 
spontaneous  termination or birth)  and assessed  for congenital anomalies  and birth  
defects.  Patients  receiving  Ra-223 will be instructed  to avoid conception for  at least  
6 month  after last administration of Ra-223.  
 
7.1.8 Medical significance  
An event that is not fatal  or life-threatening and that  does  not necessitate  
hospitalization  may be  considered  serious  if, in the opinion of the investigator,  it 
jeopardizes  the patient’s  status  and might  lead  to medical  or surgical  intervention to  
prevent any of the above  outcomes.  Such  medically significant events  could  include  
allergic  bronchospasm  requiring intensive  treatment  in the emergency room  or at 
home,  blood dyscrasias  that  do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug  dependency or abuse . 
 
The NCI CTCAE v4.0  handbook will  be used  for adverse  event descriptions  and grading.  
 
Follow -up of adverse  events  should  continue  until  the event and any  sequelae  resolve  or 
stabilize  at a level  acceptable  to the investigator and the  study site/sponsor  or medical  
monitor.  
Events  that are not considered serious  adverse  events  include:  
• Routine  treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not  associated  with  
any deterioration in condition, or for elective  procedures  
• Elective  or pre-planned  treatment for a pre-existing  condition that  did not  
worsen  
• Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not  fulfilling the  serious  criteria  
outlined above  and not  resulting in inpatient admission  
• Respite  care  
 
 
7.2 Recording  and Grading  
 
7.2.1 Recording  
All observed  or volunteered  adverse  events,  regardless  of treatment group,  severity,  
suspected  causal  relationship,  expectedness,  or seriousness  will be documented.

MSKCC  PCCTC  LOI: c13 -124  
IRB#: 14 -098  A (5) 
41 of 75  
 A clinically  significant change  in a physical  examination  finding or an abnormal  test 
result (i.e.,  laboratory,  x-ray, EKG) should  be recorded  as an AE,  if it: 
• Is associated  with  accompanying symptoms  
• Requires  additional diagnostic  testing or medical  or surgical  intervention  
• Leads  to a change  in study dosing or discontinuation  from the study  
• Requires  additional concomitant drug treatment or other  therapy,  or 
• Is considered clinically significant by the  investigator  
An abnormal  test result that is  subsequently determined to  be in error does not 
require  recording as an adverse  event,  even  if it originally  met one or more  of the 
above  criteria.  
 
7.2.2 Grading severity  
All adverse  events  will be graded based on NCI CTCAE  version 4.0 
 
7.2.3 Attributing causality  
After grading for severity,  the investigator  must evaluate  all clinical  AEs and 
abnormal  laboratory  values  for possible  causal  relationship to  the investigational  
agent.  Causality attribution will  be decided  using  the criteria  outlined  in Table  6. 
 
 
Table  6  Relationship  of Adverse Event  to Study  Drug  
Relationship  Description  
Unrelated  AE is clearly  not related  to Ra-223 
Unlikely  AE is doubtfully  related  to Ra-223 
Possible  AE may  be related  to Ra-223 
Probable  AE is likely  related  to Ra-223 
Definite  AE is clearly  related  to Ra-223 
 
Abnormal  laboratory  values  of clinical  significance  that were present at baseline  and 
did not change  in severity  or frequency during experimental  therapy or intervention  
and those  that  can obviously be  attributed  to underlying disease  will be recorded  as 
unrelated  and will  not be considered  when  evaluating  the maximum  tolerated dose  
(MTD).  
 
7.3 Reporting  Adverse Events  
 
7.3.1 Reporting serious adverse events  
All SAEs,  events  determined  to be medically significant  by the  treating Investigator,

8. CRITERIA  FOR  OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT/THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE  
8.1 Primary  endpoint  
The primary  endpoint of the study is a 30%  decline  in the BPI worst pain item from baseline  
to week  8, with  a confirmed  reduction at  week  12 without  an escalation of the subject’s  pain  
regimen from  Step 1 to Step 2 or  Step 2 to Step 3 of the WHO  analgesic  ladder.  
The baseline  BPI worst pain score  average  will be based  on the worst pain scores  completed  
by the  patient in the 7 consecutive  pretreatment days.  A minimum  of 4 days  of pain scores  
must be  completed  by the  patient in the 7 day window in order  to calculate  the average  
worst pain score.  
 
8.2 Secondary  endpoints  
• Bone -ALP response  will be described as: 
o Percentage  of change  from  baseline  to 12 weeks  (or earlier for those  who  
discontinue  study therapy)  
o Maximum  change  (rise  or fall) in bone -ALP during the  treatment period  reported  for 
each  patient as a waterfall  plot  
• Changes  in total -ALP will  be defined  as for bone -ALP above  
• PSA  decline  will be reported  on all patients.  Using PCWG2 guidelines  1, the percentage  of 
change  in PSA  from  baseline  to 12 weeks,  as well  as the maximum  decline  in PSA  will be 
reported  for each  patient  using a waterfall  plot.  
• Progression, for those  patients showing an i nitial  decline  in PSA from  baseline,  is 
defined  as an increase  in PSA that is  ≥25%  and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir,  and which  is 
confirmed  by a second  value  3 or more  weeks  later  (i.e.,  a confirmed  rising trend).  
• Progression, for those  patients  with  no decline  in PSA from  baseline,  is defined  as an 
increase  in PSA that  is ≥25%  and ≥2 ng/mL after  12 weeks. Note : PSA progression as 
such  will not lead  to study  discontinuation  
• Time  to First Radiographic  or Clinical  Progression (TTFROCP)  based on RECIST  version  
1.1 and Prostate  Cancer  Working Group  2 (PCWG2) definitions  
• Changes  in other  bone markers:  
o Serum  C-telopeptide  (sCTX -1) 
o N-terminal  propeptide  of procollagen type 1 (PINP)  
• Radiographic  response  through  the RECIST criteria  1.1 will also  be determined using  
FDG PET/CT  to assess  for treatment effect in bone.  
• Time  to pain progression,  defined  as time  until  a >2 point increase  in pain compared to 
baseline  confirmed  at least 4 weeks  later.  
• Change  in analgesic  use assessed  by the  WHO  analgesic  ladder  
• Changes  in measure  of tiredness  measured  by the  worst fatigue  item  (item  #3) from  the 
Brief  Fatigue  Inventory.  
• Measures  of pain interference  specifically  evaluating its affect on general activity and  
sleep as assessed  on BPI 
• Evaluate  the short  and long  term  toxicity to  treatment  
 
 
8.3 Therapeutic Response  
Response  and progression  will be evaluated in this study using a combination  of the revised

IRB #: 14-098 A(5) 
Approved:  01-FEB-2017

 international criteria  proposed  by the  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  
(RECIST  1.1) committee  and the guidelines  for prostate  cancer  endpoints  developed by the  
Prostate  Cancer  Clinical  Trials  Working Group (PCWG2).  
 
Trial  objectives  are defined based  on controlling,  relieving,  or eliminating disease  
manifestations  that  are present when treatment is initiated.  Traditional  measures  of 
response  reflect when a treatment is working and measures  of progression indicate  when a 
drug  should be  stopped. Because  assessing  response  in bone (the  most common site  of 
prostate  cancer  spread)  is uncertain and the  clinical  significance  of PSA changes  in response  
to therapy  is not a reliable  predictor  of response,  measures  of response  have  been expanded  
in consortium  trials  to include  measures  of progression.  
 
 
Patients  will need  to be  reevaluated  for response  every 12 weeks  ± 1 week  during  protocol  
therapy  according to  the guidelines  below.  
 
8.3.1 PSA 
Perform  PSA testing at a minimum  of 1‐week  intervals  with  the threshold  PSA  level  
at 2.0 ng/mL To report PSA‐based outcomes,  PCWG2  recommends  that the  percent  
of change  in PSA from  baseline  to 12 weeks  (or earlier  for those  who  discontinue  
therapy) and the  maximum  decline  in PSA that occurs  at any  point after treatment  
be reported  for each  patient  using a waterfall  plot.  Because  declines  in serum  PSA,  if 
they occur,  may not  do so for several weeks,  PSA  measurements  obtained  during the  
first  12 weeks  should  not be used as the sole  criterion  for clinical  decision making.  
 
8.3.2 Measurable  disease  
According  to RECIST  1.1, measurable disease  is defined  as at  least 1 lesion ≥ 10 mm  
in its longest diameter  as measured  with  conventional  techniques  (i.e.,  CT or MRI).  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable,  a lymph  node  must be  ≥ 
15 mm  in short  axis  when assessed  by CT scan. All  tumor measurements  will be 
taken  using a ruler  or calipers  and recorded  in millimeters  (or decimal  fractions  of 
centimeters).  
 
8.3.3 Nonmeasurable  disease  
Following RECIST  1.1, all other  lesions  (or sites  of disease)  will be considered  
nonmeasurable disease.  This  includes  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  < 10 mm  or 
pathological  lymph  nodes with  ≥10 to <15mm short  axis) and any of the following:  
• Bone lesions  
• Ascites  
• Pleural or pericardial  effusion  
• Lymphangitis  cutis  or pulmonis  
• Abdominal  masses  that are not confirmed  and followed by imaging  techniques  
• Cystic  lesions  
• Lesions  occurring within  a previously irradiated  area  unless  they are  
documented  as new lesions  since  the completion of  radiation therapy

46 of 75  
 • Leptomeningeal  disease  
Note : If only a single,  asymptomatic  bone lesion is  present at baseline,  and 
will be irradiated,  the metastatic  nature  of this lesion must  be confirmed  by 
x-ray, CT, or MRI.  
 
8.3.4 Target  (nodal  and visceral)  lesions  
Following RECIST  1.1, progression in a nodal  or visceral site  (i.e.,  liver  and lung)  is 
sufficient to  document disease  progression. The  presence  or absence  of nodal  and 
visceral disease  before  and after  treatment should  be recorded  separately.  
 
All measurable  lesions  (up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ and 5 lesions  in 
total)  will be identified  as target  lesions  to be measured and recorded  at baseline.  
The target  lesions  should  be representative  of all involved  organs.  Target  lesions   
will be selected  on the basis  of size (i.e.,  the largest  area) and suitability for accurate,  
repeated  measurements  (either by imaging techniques  or clinically). A sum  of the 
diameters  (longest for non‐nodal  lesions,  short  axis  for nodal  lesions)  for all target  
lesions  will be calculated  and reported as the baseline  sum  diameters.  The baseline  
sum  of diameters  will be used  as a reference  by which  to characterize  the objective  
tumor response.  
 
Pathological  nodes  which  are defined  as measurable  and may be  identified  as target  
lesions  must meet  the criterion of a short  axis  of ≥ 15mm  by CT scan.  
 
8.3.5 Bone lesions  
On bone scan, progression  of bone metastases  is defined  as the appearance  of 2 or 
more new bone lesions.  
 
•If 2 or more new bone lesions  are observed on the first  reassessment scan only,  a 
confirmatory scan performed  at least 6 weeks  later  needs  to show  2 or more  
additional new lesions  (for a total  of 4 or more  new lesions  since  the baseline  
assessment) for progression to  be documented.  
 
• If 2 or more new bone lesions  are observed on scans  obtained  after the  first  
reassessment,  a confirmatory scan  performed  at least  6 weeks  later  needs  to show  
the persistence  of or  an increase  in the number  of bone lesions  com pared  to the 
prior scan.  
 
The date  of progression is always  the date  of the scan  in which  the change  was first  
observed.  
 
8.3.6 Nontarget  lesions  
All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease) will  be identified  as nontarget  lesions  and 
recorded  at baseline.  Nontarget  lesions  will include measurable  lesions  that exceed  
the maximum  number  per organ (2) or total of all involved  organs  (5), as well  as 
nonmeasurable lesions.  The presence  or absence  of these  lesions  will be recorded  
on the CRF  and should be  evaluated  at the same  assessment time  points  as all target  
lesions.

 8.3.7 New lesions  
The appearance  of up to 5 new measurable  lesions  should be  recorded. Each  new  
lesion should be  reassessed  using the  same  imaging  modality at each  time  point.  If 
measurable,  the diameter  of each  new lesion should  be recorded  in the CRF  and the 
sum  diameters  of new and old lesions  should be  calculated.  
 
Note : The  appearance  of a new lesion does  not by itself  satisfy the criteria  
for confirmed  progressive  disease.  Rather,  the tumor  burden imposed  by the  
new lesions  must be  evaluated within the  context  of the total  tumor  burden  
(i.e., preexisting plus  new lesions).  Confirming progression  in target  lesions,  
non-target  (i.e.,  other than b one)  lesions,  and bone  lesions  requires  2 
assessment time  points.  The first  must  occur  at Week 12 (or later)  and the  
second occurring  at least  6 weeks  after  the first.  Progression declared  at the 
first  time  point remains  unconfirmed unless  assessments  at the  second  time  
point demonstrate continuing or worsening  progression, as described  in Section 9.4.

8.4.1.  Measurable soft -tissue lesions  
When evaluating soft -tissue lesions,  the definitions  in Table  3 apply.  
 
 
Table  3  RECIST response criteria for target  (soft -tissue)  lesions  
Response  Evaluation  of Soft -Tissue  Lesions  
Complete  response  (CR)  Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any  pathological  lymph  nodes  
(whether  target  or non‐target)  must  have  reduction  in short  axis  to 
<10  mm.  
Partial  response  (PR)  At least  a 30%  decrease  in the sum  of diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the baseline  sum  diameters.  
Progressive  disease  (PD)  At least  a 20%  increase  in the sum  of diameters  of target  lesions,  
taking  as reference  the smallest  sum  on study  (this  includes  the 
baseline  sum  if that  is the smallest  on study).  In addition  to the 
relative  increase  of 20%,  the sum  must  also  demonstrate  an 
absolute  increase  of at least  5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance  of one or 
more  new  lesions  is also  considered  progression).  
Stable  disease  (SD)  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  
increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum  
diameters  while  on study.  
Abbreviations:  LD, longest  diameter.  
 
In some  circumstances,  it may be  difficult to  distinguish  residual  disease  from  
normal  tissue.  When the  evaluation of complete  response  depends  on this 
determination, it is recommended  that the  residual  lesion be  investigated  (e.g., fine 
needle  aspirate  or biopsy)  before  confirming the  complete  response  status.  
Changes  in nodal and visceral sites  should  be recorded  and reported  separately, and  
lymph  nodes  in the pelvis  must measure  at least 2 cm in greatest diameter  to be 
considered  target  lesions.  Complete  elimination  of disease at a particular  site

 should  be recorded  separately.  Any  favorable  change should  be confirmed  using  a 
second  follow -up scan.  
 
8.4.2 PSA 
As long as  patient safety  is the primary  concern,  in the absence  of other  indicators  of 
disease  progression, therapy should not  be discontinued  solely on the basis  of a rise 
in PSA.  
For each  patient,  use a wate rfall  plot  to report the percent  change  in PSA  from  
baseline  to 12 weeks  (or earlier  for those  who  discontinue  therapy)  and the 
maximum  decline  in PSA  that  occurs  at any  point after treatment.  
 
8.4.3 Bone  
Record the number  of post‐treatme nt lesions. In the absence  of clearly  worsening  
soft‐tissue  (nodal  and visceral)  disease  or disease‐related symptoms,  progression at 
the first scheduled  assessment should be  confirmed on a second  scan performed  at 
least 6 weeks  later.  In the  rare  case  where visible lesions disappear,  this too should  be 
confirmed.  
 
8.4.4 Non -target  lesions  
When assessing non -target  lesions,  the definitions  in Table 4 will apply.  
 
 
Table  4  RECIST  response  criteria for  non-target  lesions  
Response  Evaluation  of Non -target  Lesions  
Complete  response  (CR) The disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of 
tumor  marker  levels.  All lymph  nodes  must  be non-pathological  in size 
(<10  mm short  axis).  
Incomplete  response/  
stable  disease  (SD) The persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesions  and/or  
maintenance  of tumor  marker  levels  above  the normal  limits  
Progressive  disease  (PD)  The appearance  of one or more  new  lesions  and/or  
unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions  
 
A clear  progression of  non-target lesions  only is  exceptional.  
 
8.4.5 Symptoms  
BPI short  form  used  to assess  pain which  includes  change  in BPI pain severity  index,  
BPI functional interference  index.  Fatigue  based  on the BFI will also  be used.  
 
8.5 Confirmatory  Measures/Duration  of Response  
 
8.5.1 Confirming  time -to-event  outcomes  
Any posttreatment change  in disease  status,  be it favorable or unfavorable,  should  
be confirmed  using a second assessment at a later  time  point  not less than 6 weeks  
later.  
 
8.5.2 Duration of overall  response  
Duration of overall  response  is measured  from  the time  when partial  response  or 
complete  response  is first  noted until  the date  when  recurrent or progressive

 disease  is objectively  documented.  Duration of overall complete  response  is 
measured  from  the time  the criteria  for complete  response  are first  met until  the 
first  date  that  recurrent disease  is objectively  documented.  Duration of stable  
disease  is measured  from  the start  of treatment until  the criteri a for progression are  
met.  
 
8.5.3 Progression -free survival  
Progression -free  survival  (PFS) is a composite  endpoint defined  as the time  from  
study entry or random  assignment to  disease  progression  in bone  or soft-tissue,  
symptoms,  or death.  Use an interval -censored  approach  in which  all assessments  
of the composite  PFS endpoint (i.e.,  PSA,  bone,  CT scans,  and symptom  
assessments) are  performed  at the same  time  points.  All assessments  of disease  
should  be collected  at the same  time  interval  (e.g.,  bone  scan,  CT scan,  and PSA  at 12- 
week  intervals).  In addition  to PSA,  confirm  posttreatment  changes  in measurable  
target  lesions,  radionuclide  bone  scans,  and symptoms.

 The Data  and Safety Monitoring  Plans  (DSMP) at  Memorial  Sloan -Kettering Cancer  
Center were approved  by the  National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.   The 
plans  address  the new policies  set forth  by the  NCI in the  document entitled  “Policy  
of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring of Clinical  Trials”  
which  can be  found at:  http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -  
guidelines/page1 . The DSMPs  at MSKCC  were established  and are monitored by the  
Office  of Clinical  Research.   The MSKCC  DSMPs  can be found on the MSKCC  Intranet  
at:  
http://in side2/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20M   
onitoring%20Plans.pdf . 
 
There  are several  different mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials  are monitored  for 
data,  safety,  and quality.  There  are institutional processes  in place  for quality  
assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data  verification audits,  
therapeutic  response,  and staff education on clinical  researc h quality assurance)   
and departmental  procedures  for quality control,  plus  there  are two  institutional  
committees  that  are responsible  for monitoring the  activities  of our clinical  trials  
programs.  There  are several committees: Data  and Safety Monitoring  Committee  
(DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety Monitoring Board  
(DSMB) for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report to  the MSKCC  Research  Council  and 
Institutional  Review Board.  As a moderate risk trial,  this study will  be monitored  by 
DSMC  twice  per year.  
Since  therapeutic  efficacy is a stated  primary objective,  all sites  participant’s  
responses  are subject to  review  by MSKCC’s  Therapeutic  Response  Review  
Committee  (TRRC).  Radiology and additional lab reports  will need  to be  obtained  
from  the participating sites  for MSKCC  TRRC  review  and confirmation of  response  
assessment.  These  materials  must be  sent  to MSKCC  promptly upon request  
 
 
9.2.2 Data Auditing and Quality Assurance  
In addition to  review by  DSMC, PCCTC  will conduct  regularly scheduled remote  
monitoring every 6 weeks and audits  as specified  below.   Registration reports  will 
be generated by the  PCCTC  to monitor  subject accruals  and the  completeness  of 
registration data.  Routine  data  quality reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  
data  and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and the extent and accuracy of evaluations  
and follow -up will be monitored periodically throughout  the study  period,  and 
potential  problems  will be brought  to the  attention  of the Principal  Investigator  for 
discussion and action.  
Each  site participating in the accrual  of participants  to this protocol  will be audited  
at a minimum  of 10%  of all subjects,  but at least 2 from  each  site will be 100%  
source  data  verified  by the  PCCTC.  Auditing will  occur  once  shortly  after  initiation  
of subject recruitment at  a site,  annually during the  study  (or more frequently if 
indicated),  and at the  end or closeout of the trial, for protocol  and regulatory  
compliance,  data  verification and source  documentation. Audits  may be  
accomplished in one of two ways:  (1) sending source  documents  and research

 records  for selected  patients  from  participating sites  to the PCCTC  for audit,  or 
(2) on-site auditing of selected patient records  at participating  sites.  
The audit will  include  a review of source  documentation to  evaluate  compliance  for: 
 
• Regulatory/IRB  compliance  (review  of current  protocol  and amendments,  
Informed  consent  documents  and procedures,  annual  continuing  review reports,  
AEs/SAEs)  
• Protocol  defined  treatment  compliance  
• Subject records  
1. Each  subject  is reviewed  to determine  that  there  is a signed  and dated  
consent form  
2. Adherence  to eligibility criter ia 
3. Baseline,  on study and follow -up protocol  testing  
4. eCRF  completion  
 
Audit findings  will be reviewed and disseminated  to the site PIs and staff.  
 
In addition, each  participating  site accruing participants  to this protocol  will be 
audited  by MSK  for protocol  and regulatory compliance,  data  verification and source  
documentation.  Audits  of selected participant records  may be  conducted  on-site or 
remotely.  
 
Audits  will be conducted  annually at  minimum,  and more often  if significant and/or  
repeated  findings  are identified during monitoring  visits.  The number  of 
participants  audited will  be determined  by the  outcome  of monitoring visits  and 
complexity of the protocol.  
 
Each  audit will  be summarized  and a final  report  will be sent  to the PI at the  audited  
participating site within  30 days  of the audit.  The report  will include  a summary of 
findings,  participant -specific  case  review, recommendations  on any performance  
and/or  shortcomings  and request  for corrective  action, when necessary.  When  
corrective  action is  required,  the participating  site must reply  within 45 days  of 
receipt of the audit report  with  their corrective  action plan.  
 
10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study  Endpoints  
 
10.1.1  Analysis of the primary  endpoint  
The primary objective  of this phase  II study is  to determine  the effect of Radium -223 
on pain  improvement  for patients  with  symptomatic  metastatic  castration -resistant  
disease.  The primary  endpoint  of the study  is a 30%  decline  in the BPI worst  pain  
item  from  baseline  to week  8, with  a confirmed  reduction  at week  12 without  an 
escalation  of the subject's  pain  regimen  from  Step  1 to Step  2 or Step  2 to Step  3 of 
the WHO  analgesic  ladder.  The baseline  BPI worst  pain  score  average  will be based  
on the worst pain scores  completed  by the  patient in the  7 consecutive  pretreatment  
days.   A minimum  of 4 days  of pain  scores  must  be completed  by the patient  in the 7

 day window  in order  to calculate  the average  worst  pain  score.  We define  this event  
as a response  and propose  declaring  the treatment  effective  if the probability  of a 
response  in the population exceeds  0.20.  
 
A maximum  of 63  patients  will be entered  onto  the study.  A two-stage  design  that  
differentiates  between response  rates  of 0.20  and 0.35  will be used to assess  
treatment efficacy.  In the  first  stage  of the study 27 patients  will be enrolled.  If at 
most 5 patients  respond,  accrual  will be terminated.  If at least 6 patients  respond, an  
additional 36 patients  will be entered  onto  the study.  At the  conclusion of  this 
second  stage,  if at least 17/63  patients  respond,  the treatment will  be declared  
effective.  The probability  of declaring the  treatment  effective  is 0.10  when the  
response  rate  in the popula tion is  0.20  and increases  to 0.90  when the  response  rate  
is 0.35.  
 
10.1.2  Analysis of secondary endpoints  
 
A summary of adverse  events  will be tabulated  at baseline  and during treatment.  
Analgesic  use will be tabulated,  converted into  equivalent units,  and changes  in 
opiate  equivalents  before  and after treatment will be compared.   Descriptive  
statistics  will be used  to report the  proportion of patients  with  changes  in fatigue  
scores  compared  to baseline  according to  the worst  fatigue  item  (Item  #3) of the 
Brief  Fatigue  Inventory,  at weeks  8 and 12. Descriptive  statistics  will also  be used to 
report  the proportion of patients  with  changes  in pain interference  scores  compared  
to baseline  based  on the interference  with  activities  item  of the BPI,  at weeks 8 and 
12. 
 
The time  to radiographic  progression  and pain progression will  be summarized  
using the  cumulative  incidence  function. The  percent  change  in PSA and bone  
turnover  markers  from  baseline  to 12 weeks  will be summ arized  with  descriptive  
statistics.  Longitudinal  assessments  of BPI,  and tiredness  will be recorded  and 
summarized  over  time.  
 
Radiographic  progression  using PCWG2  criteria  for bone scans,  and RECIST  for soft 
tissue/measurable  disease  will be used.  The use of FDG PET imaging to  demonstrate  
post -treatment effects  is exploratory  in nature  – the impact of radium  on the actual  
cancer  cell is not known.  Furthermore,  there  is no standard method for  assessing  
post -treatment FDG PET  changes  that  have  been prospectively validated in prostate  
cancer.  Because  Ra-223 is a bone directed agent,  bone  lesions  will be treated  
separately  from  soft tissue  lesions.  We will therefore  examine  multiple  methods  of 
examining post -treatment  changes  in FDG PET  in order t o explore  which  of those  
will most  closely  correlate  with  both  pain response.  These  will include:  
 
A. We will analyze  up to  5 bone lesions.  Analysis  will be performed  either  on 
HERMES  or AWS  workstation.  For each  lesion, a five point confidence  scale  will 
be employed as  follows: 1: negative  for tumor; 2: probably negative  for tumor;  3: 
equivocal  for tumor; 4: probably  positive  for tumor;  5: definitely  positive  for 
tumor.  The SUV  for each  lesion will  also  be recorded  along with  its location .

 SUVpeak  lean body mass  will be determined  in each  of these  lesions.   The sum  of 
these  values  at baseline  will be compared  to that  of the sum  at followup.  
B. If feasible,  we will apply  the above technique  not only  to 5 index lesions,  but to 
all of the lesions,  using the  PET  VCAR  software  or its equivalent.  
C. As a comparison, we will  explore  FDG PET  interpretation using the  PERCIST 1.0 
criteria  (Wahl  et al J Nucl  Med  2009  50: 122S -150S).  
PSA  decline  will be reported  per PCWG2  criteria  1 
 
10.2 Analysis  Populations  
 
10.2.1  Evaluable population  
Responders  will be defined by a 30% decline  in the BPI worst pain  item  from  
baseline  to week 8, with  a confirmed reduction at  week  12 without  an escalation of 
the subject's  pain regimen from Step 1 to Step  2 or  Step 2 to Step 3 of the WHO  
analgesic  ladder.  
Patients  with  progressive  pain will  be defined  by time  until  a > 2 point increase  in 
the average  “worst pain”  item  on the BPI over  a 7 day period  compared to baseline  
is seen  and confirmed at  least 2 weeks  later.  
Patients  who  are neither  categorized as  pain responders  or are categorized  as ones  
with  progressive  pain will  be recorded  as non-responders.  
All patients  who meet eligibility cr iteria  and receive  at least  1 dose  of study  
medication  will be  included  in the main  analysis  of the response  rate,  even  if there  
are major  protocol  deviations  (e.g.,  incorrect treatment schedule  or drug  
administration).  Each  patient will  be assigned  to one of the above  categories.  
10.2.2  Safety population  
All patients  enrolled  in the study will be included  in the safety analysis  population  
and considered  evaluable  for toxicity and  safety from  the time  of their first  dose.  
Demographic  and baseline  characteristics  for the safety population will  be 
summarized  by number  and percent for categorical  data  (e.g., sex,  race/ethnicity)  
and by descriptive  statistics  for continuous  data  (e.g., weight, vital  signs,  EKG  
readings,  disease  status).  
 
10.3 Safety  Analysis  
 
10.3.1  Evaluation of adverse events  
Pain  will be assessed  using  PBI and fatigue  by the  BFI. 
Treatment -emergent adverse  events  will be translated  from  investigator  terms  to 
NCI CTCAE v4.0  terminology  and summarized  (number  and percentage  of patient s) 
for all patients  who  receive  at least  1 dose.  Adverse  event summaries  will be 
organized  by body system,  frequency of occurrence,  intensity  (i.e.,  severity grade),  
and causality or attribution.  Patients  who  experience  an adverse  event more  than  
once will be counted only  once.  The occurrence  with  the maximum  severity  will be 
used to calculate  intensity.

Adverse  events  deemed  serious  and those  resulting  in treatment withdrawal  or 
death  will be summarized  separately.  
 
10.3.3  Evaluation of laboratory parameters  and assays  
Selected  clinical  laboratory parameters  will be summarized  and clinically significant  
changes  from  baseline  will be discussed.

Treatment exposure  will be summarized  for all patients,  including dose  
administration, number  of cycles,  or delays,  and duration of therapy.

11.1 Roles and  Responsibilities  
11.1.1  Lead Site/Sponsor Principal  Invest igator  
The Sponsor  Principal  Investigator  at the lead  site is responsible  for performing the  
following tasks:  
• Responsibility for the  overall  conduct of  the study at all participating sites  and

request to MSKCC.  Once  approved,  MSKCC  will formally  contact PCCTC  and grant the  site 
permission to  proceed  with  enrollment.  
 
11.4 Protocol Amendments  
Before  starting the  study,  the protocol  must be  approved  by each  institution’s  IRB or 
Independent Ethics  Committee  (IEC).  Each  change  to the protocol  document must be  
organized  and documented  by MSKCC  and first  approved  by the  MSKCC  IRB/PB.  Once  
approval of the MSKCC  IRB/PB has been granted,  PCCTC  will distribute  all non expedited  
amendments  to the participating  sites  for submission to  their local  IRBs.  
 
Participating sites  must obtain approval  for all  non expedited amendments  from  their IRB  
within 90 calendar  days  of MSK  IRB/PB approval. If  the amendmen t is the result of a safety  
issue  or makes  eligibility  criteria  more  restrictive,  sites  will not be permitted  to continuing  
enrolling new participants  until  the participating site IRB approval  has been  granted.  
 
The following documents  must be  provided  to PCCTC  for each amendment within the  stated  
timelines:  
 
• Participating Site  IRB approval  
 
• Participating Site  IRB approved  informed  consent form  and HIPAA authorization  
 
PCCTC  is responsible  for submitting all  participating  site local  IRB approvals  and/or  
acknowledgments  to MSK  upon receipt.  
 
11.5 Additional IRB  Correspondences  
 
Continuing  Review  Approval  
The Continuing Review  Approval  letter  from  the participating site’s  IRB and the most  
current approved  version  of the informed  consent form  should be  submitted  to PCCTC  
within 7 days  of expiration.  Failure  to submit the re-approval  in the stated  timeline  will 
result  in suspension of new  participant enrollment.  PCCTC  is responsible  for submitting all  
participating site local  IRB approvals  and/or  acknowledgments  to MSK  upon  receipt.  
 
Deviations and Violations  
A protocol  deviation on this study is  defined  as a request to  treat  a research  participant who  
does  not meet all the eligibility criteria,  pretreatment  evaluation, or who  requires  alteration  
in their  study plan.  If a deviation from  this protocol  is proposed  for a  potential  or existing  
participant at  MSK  or a participating site,  approval  from  the MSK  IRB/PB is  required prior   
to the action.  To request a protocol  deviation, participating  sites  should  contact  PCCTC  who  
will in turn work with  MSK  to seek approval  from  the MSK  IRB/PB.  
 
A protocol  violation is  any change  or departure  from  the research  protocol  that occurred  
without  prior approval from  the MSK  IRB/PB. For  protocol  violations  that are identified  
after  they occur,  the participating site  should  report the  event(s) to  PCCTC  as soon  as 
possible.  PCCTC  will in turn work with  MSK  to report  the violation to  the MSK  IRB/PB.

responsible  for submitting  all participating site local  IRB correspondences  to MSK  upon  
receipt  
 
11.6 Written  Informed  Consent  
Before  obtaining consent,  members  of the study team  will review the rationale  for the 
treatment program  with  the patient.  The discussion  will review the  alternatives  available  
(including hormonal  therapy,  chemotherapy,  or supportive  care  as appropriate),  the 
potential  benefits  of this program,  the risks  and the probability of their occurrence,  and the 
procedures  to minimize  these  risks.  Should an adverse  event occur,  the provisions  available  
to ensure  medical  intervention will  also  be reviewed.  Why the  risks  are reasonable in 
relation to  the anticipated  benefits,  incentives,  or costs  that  will or may be  incurred  as a 
result  of participating in the study,  as well  as the efforts  to maintain confidentiality,  will also  
be discussed  with  the patient.  
Patients  will be required to sign and date  (in triplicate) a statement of informed consent   
that  meets  the requirements  of the Code of Federal  Regulations  (Federal  Register Vol.  46, 
No. 17, January 27, 1981,  part 50) and the  IRB.  The medical  record  will include  a statement  
that  written informed  consent was  obtained  (and document  the date  that  it was  obtained)  
before  the patient  is enrolled  in the study.  The original  signed  document will become  part of  
the patient’ s medical  record,  a copy  will be forwarded  to the lead  site/sponsor  pursuant to  
sponsor  registration and to the PCCTC  and a copy  will be sent  home  with  each  patient.  
The consent form  will include  the following:  
• The nature  and objectives,  potential  toxicities,  and benefits  of the intended  study  
• The length  of therapy and  likely  follow -up required  
• Alternatives  to the proposed  therapy  (including  available  standard and  investigational  
therapies)  
• The name  of the investigator(s) responsible  for the protocol  
• The right  of the patient to  accept or refuse  treatment and to  withdraw  from  
participation in this study  
• Text regarding the  PCCTC  should be  added  to all institutional informed  consent  
documents  and sections  in th e research  authorization/HIPAA forms  (e.g. , “Prostate  
Cancer  Clinical  Trial  Consortium”)

 11.7 Protection  of Privacy  
Patients  will be informed  of the extent to  which  their  confidential  health  information  
generated  from  this study  may  be used  for research purposes.  After this  discussion, they  
will be asked  to sign a Notice  of Privacy Practice  research  authorization/HIPAA  form.  The 
original  signed  documents  will become  part of  the patient’s  medical  records,  and each  
patient will  receive  a copy  of the signed  documents.  The use and disclosure  of protected  
health  information will  be limited to  the individuals  described  in the research  authorization  
form.  The research  authorization form  must be  completed by the  principal  investigator  and 
approved  by the  IRB.  
 
11.8 Terminating  or Modifying  the Study  
Adverse  event and laboratory  data  from  this trial  will be assessed  by the  lead  site or the 
sponsor’s  medical  monitor on an ongoing  basis.  SAEs  will be reviewed as  they  are reported  
to the lead  site/sponsor  and PCCTC,  and the  medical  monitor  will make  an assessment  
regarding the  safety of continuing or modifying  the study.  This  assessment will  be shared  
with  the investigators  either in writing or as part  of a teleconference.  Should  the assessment  
of either the  lead  site/sponsor  or the principal  investigator  be that the  study  should be  
terminated; the  study will be closed  to further accrual.  Patients  who  are receiving Ra-223  
will be assessed  individually by the  investigator  to see if it is in the patients’  best interest to  
continue,  which  might  be the case  for a patient  that  is responding  to the intervention.  
Follow -up safety  assessments  will be performed  for all patients  who  are terminated  from  
the study prematurely.  
 
11.9 Noncompliance  
If a participating site  is noncompliant with  the protocol  document,  accrual  privileges  may be  
suspended  and/or  contract payments  may be  withheld,  until  the outstanding  issues  have  
been resolved.

 APPENDIX  G: RADIATION  SAFETY  PRECAUTIONS  FOLLOWING  RADIUM -223  
DICHLORIDE,  INJECTION  
 
You  will be given  a card  which  informs  people  that  you have  received  radioactive  medicine,  always  carry  this 
card  with  you.  
 
There  are NO restrictions  regarding  contact  with  other  people  after  receiving  the study  drug.  
 
During  the first  week  after  Radium -223  Dichloride  injection  there  may  be some  radioactivity  in your  blood,  
urine,  and stools,  therefore  you should  take  the following  precautions:  
• Use medical  gloves  when  wiping  up blood,  urine,  stools,  or vomit,  or when  handling  stained  clothes.  
• A normal  toilet  should  be used  in preference  to a urinal.  The sitting  position  should  be used  instead  of the 
standing  position.  
• Wipe  up any spilled  urine  or stool  with  a tissue  and flush  it away.  
• If you are sick,  wipe  up spilled  vomit  with  a tissue  and flush  it away.  
• Ensure  that  you always  thoroughly  wash  your  hands  after  using  the toilet  or after  wiping  up spilled  fluids.  
• Wash  any linen  or clothes  that  become  stained  with  urine,  blood  or stools  separately  from  other  clothes  and 
rinse  them  thoroughly.  
• If you are sexually  active,  the use of a condom  is recommended  during  the first  week  after  injection  because  
there  may  be some  slight  radioactivity  in the body  fluids  (but  most  in blood,  urine  and stools).  
• If sampling  of blood,  urine  or stools  is necessary  during  the first  week  following  administration,  please  
inform  the personnel  that  you have  been  treated  with  radioactive  Radium -223.  
• If you need  medical  care  such  as an operation  or hospital  admission  during  the first  week  following  
administration,  please  inform  the personnel  that  you have  been  treated  with  radioactive  Radium -223.

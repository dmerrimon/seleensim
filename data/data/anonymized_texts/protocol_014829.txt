Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)Adverse event that led to any  of the following:
Death.
A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that 
either resulted in:
a.a life -threatening illness or injury .
Note: Life -threatening means that the 
individual was at immediate risk of death fr om 
the event as it occurr ed, ie, it does not include 
an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurr ed in a mor e sever e 
form.
b.any potentially  sight -threatening event or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a 
body  function.
c.in-patient hospitaliza tion or prolonged 
hospitalization.
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pr e-
existing condition, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not consider ed a 
serious adverse event. In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the individual 
remained at the hospital or emer gency war d

involving an overnight stay) that would not 
have been appr opriate in the physician's office 
or an out -patient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospitalization ar e adverse 
events. If a complication pr olongs 
hospitalization or fulfills any other serious 
criteria, the event is serious. W hen in doubt as 
to whether “ hospitalization ” occurr ed, the 
event should be consider ed serious.

5INTRODUCTION
5.1 Rationale and Backgr ound
Meibomian glands are located in the tarsal plate of the upper and lower ey elids, where they  
terminate along the interior rim (or margin) of the eyelids. These glands secrete meibum, 
which is a lipid- rich es sential component of a healthy  tear film. When suf ficient meibum is 
not present in the tear film matrix ,the aqueous layer of the tear film is disrupte d and readily  
evaporates resulting in irritation, redness, and inflammation of the li d margin and ocular 
surface . MGD is associated with a failure of these gland s to produce adequate quality  and 
quantity of meibum due to atrophy , inflammation, or obstruction, and is thought to be the 
most common cause of evaporative dry  eye disease (Schaumberg 201 1).
MGD is one of the most common ophthalmic conditions found in clinical practice. Yet, MGD 
is often under -diagnosed. Clearing meibomian gland (MG)obstruction may  also mitigate the 
chronic pathologic progression of MGD, including atroph y of the glands. Population-based 
studies have reported a prevalence of MGD ranging from 3.5% to 69.3% with dif ferences 
among studies b y race/ethnicity and parameters used to define presence of MGD. 
Furthermore, studies have shown that 61.7% to 86% of those with dry  eye symptoms have 
clinical signs of MGD (Lekhanont 2006, L in 2003, L emp 2012). According to the 
International W orkshop on MGD Report published in 201 1, “MGD may well be the leading 
cause of dry eye disease thr oughout the world
”(Nichols 201 1).
A common clin ical treatment to improve meibomian gland function in patients with 
obstructive MGD involves the application of heat and pressure therap y to the eyelids to 
express the meibum and other material from the gland ( Lekhanont 2006) . Warming the ey elid 
tissue softens or melts the meibum, which is known to facilitate expression using pressure.
The iL ux Sy stem is a commercially  available medical device designed for use by  the Ey e 
Care Professional (ECP) to apply  localized heat and pressure therapy  to a patient ’s eyelids.

Warming is accomplished using light energy emitted from LED in this instrument. A 
mechanism in this device allows the operator to apply  pressure to the ey elid by  controlling 
the movement of the outer pad using finger pressure applied to the compression control 
button .
The L ipiFlow Thermal Pulsation Sy stem is a commerciall y available medical device for use 
by the ECP to provide localized heat and pressure therap y to adult patients with chronic 
conditions of the ey elids, including MGD.
Additional information on both devices can be found in their respective DFUs.
5.2 Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this post-approval study isto demonstrate that iL ux MGD treatment offers 
comparable treatment effectiveness to Lipi Flow MGD treatment at 12 months post single 
treatment .
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate noninferiorit y of iLux when compared 
to LipiFlow in change from baseline in (MGS at 12 months post single treatment in MGD 
subjects with EDE.
 
At the end of the study , a clinical study  report will be p repared in accordance with applicable 
regulatory  requirements and standards.
 
5.3 Risk s and Benefits
The iL uxand LipiFlow device sarenon-significant risk device sbecause they do not meet 
FDA ’s criteria for asignificant risk device in that the product poses no significant risk to the 
subject . Potential benefit of iL ux trea tment is unblocking the inspissated and/or obstructed
meibomian glands and expression of the contents of theMG via heating and expression.
Known potential risks may  include:
Eyelid/ey e pain requiring discontinuation of the treatment procedure

Eyelid irritation or inflammatio n
Temporary  reddening of the skin
Ocular surface irritation or inflammation (eg, corneal abrasion, conjunctive edema or 
conjunctival injection (hy peremia))
Ocular s ymptoms (eg, burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, foreign bod y 
sensation , visual disturbance, sensitivity  to light)
There may  also be unknown risks with the use of iLux.Any risk to subjects in this clinical 
study  will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility  criteria and study  procedures, 
clinical oversight ,andmonito ring.
Risks associated with the L ipiFlow can be found in the DFU.

7.4 Rationale for Choice of C ontrol Product
The LipiFlow is a commerciall y available device used in the treatment of MGD. It is cleared 
to be marketed b y the United States Food and Drug Administration and will be used as the 
control device in this study .
There are several reusable warm compresses available for at home management of MGD; 
however , the LipiFlow is the only  comm erciall y available in of fice device that uses localized 
heat and pressure ( thermal pulsation) therap y for the treatment of MGD similar to the test 
device. Hence, Lipi Flow will serve as a control product in this study .

11ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES
11.1 General Information
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury , or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device (test article). Refer to the 
Glossary  of Terms for categories of 
AEs and SAEs.

3.0; Most-Recent; Effective; CURRENT
TDOC-0056343
Protocol - Clinical
18-Jun-2019
Page 51of 66
Device Deficiencies 
A device deficiency  may  or may  not be associated wit h subject harm (ie, ADE or SADE); 
however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a device deficiency . The Investigator should 
determine the applicable category  for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report 
any subject harm separately .
11.2 Monitoring fo r Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated during the study  
are to be reviewed b y the I nvestigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in 
a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response that is clinically  relevant, in the 
opinion of the I nvestigator , is to be reporte d as an AE. These clinicall y relevant changes will 
be reported regardless of causality . 
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control articles on the Device Deficiency eCRF .The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study  Sponsor 
immediately  as follows:
All SAEs must be reported immediately  (within 24 hours) of the Investigator ’s or site ’s 
awareness . 
ADEs that do not meet se riousness criteria and device deficiencies must be reported 
within 10 calendar day s of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .

A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Ef fect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included w ith product returns. Refer to the MOP  
for additional information on product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report, Certificate 
of Death ,etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Adverse Device Ef fect (for related 
AEs) and Serious Adverse Event eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device 
Deficiency Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study  Sponsor at 
msus.safety @alcon.com. according to the timelines outlined above; however , the reported 
information must be entered into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study ,marketed devices/products (i e, LipiFlow , 
Johnson & Johnson Vision)will be co nsidered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.
Study Sponsor  repr esentatives may be contacted for  any pr otocol r elated quest ion and 
their  contact information is pr ovided in the Manual of Pr ocedur esthat accompanies 
this pr otocol.
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicable portions of the s ubject ’s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
sympto m.
Alcon - Business Use Only   Effective Date:

3.0; Most-Recent; Effective; CURRENT
TDOC-0056343
Protocol - Clinical
18-Jun-2019
Page 53of 66
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inabilit y to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utili zing the same definitions, as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -
serious to serious or from unrelated to re lated.
11.4 Return product analysis
Study  Sponsor representatives and their contact information are provided in theManual of 
Procedures that accompanies this protocol. 
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # which will be provided by  Study  Sponsor after the 
case is entered in the Study  Sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management S ystem.
All Alcon products used or unused, regardless of AE/D evice Deficiency association will be 
returned at the end of the enrollment period as instructed b y the Sponsor .
11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y(see Section 9.4 of the protocol) .If the treatment code needs to be broken in 
the interest of subject safety , the Investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate Study

Sponsor representative pri or to unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. 
Dependent upon the individual circumstances (ie, medical emergency), the code may be 
broken prior to contact with the Study  Sponsor . The Study Sponsor must be informed of all 
cases in which the c ode was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally , the 
Study  Sponsor may  be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is respo nsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock). 
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to 
the medica l device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.
The Investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study  entry  are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; however, 
complications may  be reportable and will be decided on a case –by-case basis.  
 
12ANAL YSIS PLAN
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of obser vations, mean, standard

12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
This study  defines 1 primary ,  
endpoints.  will use the FAS as the primary  analy sis set.
 
 
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate noninferiorit y in change from baseline 
in MGS with iL ux compared to LipiF low at 12 months following a single treatment. The 
primary  endpoint, change from baseline in MGS, is derived from MGS, collected separatel y 
for each ey e, where baseline is defined as V isit 1. 
12.4.1.1 Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are 
formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 5 for 
noninferiority :
H0: µ(iLux) – µ (Lipiflow) ≤ -5
Ha: µ(iLux) – µ (Lipiflow) > -5
where µ (iLux) and µ (Lipiflow) denote the mean change from baseline inMGS for iL ux and 
LipiFlow, respectively .

12.4.1.2 Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fectsrepeated measures model will be utilized to test these hy potheses. The model 
will include terms for treatment , visit, treatment by visit interaction, and baseline MGS . 
Within-subject correlation due to eye will also be accounted for in the model. Treatment
difference ( iLuxminus LipiFlow) and the corresponding one -sided 95% lower confidence 
limit (LCL)will be computed. Noninferiorit y in change from baseline inMGS will be 
declared if the LCLis greater than -5.

12.5 Handling of Missing Data
All data obtained in evaluable subjects/ey es will be included in the analy sis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out f
12.6 Safety Analys es
The safet y endpoints are:
AEs
Biomicroscop y findings
Device deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of AEs as well as the other listed 
parameters.
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis se t 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular 
and nonocular AEs will be presented by  Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
Preferred T erms. AEs leading to study  discontinuation, and SAEs will be identifie d. 
Individual subject listings will be provided, as necessary . 
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.
Each biomicroscop y parameter will be tabulated by its grade. For select biomicroscopy  
parameters, counts and percentages of ey es that experience an increase of 1 grade from

with a sample size of 188 (94 per treatment group).
 
 
 
 
13DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Subject C onfidentiality
The Investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anony mity is maintained throughout the 
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each stud y participant. At the end of the clinical study , the Study  Sponsor will collect a copy  
of the enrollment log without any identifyin g subject information . All documents submitted 
to the Study  Sponsor will identify  the subjects exclusively  by number and demographic 
information. No other personally  identify ing information will be transmitted to the Study  
Sponsor .
The Study  Sponsor may  release anon ymized study data to external researchers for purposes 
of future research directly  related to the study  objectives, or future research that is bey ond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study  
subjects. Anon ymization means that all identifiable information will be removed from the 
dataset and all links to the subjects in the study will be removed. Anon ymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality  of the subjects who participate in the study  sothat they  cannot 
be identified b y external researchers. The anon ymized data set will contain records from all 
of the subjects in the current study , but the anonymization process might change the data set

in some way s, so external researchers will be infor med that they  might not be able to 
duplicate some o f the results from this study .
13.2 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Case Report Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to complete the CRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor , 
and all discrepancies shall be appropriately  documented via the query  resolution process. Site
monitors are appointed by the Stud y Sponsor and are independent of stud y site staf f.
If elect ronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in
advance of starting the study . 
At a minimum, source documents include the following information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethnicit y)
Documentati on of subject eligibility
Date of informed consent
Dates of visits
Documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed
Results of study  parameters, as required b y the protocol
IP accountability  records
Documentation of AEs and other safet y param eters (if applicable)
Records regarding medical histories and the use of concomitant therapies prior to and 
during the stud y
Date of stud y completion and reason for earl y discontinuation, if applicable
It is required that the author of an entry  in the sour ce documents be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that 
the data recorded on the CRF are consistent with the original source data.
Only  designated individuals at the site will complete the CRFs. The CRFs must be completed 
at regular intervals following the clinical study  visit schedule. I t is expected that all data 
reported have corresponding entries in the source documents. The Principal I nvestigator is 
responsible for reviewin g and certify ing that the CRFs are accurate and complete. The onl y 
subject identifiers recorded on the CRFs will be subject number , and subject demographic 
information.

13.3 Data Review and Clarifications
A review of CRF data to the subject’ s source data will be completed b y the site monitor to 
ensure completeness and accuracy . After the CRFs have been completed, additional data 
clarifications and/or additions may  be needed as a result of the data cleaning process. Data 
clarifications are documented and are par t of each subject ’s CRF .
13.4 Sponsor and Monitoring Responsibilities
The Study  Sponsor will designate a monitor to conduct the appropriate site visits at the 
appropriate intervals according to the stud y monitoring plan. The clinical investigation will 
be monit ored to ensure that the rights and well -being of the subjects are protected, the 
reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from the source documents, and the study 
is conducted in compliance with the current approved protocol (and amendments[s], if 
applicable), with current GCP , and with applicable regulatory  requirements.
The site may  not screen subjects or perform the informed consent process on any  subject
until it receive sa notification from an appropriate Study  Sponsor representative that the site 
may commence conducting study  activities. Monitoring will be conducted periodicall y while 
the clinical study  is ongoing. Monitoring methods may  include site visits, telephone, written 
and fax correspondence. Close -out visits will take place after the last visit of the last subject
at the site .
A Coordinating Investigator may  be identified by  the Study  Sponsor to review and endorse 
the final study  report. In cases where a Coordinating Investigator is engaged , the Study  
Sponsor will select the Coordinating Investigator based upon their experience, qualifications, 
active study  participation, and their willingness and ava ilability  to take on this role.
Alcon may  have an expert Sponsor Representative present during subject visits to offer 
training 
to the Investigator on proper operation of the device to make technical observations 
during the stud y visit . 
The Sponsor Representative must be supervised by  the Investigator or designee to ensure the 
Sponsor Representative ’s presence or activities do not bias the outcome of the study , affect 
the quality  of the research data, and/or compromise the rights and welfare of the subject. The 
Sponsor Representative will not intervene with the standard of care provided to study  
subjects or make safet y-related decisions or assessments. The activities of Sponsor 
Representatives will be described in the Informed Consent.

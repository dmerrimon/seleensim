1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
COVID -19 is a contagious respiratory illness, caused by infection with the novel coronavirus 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2).  This communicable disease 
is easily transmitted through aerosolized droplets containing the infectio us virus.  Infections with 
SARS -CoV -2 can have varying degrees of signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic to 
severe .  Individuals infected with SARS -CoV -2 are believed to be contagious from as early as 
two days prior to symptom onset to at least ten days after the onset of symptoms.   
Influenza ( Flu) is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect  the nose, 
throat, and lungs. This communicable disease is  also transmitted through droplets  containing the 
virus. Influenza (flu) can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. There are 
two main types of influenza (flu) viruses: types A and B. The influenza A and B viruses that 
routinely spread in people (human influenza viruses) are responsible fo r seasonal flu epidemics 
each year.  Individuals infected with Flu  are believed  to be the most contagious in the first three 
to four days after the  onset of symptoms, however , they may still spread the  virus and have no 
symptoms. Infants and individuals wit h weake ned immune systems who are infected with flu 
viruses may be contagious for longer than seven days.  
The r apid detection of infections and contacts and the implementation of infection control 
measures are critical for mitigation of th ese virus es. 
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test  is a lateral flow  
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for the  simultaneous  qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B  
direct ly from anterior nasal swab specimens obtained  from individuals , who are suspected of 
respiratory viral  infection  within five (5) days of symptom onset .  This test is intended for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and older or adult lay user  collected anterior nares swab samples  from individuals 
aged 2 to 13 years.  
1.2 Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B 
Home Multi T est in Home Use.  
1.3 Risk and Benefit Assessment  
1.3.1  Potential Risks  
The only study -related procedure that could impact subject safety is in the collection of nasal 
specimens from the anterior nares using a nasal swab.  The risks of collecting a specimen using a

nasal swab may include symptoms associated with standard collection practices , such as slight 
pain and/or a small amount of bleeding in the nose .   
All s ubject(s) will be de -identified using a study -specific number at the time of enrollment.  All 
study form s, Case Report Forms (CRFs) and study samples will be labeled with the de -identified 
subject ID number.  No identifiable patient information will be provided to Medical Group Care .  
No patient treatment or management decisions will be based on any results generated during this 
study.  
Information collected for this study is confidential. However, officials of the FDA or other 
regulatory agencies may research records during the ordinary course of conducting  their 
functions.  A sponsor representative may also inspect research records to make certain the study 
data is accurate.  The investigator, institution, regulatory agencies, and sponsor will protect the 
confidentiality of the records.  
1.3.2  Potential Benefits  
The information obtained in this study will not benefi t the study subjects directly but may aid 
future patients by helping to rapidly and accurately detect infection caused by SARS -CoV -2, 
influenza A and/or influenza B . 
1.4 Study Device Description  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test is a lateral fl ow 
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B 
directly from anterior nasal swab specimens obtained from individual s, who are suspected of 
respiratory viral infection within five (5) days of symptom onset .  This test is intended for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and older or adult lay user collected anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
aged 2 to 13  years . 
1.5 Device Output  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test detects influenza A and B viral 
antigens and COVID -19 antigen through visual interpretation of color develop ment on the test 
cassette .  
Nasal swab s amples  are loaded into the sample port of the test cassette .  The extracted specimen 
reacts with anti - influenza A, B and COVID -19 antibodies conjugated to colored particles and 
precoated onto the sample pad of the t est. The mixture then migrates through the membrane by 
capillary action and interacts with the reagents on the membrane.  If there is sufficient influenza 
A and /or B viral antigens or COVID -19 antigen s in the specimen, a pink colored band(s) will 
form in the test region (s) of the membrane , i.e., COVID -19, Flu A and/or Flu B, as illustrated in 
Figure 1.

Negative Test   
The appearance of  a pink line in the control region  (C) and the absence of a pink line in the test 
region (s) indicates a negative test result , as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Figure 2. 
The appearance of a colored band at the control region  (C) serves as a pro cedural control, 
indicating that the proper volume of specimen has been added and membrane wicking has 
occurred. If the Control line  (C) does not appear, as illustrated in  Figure 3, the result is invalid , 
and the test should be repeated .  
Positive Test  
The appearance of a pink line in the control region  (C) and a pink line in the test region(s) 
COVID -19, Flu A, and/or Flu B indicates a positive result  for the particular viral antigen .  Figure 
1 depicts positive test results.

1.5.1  Intended Use  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test  is a lateral flow 
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for th e simultaneous qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B 
directly from anterior nasal swab specimens obtained from individuals, who are suspected of 
respiratory viral infection wit hin five (5) days of symptom onset.  This test is intended  for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and older or adult lay user collected anterior nares  swab samples from individuals 
aged 2 to 13 years . 
Results are for the simultaneous identification of SARS -CoV -2, influenza A, and influenza B. 
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test is not intended to detect influenza C 
antigens.  These viral an tigens are generally detectable in anterior nasal swab specimens during 
the acute phase of infection.  Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical 
correlation with patient history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine 
infection status.  Positive results do not rule out bacterial infection or co -infection with other 
viruses.  The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.  Individuals who test 
positive with the MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home M ulti Test  should self - isolate and 
seek follow -up care with their physician or healthcare provider as additional testing may be 
necessary.  
Negative SARS -CoV -2 results should be treated as presumptive and confirmed with a molecular 
assay, if necessary, for patient management.  Negative results do not rule out SARS -CoV -2 
infection and should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient management decisions, 
including infection control decisions.  Negative results should be considered in the context of an 
individual’s recent exposures, history, and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms 
consistent with COVID -19.  
Negative influenza A and B test results should be treated as presumptive.  It is recommended 
these results be confirmed by viral cultur e or an FDA cleared influenza A and B molecular assay.  
Negative results do not preclude influenza virus infection and should not be used as the sole 
basis for treatment or other management decisions.  
Additional confirmatory testing with a molecular test f or positive results may also be necessary, 
if there is a low likelihood of COVID -19 or influenza, such as in individuals without known 
exposures to COVID -19 or influenza or residing in communities with low prevalence of these 
infections.  Individuals who t est negative and continue to experience symptoms of fever, cough 
and/or shortness of breath may still have SARS -CoV -2 or influenza and should seek follow -up 
care from their healthcare provider.  Individuals should provide all results obtained with this 
product to their healthcare provider for public health reporting.  All healthcare providers will 
report all test results they receive from individuals who use the authorized product to relevant 
public health authorities in accordance with local, state, and fe deral requirements using 
appropriate LOINC and SNOMED codes, as defined by the Laboratory In Vitro Diagnostics 
(LIVD) Test Code Mapping for SARS -CoV -2 Tests provided by the CDC.

1.6 For Investigational Use Only  
The MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test is a lateral flow 
immunochromatographic antibody assay intended for the simultaneous qualitative detection and 
differentiation of the nucleocapsid antigen from SARS -CoV -2, influenza A and/or influenza B 
directly from anterior nasal swab specimens obta ined from individuals, who are suspected of 
respiratory viral infection within five (5) days of symptom onset.  This test is intended for non -
prescription home use with self -collected direct anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
ages 14 years and ol der or adult lay user collected anterior nares swab samples from individuals 
aged 2 to 13  years .  The performance characteristics of the  test using nasal swabs have not been 
established.  The results obtained from this study will not be used for diagnostic  purposes or 
patient management.  
Results are intended for the simultaneous identification of SARS -CoV -2, influenza A, and /or 
influenza B, which  are generally detectable in nasal samples during the acute phase of infection.   
Positive results indicate the presence of viral antigens, but clinical correlation with patient 
history and other diagnostic information is necessary to determine infection status.  Positive 
results do not rule out bacterial infection or co -infection with  other viruses.  The agent detected 
may not be the definite cause of disease.

3 STUDY PROCEDURES  
3.1 Set Up  
Testing will take place in a room to simulate the home environment.  A table with chairs will be 
available.  The observer will stand  or sit  to the side of the subject providing enough space to: 1) 
ensure there is no interference with the subject’s activities and 2) allow adequate view of the 
subject’s interact ion with the test kit.  Other than providing the test kit and QRI, the observer will 
not provide any other directions on how to use the kit.  
Each box of the MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi Test  contains one (1) each of 
the following: sterile nasal  swab, test cassette, and the sample collection tube with nozzle lid .    
Upon completion of the testing, the used test components  will be disposed of properly per local 
regulations . 
At the conclusion of testing and the subject’s completion of the questionnaire, the observer will 
present ten (10) images  of different test results and ask the subject to interpret each test result.   
3.2 Informed Consent  
Study staff trained in basic human res earch subjects protection will explain the study protocol, 
procedures , and objectives to the subject  and obtain written informed consent and assent, if 
applicable, for participation in the study from each subject prior to performing any study 
procedures.  The study staff will review all information in the consent / assent, if applicable, 
allowing subjects ample time to review the form(s), ask questions and have their questions 
answered to the satisfaction of the subject.  Subjects willing to participate wil l sign the consent / 
assent, if applicable, and will be provided a copy for their records.

3.2.1  Vulnerable Populations  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the relevant articles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  The Declaration of Helsinki defines vu lnerable individuals as having “An increased 
likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.”  (World Medical Association 2013 )  
For the purpose of this study, we define vulnerable individuals as those whose capacity to protect 
or exercise their rights is restricted due to their mental, social, economic, or ethnical status, age, 
or health condition.  Subjects deemed vulnerable by t he IRB and/or the principal investigator will 
not be eligible for this study.  
This study involves children who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatment or 
procedures involved in research and are a vulnerable population.  Children are a gro up already 
burdened by COVID -19 and flu and while there is no benefit to study participants, the anterior 
nares swabs for this study does not pose greater than a minimum risk to children.   
3.3 Subject Enrollment  
Once informed consent is obtained, the subject will be assigned a subject ID number.  The 
subject ID number will consist of the study site number followed by a 3 -digit sequentially 
assigned subject number.  For example, the first subject enrolled at site 01 will be assigned 01 -
001, with subsequent enro lled subjects assigned 01 -002, 01 -003, etc.  The site will maintain an 
enrollment log that correlates the subject ID number to the subject’s name.  
The unique subject ID number will be written on each page of the Case Report Form (CRF) and 
all other documen tation related to the subject.  All data will be captured on the paper C RF. 
3.4 Baseline Data  
The site will provide a narrative  describing how the testing simulated a home environment.  For 
example, whether a table and chair were provided, how subjects could s anitize their hands, 
positioning of the subject such that they could not observe others conducting the test, and 
position of the observer.  
Upon confirmation of eligibility to participate in the study, the following information will be 
obtained : 
• Age (For su bjects under 14 years of age , the age of the person collecting and testing the 
sample will also be recorded.)  
• Sex 
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Educational Level (For subjects under 14 years of age, the educational level of the person 
performing the test  will be recorded .)

• Occupation  (For subjects under 14 years of age, the occupation  of the person performing 
the test  will be recorded .)  
• Exposure to someone with COVID -19, and the number of  days prior to the visit the 
exposure occurred . 
• Presence or absence of respiratory  symptoms: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; 
difficulty breathing; muscle or body aches, new loss of taste or smell.  Subjects will be 
asked the date each  symptom appeared.  
• COVID -19 vaccine status and number of doses, manufacturer, and date of last vaccine.  
• Flu vaccine status  and date of vaccine , if applicable.  
3.5 Test Procedure  
The observer will provide the subject the MGC Health COVID -19 & Flu A+B Home Multi 
Test and the QRI .  The  lot number and expiration date  of the kit will be recorded .  The 
observer will ask the subject to conduct the test .  The subject will be expected to collect the 
sample, conduct the test, read and interpret the test result.  
The observer will complete an observation form that will assess how well the subject 
followed the QRI to perform the critical steps for the test  and interpret the test result.   
The critical steps that each subject should perform accurately are as follows:  
• Swab each nostril , rotating swab against nostril at least 5 times.  
• Rotate the nasal swab in the sample collection tube liquid at lea st 5 times . 
• Lift the swab out of the liquid in the collection tube and squeeze the tube  against the 
swab  tip 3 times . 
• Squee ze the sample collection tube  while removing the nasal swab.  
• Press the nozzle lid firmly onto the sample collection tube.  
• Transfer 3 drops from the sample  collection tube in to the sample well of test cassette . 
• Do not move or lift the test cassette.  
• Read the results between 15 and 20 minutes.  
The subject s will interpret the test result and the observer will assess whether they agree or 
do not agree with the reading of the result.   If they do not agree, they will provide the reason.  
The observer will label each cartridge with the subject ID, protocol number , and date and 
will take  a photo graph  of each test cartridge  immediately after the subject has interpreted the 
result.   Each  photo graph  will be saved as a n image titled with the subject ’s ID number .   
After completion of the test process , the subject will complete a questionnaire on the clarity 
of the instructions provided , ease of perform ing the test, and ease of reading and interpret ing 
their results.

5 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1 Safety Warnings and Precautions  
All samples should be handled as potentially infectious .  Use an appropriate disinfectant for 
decontamination.  Store and dispose of these materials and their containers in accordance with 
local regulations and guidelines.  
5.2 Definition of Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs to the subject during the 
course of a study (with onset after the first study -specific procedure), whether or not  that event is 
considered study -related.  
An adverse event may be mild, moderate, or severe and is usually unexpected.  
All adverse events observed by the principal investigator or reported by the subject must be 
reported to the sponsor within 24 hours.  To report an adverse event, the principal investigator 
will complete an adverse event form or relevant form located in the CRF.  
Adverse events will be considered study -related if the event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from a study related procedure  and could readily have been produced by that study 
procedure. For the purpose of this study, only the collection of nasal nares swab is considered to 
be the study procedure . 
5.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  is any adverse  event that:  
• led to death  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in a life -
threatening illness or injury, or a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function, or in -patient hospitalization  or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization , or in 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• led to fetal distress, fetal death , or a congenital abnormality or birth de fect 
Hospitalization is defined as greater than 24 hours in hospital.  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the sponsor by telephone within 24 hours of the 
principal investigator becoming aware of it.

The sponsor will be contacted using  the following information : 
Contact Name:  Tomaz Lovse  
Telephone Number:   239-631-1907  
The principal investigator should institute appropriate therapeutic and follow -up measures in 
accordance with good medical practice but should notify the monitor of such actions and record 
them in the subject’s CRF.   Each telephone reported reaction must be reported in w riting to the 
sponsor within 10 working days of the event.  
It is also the responsibility of the principal investigator to inform the representative of the 
appropriate local IRB in a timely manner.  
5.4 Possible Risks Associated with Study Procedures  
The only s tudy-related procedure that could impact subject safety is in the collection of a direct 
anterior nares (nasal) swab.  The risks of collecting a nasal nares swab may include symptoms 
associated with standard collection practices such as slight pain  and/or  minor bleeding.   
Information collected for this study is confidential. Subjects will be identified using a study 
specific number at the time of enrollment.  All study forms will be labeled with the study 
number.  No identifiable patient information will b e provided to the sponsor. However, officials 
of the FDA or other regulatory agencies may research records during the ordinary course of 
conducting  their functions. A sponsor representative may also inspect research records to make 
certain the study data i s accurate.  The investigator, institution, regulatory agencies, and the 
sponsor will protect the confidentiality of the records.  
No medical decisions will be based on investigational assay results generated as part of the 
study.

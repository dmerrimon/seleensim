You are being invited to join a research study. Dr. Ptomey is conducting the study at the 
University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). About 20 people will be in phase 2. Here are basic 
things for you to think about:
You can decide if you want to be in the study or not.
Please take as much time as you need to make your choice.  
You can ask questions at any time.  
Even if you say yes now, you can still leave the study at any time.  Leaving will not affect 
your regular care. 
Why is the study being done?  
Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality associated with an 
intellectual disability. There is currently considerable interest in increasing physical activity 
among adults with disabilities. The goal of this study is to see if video game based physical 
activity is beneficial and feasible for people with DS. We are asking you to be in a research study. 
Research is done to answer a scientific question. Research studies may 
or may not help the people who participate.  
Joining this study is completely voluntary. If you say yes, you can quit 
the study at any time. 
You can still get medical care and other services from the University of 
Kansas Medical Center even if you are not in the study. 
The research team will explain what happens if you decide to join the 
study. This conversation is called “informed consent.”  
Informed consent includes a chance to get your questions answered 
before you make your decision. Please ask as many questions as you 
need to.  
This consent form explains the study. Take as much time as you need to 
decide.
If you decide to be in the study, you will be asked to sign this form. 
KUMC IRB # STUDY00148828 | Approval Period 7/6/2022 - 7/5/2023 | FWA# 00003411
How long with the study take?
We expect your participation to last about 14 weeks and involve 2 visits to the research clinic 
and 12 at home workouts for 90-180 minutes each, depending on what week of the study you 
are in. You do not have to do all of your weekly exercise minutes in one day. You will also have 
12 at-home, virtual coaching sessions for 30 minutes each. 
What will happen if I join the study?
We will give you a form for your doctor to sign, giving permission for you to be in the study. You 
will need your doctor’s permission before you begin.
Week 0 (At KUMC): 
You will come to the research clinic and fill out a demographic questionnaire. The research team 
will give you a Nintendo SwitchTM along with the Ring-Fit AdventureTM  video game. The Nintendo 
SwitchTM is a video gaming console that will be used within your home during this study. It will 
be required to be hooked up to a television so that you can play an active video game, Ring-Fit 
AdventureTM. The research team will show you how to use the game by creating a profile and 
going through two, unique “levels” within the game. This will take about 45 minutes. 
 
You will take both Ring-Fit AdventureTM and the Nintendo SwitchTM home with you. We will ask 
you to use the game for 60 minutes (1 hour) per week. You can go at your own pace during 
these sessions. 
The research team will also give you a Fitbit Versa 3 and an iPad. You will be asked to wear the 
Fitbit on your wrist while you play the video game. A Fitbit is a device that is similar to a 
wristwatch and measures how much movement and activity occurs when you are wearing it. The 
information from your watch will automatically be sent to an application on your iPad.  The study 
team will give you guidance on how to use the Fitbit and iPad.
You will also be asked to do these physical activity tests:
6-minute walk: This test measures the distance that you can walk on a flat, hard surface in a 
period of 6 minutes. The research team will instruct you on how to prepare and conduct this test.  
Timed Up and Go: During this test, you will be asked to sit down in a chair. Approximately 10 
feet in front of you there will be a line on the floor. The research team will say “go” and you will 
get up from the chair, walk to the line at your normal pace, and then turnaround and walk back 
to the chair and sit down again. The research team will record how long it takes you to do this.
Balance: During this test, we will ask you to balance on one leg and reach in three directions as 
far as you can with your other foot. You will then do the same on your other leg.
Leg Strength: Leg strength will be measured on the leg press machine. Researchers will assess 
the maximum amount of weight you can press for 5 repetitions.
Hand Grip Strength: You will be asked to squeeze a device as hard as you can to test your grip 
strength. This will be done on both hands.
KUMC IRB # STUDY00148828 | Approval Period 7/6/2022 - 7/5/2023 | FWA# 00003411
Researchers will also ask you and your parent/caregiver questions about how much you enjoy 
physical activity, and what you currently do for exercise.
Weeks 1-12 (At Home): 
We will ask you to play Ring-Fit AdventureTM for 90-180 minutes per week. While playing Ring-
Fit AdventureTM, you will be asked to do a variety of exercises and activities. These include 
jogging in place with a leg strap attached to your leg, pressing and pulling a ring that is similar 
to a Pilates ring, leg/abdominal/yoga exercises. 
Weekly exercise minutes:
Week 1: 90 minutes
Week 2: 120 minutes
Week 3: 150 minutes
Week 4-12: 180 minutes (each week)
You and your parent/caregiver will also be asked to do a weekly coaching session with the 
research team, which will take about 30 minutes per week. You will not need to come to the 
clinic for your coaching sessions, as they will be done over your iPad using Zoom. During these 
sessions, the research team will: 
review the study requirements with you 
review your physical activity over the past week. 
give you information on the importance of engaging in physical activity
ask if you have had any problems with using the game or system 
provide social support and encouragement.
Week 13 (At KUMC): 
During this visit, the researchers will also ask you and your parent/caregiver questions about 
how much you enjoy physical activity, if you were able to complete all of your exercise sessions 
and return your IPad to the researchers. You will also perform the same physical activity tests 
and optional exercise test you did during your Week 0 study visit.
What are some risks of joining the study?  
You may have problems because of the procedures that will be performed during the study. 
These are called adverse events or side effects. Some may be only an inconvenience, but some 
may be harmful. There could be side effects that are not yet known or the research may involve 
KUMC IRB # STUDY00148828 | Approval Period 7/6/2022 - 7/5/2023 | FWA# 00003411
risks to you that are currently unforeseeable. It is important that you tell the study team 
immediately about any side effects or problems you have.  
Exercise/Physical Activity: You might have muscle soreness, fatigue, nausea, dizziness. There 
is a very rare chance of unpredictable changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm, and heart 
attack. 
Questionnaires: You might feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions in the 
questionnaire. You may skip a question or stop participating altogether.
Computer Security: There is a chance that someone outside the study could get information 
from the computers when they are not supposed to have it. After your information comes to the 
research team, it will be stored on secure computers.  
Are there benefits to being in this study?  
Being in this study could help you find another method of exercise you enjoy. This may prove 
useful for future exercise behavior. The researchers might learn how to motivate adults with 
Down syndrome to exercise. 
Will it cost anything to be in the study?  
You will not be charged for being in the study. The costs of the iPad, Nintendo SwitchTM and the 
Ring-Fit AdventureTM  video game will be covered by the study. We ask that you return the iPad 
at the conclusion of the study.    
Will I be paid for being in the study? 
If you complete all 14 weeks of the study, you will be allowed to keep the Fitbit, Ring-Fit 
AdventureTM and the Nintendo SwitchTM. These devices retail at $540. If you cannot complete 
all 6 weeks of the study, we will ask that you return all equipment. In the event of possible 
damages to any of the devices, we will provide you with a replacement.
What are the financial arrangements for this study?  
The institution (KUMC Research Institute, Inc.) will receive payments from the sponsor, Healthy 
Weight Research Network for Children and the Center for Children’s Healthy Lifestyles and 
Nutrition for conducting this study. Payments will be used for research purposes only.
What happens if I get hurt or sick during the study?

Study Title: The Adaption of the GameSquad Exergaming Intervention for Young Adults  with Down 
Syndrome: A Pilot Feasibility Study  
 
I. Purpose, Ba ckground and Rationale  
A. Aim and Hypotheses  
1. The 5 -year transitional period between adolescence and young adulthood is known t o be 
a period of increased risk for the developm ent of obesity, u nhealthy diet, and low 
physical activity (PA) levels1. The limited research in individuals with Down syndrome 
(DS), a population with a high prevalence of o besity and higher rates of function al 
decline, mobility restrictions, frailty, musc uloskeletal problems, osteoporosis, and sleep 
problems, suggests this tr ansition period impacts individuals with DS in a similar 
manner1. Increased moderate -to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is ass ociated with 
improved physical  and cognitive  function2. However, participation in MVPA among adults 
with intellectual disabilities (ID), including DS is extremely low when compared to typical 
functioning adults3. Adults with DS f ace unique barriers to part icipatio n in MVPA4,5. 
Exergames, which integrate MVPA in to video game play are an affordable, accessible, 
home -based exercise pr ogram which has shown effectiveness for increasing MVPA and 
improving both physical and cognitive function in typically develope d popula tions6. An 
exergaming intervention with individu al health coaching called GameSquad has been 
shown to be effective in improving MVPA and cardiometabolic parameters in children with 
overweight/obesity and adolescents with neurodevelopmental and psyc hiatric 
diagnoses7,8. We propose a project to  adapt/evaluate the GameSquad intervention for 
use in adults with DS (GameSquad -DS). We will conduct a 12 -wk. single arm pilot trial in 
20 young adults with DS to assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of 
the intervention and c alculate effect sizes for change MVPA , physical function, muscular 
strength, physical activity enjoyment, and self -efficacy. Successful completion of this 
project represents an initial step in achieving our goal of developing effective 
interventions to inc rease MVPA and promote healthy aging in adults w ith DS.  
2. Primary aim:  To assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the 
intervention using various quantitative  alongside qualitative data. Specifically, we will 
assess mins/wk of Ring -Fit AdventureTM played, attendance at virtual health coaching 
sessions, semi -structured interviews, participant retention, and intervention safety 
measured as number of adverse events.  
Secondary  aim: To calculate effect sizes for change across 12 -wks. in MVPA, physical 
function, muscular strength, physical activity enjoyment, and self -efficacy. We 
hypothe size increases in MVPA, physical function, muscular stren gth, physical activity 
enjoyment, and self -efficacy.  
Secondary  aim: To determine energy expenditure of a ses sion of Ring -Fit AdventureTM 
among adults with DS.  We hypothesize energy expenditure akin to moderate physical 
activit ies.

 B. Background and Signific ance 
1. Study Significance:  Down syndrome ( DS) or t risomy 21 is the most common 
chromosomal abnormality associated with an intellectual disability (ID). The current 
incidence of DS is 1 in every 650 live births which is ~30% higher than in 1979, largely 
due to women conceiving after age 35 . Additionally, life expectancy for people with DS 
has increased dramatically over the past 60 years due to advancements in disease 
knowledge, medical care, and caregiving services9. With this increase in DS prevalence 
throu gh improved life expectancy, it is critic al to a ddress ways to support healthy living 
throughout their lifespan. Adults with DS have a higher prevalence of obesity10 and 
obesity associated health conditions including sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes11 
compa red to adults without DS. Additionally, adults w ith DS face premature aging12, 
higher rates and earlier onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD)13, functional decline, mobility 
restrictions, frailty, musculoskeletal problems, osteoporosis, a nd sleep problems when  
compared with typically developed adults14. These Increased rates of chronic disease and 
functional decline are associated with reduced quality of life, and increased burden on 
families, care providers, and disability services. Chronic disease also contri butes to 
absenteeism from disability employment,  premature withdrawal from the workforce, and 
increased health care utilization15. 
2. We recently asked 10 adults with DS who visited our lab to complete assessments for an 
on-going trial ( TL1TR002368) to play t he introductory game on Ring -Fit Adventur eTM for 
~15 minutes while wearing a portable accelerometer on a belt at waist. Approximately 7 
minutes provided instructions on how to use the game and ~8 minutes predominately 
light physical activity active play. P articipants enjoyed playing the game and felt th e 
game would be feasible and safe for home use. The accelerometer data indicated ~5 
minutes of light and ~3 minutes of MVPA, which appeared reasonable based on the types 
of activities in cluded in the game. Th us, based on these preliminary results we  propos e 
to adapt the GameSquad intervention using the Ring -Fit AdventureTM as our exergaming 
platform for use in transition age young adults with DS (18 -25 yrs.)  
3. Literature Review : A 24-wk. randomized trial in 46 c hildren with overweight/obesity 
using a home -based intervention which incorporates exergaming  (Xbox Kinect) with 
individual health coaching called GameSquad demonstrated reduced BMI -z score 
(p=0.016) and improved systolic and diastoli c blood pressure, tota l and low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol , and M VPA relative to wait -list control (all p <0.0 5)7. Members of 
our study team recently conduct a 10 -wk pilot trial of the game GameSquad intervention 
(3 exergaming sessions/wk., plus 6 health coaching sessions)  adapted for use with 
adolescents with neurodeve lopmental and psychiatric diagnoses (n=23, a ge ~ 15 yrs.)8. 
Participants reported an average of ~82 min/wk. of exergaming and completed 83% of 
the scheduled health coaching sessions. Unf ortunately, both the o riginal and Adaptive 
GameSquad interventi ons use d the Xbox Kinect gaming system which was dis continued 
in 2017. Nintendo Ring -Fit AdventureTM is a novel, and currently popular exergame that 
uses both a resistance ring and body weight to perform numerous up per and lower body 
cardiovascular and resistance  exercises. In contrast to other exergames, p articipants 
incorporate exercise to complete an adventure narrative guided by Ring -Fit AdventureTM 
characters. The narratives provide  ~60 hou rs of unique activity which increases in both 
intensity and dif ficultl y as participants progress through the game. Participant exercise is 
guided by both written instructions and visual demonstrations via an in -game avatar. 
Feedback regarding proper exercise form is provided by  controllers/ accelerometers

 imbedded in the  game ring. Formative work by Dr. Bowling found t hat Ring -Fit 
AdventureTM was the most enjoyable and user -friendly of the 4 evaluated exergames.  
 
C. Rationale  
1. The orig inal GameS quad among child ren and the ad apted GameSqaud among 
adolescents with neurodevel opmenta l and psychiatric diagnoses  have both demonstrated 
strong potential. We now want to fu rther adapt the Game Sqaud concept for young adul ts 
with Down Syndrome.  
2. Successful compl etion of this project represents a n initial step in achieving our goal of 
developi ng effective interventions to increase MVPA and promote healthy aging in adults 
with DS.  
 
II. Research Plan  and Design  
 
A. Study Objectives : Primary aim:  To assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibi lity 
of the intervention using quantitative  data alongside qualitative data. Specifically, we will 
assess mins/wk of Ring -Fit Ad ventureTM played, attendance at  virtual health coaching 
sessions, semi -structured interviews, participant retention, and intervention safety measured 
as number of advers e events.  
B. Secondary aims: To calculate effect sizes for change across 12 -wks. i n MVPA, physical 
function, muscular strength, physical activity enjoyment, and self -efficacy.   
C. Exploratory aim: To determine ene rgy expenditure of a session of Ring -Fit Adventu reTM 
among adults with DS.  
D. Study T ype and Design : Single -Group, Pretest -Posttest.  
 
E. Sample size , statistical methods,  and power calculation  
1. We will calculate point estimates and confidence int ervals for a ll endpoints of interest and 
will use effect siz es estimated from this data to guide power analyses for future trials. We 
expect a positive change in MVPA, and in 1 measure  of physical function. Continuation to 
a larger trial will be based on a p ositive response in at least one of these endpoi nts. 
2. N=20 . The sample size was determined from the number of subjects that could feasible 
be recr uited in the 1 -year timeline for the grant and within the g rant budget . 
 
 
F. Subject C riteria (See V ulnerable Populations appendix, if applicable):  Primary care 
physician (PCP) clearance will be requir ed for all participants.  A form with PCP clearanc e will 
need t o be signed before parti cipation will be allowed . Inclusion criteria: 1) Young adults

the investigator. If the participant  asks to be withdrawn from the study, the parti cipant 
will be removed . 
4. A study subject ca n participate in another study while participati ng in this research  study.  
 
E.  Specific methods and techniques used throughout the study   
 
1. Laboratory tests : Physical function will be assessed using the 6 -minute walk test16, Timed 
Up and Go test17, and th e Y-Balance Test18.  
2. Leg strength will be assesse d using a standard 5 -repetition maximum protocol19 on a 
Cybex plate -loaded leg press. Hand grip strength of bo th the dominant and non -
dominant hands will be assessed with a Jamar handgrip  dynamometer (JWL In struments, 
Chicago, IL)20.  
3. Daily physical  activity, specifically MVPA , will be acces sed using a Fitbit  that will 
be synced to a tablet computer  (iPad). Daily  physical activity  across the 12 -
week study activity will be assessed using a Fitbit Versa 3 monitor worn on the 
non-dominant wrist during e ach day of  the intervention.  Real-time data from 
the Fitbit will be transferred via Fitbit's Open API using R, thus participant 
burden is minimal.  Immediate participant feedback via a graphic di splay of daily 
steps, minutes of sedentary time,  time spent in  light, mo derate and vigorous PA 
will be available on the iPad. This data, accessible to health educators, will  be 
used to provide motivation and feedback during the  virtual  coaching  sessions. 
Participants will be reminded to wear and charge the F itbit dur ing the in dividual 
support/education sessions and will receive automatic reminder messages via 
the iPad.  
 
Study  Procedures: 6-minute walk test  (6-minutes) , Timed Up and G o test  (5-minutes) , 
and the Y-Balance Test  (5-minutes) . Leg strength will be  assessed using a standard 5 -
repetition maximum protocol  (5-minutes ) on a Cybex plate -loaded leg press. Hand grip 
strengt h of both the dominant and non -dominant hands will be asses sed with a Jamar 
handgrip dynamometer (JWL Instruments, Chicago, IL),  (5-minutes ). Physical activity 
enjoyment will be assessed using the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale  (10-minutes) . 
Self-effica cy will be assessed using the Self -Efficacy for Activity fo r Persons with 
Intellect ual Disabilities Scale  (10-minutes) . Energy expenditure of a ring-fit session will 
be assessed in a volunteer sample of both patient and caregiver using a previously 
validat ed portable, open -circuit indirect calorimeter (Cosmed, Ita ly) which measures 
breath -by-breath ventilation, expired oxygen, and carbon dioxide. S tudy staff will 
schedule the assessment with participants which will involve a  visit to the lab.  The flow  
turbine will be calibrated using a 3.0 -L syringe. The lightweigh t (~1.5 kg) portable 
system will be attached by a harness around the waist and shoulde rs of the participant 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 5 of 11
  
 before each assessment. The device will be programmed utilizing study ID n umbers, with 
no other identifying information. During exercise sessions, p articipants will breathe into a 
facemask that directs air into the unit housing the O2  and CO2 a nalyzers. Data will be 
retrieved for analysis via a serial port interface and download ed to a u nivers ity 
monitored, HIPPA compliant computer once staff returns to campus. Software prov ided 
with the calorimeter will be used to analyze data by aggr egating ov er 20-second epochs 
for the calculation of 1 -min averages. MET levels will be age corr ected using the  Schofield 
equation21 as recommended by McMurray et al22. Participants will be asked to wear both 
hip and wrist ActiGraphs during the assessment for compar ison of physical activity levels 
between devices.

may prove useful for future exercise behavior  after acquiring  Ring-Fit AdventureTM 
and a Nintendo SwitchTM at the conc lusion  of participation .  
b. The researchers might le arn more about how to get adults with Down syndrome 
to exercise.  
c. There is currently consider able interest in increasing physical activity in adults  
with di sabilities . This may prove benefi cial to that  effort.  
G. Location where study will be performed: Kirmayer Fitness Center

I. Assessment of  Subject  Safety and Development of a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan 
 
1. Elements of the plan include:  
a. Persons/groups who will review the data (study team; independent safety 
monitor, data monitoring committee or fo rmal DSMB) : Study Team  
b. Data/events that will  be revi ewed: Subject accrual (adherence to protocol 
regarding demographics, inclusion/exclusion)  and Adverse Event  Rates  
c. Frequ ency of review : Monthly  
d. Types of an alyses to be performed : Means  
e. Safety -related t riggers that would cause the PI to stop or alte r the st udy: The 
most likely scenario indicating the need to stop the investigation would be a 
failure to recruit o r deliver the intervention as planned. Another issue relating to 
stopping rules fo r this trial wo uld be new information. It is unlikely that any new 
inform ation will become available during this trial that would necessitate stopping 
the trial  
2. Data on adver se events will be reported monthly to the PI th roughout this trial. We 
anticipate t hat most adver se events will be mild in nature and will al low a co mplete 
return to the same activities after a short period of time; that is, later that day or a day 
or two later.   
3. We anticipate most adverse events (if not all) will  allow a complete return to the same 
activities after a short period of time; tha t is, la ter that day or a day or two later . 
However, if a serious adverse event that prohibits  participation moving  forward, the 
participa nt will be terminated fr om the intervention.  
 
 
III. Subject Participation  
 
A. Recruitment : 
1. The recruitment plan was informed by our e xperience with completed projects where we 
successfully recruited adults with DS  (DK083539, HD094704,  AG036 909). As in our 
previous trials, project staff will contact local community agencies serving a dults with DS, 
case managers, and CDDOs by mail  or emai l, provide presentations at CDDO meetings, 
and text for CDDO newsletters describing the project. Interested  adults with DS or their 
parent/caregiver will be asked to contact the study coordinator via e mail, our website, or 
a dedicated toll -free stu dy phone  number that will be included in all recruitment 
materials. The study coordinator will contact interested i ndividuals by phone to answer 
questions and conduct an initial eligibility screen. Zoom® meeti ngs will be scheduled with 
those remaining inte rested a nd potentially eligible to complete eligibility screening and to 
obtain informed consent or parent/guardian  consent and participant assent in cases 
where the participant has a surrogate decision maker.  We will attempt t o recruit ~50% 
female and ≥ 30% minoriti es. Stud y staff will forward a form to the PCP requesting 
permission to participate.  
 
Screening Interview/questionnaire : Screening for potential study participants  will be 
done using an interest and enroll ment que stionnaire (IEQ). The IEQ will have relevant 
qualification criteria based on the inclusion criteria for the pilot study. It will also have 
contact information for potential study participants to allow the p rincipal investigator or 
study coordinator  to reac h the parent, legal guardian, or caregiver of the adult with DS. A 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 8 of 11
  
 REDCap link to the IEQ will be distributed on the flyer and d ata will be stored in the secure, 
HIPAA -compliant database. Potential particip ants who meet the eligibility criteria for  the 
research study will be contacted to review the study and the informed consent.  
 
Questions for the questionnaire in clude:  
• Do you have Primary Care Physician clearance to participate?  
• Are you between 18 -30 ye ars old?  
• Have you been diagnosed with DS?  
• Do you have the ability to understand directions, communicate preferences, wants, 
and needs through spoken language?  
• Are you living at home with a parent/guardian or in a supported living environment 
with a parent /caregiver who agrees to serve as a study partner?  
• Are you able to participate in moderate to vigorous exercise?  
• Do you have a serious medical risk (e.g., cancer, recent heart attack, stroke, 
angioplasty)?  
 
The study coordinator will contact interested in dividuals by phone to answer questions and  
conduct  an initial eligibility screen. Zoom® meeti ngs will be scheduled with those remaining 
interested and potentially eligible to com plete eligibility screening and to obtain informed 
consent or parent/guardian consent and participant assent , via Redcap ,in case s where the 
participant has a surrogate decision maker  
B. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent  
1 Kameron Suire will obtain written informed consent . 
2 Remote video chat sessions (Zoom) will be scheduled  with participants and their legal 
guardian (if they are not their own g uardian) who are deemed to be initially eligible to 
participate. This video chat session will provide an opportunity to describe the project in 
detail, answer questions, ve rify eligibi lity, and to obtain consent a nd assent . Prior to the 
consenting session,  the participant will be sent the consent form and cover letter through 
The University of Kansas Medical Center’s (KUMC) secure email system. The study team 
will use the “s hare screen”  option on Zoom to walk throu gh each s ection of the consent 
document whi le noting questions that arise and answering these questions fully. 
Participants who are willi ng to participate in the study will sign and date the consent 
and/or assent fo rms electron ically via REDCap. Participan ts/caregi vers will be given 
unlimited time to make the decision on whe ther to participa te. The study team member 
who conducted the consent meeti ng will also sign and date after reviewing the signed 
consent forms and  verifying c ompleteness. Study staff will  provide the participant with a 
fully signed consent form for their records. Medical consent from the participant’s 
physician will also b e obtai ned prior to enrollment in the study. The physician will receive 
a desc ription of t he study  and a request for medical clearanc e to participate in the 
physical activity  
 
3 Subjects whom are not their own legal g uardian will require a caregiver to give consent.  
Kameron S uire will make the d eterminat ion.  
C. Alternatives to Participa tion: The Alternative  to participation  would be not en roll in the 
study.

 D. Costs to Subject s: There will be no cost to the subject for any testing or participation  
related to this study.  
E. How new information will be co nveyed to  the study subject and how it w ill be 
documented : It is unlikely that new information would be presented during this study, 
however, the study team would review new information  and take action accordingly.   
F. Payment, in cluding a prorated plan for p ayment : Participants will be provided wi th 
Fitbit, Ring-Fit Adve ntureTM and the Nintendo SwitchTM gaming system  if eligible  and after

V. Data Analysis and Reporting  
A. Statistical  and Data Analysis:  We will calculate point estimates and confidence intervals  
for all endpoints of interest and will use effect sizes esti mated from this data to guide  power 
analyses for future trials. We expect a po sitive change in MVPA, and in 1 of the  measures of 
physical function.  Continuation to a larger trial will be based on a positive response in at 
least one of these endpoints.  
Thematic analysis will be used to analyz e qualitative data completed by res earch 
personnel23.  
B. Outcome : We expect a po sitive change in MVPA, and in 1 of the measures of physical 
function. Continu ation to a larger trial will be based on a positive response in at least one of 
these endp oints. 
C. Study results to participants : All results will be given to the s ubjects after c ompletion of 
the post -testing  appoi ntment. An interview  will be given going ove r the result s and giving 
the participants a hand -out of all o utcomes. This i s due to the p otential of positive results 
after being physically active , and could have r amification s on future behavior.  
D. Publication Plan : Publication will  be sought as a p ilot, feasibility  study based on quantitative  
and qualitative resu lts from all outcomes.

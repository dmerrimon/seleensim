1.1. Primary Objectives 
To assess the safety of IV injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate for MRI . 
 
1.2. Exploratory Objectives 
To assess the frequency and sensitivity with which lactate and bicarbonate signals can be 
detected in malignant brain tumors after IV injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate. 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 2.1. Study Disease 
Our ultimate goal is to develop a strategy to manage cancer as a chronic disease for which 
treatment can be calibrated according to the tumor’s metabolic state.  In particular, c ancer cells, 
in addition to their high growth rate, universally demonstrate an abnormal metabolism characterized by an overproduction of lactate (via a process known as glycolysis [GLY]) relative to the more energy efficient conversion of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]).  Originally described over 80 years ago by Otto Warburg, this 
altered metabolism, more recently termed metabolic reprogramming [1], is now viewed as a 
hallmark of cancer and appears linked to the need for carbon skeletons to produce biomass and 
is thus intimately tied to the ability of cancer cells to proliferate [2].  The novel clinical implication 
of these observations suggest that a potential anti -tumor strategy lies in reversing the “Warburg 
Effect” by forcing cancer cell metabolism away from GLY towards OXPHOS.  Although this would not result in cell kill per se, it should result in stabilization of growth with minimal toxicity.  
Although a number of targets exist for which active drugs could be directed, a major obstacle 
towards taking this to the clinic has been the inability to measure cancer metabolism in vivo.   
 Using a rat model, we have developed magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) 
of hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate as a noninvasive measure of lactate (Lac) and bicarbonate 
(Bic) production reflecting GLY and OXPHOS respectively  [3], [4].  W e now wish to translate this 
imaging technology to the clinic and demonstrate that these critical aspects of glucose metabolism can be measured in patients with glioma.  A hyperpolarizer that can be used clinically has been purchased and is now ready to be utilized.  We have funds in which to test 15 subjects and would like to perform a pilot test to confirm two necessary aspects of  our 
hypothesis: (i) determining that our methods for polarizing [1 -
13C]-pyruvate are safe for patient 
use; and (ii) evaluating if and how frequently we can detect lactate and bicarbonate signaling 
within brain tumor tissue. 
 2.2. Study Agent/ Device/Imaging procedure 
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRS I) is 
based on the transfer of polarization from the electron spins of paramagnetic centers embedded in a glassy frozen solution to neighboring nuclear spins through dipolar interactions, thus driving nuclei temporarily into a significant redistribution of the ordinary populations of energy levels [5].  These spin states are not stable in the sense that the induced massive spin polarization decays during a relatively short period but within this period allows one to follow a nucleus (usually carbon or nitrogen) as it is processed by a tissue.  The absence of ionizing radiation and 
convenient integration with standard MRI imaging of hyperpolarized nuclei therefore offers the 
prospect of monitoring tumor metabolism noninvasively, the potential value of which depends on three factors: (i) the T1 signal needs to be sufficiently long so that enough material is preserved after injection to measure; (ii) the metabolic pathway itself much be sufficiently rapid so that the fate of the tracer can be measured; and (iii) the process must be relevant to tumor biology  [6].   
Study IRB- 39845 / BRN0036 
Version Date 15 May 2019 Page 7 of 18 CONFIDENTIAL   
[1-13C]-pyruvate is currently the tracer for which the most preclinical and clinical experience 
exists .  Pyruvate (Pyr) is situated at a hub of the glucose utilization pathway where it can be 
reduced to lactate, amidated to alanine or catalyzed to acetyl CoA and CO 2.  Although an issue 
existed early in its development as to whether it could cross the blood brain barrier fast enough 
to allow imaging in brain tumors without disruption, unequivocal imaging of brain tumor metabolism of hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate in brain has been demonstrated [4]. 
 
Signal to noise (SNR) ratios are particularly strong for visualizing lactate ( Lac), on which 
most studies to date have focused.  Using this technology, it has been possible to show lactate 
dehydrogenase catalyzed interconversion of label between Pyr and Lac in several tumor types 
including GBM and that changes occur in the rate of labeling with treatment [4], [7]-[9] .  
Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that an increased conversion of Pyr conversion to alanine is an early feature of experimental myc -driven hepatic tumors [10].   
 
Based on numerous previous reports, tracing Pyr fate into the mitochondria has been more 
challenging and there have been numerous reports noting that imaging both lactate and bicarbonate (Bic) is difficult, especially in brain tumor [11], [12], creating barriers for using this 
imaging modality to explore the question of whether forcing OXPHOS slows cancer growth.   
 We recently overcame this hurdle through optimization of the acquisition protocol for spiral 
chemical shift imaging so as to be able to measure both lactate and bicarbonate in transplanted C6 glioma.  Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate a consistent and marked decrease in the ratio of Lac/Bic acutely after the administration of DCA  [8], substantiating at least that change in 
Pyr flux is occurring so that more substrate is directed into the mitochondria (since that is where Bic is generated). 
 This technology has been recently applied to clinical populations.  The first-in-man Phase I 
trial examined a cohort of prostate cancer patients.  It demonstrated the safety of administering 
250 mM hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate up to doses of 0.43 mL/kg body weight and that 
images could be acquired that demonstrated conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate in 
regions of biopsy -proven tumor  [13].  Since these experiments were reported from UCSF, this 
technology has become available for clinical study at M emorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 
University of Texas at Southwestern (UTSW), Cambridge University, Oxford University, 
University of Toronto, and several other centers (including ours) are gearing up for study. 
 2.3. Clinicaltrials.gov

4. IMAGING AGENT /DEVICE/PROCEDURE  INFORMATION 
 
4.1. Hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-Pyruvate 
13C is a stable non-radioactive isotope of carbon.  [1-13C]-pyruvate has exactly the same 
chemical characteristics as pyruvate.  In [1-13C]-pyruvate, the C -1 carbonyl has been enriched 
with 13C-nuclei , which h as a magnetic moment and can be hyperpolarized by DNP in the 
presence of an electron paramagnetic agent (EPA), i.e., AH111501 sodium salt (a stable trityl 
radical) .  Although [1-13C]-pyruvate has the same chemical characteristics as unlabeled 
pyruvate and is metabolized the same way, the fact that it can be hyperpolarized means that 
MRSI can be used to rapidly detect the hyperpolarized 13C-label in [1-13C]-pyruvate and its 
metaboli c products . 
 Hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate will be prepared by qualified staff at the Lucas Center under 
aseptic  GMP/GLP conditions  using a DNP polarizer (SpinLab, GE Healthcare).  The imaging 
agent will be administered by IV injection at a rate of 5 ml/sec followed by a 20 ml saline flush at 
5 ml/sec (on average 30 -40 seconds).  The formulation procedures are detailed in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB).   
 4.2. Dissolution DNP  MRSI  
Hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate will be injected at a dosage of 0.43 ± 0.05 mL /kg body 
weight (concentration of 250 mM), the maximum safely administered dose attained in the Phase 
I study  [13].  After hyperpolarization in the SpinLab polarizer , a syringe is automatically filled.  
The quality control module of the SpinLab measures the pyruvate concentration, volume, temperature, pH, polarization, and removal of the EPA in the syringe.  A quality control 
assessment is then performed to ensure all parameters are reached, after which the syringe is 
released by the protocol director and immediately passed to a nurse or radiology technician for 
initiation of injection.    
 The overall imaging protocol will consist of 1) standard non-contrast clinical collection setup 
for brain imaging (~ 45 min), 2) hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate MRSI (single- or multi -slice 
acquisition, ~3-min acquisition) , and 3) standard clinical brain gadolinium -enhanced MRI 
(~10min). 
 4.3. Dose Modification 
Study IRB- 39845 / BRN0036 
Version Date 15 May 2019 Page 10 of 18 CONFIDENTIAL  The starting dose of [1-13C]-pyruvate will be 0.43 ± 0.05 mL /kg body weight (250 mM 
[1-13C]-pyruvate).  If we encounter a DLT at this dose (which seems unlikely since it has been 
well tolerated in safety studies elsewhere), we will decrease dose to 0.28 m L/kg. 
 
The choice whether or not to use the [1-13C]-pyruvate and/or gadolinium MRI contrast agent 
is made at Protocol Director’s  discretion.  If the investigator choses to forego gadolinium 
contrast (due to concerns of gadolinium accumulation or other concerns), the second MRI brain scan may be skipped. 
   
5. STUDY PROCEDURES  Healthy volunteers ( Arm 1 of the study) will be recruited via an IRB -approved e-mail that 
refers them to the clinical research coordinator  or research team . Eligible patients  for arm 2  will 
be invited to participate at any time during their course of CNS malignancy treatment.  
Generally, arm 2  patients will be recruited during a regular  clinic visit.  
 If the patient signs the informed consent form and agrees  to participate, the following 
screening procedures will be performed within 14 days prior to Day 1: 
• Collect demographics  
• Measure vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure), height and weight 
• Serum chemistry blood test  
• Serum pregnancy test, if woman of childbearing potential  
• Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
 On Day 1, MRI and MRS I will be performed in the Richard M. Lucas Center for Imaging at 
Stanford University .  Production of hyperpolarized [1-
13C]-pyruvate will be coordinated with 
imaging schedule such that MRSI  begins within 1 minute of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate 
administration.  Each subject will undergo the following procedures : 
• Measure vital signs  
• MRI scan of brain, 45 min acquisition time using standard non -contrast clinical brain 
collection setup 
• Administration of hyperpolarized [1-13C]-pyruvate (250 mM, 0.43 ± 0.05 mL/kg body 
weight) IV injection at a rate of 5 mL /sec followed by a 20 mL saline flush at 5 
mL/sec (on average 30- 40 seconds)  
• MRS I scan of brain, 3 min  acquisition on a 3T MRI scanner equipped with both 1HF 
and 13C RF coil s. 
• MRI scan of brain, 10 min acquisition time using standard Gadolinium -enhanced 
contrast clinical brain collection. Gadolinium c ontrast agent may or may  not be 
administered at the discretion of the Protocol Director. Gadolinium will not be used 
for Arm 1 Healthy Volunteers.  
• Withi n 10 min after the conclusion of image collection: 
o Measure vital signs  
o Collect any adverse events and monitor injection site  
• At least once more  20-45 minutes after the conclusion of image collection: 
o Measure vital signs  
o Collect any adverse events and monitor injection site  
• 1 to 5 hours post pyruvate administration: 
o Measure vital signs  
o ECG  
o Collect any adverse events and monitor injection site  
Study IRB- 39845 / BRN0036 
Version Date 15 May 2019 Page 11 of 18 CONFIDENTIAL   
Between Day 2 and 4, subjects will be contacted by phone or at an in-person clinic visit to 
collect any adverse events. 
 Once initial imaging is completed, patients will be followed as expected by standard of care.  
Patients are free to enroll in other studies .

Version Date 15 May 2019 Page 12 of 18 CONFIDENTIAL  7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
 
7.1. Potential Adverse Events 
In the original Phase I studies with [1 -13C]-pyruvate, no dose-limiting toxicities or toxicities 
deemed to be clinically significant were noted [13].  We will consider any Grade 2 or higher 
toxicity judged related or possibly -related to [1-13C]-pyruvate as significant (excluding 
asymptomatic lab abnormalities).   
7.1.1. Stopping Rules 
The study will be stopped if infection attributable to any component of the pyruvate infusion 
is observed.  The study may resume after the necessary chemistry, manufacturing and controls 
(CMC) changes are made and the IND amendment is submitted to FDA and approved by IRB. In addition, the study will pause enrollment pending a safety review if two dose-limiting toxicity 
events (any Grade 2 or higher toxicity judged related or possibly -related to [1-
13C]-pyruvate, 
excluding asymptomatic lab abnormalities) are observed.  
 7.2. Adverse Event Collection 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v5 .0.  Both Serious and Non-Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event 
(AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol 
Document, or Investigator’s Brochures , and related to the investigation.   
 All AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to investigational agent, will be collected 
from Day 1 through safety follow-up contact.  From signing of informed consent to prior to 
Day 1, only AEs deemed related to study procedures will be collected.  All Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution or 4 days after the last dose of the study 
treatment.  After the safety follow -up contact, any SAEs spontaneously reported to investigator 
and deemed related to investigational agent should be reported to the IND Sponsor -Investigator 
(Daniel Spielman, PhD).  
 
7.3. Adverse Event Reporting 
Non serious adverse events will be reported annually to FDA via an Annual Report 
( ) and to IRB via Continuing Review. 
 The PD (aka Principle Investigator) must immediately report within 24 hours of knowledge of 
event to the IND Sponsor-Investigator (Daniel Spielman, PhD), any serious adverse event, 
whether or not considered related to study drug.  SAEs of all grades will be reported to the Sponsor -Investigator using the Stanford Cancer Institute SAE CRF.   
 Adverse events deemed serious, unexpected (i.e. not described in the protocol, 
Investigator’s Brochure or informed consent documents) and related to investigational agent must be reported to the IND Sponsor -Investigator by email or fax  using the FDA MedWatch 
form 3500a within 24 hours of knowledge of event.  The IND Sponsor -Investigator is responsible 
for deciding whether the event meets IND Safety Reporting criteria.  
 Even ts will be submitted to Sponsor-Investigator Dr. Daniel Spielman, at: 
Daniel Spielman, PhD  Professor of Radiology  and Electrical Engineering (by courtesy)

 It will be the responsibility of the Sponsor -Investigator to provide to the FDA all information 
concerning significant hazards, contraindications, side effects or precautions felt significant to the safety of the investigational agent being studied.  The PD is responsible for accurate and 
timely communication to the Sponsor -Investigator of any events reportable to FDA.   
 SAEs CTCAE Grade 2 and above, and all subsequent follow -up reports will be reported to 
the Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation.  Following review by the DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB 
using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for deaths or 
life-threatening experiences.  
 
8. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1. Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related 
to the study (e.g.  advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by 
the Stanford IRB  and Scientific Review Committee (SRC).  Any changes made to the protocol 
will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB , and SRC  if applicable, prior 
to implementation.  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information 
to all participating investigators.  
 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the FDA under IND in accordance to the 
regulations.  
 
8.2. Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.  Case report forms will be developed using the Oncore database system and will be maintained by CCTO.  CRFs will be kept in a locked office, only accessible to the research team.”  
 8.3. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
During the clinical investigation, the Protocol Director will evaluate the progress of the trial, 
including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of trial sites, and other factors that 
can affect study outcome.  Monitoring of the trial will occur every 8 weeks and a record of 
monitoring activities will be maintained by the study team.   
 
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC ) will audit 
study  related activities at least annually in accordance with the DSMC SOP to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating 
procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of 
regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results of DSMC audits will be

review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
 
9. MEASUREMENTS  
 9.1. Primary and Exploratory Outcome measures 
Primary Outcome Measure: This is a pilot study which will allow us to develop a novel MRS 
technique for clinical application.  Our primary measurement will be safety of [1-
13C]-pyruvate IV 
injection defined as the absence of Grade 2 toxicity (except for asymptomatic lab increases).   
 Exploratory  Outcome Measure: Detection of lactate and bicarbonate production in tumor 
and normal brain tissue, defined as the frequency of 
13C MR signal detection above background 
noise level of both lactate and bicarbonate in all tumors screened. 
 9.2. Measurement Methods 
Images will be analyzed for several conventional MR parameters, including tumor volume 
and CBV.  Pyruvate, bicarbonate and lactate signals  will be assessed by peak integration of the 
corresponding spectral peaks .   
 9.3. Measurement Time Points 
Assessments will be made only at one time point.    9.4. Response Review  
No response review is planned.  
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 10.1. Statistical Design 
This pilot study seeks to demonstrate safety of the [1-
13C]-pyruvate IV injection as well as 
the ability to detect lactate and bicarbonate spectra.  Safety will be defined as the absence of Grade 2 toxicity (except for asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities ). 
 Another goal is an assessment of whether lactate and bicarbonate spectra can be detected 
in tumor.  Three answers are anticipated.  Either there will be bicarbonate spectra detected in all, some or none.  Our experimental data suggests that we should be able to see it in  all 
enhancing areas, although the technical differences between experimental and clinical machines does not guarantee this outcome. 
 5 healthy volunteers and 10 patients  with CNS malignancies  will be assessed, which is the 
maximum that our budget will allow .  These results will then be used to properly formulate a 
more formal experiment that will subsequently be submitted. 
 10.2. Randomization 
No randomization.  
 10.3. Interim analyses 
No interim analysis is planned.    10.4. Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis

10.6. Sample Size 
Our budget allows 5 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with CNS malignancies  for a total of 
15 subjects .  This number will allow us to accrue enough data to better understand lactate and 
bicarbonate detectability and safety .   
 
10.7. Accrual estimates 
15 subjects  will be assessed over one year.  
 
10.8. Criteria for future studies 
 The data obtained from the current study will be instrumental in helping us craft the first in 
human study assessing [1-13C]-pyruvate DNP MRS in GBM patients receiving bevacizumab.

Iden�fy ing the ac�ve elements of a digital single- session interven�on targe�ng depression : a factorial 
experiment 
ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
May 1, 2024   
Arms and  Interven�on s: details  
We will conduct an  8-arm factorial trial to determine the main and interac�on eﬀects of the candidate 
components . The 8 condi�ons are provided in Table 1.

Table 1  
Breathing – This component will present a triangle breathing video for 2 minutes and will be present in 
all 8 condi�ons . 
Psychoeduca�on – This component provides informa�on on how taking ac�on can help improve our 
mood and diﬀerent types of ac�ons par�cipants can take to improve their mood.  
Tes�monials + Saying is believing exercises – Par�cipants are shown examples of how other individuals 
have taken ac�on to improve their mood . The par�cipant  is also asked  to provide advice to another 
simulated individual who is stuck in a negative mood spiral . 
Ac�on plan – The par�cipant is walked through  to plan the details of a posi�ve ac�on  that they want to 
take to improve their mood.  
Randomization 
Par�cipants will be randomized to one of the 8 condi�ons with equal probability  using Qualtrics’s 
internal randomizer . 
 
Data collec�on and sample size  
Data collection procedures  
We will recruit par�cipants through the CloudResearch Connect pla�orm. All poten�al par�cipants will 
be paid $0.25 for comple�ng a 2 -minute screener of depressive symptoms to determine their eligibility 
for the study. Eligible par�cipants will be paid $3.00 for comple�ng the ﬁrst part  containing the baseline 
ques�onnaires, 1 of the 8 condi�ons, and immediate post -interven�on ques�onnaires  (18 minutes) . 
They will be compensated $1.00 for comple�ng the 2-week follo w-up (5 minutes), and $1.00 for 
comple�ng the 8-minute follow -up (5 minutes). Payment will be delivered online through CloudResearch 
Connect.  
Sample size  
We will recruit 880 par�cipants with 110 par�cipants in each group.  
Sample size rationale  
We aimed to detect a main eﬀect  of Cohen’s d = 0. 15 for the candidate components  (we considered 
d=0.15 as the minimum acceptable eﬀect size for a candidate component to be independently useful ). 
We calculated the sample size using the MOST package in R, which performs power calcula�ons using 
simulated data.  
Stopping rule  
We will stop the trial when we have reached the required number of par�cipants. 
 
Analysis plan 
Demographic data  
We will report demographic variables as percentages of the total number of par�cipants.  
Eﬀects of candidate components and common factors  
We will run 3 separate mul�ple regression s with the PHQ -8 score at  immediate post -interven�on, 2-
week follow -up, and 8- week follow -up as the dependent variable and baseline PHQ -8 and the eﬀect -
coded candidate components  as the predictors (Collins et al., 2014) . We will use the stats  package in R to 
run the regression.  
lm(8-week PHQ -8 ~ baseline PHQ-8 + (mainEﬀectPsychoeduca�on + mainEﬀectSIBT + 
mainEﬀectAc�onPlan)^3 ) 
SIBT = Saying is believing + Testimonials  
As an exploratory analysis, we will repeat the above mul�ple regression and include c redibility ra�ng and 
expectancy ra�ng at immediate post -interven�on as predictors.  
lm(8 -week PHQ -8 ~ baseline PHQ-8 + (mainEﬀectPsychoeduca�on + mainEﬀectSIBT + 
mainEﬀectAc�onPlan)^3  + credibility ra�ng + expectancy ra�ng ) 
We will run another exploratory analysis with 8 -week PHQ -8 as the dependent variable and baseline 
PHQ -8 and eﬀect -coded candidate components as predictors, and we will include all the demographic 
variables as co -variates.  
lm(8 -week PHQ -8 ~ baseline PHQ-8 + (mainEﬀectPsychoeduca�on + mainEﬀectSIBT + 
mainEﬀectAc�onPlan)^3  + gender + age + ethnicity + sexual orienta�on + educa�on Level + employment 
+ MacArthurScaleofSubjec�veSocialStatus + programComple�ondevice ) 
We will also run 4 separate mul�ple  regression s with measures of hopelessness (BHS -4), autonomy, 
relatedness, and competence (BMPN)  as dependent variables and the eﬀect -coded candidate 
components as predictor variables. The regression coeﬃcients will provide the main and interac�on eﬀects of the candidate components 
(Kugler et al., 2018) . 
Mediation eﬀects  of autonomy, relatedness, and competence  
To evaluate the media�on eﬀects of autonomy, relatedness, and competence, we will use the joint 
signiﬁcance test  (MacKinnon et al., 2002). It is a causal steps approach to evaluate media�on eﬀects. It 
tests two null hypotheses: the eﬀect of the mediator on the dependent variable is 0  (b pathway), and the 
eﬀect of the independent variable on the mediator is 0  (a pathway) . If the eﬀects of both the b  and a 
pathway are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0, it is considered evidence for media�on  (Strayhorn et al., 
2022) . We will  separately  evaluate whether autonomy, relatedness, and competence : 
1. at immediate post -interven�on mediates the PHQ -8 scores at 2-week and 8 -week follow -up 
2. at 2-week follow -up mediates the PHQ-8 score at 8 -week follow -up. 
Inference criteria 
To determine sta�s�cal signiﬁcan ce of the candidate components, w e will use α = 0.10  to reduce the risk 
of ruling out poten�ally ac�ve ingredients (Watkins et al., 2023) . 
For all other analyses, we will use α = 0.0 5. We will use two -tailed tests for all analyses.  
Data exclusion We will exclude par�cipant data if they : 
1. dropped out before being randomized to one of the 8 condi�ons  
2. indicate that they did not par�cipate seriously in the study  
3. complete the study more than once. In such cases, if possible, we will use data from the ﬁrst 
submited survey.  
Missing data  
We will take eﬀorts to avoid missing data (e.g., a ﬁnancial incen�ve for comple�ng the study and 
reminder emails). Par�cipants with missing data at will be included in the analysis and missing data will 
be imputed using the mul�ple imputa�on method . We will use the mice package in R for mul�ple 
imputa�on.  
Exploratory analysis  
Addi�onally, w e will run exploratory analyses using data generated from this study. However, we are not 
pre-registering these exploratory tests at this �me.

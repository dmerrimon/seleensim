WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
This is a research stu dy.  We invite you to participate in this research study  because you are an adult.  
The purpose of this research study is to determine if remote limb  ischemic conditioning ( RLIC), which 
refers to reducing blood flow to the arm for brief periods of time and then letting blood flow back into 
the arm by  inflating and deflating a blood pressure cuff on the arm, can  increase performance and 
learning. The treatment effects of remote limb  ischemic conditioning will be compared to the effects of a 
sham treatment , in which no ischemia is generated. The immediate goal is to test the  combination of 
RLIC with motor training in neurologically intact adults. The long term goal is to test if RLIC augments 
the learning that occurs during a rehabilitation training exercis e in people who have motor deficits 
following stroke.   We hypothesize that people in both groups will demonstrate improved performance on the motor tasks with practice but that people in the RLIC group will demonstrate greater improvements in performance 
compared to people in the sham group.   If eventually effective, RLIC could have a profound effect on the rehabilitation and recovery of motor 
function in people with stroke.   
WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THIS STUDY?  
Your participation is for research purposes only. It will involve 9 visits to our laboratory where we will measure your ability to learn  two motor task s. The visits will be within a span of 6 weeks.   
  The first 2 visits are priming days ( D1 and D2) and will take approximately 1.5 hours and 1 hour, 
respectively. The following 5 visits are training days (D3-D7) and will take approximately 1.5-2.0 hours. 
The final two visits are follow -up days (F/U1 and F/U2) which take place two and four weeks after D7

 and will last approximately 30 minutes.  
Day 1:  
1. A trained clinical interviewer will provide informed consent and conduct a structured clinical 
interview.  
2. If you are deemed eligible and cho ose to sign this consent form, you will first be asked to 
complete a form about your medication history.  
3. You will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to either group 1 or group 2.  
a. You will not know whether you are in group one or two.  
b. Group 1 will undergo RL IC treatment and group 2 will undergo sham treatment.  
4. You will perform 3-5 trials of a balance task and 4-6 trials of a motor task to determine your 
baseline level of function.   
5. You will undergo one set of RL IC or sham treatment.  
a. Group 1 RL IC treatment will be achieved via blood pressure cuff inflation to 20 mmHg 
above systolic blood pressure, on the non-dominant arm.   
b. Group 2 sham conditioning will be achieved via blood pressure inflation to 10 mmHg under diastolic blood pressure, on the non-dominant arm .  
c. One set of RLIC or sham conditioning consists of 5 cycles of alternating 5 minutes of 
inflation, 5 minutes of deflation.  
 
Day 2: 
1. You will undergo one set of RL IC or sham treatment.  
 
 
Days3-7:  
1. You will undergo one set of RL IC or sham treatment.  
2. You will participate in motor training on a balance task and a motor task  for 15-25 minutes each, 
rest breaks taken as needed.  
  
Follow up 1 and  2: 
1. You will perform 3- 5 trials of a balance task and 4-6 trials of a motor task.  
2. You will not receive RLIC or sham treatment  during the follow-up sessions. 
3. You will fill out a survey indicating whether you think that you received RLIC or sham 
treatment.  
 
All visits will take place in a private room in Dr. Lang’s research suite which can be found within The 
Rehabilitation Institute of St. Louis.  
 
As a part of this study, some physical health information will be collected and used. This will include your past medical history, exercise history, and list of medications that you are currently taking. You are free to skip any questions that you would prefer not to answer. Some new health information may be created during the research. This could include measures  of your motor performance.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background  
ZELTIQ Aesthetics has developed and commercialized a technology to non -invasively reduce 
subcutaneous fat. The ZELTIQ technology, termed CoolSculpting and ge nerically referred to 
as cryolipolysis, enables a non -invasive alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through 
cellular apoptosis. The CoolSculpting System, which is FDA -cleared for use in the United 
States for an indication of fat layer reduction in th e submental area, thighs, flanks, abdomen, 
bra fat, and banana roll , has been clinically proven to reduce fat bulges, allowing patients to 
achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without the pain, expense, downtime, and 
risks associated with ex isting invasive and minimally -invasive procedures.  
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System using vacuum applicators for non -invasive subcutaneous fat reduction in the abdomen . 
Slightly different  size vacuum applicators will be used in this study .  
1.2 Device Description 
The study treatments will be performed using the ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System. The ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System is comprised of a control unit which houses the system 
controller and  power source, and a detachable vacuum applicator used to apply the cooling to 
the treatment site.  
 
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vacuum applicators to treat the  abdomen . 
The subjects will receive 4-6 cooling cycles during each of two treatment visits   The treatment 
cooling cycle on  the abdomen  will be  up to (REDACTED) minutes in du ration with a 
temperature of  (REDACTED) °C. At the investigator’s discretion, an additional cooling cycle 
may be deliv ered to cover the treatment area ..  
1.3 Regulatory Status  
The ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System has been cleared in the United States for use as an aesthetic treatment to affect the appearance of the flanks (DEN090002), the abdomen 
(K120023), the thighs (K133212 ) the submental area (K151179), and bra fat, back fat, and 
banana roll (K160259). Additionally, the System has been cleared for flexible treatment 
parameter ranges (K142491).  
 
The ZELTIQ CoolSculpting System can also provide localized thermal therapy (hot or cold) to 
minimize pain for post -traumatic and/or post -surgical pain and to temporarily relieve minor 
aches and pains and muscle spasms. The optional massage function can also be used for temporary:  
 
· Relief of minor muscle aches, pain, and spasm  
· Improvement in local circulation

2.9.1 Screening 
Subjects will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study participation.  Screening 
procedures include the collection of demographic information medical history and 
examination, concomitant medications, and pre -treatment imaging of the intended 
treatment area.  All female subjects of childbearing potential will be asked to take a pregnancy test (urine) prior to being treated. If the subject is pregnant, she will be excluded 
from participation.  
2.9.2 Treatment  
 
Treatment will be performed in accor dance with Zeltiq Aesthetic’s Instructions for Use for 
the CoolSculpting System and vacuum applicator.  Cooling will be delivered to the 
abdomen using two (2) applicators simultaneously. Treatment parameters such as cooling 
temperature and duration of cooling will be preset by Zeltiq Aesthetics.  
2.9.3 Follow-up Schedule 
 Follow-up will occur at 1, 6 and 12 weeks post-treatment with the CoolSculpting System.  
Post-treatment images will be collected at all in -office follow-up visits. 
 
3. Study Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoints of the study will be defined as follows:  
 
• Safety endpoint : measurement  of device - or procedure -related adverse events  
• Efficacy endpoint:  Correct identification of pre -treatment vs. 12 -week post -final 
treatment   images by two out of three blinded independent reviewers. Success will be defined as at least 70% correct identification of the pre -treatment images.  
 
The secondary endpoint of the study is defined as subject satisfaction as assessed by 
questionnaire administered at 12-weeks post-treatment.	
 
3.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
3.1.1 Statistical Methods: Overall Plan  
 
Data will be summarized based on the nature of the data. Dichotomous (e.g., gender, 
independent photographic review) and ordinal (e.g., Fitzpatrick Skin type) data will be tabulated by category. The mean, standard error, maximum and minimum will be tabulated for continuous data (e.g., age,). The significance level will be t wo-sided 0.05 for all statistical tests. 
 
3.1.2 Endpoint Analysis

Disclosure	to	unauthorized	individuals	or	dissemination,	publication	or	copying	is	prohibited	without	prior	written	consent	
of	ZELTIQ.				 	3.1.2.1    Primary Safety Endpoint 
The primary safety endpoint is measurement of all device - or procedure-related adverse 
events. All adverse events reported during and following the treatment will be included 
in the safety analysis. 
3.1.2.2   Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the correct identification of pre - vs 12- week post -
treatment images. Since weight change will affect the image, the analysis will be bas ed on 
the evaluation of the PP population, (i.e. treated subjects followed for 12 weeks who did 
not became pregnant, and with weight change of no more than 5% at the 12 -week visit ). 
Success will be defined as at least 70% correct identification of the pre -treatment images.  
3.1.2.3 Secondary Endpoint Analysis 
The secondary endpoint of the study is subject satisfaction  as assessed by questionnaire 
administered at 12-weeks post treatment.  The number and percentage of subjects will 
be summarized for each possible point grade of the satisfaction questionnaire at 12 -
weeks post-treatment.  The percentage of subjects with moderately or very satisfied will 
be provided, and the corresponding exact 95% confidence interval (per binomial 
distribution) will be calculated . The percentage and the exact 95% confidence interval of 
unsatisfied response (very, moderately, or mildly) will also be calculated.  
4.  Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events (AE) will be assessed continuously throughout the study. An adverse event is defined as  any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, regardless of whether the event is 
related to the device.
  
 
 Adverse Device Effect (ADE)  
 Any sign, symptom, or disease in a study subject that occurs during the course of a 
 clinical trial that is determined by the investigator to have a causal relationship or 
 possible causal relationship with the device under investigation.  
 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, regardless of whether th e event is 
related to the device that:  
a. results in death;  
b. results in a life threatening illness or injury;  
c. results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function;  
d. requires in- patient hospitalization or prolongation of existin g hospitalization  
e. results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure or 
function;  
f. results in fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality/birth defect.  
 
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
Any serious adverse effect on health and safety or any life- threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational

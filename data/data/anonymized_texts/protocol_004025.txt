Title of Study: A  phase  II study  of combination immunotherapy  with ipilimumab and nivolumab 
in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer  resistant  to anti-PD-1-axis monotherapy
Primary Investigator: Scott  Gettinger,  MD
Study  Center(s):  Yale  Cancer  Center/Smilow  Cancer  Hospital and Yale  Care  Centers, New  Haven,  
CT
Concept  and Rationale:
Approximately  20 percent  of unselected patients with advanced non-small cell lung  cancer  
(NSCLC) and progression during  or
 after  standard first line  chemotherapy  will experience  tumor  
response  to nivolumab1-4. Treatment  options for  patients who are  not responsive  to 
programmed death 1  (PD-1) axis inhibitor  therapy  are limited,  and the  mechanisms of primary  
resistance  are poorly  understood.
The combination of  nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently  FDA  approved for  the treatment  of 
advanced melanoma based on superiority  to either  agent  alone5. The  results of a phase  I study  
evaluating combination therapy  with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced 
NSCLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) were  presented at  the annual American Society of  Clinical  Oncology  
(ASCO) meeting in 20166. Dosing of nivolumab 3  mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  
every 6 weeks yielded an objective  response  rate  (ORR) by RECIST v1.1 of  39%, with one-year  
survival rate  of 69%  and grade  3-4 treatment-related adverse  event  rate  of 33%. These  results 
prompted an ongoing phase  III study comparing this regimen to standard first  line 
chemotherapy,  nivolumab monotherapy or combination therapy  with chemotherapy  and 
nivolumab for  patients with advanced NSCLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
We propose  a trial to evaluate  if the  addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab after  primary  
resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis therapy can lead to
 objective  radiographic  tumor  regression. It  is 
hypothesized that  ipilimumab will  enable  more  effective  immune  priming in some  patients, 
resulting in the  trafficking  of tumor-specific  cytotoxic  T cells to the  tumor, as well as depletion of  
tumor-permissive  T regulatory cells. With concurrent  nivolumab,  PD-1  inhibition in the  tumor  
will enable  effective  anti-tumor  attack  by tumor-specific  T cells. Serial tumor  biopsies and blood 
collections will  allow  interrogation of  changes in the  tumor  microenvironment  (and periphery) 
that support  this hypothesis. 
We will primarily enroll patients who have  experienced progression of  NSCLC after  anti-PD-1- 
axis therapy  without  initial  response  to such therapy (‘primary resistance’). A smaller  cohort  of 
patients with acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1 axis therapy  (i.e. progression after  initial  
response) will  additionally be  accrued.
Primary Objective/ Endpoint:
- To  determine  the objective  response  rate  (ORR) using  RECIST v1.1  to nivolumab and 
ipilimumab when administered in combination to patients with pre-treated advanced

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/20216NSCLC who have  experienced primary  resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis therapy  as their  last 
line of systemic  therapy.
Secondary  Objective(s)/ Endpoint(s):
- To  determine  the objective  response  rate  (ORR) using  immune  related Response  Criteria 
(irRC) to nivolumab and ipilimumab when administered in combination to patients with 
pre-treated advanced NSCLC who have  experienced primary resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis 
therapy  as their  last line of  systemic  therapy.
- To  determine  progression-free  (RECIST v1.1  and irRC) and overall survival with 
nivolumab and ipilimumab when administered in combination to patients with pre- 
treated advanced NSCLC who have  experienced primary  resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis 
therapy  as their  last line of  systemic  therapy.
- To  determine  ORR  and progression free  survival (PFS) by  RECIST v1.1  and irRC,  and 
overall survival,  with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with pre-treated advanced 
NSCLC who have  experienced acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis therapy  as their  last 
line of systemic  therapy.
- To  characterize  the safety profile  of nivolumab and ipilimumab when administered in 
combination,  and feasibility  of sequential biopsies, in patients with pre-treated 
advanced NSCLC who have  experienced primary or acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis 
therapy  as their  last line of systemic  therapy.
- To  evaluate  changes in the  tumor  microenvironment  and blood after  adding ipilimumab 
to nivolumab in patients with primary  and acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1-axis as their  
last line of systemic  therapy.
Study  Design:
This a  phase  II study employing a Simon two-stage  design to evaluate  the primary endpoint  of 
ORR by RECIST v1.1 to combination therapy  with nivolumab 3  mg/kg  administered 
intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks,  with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered IV every  6 weeks,  in 
patients with advanced NSCLC and primary resistance  to anti-PD-1 axis therapy. If there  is at  
least  one response  or prolonged stability (> 24  weeks) using irRC appreciated in the  first  10 
patients who initiate  trial therapy,  a  total of  40 patients will  be enrolled. An additional  10 
patients with acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1 axis therapy  will be enrolled in an exploratory  
cohort  receiving the  same  therapy.
Tumor  biopsies (and blood collection for  pharmacodynamic  studies) will  be performed just  prior  
to
 initiating trial therapy,  and 9 to 10  weeks after  receiving first  dose  of trial therapy.
Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/20217-Anti- PD-1  Axis therapy  (anti-PD-1 or  anti-PD-L1, e.g. nivolumab,  pembrolizumab, 
atezolizumab, durvalumab,  avelumab) must  be the most  recent  systemic  anti-tumor  
treatment  received in all patients, with documented progressive  disease:
a. Patients to be  enrolled to the  primary  cohort  (primary resistance) must  have  had 
progressive  disease  or stable  disease  less than 24  weeks as the  best  clinical  response  
to
 anti-PD-1-axis therapy.
b. Patients to be  enrolled to the  exploratory cohort  (acquired resistance) must  have  
had stable  disease  for at least  24 weeks,  partial  response,  or complete  response  as 
the best  clinical  response  to anti-PD-1-axis therapy,  with subsequent  progression of  
disease.
-Chemotherapy  naive  and treated patients will  be eligible,  with no limit  on  number  of 
prior  therapies. Patients with NSCLC known to harbor  an ALK  rearrangement, or EGFR  
mutation known to be  sensitive  to FDA  approved tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors (TKI), are  
only eligible  after  experiencing disease  progression (during  or after  treatment) or  
intolerance  to an FDA  approved EGFR  TKI or ALK TKI, respectively:
a. Patients with TKI  treated EGFR  mutant  NSCLC harboring the  secondary EGFR  T790M  
tumor  must  have  received prior  osimertinib.
b. Patients with crizotinib treated ALK  rearranged NSCLC must  have  received a next  
generation ALK  inhibitor  (e.g. ceritinib,  alectinib or brigatinib).
-At least  one  tumor  amenable  to incisional, excisional,  core  or forceps (transbronchial) 
biopsy. Patients must be willing to undergo tumor  biopsies before  starting trial therapy,  
and 9  to 10  weeks after  initiation of therapy:
a. If the  initial  biopsy will  be excisional,  the excised tumor  cannot  be counted as a  
target  lesion and there  must  be another  lesion amenable  to incisional, excisional,  
core or forceps biopsy. In this scenario,  the second biopsy can only  be excisional if 
the lesion to be  excised is not a target  lesion.
b. Cytology  tumor  specimens (e.g. from  fine-needle  biopsies, or  drainage  of pleural/ 
pericardial or ascites fluid) are  not acceptable. Biopsies of bone  lesions that  do not  
have  a soft  tissue  component  are also not  acceptable  (i.e. decalcified tumor  samples 
are not acceptable).
-Adequate  hematologic  and end-organ function
Exclusion
-Subjects must  not have  a history of life-threatening  toxicity related to prior  anti-PD-1  
axis therapy:
a.   Subjects with history of anti-PD-1  axis therapy  toxicities that  are unlikely  to recur  
with standard countermeasures (e.g.,  hormone  replacement  after  adrenal crisis) are  
eligible.
- Prior  treatment  with anti-CTLA-4 therapeutic  antibodies
-Symptomatic  or  untreated CNS metastases. Patients with a history of treated 
asymptomatic  CNS metastases are  eligible,  provided they meet  all of  the following  
criteria:
a.   No evidence  of interim  progression between the  completion of CNS-directed 
therapy  and the  start  of trial therapy.

anticonvulsants at  a stable  dose  are allowed.
c. Completed stereotactic  radiosurgery at  least  1  week  prior  to Cycle  1, Day 1  or 
whole-brain radiation at  least  2 weeks prior  to Cycle  1, Day  1.
-History of  leptomeningeal  carcinomatosis
-Prior  palliative  radiotherapy  outside  the CNS within 2  weeks of the  first  dose  of study  
drug
-Treatment  with systemic  immunosuppressive  medications (including but  not limited to,  
dexamethasone  at doses >
 2 mg daily (or  equivalent  dose  of other  corticosteroids), 
cyclophosphamide,  tacrolimus,  sirolimus,  azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and 
antitumor  necrosis factor  [anti-TNF]  agents) within 2 weeks prior  to initiating  trial 
therapy  (Inhaled or  topically  applied steroids, and acute  and chronic  standard-dose  
NSAIDs are  permitted. Replacement  steroids are  also permitted).
Intervention and Mode of Delivery:
Nivolumab 3  mg/kg IV every  2 weeks and Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  IV every  6 weeks
Duration of Intervention and  Evaluation:
Combination therapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab will  be continued until disease  progression 
or
 unacceptable  toxicity. Patients with progression of  disease  by RECIST v1.1 without  decline  in 
performance  status will  be allowed to continue  trial therapy  if their  treating physician believes 
they  are deriving clinical  benefit  from study therapy.
Both RECIST v1.1  and immune-related response  criteria (irRC) will  be used to assess response  to 
therapy. All  patients who receive  at least  one  dose  each of
 ipilimumab and nivolumab will  be 
considered evaluable.
Tumor  response  will be based on  tumor  assessments at  screening, every  9 weeks from the  first  
dose (for the first 24 weeks) and thereafter  every 12 weeks until investigator-assessed initial  
disease  progression.
Statistical Methods:
For the primary endpoint  of objective  response  rate  (ORR) by  RECIST v1.1 among  patients with 
primary resistance  to
 anti-PD-1-axis therapy,  a Simon two-stage  design will  be employed.  The 
design is based on our intuition for a very low anticipated response rate and not on any specific 
experimental evidence.  The study will terminate  early if there  are no responses or prolonged 
stability  (> 24  weeks) using irRC among the  first  10 patients enrolled. Otherwise  we will enroll a 
maximum of  40 patients with primary resistance  and reject  the  null hypothesis of no objective 
response if we  observe  4 or more  positive  responses. For a null hypothesis with a 5% ORR and 
alternative with a 19% ORR, this criterion has significance  level 0.1 and power  greater  than 85%. 
The null and alternative hypothesis rates are not motivated by experimental evidence but rather, 
are examples of one pair of hypotheses that can be tested using this design.  
Progression-free  survival will  be estimated with derivation of the  corresponding 95%  CI, plotted 
using the  Kaplan-Meier  method. Overall survival  will be plotted using the  Kaplan-Meier  method. 
Median OS  and corresponding 2-sided 95%  CI will be reported. Estimated overall survival rate  
(OSR) at  certain time  points (e.g.,  2
 years) and 95%  Cis will  be reported.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/20219Time-to-event  endpoints (PFS, OS) will  be analyzed using the  Kaplan-Meier  plots.  We will 
correlate OSS and PFS with ORR using Cox proportional hazards regression methods.No 
formal statistical analyses will  be conducted on
 the 10  additional  patients with acquired 
resistance, though the  finding  of immune  related response  in 1 or more  patients would be  
unexpected, and should prompt  further  study.

2. BACKGROUND
2.1. Introduction
Lung  cancer  remains the most  common cancer  worldwide7, and is the leading  cause  of cancer  related 
deaths in the United States, with an estimated 159,000  deaths in 20148. Non-small  cell lung  cancer  
(NSCLC), which is the largest  subgroup of lung  cancer  (~80%),  is most  often diagnosed at an advanced 
stage  when standard first line systemic  therapies result in a median survival of
 only  10-12  months in 
the healthiest  patients, with one year  survival rates of 40-50%9. Second line therapies are less 
effective,  with associated median survival of 8 months,  and one-year  survival rate of approximately  
30%10,11. Currently,  no more  than 2 lines of chemotherapy  are recommended/FDA  approved for 
advanced NSCLC, with lack  of clear  survival benefit.
A small percentage  of  patients with advanced NSCLC (approximately  15%) are found to have  tumors 
driven by an epidermal  growth factor  receptor  (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic  lymphoma kinase  (ALK) 
rearrangement. Treatment  of such patients with small molecule  EGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors (TKI) 
or ALK TKIs respectively,  can lead to high response  rates;  however,  the majority  of patients will 
experience  progression of disease  within a year  of starting therapy.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202111Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory  receptor  up-regulated on activated T  cells, which 
suppresses T cell effector  function upon binding  to one of its two ligands, PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) or PD 
ligand 2 (PD-L2). PD-L1  is broadly  expressed on hematopoietic  cells, while  PD-L2  expression is mainly  
found on dendritic  cells. PD-1  inhibition in certain situations can protect  against  an excessive  
inflammatory  response  and the development  of clinically  apparent  autoimmunity;  however,  in the 
setting  of cancer,  can be co-opted by tumors to suppress anti-tumor  immunity  at the site of the 
tumor. Indeed, PD-L1  upregulation has been demonstrated on several tumors,  and has generally  
been associated with a poorer  prognosis. Over  the last 5 years, durable  anti-tumor  responses have  
been appreciated with a number  of PD-1  and PD-L1  antagonist  antibodies in clinical  trials across a 
number  of solid malignancies, including NSCLC.
Nivolumab,  an IgG4  antagonist  antibody  against  PD-1,  is currently  FDA approved for use in patients 
with advanced NSCLC who have  experienced disease  progression after  standard platinum-based 
doublet  chemotherapy. In patients with advanced squamous NSCLC, nivolumab was found to be 
superior  to standard salvage docetaxel,  with median over  survival of
 9.2 vs. 6 months (HR 0.59, 95%  
CI 0.44  to 0.79;  p<0.001);  and response  rate of 20%  vs 9%. Median duration of response  was not 
reached with nivolumab,  and 8.4 months with docetaxel2. In similar  trial enrolling  only  patients with 
non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab also improved overall survival compared to docetaxel with median 
survival of 12.2  months  vs. 9.4 months (HR 0.73,  95%  CI 0.59  to 0.89;  p=0.002) with response  rates 
of 19%  vs. 12%. Duration of response  was 17.2  months with nivolumab,  compared to 5.6 months  
with docetaxel12. Nivolumab is also FDA approved for use in unresectable  or metastatic  melanoma,  
advanced renal cell carcinoma after  anti-angiogenic  therapy  and classical  Hodgkins disease  that has 
relapsed or progressed after  autologous hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation and post- 
transplantation brentuximab vedotin.
Pembrolizumab, another  IgG4 antagonist  antibody to PD-1,  is also approved for use in patients with 
advanced NSCLC and progressive  disease  after  standard platinum  based doublet  chemotherapy. 
However,  unlike  nivolumab which is FDA approved regardless of tumor  PD-L1  expression, 
pembrolizumab can only  be prescribed to patients with tumor  PD-L1  protein expression (i.e. at least  
1%
 of tumor  cells showing  PD-L1  expression). Initial  approval was based on a large  phase  I trial which 
reported a response  rate of 45%  in 73 patients with high PD-L1 expression, with median duration of 
response  of 12.5  months. Among  the 57 patients with previously  treated advanced NSCLC, response  
rate was 44%. A subsequent  phase  III trial randomized 1034  patients with advanced pre-treated 
NSCLC with at least  1% of tumor  cells demonstrating  PD-L1  expression to salvage  pembrolizumab 
(2mg/ kg or 10 mg/kg  dose) versus docetaxel. Overall survival and response  rates were  higher  with 
the pembrolizumab arms;  median survival/response  rates were  10.4  months/ 18%  (2mg/kg  dose) 
and 12.7  months/ 18%  (10 mg/kg  dose) versus 8.5 months/ 9% for the docetaxel treated group [HR  
0.71, 95%  CI 0.58-0.88  and  0.61,  95%  CI 0.49-0.75, respectively]13.  In  October  2016, the FDA 
additionally  approved the use of pembrolizumab in the first-line  setting  for patients with advanced 
NSCLC with high PD-L1  tumor  expression (i.e. at least  50%  of tumor  cells expressing  PD-L1). Approval 
was based on a Phase  III trial demonstrating  improvement  in progression-free  and overall survival 
with pembrolizumab compared to standard platinum-based doublet  chemotherapy in patients with 
untreated advanced PD-L1 high tumors,  with median of PFS 10.3 months versus 6 months  (HR 0.50, 
95%  CI 0.37  to 0.68;  p<0.001) and estimated rate  of overall survival at  6 months of 80%  in the

p=0.005)14.
Cytotoxic  T  lymphocyte  antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is another  immune  checkpoint  inhibitor  receptor  which 
is upregulated on naïve  T cells when presented with antigen. It is also constitutively  expressed on T 
regulatory  cells. Upon engagement  with CD80  or CD86  expressed on antigen presenting  cells, it 
delivers an inhibitors signal resulting  in downregulation of immune  responses. Antagonist  antibodies 
to CTLA-4  have  shown activity  across tumor  types in early  studies,  including advanced NSCLC.
Ipilimumab,  an IgG1  antagonist  antibody  against  CTLA-4, was initially  FDA-approved for use as 
monotherapy  in patients with unresectable  or
 metastatic  melanoma on the basis of an OS advantage  
found in comparison with an investigational  tumor  vaccine  and placebo as part of a randomized, 
double-blind, double-dummy  trial15. It was later  approved as adjuvant  monotherapy  for patients 
with completely  resected cutaneous melanoma with lymph node  involvement. Recently, ipilimumab 
was approved for use in combination with nivolumab for patients with unresectable  or metastatic  
melanoma based on a phase  III trial demonstrating  an improvement  in progression free survival 
compared to either  ipilimumab or nivolumab alone. The combination was associated with more  
toxicity;  grade  3 or 4 treatment  related adverse  events were  reported in 16%, 27%  and 55%  of 
patients treated with nivolumab alone, ipilimumab alone, or combination therapy,  respectively5.
The combination of  nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently  being  evaluated in patients with 
advanced NSCLC, with results from  a phase  I reported at the annual American Society  of Clinical  
Oncology  (ASCO) meeting  in 2016  (see Section 2.2.2). Based on promising  results,  a phase  III trial 
was initiated randomizing  patients with PD-L1  positive  tumors to standard platinum  based doublet  
chemotherapy,  nivolumab alone  or combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Patients with PD-L1  
negative  tumors are randomized to combination therapy  with nivolumab and ipilimumab to 
standard platinum  doublet  chemotherapy with or without  concurrent  nivolumab.
2.2. Study  Rationale
It is hypothesized that pharmacologic  antagonism  of  CTLA-4  can overcome  resistance  to anti-PD-1- 
axis monotherapy  in subjects with advanced NSCLC by enabling  more  effective  tumor  immune  
priming  and/or  releasing  immune  suppression mediated by T regulatory  cells. This approach is 
supported by preclinical studies,  and clinical  studies in advanced melanoma demonstrating  
superiority  of combination therapy  with nivolumab and ipilimumab compared to either  agent  alone. 
Preliminary  results from  large  phase  I/dose  expansion clinical  trials evaluating combination therapy  
with anti-CTLA-4  and anti-PD-1  axis therapy  in advanced NSCLC further  support  evaluation of 
combination therapy  NSCLC6,16. We propose  a trial to  evaluate  whether  the addition of ipilimumab 
to nivolumab after  primary  resistance  to anti-PD-1-axis therapy  can lead to objective  radiographic  
tumor  regression. Serial tumor  biopsies (and blood collections) will allow  interrogation of changes 
in the  tumor  microenvironment  (and periphery) that  support  this hypothesis.
2.2.1. Pre-Clinical  Studies
In vitro combinations of  nivolumab plus ipilimumab increase  IFN-γ production 2- to 7-fold over  
either  agent  alone  in a mixed lymphocyte  reaction. Increased antitumor  activity  of the  combination 
was also observed in 3 of 5 syngeneic  murine  cancer  models. In a murine  melanoma vaccine
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202113model, blockade  with either  CTLA-4 or  PD-1  antibodies increased the  proportion of CTLA-4 and PD- 
1-expressing CD4/CD8  tumor  infiltrating  T effector  cells, and dual blockade  increased tumor  
infiltration of T effector  cells and decreased intratumoral T regulatory  cells, as compared to either  
agent alone17.
2.2.2    Clinical Studies
The combination of  nivolumab and ipilimumab is currently  FDA approved for use in patients with 
unresectable  or metastatic  melanoma. Approval  was based on a phase  III study  randomizing  945 
previously  untreated stage  III or IBV melanoma to nivolumab alone, nivolumab combined with 
ipilimumab, or ipilimumab alone. Progression free survival (co-primary  endpoint  with overall 
survival) was 11.5  months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab (95%  CI, 8.9 to 16.7),  as compared to 2.9  
months (95%  CI 2.8 to 3.4) with ipilimumab (hazard ratio for death or disease  progression, 0.42;  
99.5%  CI, 0.31  to 0.57;  P<0.001) and 6.9 months (95%  CI, 4.3 to 9.5) with nivolumab (hazard ratio for 
the comparison with ipilimumab, 0.57;  99.5%  CI, 0.43  to 0.76;  P<0.001). Overall response  rates were  
44%  (nivolumab alone),  58%  (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) and 19%  (ipilimumab alone). Although the 
trial was not powered to compare  treatments by PD-L1  expression, both nivolumab alone  and in 
combination with ipilimumab resulted in a similar  prolongation of progression free survival 
compared to ipilimumab alone  in patients with PD-L1  positive  tumors (with overall response  rate 
slightly  higher  numerically  with combination therapy  at 72%  % compared to nivolumab alone  at 
58%)5.
The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has been evaluated as first line therapy  for patients 
with advanced NSCLC with promising  activity. Safety  and efficacy  results from  two combination arms 
varying  the schedule  of ipilimumab (nivolumab 3mg/kg  every  2
 weeks with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg  
administered either  once every  6 or 12 weeks), are shown below  (Table  2.2.1  & 2.2.2,  Figure  2.2.1). 
Also shown below  is another  arm of the trial evaluating  first line nivolumab monotherapy  (3mg/kg  
every  2 weeks) in patients with advanced NSCLC. Therapy  in all arms was continued until disease  
progression or unacceptable  toxicity. Patients were  allowed to continue  therapy  despite  progression 
of disease  if they  were  felt to be deriving  clinical  benefit  without  worsening  of their  performance  
status. The primary  endpoint  of all arms was safety  and tolerability,  with secondary  endpoints of 
ORR (RECIST v1.1) and PFS at 24 weeks.

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021152.2.3.  Rationale for Shorter Infusion  Times
Previous clinical  studies of  nivolumab monotherapy  and ipilimumab monotherapy  and the 
combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab have  used a 60-minute  infusion duration for nivolumab 
and 90-minute  infusion duration for ipilimumab (1-3 mg/kg  dosing  for both). However,  both 
nivolumab and ipilimumab have  been administered at up to 10 mg/kg  with the same  infusion 
duration.
In Study  CA209010  (a  Phase  2, randomized, double-blinded,  dose-ranging  study  of nivolumab in 
subjects with advanced/metastatic  clear  cell RCC), a dose  association was observed for infusion site 
reactions and hypersensitivity  reactions (1.7%  at 0.3 mg/kg, 3.7%  at 2 mg/kg  and 18.5%  at 10 mg/kg). 
All the events were  Grade  1-2 and were  manageable. An infusion duration of 30 minutes for 3 mg/kg  
nivolumab (30%  of the dose  provided at 10 mg/kg) would not be expected to present  any safety  
concerns compared to the prior  experience  at 10 mg/kg  nivolumab dose  infused over  a 60-minute  
duration.
Similarly,  ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg  has been safely  administered over  90  minutes. In the CA184022  
study,  where  ipilimumab was administered  up  to  a dose of 10 mg/kg, on-study  drug   related 
hypersensitivity  events (Grade  1-2) were  reported in 1 (1.4%) subject  in the 0.3 mg/kg  and in 2 (2.8%) 
subjects in the  10 mg/kg  group. There  were  no drug-related hypersensitivity  events reported in the 
3 mg/kg  group. Across the 3 treatment  groups,  no Grade  3-4 drug-related hypersensitivity  events 
were  reported,  and there  were  no reports of infusion reactions. Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg  monotherapy  
has also been safely  administered as 90-minute  infusion in large  Phase  3 studies in prostate  cancer  
(CA184043) and as adjuvant  therapy  for stage  3 melanoma (CA184029),  with infusion reactions 
occurring  in subjects. Administering  1 mg/kg  of ipilimumab represents one-tenth of the 10 mg/kg  
dose.
Infusion reactions including  high-grade  hypersensitivity  reactions have  been uncommon across 
nivolumab or ipilimumab clinical  studies or
 the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab. A 30- 
minute  break  after  the first infusion for combination cohort will ensure  the appropriate  safety  
monitoring  before  the start  of the second  infusion. Overall, a change  in  safety  profile  is not 
anticipated with 30-minute  infusion of nivolumab,  ipilimumab or  combination.

4. TREATMENT PLAN
4.1. Study  Design
This is a  phase  II study  employing  a 2-stage  design to evaluate  the primary  endpoint  of ORR to 
combination therapy  with nivolumab 3 mg/kg  administered intravenously  (IV) every  2 weeks with 
ipilimumab 1 mg/kg administered IV every  6 weeks in patients with advanced NSCLC and primary  
resistance  to anti-PD-1  axis therapy. If there  is at least  1 response  or prolonged stability  (> 24 weeks) 
using  irRC appreciated in the first 10 patients who initiate  trial therapy,  an additional  30  patients will 
be enrolled to a total of 40 patients. An additional  10 patients with acquired resistance  to anti-PD-1  
axis therapy  will be enrolled in an exploratory cohort  receiving the  same  therapy.
4.1.1. Tumor Biopsies  and  Pharmacodynamic Blood  Draws
A trial tumor  biopsy  will be required of  all enrolled patients before  starting  treatment. A second 
mandatory tumor  biopsy will  be performed between day  56 and 70 of trial therapy  (9-10  weeks 
after  initiation of therapy). These  on-trial tumor  biopsies must be collected via core,  forceps, or  
incision/ excision. Although the second biopsy will generally be obtained from the same site as the 
first one, there may be circumstances when another tumor site would alternatively be biopsied 
(e.g. lesion initially biopsied becomes too small to safely and/or effectively biopsy). 
Optional biopsies may  be performed at  sites of response (including partial response, or stable 
disease at least 24 weeks) or
 progression while  on treatment. We anticipate  that  such biopsies will  
help to  characterize  changes in the  tumor  immune  microenvironment  that  play  a role  in mitigating 
response  or resistance  to treatment,  respectively.
If archived tumor  tissue  from  a  biopsy performed prior  to enrollment  is available,  unstained slides 
or block  will be requested for  additional  analysis of  biomarkers (as consented to in the  informed 
consent  document).
Blood draws to  characterize  the peripheral anti-tumor  immunologic  milieu will  be collected prior  to 
the initiation of
 combination therapy. Serial draws will  be performed 2  weeks,  4 weeks,  6 weeks,  
and 9  weeks after  the initiation of therapy (should correspond with timing of on-treatment  biopsy) 
as well as at  the time  of disease  progression.

4.3. Treatment  Schedule and  Dosing  Plan
Enrolled subjects will  receive  treatment  with nivolumab 3  mg/kg as a 30-minute  infusion every 2  
weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg as a 30-minute  infusion every 6 weeks,  starting  on Day 1, until 
progression, unacceptable  toxicity,  withdrawal  of consent, or the study ends,  whichever  occurs 
first.
When nivolumab and ipilimumab are  to  be administered on  the same  day,  separate  infusion bags 
and filters must be used for  each infusion. Nivolumab is to be  administered first. The  second 
infusion will  always be  ipilimumab and will  start  no sooner  than 30 minutes after  completion of the 
nivolumab infusion.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab may  be diluted in 0.9%  Sodium  Chloride  Solution or  5% Dextrose  
solution.
Dosing  calculations should be  based on  the body weight  assessed. If the  subject’s weight  on the 
day of dosing differs by >10%  from  the weight  used to calculate  the prior  dose, the  dose  must be 
recalculated. All  doses should be  rounded to the  nearest  milligram. There  will be no dose  
modifications allowed.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202121Subjects may  be dosed with nivolumab no less than 12  days from the  previous dose. There  are no 
premedications recommended.
Subjects should be  carefully  monitored for  infusion reactions. If an acute  infusion reaction is noted,  
subjects should be  managed according to Section 4.8.5.
Doses of  nivolumab and/or  ipilimumab may  be interrupted,  delayed, or discontinued depending on  
how well the  subject  tolerates the  treatment.
4.3.1. Dose Delay  Criteria
Dose delay criteria apply to all drug-related AEs. Treatment delays are allowable up to 6 weeks
for nivolumab and 12 weeks for ipilimumab from the last dose (any dose delays greater than this
will require approval from the medical monitor).
Tumor  assessments for  all subjects should continue  as per  protocol even if  dosing is  delayed.
Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be  delayed for  the following:
-Grade  2  non-skin,  drug-related adverse  event,  except  for fatigue  and laboratory  abnormalities
-Grade 2 drug-related creatinine, AST, ALT and/or Total Bilirubin abnormalities
-Grade  3  skin, drug-related AE
-Grade  3  drug-related laboratory  abnormality  with the  following  exceptions:
-Grade  3  lymphopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase elevation does not require  dose  
delay
-Grade ≥ 3 AST, ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discontinuation
-Any AE, laboratory  abnormality  or  intercurrent  illness which, in the judgment  of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the  dose  of study medication.
Participants who have drug-related toxicities that meet the criteria for dose delay should have both 
drugs (ipilimumab and nivolumab) delayed until retreatment criteria are met. (Exceptions apply to 
the retreatment criteria after dose delay of ipilimumab and nivolumab for Grade ≥ 3 amylase and 
lipase abnormalities that are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis 
and that are attributed to ipilimumab alone.)
Rescheduling:
Nivolumab may  be delayed until the next  planned ipilimumab dose  if the next  ipilimumab dose  is 
scheduled within the next  12
 days. This will permit  periodic  ipilimumab dosing  to be synchronized 
with nivolumab dosing.
Ipilimumab should be dosed at the specified interval regardless of  any delays in intervening  
nivolumab doses. However,  in order  to maintain periodic  synchronized dosing  of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab,  the dosing  days of nivolumab (every 2 weeks   days) and ipilimumab (every 6 weeks 
  days) may be  adjusted within the permitted  5 day window, as long  as consecutive  nivolumab 
doses are given at least  12 days apart. Ipilimumab may  be delayed beyond the 5 day window  if 
needed to synchronize  with the  next  nivolumab dose.

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202125- Grade 4  neutropenia ≥ 7 days
- Grade 4  lymphopenia or leukopenia
- Isolated  Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management 
within 72 hours of their onset
- Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy  adverse events, such as, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or 
glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone 
replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose-controlling agents, respectively, 
may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the PI.
-Any Grade  ≥ 2  drug-related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease  that  does not  resolve  with 
dose delay  and systemic  steroids (also see  package insert for Pulmonary Adverse  Event  
Management)
- Any  adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of 
the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued nivolumab/ 
ipilimumab dosing.
- Any  event that leads to delay in dosing lasting > 6 weeks (or 12 weeks for ipilimumab) from 
the previous dose requires discontinuation, with the following exceptions:
1. Dosing delays  to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related adverse 
events are allowed.
2. Dosing delays  lasting > 6 weeks (or 12 weeks for ipilimumab) from the previous dose that 
occur for non-drug-related reasons may be allowed if approved by the PI.
- In the  case of pregnancy, the investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor or designee of 
this event. In most cases, the study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate 
manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for participant safety). Please contact the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. If the investigator determines a 
possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study drug, a discussion 
between the investigator and the PI must occur.
Prior to  re-initiating treatment in a participant with a dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks (or 12 weeks 
for ipilimumab), the PI must be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol 
even if dosing is delayed. Periodic study visits to assess safety and laboratory studies should also 
continue every 6 weeks or more frequently if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.
The assessment  for discontinuation of nivolumab should be made separately from the assessment 
made for discontinuation of ipilimumab. Although there is overlap among the discontinuation 
criteria, if discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with 
nivolumab may continue if ipilimumab is discontinued.
If a  participant meets criteria for discontinuation and investigator is unable to determine whether 
the event is related to both or one study drug, the participant should discontinue both nivolumab 
and ipilimumab and be taken off the treatment phase of the study. Continuation of ipilimumab 
after discontinuation of nivolumab is not allowed on study.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021264.4. Duration  of Therapy
In the  absence  of treatment  delays due  to adverse  event(s), treatment  may  continue  until one  of the  
following criteria applies:
1 Disease  progression (PD by RECIST 1.1 with exception discussed in section 4.6
2 Symptomatic  deterioration of  health status without  objective  evidence  of disease  progression. 
Every  effort  should be  made  to document  objective  progression of disease  in such cases.
3 Unmanageable  toxicity  attributed to  trial therapy  (see  section 4.9)
4 Development  of  intercurrent  illness limiting the  ability to  comply with study or  the 
development  of uncontrolled concurrent  illness that  prevents further  administration of treatment  or 
confound the  ability  to interpret  data
6 General or  specific  changes in the  patient’s condition rendering the  patient  unacceptable  for 
further  treatment  in the  judgment  of the investigator
7 Patient  request  for discontinuation,  patient  withdrawal  from  study, or patient  lost  to 
follow  up
8 Death
9 Study  termination
4.5. Criteria for Removal from Study
Patients will  be removed from study when any  of  the criteria listed in Section 4.4 applies. The  
reason for  study  removal  and the  date  the patient  was removed must  be documented.
4.6. Treatment  Beyond  Disease Progression
Subjects will  be permitted to continue  trial treatment  beyond RECIST v1.1 defined PD as long as they 
meet the following criteria: 
• Investigator-assessed  clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression
• Subject  is tolerating study treatment
• Stable  performance status
• Treatment  beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious 
complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases, impending vital organ compromise)
• Subject  provides written informed consent prior to receiving additional nivolumab and or 
ipilimumab treatment, using an informed consent form describing any reasonably foreseeable 
risks or discomforts, or other alternative treatment options. The decision to continue treatment 
beyond initial progression should be discussed with the PI.
Additionally, in cases where  the majority  of  the disease  is stable  or responding, and progressing  lesions 
can be controlled with local therapy  (i.e. resection or radiotherapy), the patient  may be continued on 
trial following local therapy.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021274.7. Duration  of Follow Up
Patients who discontinue  trial therapy  will be followed for  survival after  removal  from  study  until death.
4.8. General  concomitant  therapy  and  management  of safety  concerns
4.8.1. Concomitant  therapy
Additional anti-tumor  therapies are prohibited during  study  treatment. The use of corticosteroids or  other 
immunosuppressive  medications will not be allowed during  study  therapy  (unless used to treat  a drug  
related adverse  event). Low-dose  steroid use (≤2mg  of dexamethasone  or equivalent) as corticosteroid 
replacement  therapy is allowed.
4.8.2. Management  of Safety  concerns
Measures will be taken to  ensure  the safety  of patients participating  in this trial, including  the use of 
stringent  inclusion and exclusion criteria (section 3.1 and 3.2) and close  monitoring  (as indicated below  and 
in Sections 5 and 6). See Section 6  for complete  details regarding safety  reporting for  this study.
4.8.3. Monitoring
Safety  will be evaluated in this study  through the monitoring  of all serious and non-serious AEs, defined 
and graded according  to
 NCI CTCAE v4.0. (see  appendix 1). Patients will  be assessed for  safety  (including  
laboratory  values) according  to Section 5 Patients will be followed for safety  for 100 days following the  last 
dose  of study treatment.
General safety  assessments will include  serial interval histories,  physical examinations, and specific  
laboratory  studies,  including  serum  chemistries and blood
 counts (see Section 5 for the list and timing  
of study  assessments). All SAEs and protocol-defined events of special interest  (see Section 6) will be reported 
in an expedited fashion (see Section 6.5). In addition,  investigators will review  and evaluate  observed AEs 
on a regular  basis.
Patients who have  an ongoing  study  treatment related adverse  event  upon study  completion or at 
discontinuation from  the study  will be followed until the event  has resolved to baseline  grade,  the event
 is 
assessed by the investigator  as stable, new  anti-cancer  treatment  is initiated,  the patient  is lost to follow-
up, the patient  withdraws consent, or until  it has been  determined  that study  treatment  or participation 
is not  the cause  of the AE.
4.8.4. Management  for Immuno-Oncology  Agent AEs
Immuno-oncology  (I-O) agents are  associated with AEs that  can differ  in severity  and duration than AEs 
caused by  other
 therapeutic  classes.  Nivolumab  and  ipilimumab  are  considered  immuno- oncology  
agents in this protocol. Early  recognition and management  of AEs associated with immuno- oncology  agents 
may  mitigate  severe  toxicity. Please review the label/package insert for Management  
Algorithms developed to assist  investigators in assessing and managing AEs.

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021284.8.5. Treatment  of Nivolumab  or Ipilimumab  Infusion  Reactions
Since  nivolumab and ipilimumab contain only  human immunoglobulin protein sequences,  
they  are unlikely  to be  immunogenic  and induce  infusion or
 hypersensitivity reactions. 
However,  if such a reaction were  to occur, it  might  manifest  with fever, chills,  rigors,  
headache, rash, pruritus,  arthralgias, hypo- or  hypertension, bronchospasm, or other 
symptoms. All  Grade  3 or 4 infusion reactions should be  reported within 24 hours to  the PI  
and reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion reactions should be  graded according 
to NCI  CTCAE (Version 4) guidelines.
Treatment  recommendations are  provided below  and may  be modified based on  local 
treatment  standards and guidelines,  as appropriate:
For Grade  1  symptoms: (mild reaction;  infusion interruption not  indicated;  intervention 
not indicated)
Remain at  bedside  and monitor  subject  until recovery from  symptoms. The  following 
prophylactic  premedications are  recommended for  future  infusions:  diphenhydramine  50
 
mg (or equivalent) and/or  acetaminophen 325 to 1000 mg at least  30 minutes before  
additional  nivolumab or  ipilimumab administrations.
For Grade  2  symptoms: (moderate  reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but  responds 
promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  [e.g., antihistamines,  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, 
narcotics,  corticosteroids,  bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic  medications indicated for ≤ 24 
hours)
Stop the  nivolumab or  ipilimumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal  saline, and treat  the 
subject  with diphenhydramine  50 mg IV (or  equivalent) and/or  acetaminophen/paracetamol 325  
to 1000 mg;  remain at  bedside  and monitor  subject  until resolution of symptoms. Corticosteroid 
and/or  bronchodilator  therapy  may  also be  administered as appropriate. If the  infusion is 
interrupted,  then restart  the infusion at  50%  of the original infusion rate  when symptoms resolve;  
if no further  complications ensue  after  30 minutes,  the rate  may be increased to 100%  of the 
original infusion rate. Monitor  subject  closely. If symptoms recur, then no further  nivolumab or  
ipilimumab will  be administered at  that  visit. Administer  diphenhydramine  50 mg IV, and remain 
at bedside  and monitor  the subject  until resolution of symptoms. The  amount  of study  drug 
infused must  be recorded.
For future  infusions,  the following prophylactic  premedications are  recommended:  
diphenhydramine  50
 mg (or equivalent) and/or  acetaminophen/paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg 
should be  administered at  least  30 minutes before  nivolumab or ipilimumab infusions. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25  mg of SoluCortef or equivalent) may  be used.
For Grade  3  or 4 symptoms:  (severe  reaction, Grade  3: prolonged [i.e.,  not rapidly responsive  to 
symptomatic  medication and/or  brief interruption of infusion];  recurrence  of symptoms following  
initial  improvement; hospitalization indicated for other  clinical  sequelae  [e.g., renal  impairment, 
pulmonary  infiltrates]. Grade  4: Life threatening;  pressor  or ventilatory  support  indicated)
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202129Immediately  discontinue  infusion of  nivolumab or ipilimumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal  
saline  and treat  the subject  as follows:  Recommend bronchodilators, epinephrine  0.2 to 1 mg of 
a 1:1000  solution for  subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000  solution 
injected slowly  for IV administration, and/or  diphenhydramine  50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone  100 mg IV (or  equivalent),  as needed. Subject  should be  monitored until the  
investigator  is comfortable  that  the symptoms will  not recur. Nivolumab or ipilimumab will  be 
permanently  discontinued. Investigators should follow  their  institutional guidelines for  the 
treatment  of anaphylaxis. Remain at  bedside  and monitor  subject  until recovery  of the 
symptoms.
In case  of  late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g.,  appearance  of a localized or generalized 
pruritus within 1 week  after  treatment), symptomatic  treatment  may  be given (e.g.,  oral 
antihistamine  or corticosteroids).
5. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND PROCEDURES
A  window   of   -2 / +3  days  can  be   applied  to  scheduled  visits  for   nivolumab  and  
ipilimumab administration if necessary for holidays, vacations,  inclement  weather, etc.
5.1. Screening Period
The following  procedures and tests will  be completed during  this period to determine eligibility.  All 
procedures to be completed within 28 days of first dose, except labs.  All labs should be collected

weeks,  and thereafter every  12 weeks.
Tumor  biopsies (excision,  core  or forceps) will be performed 9 to 10 weeks after  initiating  trial 
therapy  after  the 4th or 5th nivolumab infusion to allow for analysis of pharmacodynamics changes 
related to trial therapy  (see Sections 4.1.1  and 7). Blood will be drawn for correlative  studies the 
day of the first  four  nivolumab infusions,  and the  week  after  the 5th nivolumab infusion.

6.1 Safety  Analysis
Safety  will be analyzed for patients treated in this study. All patients who receive  any amount  of 
study  drug will  be evaluable  for
 toxicity.
At each visit,  a  brief focused history  will be obtained and any indication of treatment- related toxicity  
will be evaluated by appropriate  examination and/or  laboratory/radiographic  studies.
Safety  analyses will include  summaries of adverse  event  rates and changes in laboratory  results,  as 
well as number  of
 CTCAE (v4.0) toxicity  grades for both laboratory and non-laboratory  data.
The evaluation period should extend from  date  of  first treatment  until 100 days from discontinuation 
of treatment,  and until resolution from  all acute  toxicities associated with the  drug  administration.
6.2 Definition  of Adverse Event  Terms
Adverse Event:  Any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including  an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom,  or
 disease  temporally  associated with the use of a medical treatment  or procedure  
regardless of whether  it is considered related to the  medical  treatment  or procedure  (attribution of 
unrelated,  unlikely, possible, probable,  or definite). [NIH Guidelines,  January 2001]
Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE): Any adverse  drug experience  occurring at  any dose  that results in any  
of
 the following  outcomes:
1)Death
2) A  life-threatening adverse  drug experience
3)In-patient  hospitalization or  prolongation of  existing hospitalization
4)Any persistent  or  significant  disability/incapacity
5) A  congenital anomaly/birth defect
6)Is a  new  cancer  (that  is not  a condition of the study)
7)Is associated with an overdose
8)Is another  important  medical  event
9)Pregnancy
Important  medical  events that may  not result  in death,  be life-threatening,  or require  hospitalization 
may be considered a serious adverse  drug  experience  when,  based upon appropriate  medical 
judgment,  they  may jeopardize  the patient  and may  require  medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent  one  of the outcomes listed in this definition. [Code  of Federal Regulations Title  21].
Progression of  the cancer  under  study  is not considered an adverse  event  unless it results in 
hospitalization or death.
“Serious” Versus  “Severe” Adverse Events:  There  is a distinction between serious and severe  AEs. 
Assessment  of seriousness will  be made  solely  by the serious criteria listed above.
Severity  of  AEs will be graded according  to the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  Events 
v4.0. Therefore, serious events will not be automatically  considered severe. For example,  a stroke  
that results in only a limited degree  of disability  may be considered a mild (not severe) stroke,  but it 
would still meet  serious criteria and thus,  be captured as an SAE. Similarly,  severe  events may  not 
always be  serious. An example  would be  an episode  of severe,  transient  nausea which persists for
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202141several hours. This would be  classified as a  “severe” episode  of nausea,  but  if it  did not  require  
treatment,  intervention,  or somehow  meet  other  serious criteria,  it would not  be considered an SAE.
Life-threatening Adverse Drug Experience:  Any  adverse  drug  experience  that  places the  patient  or 
subject, in the  view  of
 the investigator,  at immediate  risk of death from  the reaction as it  occurred,
i.e. it  does  not include  a reaction that, had it  occurred in a more  severe  form, might  have  caused 
death. [21CFR312.32(a)]
Unexpected  Adverse Drug Experience:  Any adverse  drug  experience,  the specificity  or severity  of  
which is not consistent  with the current  investigator  brochure;  or, if an investigator  brochure  is not 
required or available,  the specificity  or severity  of which is not consistent  with the risk information 
described in the general  investigational  plan. “Unexpected” as used in this definition, refers to an 
adverse  drug  experience  that  has not been previously observed rather  than from  the perspective  of 
such experience  not being  anticipated from  the pharmacological properties of the pharmaceutical 
product.
Laboratory  test  abnormalities: Laboratory  abnormalities that  constitute  an adverse  event  in their  
own
 right  (are  considered clinically  significant, induce  clinical  signs or symptoms, require  
concomitant  therapy or require  changes in study  treatment), should be  recorded. Whenever  
possible, a diagnosis,  rather  than a symptom  should be  provided (e.g. anemia instead of low 
hemoglobin). Laboratory  abnormalities that  meet  the criteria for adverse  events should be  
followed until they have  returned to normal  or an adequate  explanation of the abnormality  is 
found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result  corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already  
reported adverse  event,  it is not necessary to separately  record the  lab/test  result  as an additional  
event.
Laboratory  abnormalities, that  do not  meet  the definition of  an adverse  event, should not  be 
reported as adverse  events. A Grade  3 or 4 event  (severe) as per  CTCAE does not automatically  
indicate  a SAE unless it  meets the  definition of serious as defined below  and/or  as per  
investigator’s discretion. Please  note  that  a dose  hold or medication for  a lab abnormality may  be 
required by the  protocol in which case  the lab abnormality would still,  by definition, be  an adverse  
event and must be reported as such.
6.3. Toxicity Grading
Toxicities will  be graded according to the  current  version of  the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse  Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. The  full text  of the  NCI CTCAE is available  online  at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv4.pdf
If a  certain event  or symptom is not  described in the CTCAE grades, use  the following grading scale:
Mild Awareness of  event,  but easily  tolerated
Moderate Discomfort  enough to  cause  some  interference  with usual activity
Severe Inability  to carry out  usual activity
Very  Severe Debilitating,  significantly  incapacitates patient  despite  symptomatic  therapy
6.4. Toxicity Attribution
Assessment  of  attribution is made  by consideration of  all clinically  relevant  data prior  to, during,  
and after  occurrence  of the event,  including diagnostic  tests to assess the  cause  of the  event.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202142Clinically  relevant  data include,  but are not limited to; underlying disease, past  and present  medical 
history (all concurrent  non-malignant  disease),  concurrent  medications, and timing between event  
and drug administration. The  mechanism  of
 action and prior  toxicology of the study  drug should be  
considered.
An adverse  event  is associated with the  use of  the drug  when there  is a reasonable  possibility  that  
the experience  may have  been caused by the  drug. Potential attribution of an adverse  event  
associated with trial therapy  will be provided for  all study  drugs, nivolumab and/or  ipilimumab.
Attribution Standards per  NCI –  CTEP:
Unrelated The Adverse  Event  is clearly  not related to the  investigational  agent  (s)  
Unlikely The Adverse  Event  is doubtfully  related to the  investigational  agent(s) 
Possible The Adverse  Event  may be  related to the  investigational  agent(s) 
Probable The Adverse  Event  is likely  related to the  investigational  agent(s) 
Definite The Adverse  Event  is clearly  related to the  investigational agent(s)
6.5. Yale Principal  Investigator Safety  Reporting Requirements
6.5.1 Expedited  Reporting of Unexpected  SAEs
AEs classified as “serious” and “unexpected” that are possibly, probably,  or  definitely  attributed to 
drug  administration, or SAEs whose  frequency  exceeds expectations,  require  expeditious handling  
and reporting.
The PIs  will promptly  investigate  all safety  information related to an adverse  experience. If the results 
of the PIs’ investigation show an adverse  drug  experience  not initially  determined to be reportable  
(based on whether  the event  is serious,  unexpected, and associated with drug  administration) is so 
reportable, the PIs will report  such experience. Follow-up information to a safety  report  shall be 
submitted as soon as the  relevant  information is available.
6.5.2 Reporting  to the Yale Human  Investigation  Committee
All SAEs,  whether  originating at  Yale or  a collaborating  center, meeting the  criteria for expedited 
reporting  will be reported to the Yale University  Human Investigation Committee  (HIC) using HIC 
Form 710 FR  4: Unanticipated Problem  Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPIRSOs),  including  
Adverse  Events (AEs) Reporting Form  as per  IRB Policy  710.
The HIC does not  require  reporting  of any  other  Adverse  Event  type. A  copy of the IRB Policy 710  
Reporting  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others, including  Adverse  Events 
is available  at:

owchart_vF.PDF
6.5.3 Reporting  to the Food  and  Drug Administration
This study  will be conducted under  an IND (Investigational New  Drug  application) that will be held 
by the Principal  Investigator, Dr. Scott  Gettinger. The Principal Investigator  will report  in an 
expedited manner  all SAEs meeting  the criteria of
 “serious”,  “unexpected” and “related to study  
treatment”. Written safety  reports will  use a MedWatch Form  3500A. A “fillable  pdf” version with
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202143instructions   is   available    at:    http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/FDA-3500A_Fillable_08-16- 
2006.pdf
There  are two types of  expedited safety  reports to the FDA:
1. 7-Calendar-Day  FDA Telephone  or Fax Report:  The sponsor-investigator  will directly  notify  
the FDA, within 7 calendar  days after  his initial  receipt  of
 the information, of any adverse  event  that 
is ALL of the following:
Death or  immediately life-threatening
Unexpected
Associated with the  use of  nivolumab or  ipilimumab
Notification to the  FDA  will be made  directly to the  new  drug review  division in the  Center  for Drug  
Evaluation and Research or
 in the  product  review  division for the Center  for Biologics Evaluation 
and Research, whichever  was responsible  for the review  of the IND. [21CFR312.32(c)]  A written 
report  of the event  is to follow  within 15 calendar  days.
2. 15-Calendar-Day FDA  Written Report: The  sponsor-investigator  will directly  notify the  FDA  
within 15  calendar  days of
 any adverse  event  that  is ALL of the following:
Serious (due  to non-fatal and non-life  threatening criteria)
Unexpected
Associated with the  use of  nivolumab or  ipilimumab
Note:  Serious Adverse  Events which do not  meet  the criteria for  expedited reporting will  be 
reported to the  FDA  in the  IND Annual Report.
6.5.4 Reporting  to Bristol  Myers  Squibb
Investigators must  report  all SAEs to Bristol  Myers Squibb within the  timelines described below. The  
completed MedWatch/case  report  should be  faxed and/or emailed immediately  upon completion to 
BMS Drug  Safety at:  
SAE Facsimile  Number:   609-818-3804        
SAE Email Address:  Worldwide.Safety@BMS.com
Relevant  follow-up information should be  submitted to BMS Drug  Safety  as soon as it  becomes 
available.
SAE reports whether  related or  unrelated to nivolumab or ipilimumab will  be transmitted to BMS 
within 24  hours of the Awareness Date.
Additional reporting requirements to BMS include  the following:
-Any reports of  pregnancy  following the  start  of administration of  nivolumab and 
within the  follow-up period (for female  patients within 5 months  after  the last 
dose  of nivolumab or ipilimumab or the  partner  of a male  patient  within seven 
months of completing therapy) will  be transmitted to BMS within 24 hours of the 
Awareness Date.
-All non-serious nivolumab or  ipilimumab AEs originating from the  study will  be 
forwarded to BMS quarterly
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202144Follow-Up  Information
Additional information may  be added to  a previously submitted report  by any of the following  
methods:
-Adding to  the original MedWatch 3500A  report  and submitting it  as follow-up
-Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it  as follow-up with the  
original MedWatch 3500A  form
-Summarizing new  information and faxing it  with a  cover  letter  including patient  
identifiers (i.e., D.O.B. initial, patient  number), protocol description and number,  if 
assigned, brief AE description, and notation that  additional  or follow-up 
information is being submitted. (The  patient  identifiers are  important  so that  the 
new  information is added to the  correct  initial  report.)
Occasionally  BMS may  contact  the reporter  for  additional  information, clarification,  or current  
status of the patient  for whom and AE was reported. Relevant  follow-up information should be  
submitted to BMS Drug Safety  as soon as it becomes available  and/or  upon request.
6.5.5.  Duration  of Reporting of  SAEs
From  the administration of first treatment  until 90 days (unless otherwise  specified) subsequent  to  
last treatment  or withdrawal  of subject, new  onset adverse  events will be captured. Follow-up and 
reporting  of these  events will follow  the same  procedure  as for AEs observed during  the study  
period. In addition,  any unexpected Serious Adverse  Event  that occurs more  than 90 days after  drug  
administration but is possibly, probably  or definitely  attributed to drug  administration will be 
recorded and reported.
6.6. Yale Safety  Reporting and Monitoring (DSMP)
The Yale  Cancer Center (YCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will provide the 
primary oversight of data and safety monitoring. The Yale DSMC will review and monitor 
compliance, toxicity and deviations from this study. The committee is composed of clinical 
specialists with experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. 
Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Principal 
Investigator.
The DSMC  will review this protocol bi-annually, at a minimum. Information to be provided to the 
committee includes: a study narrative by the PI, a summary DSMC report produced by OnCore 
(which includes participant accrual, response, trial status history, SAEs, adverse events, deviations 
and survival); audit results, and monitoring reports, as applicable. Other information (e.g., scans, 
laboratory values, etc.) will be provided upon request. Upon completing the review, the DSMC will 
approve whether the study should continue as planned, require modification/ amendment, or be 
placed on administrative hold with accrual temporarily suspended.
Trials being  monitored by the YCC DSMC will remain under the YCC DSMC purview until a DSMC 
review has occurred that includes the research activity of the last subject who completed the 
intervention, or until the DSMC feels there are no patient safety concerns that require further 
monitoring. The DSMC will determine the length of continued DSMC review.
The DSMC  has authority to intervene in the conduct of these studies as necessary to ensure the 
safety of the participants and to maintain the highest quality in the clinical research performed at 
YCC. The DSMC has the authority to require additional monitoring and/ or more frequent reporting 
on study progress and serious adverse events.

It is the responsibility  of investigators or  their  designees to report  any pregnancy  or lactation in a 
subject  (spontaneously  reported to them), including  the pregnancy  of a male  subject's female  
partner  that  occurs during  the trial or within 120  days of completing the  trial.
All subjects and female  partners of  male  subjects who become  pregnant  must  be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy  outcomes of spontaneous abortion,  missed 
abortion,  benign hydatidiform  mole,  blighted ovum,  fetal death,  intrauterine  death,  miscarriage  and 
stillbirth must  be reported as serious events (Important  Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues 
to term, the outcome  (health of infant) must also be  reported.
Such events must  be reported within 24  hours to Yale  IRB.
6.8. Warnings  and  Precautions
No evidence  available  at the time  of  the approval of this study  protocol indicated that special 
warnings or precautions were  appropriate, other  than those  noted in the provided Investigator  
Brochures. Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the 
form  of Investigator  Notifications. This information will be included in the patient  informed consent  
and should be  discussed with the  patient  during the  study  as needed.
7. CORRELATIVE/SPECIAL  STUDIES
Correlative  studies will be conducted on  serial tumor  biopsy  and blood specimens. All patients will 
undergo a tumor  biopsy  prior  to initiation of trial therapy,  and after  their  5th treatment  with 
nivolumab (study  week  10). Blood will be drawn prior  to each tumor  biopsy  to allow  additional  
correlative  studies.
Tissue  from  Serial Tumor  Biopsies:
a. Multiplexed quantitative  immunofluorescence  will be used to evaluate  multiple  markers on 
tumor/ immune  cells, including, but not
 limited to, PD-L1, PD-1,  CK, CD4,  CD8,  CD20,  Ki67, 
granzyme  B, and IDO1.
b. RNA,  TCR  and DNA  sequencing (with neoantigen analysis)
c. Additional studies,  depending  on  tissue  availability,  may include:  functional T cell studies 
(neoantigen stimulation assay, T cell culture) and generation of patient  derived xenografts.

relation to changes in tumor  tissue.
b. Tetramer  staining using neoantigenic  peptides or  ELISPOT (neoantigen stimulation assay).
8. CRITERIA  FOR  RESPONSE
Anti-tumor  activity:  data on objective  response,  progression free  survival,  and duration of  response  
will be listed for  all patients in the  study  and summarized overall.
Objective  response  is defined as a complete  or  partial  response,  as determined by investigator  
assessment  using  RECIST v1.1  and irRC (see  appendix 3 and 4)  and confirmed by  repeat  assessments
≥4 weeks after  initial  documentation. Patients not meeting  these  criteria,  including  patients without  
any post  baseline  tumor  assessment,  will be considered non-responders in the  analysis of
 objective  
response.
Duration of objective  response  will be analyzed for  the subset  of patients who achieved an objective  
response. Duration of response  is defined as the time  from  the initial  complete  or partial  response  
to the time  of disease  progression or death,  whichever  occurs first. If a patient  does not experience  
death or disease  progression before  the end of the study,  duration of response  will be censored at 
the day of the last tumor  assessment. If no tumor  assessments were  performed after  the date  of the 
first occurrence  of a complete  or partial  response,  duration of objective  response  will be censored 
at the date  of the first  occurrence  of a complete  or partial  response  plus 1  day.
Progression-free  survival is defined as the time  from  the first day of  nivolumab treatment until 
progression of disease using RECIST v1.1 and irRC (see appendix 3 and 4). If a patient  has not 
experienced progressive  disease  or death,  PFS will be censored at the day of the last tumor  
assessment. Patients with no post  baseline  tumor  assessments will be censored at the date  of first 
study  treatment  plus 1  day.
Overall survival is defined as the time from the first day of treatment until death from any cause. If a 
patient has not experienced death, OS will be censored at the day of last follow-up.     
9.STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS
This trial is designed to  determine  the objective  response  rate  (ORR) using  RECIST v1.1  and irRC to 
nivolumab and ipilimumab when administered in combination to patients with advanced NSCLC 
and primary  resistance  to PD-1  axis inhibitor  therapy. Details on the response criteria and its 
duration are described in Section 8 of this protocol. For our primary endpoint we will employ  a 
Simon two-stage  design. This design is based on our intuition for a very low response rate and not 
on any specific experimental evidence. The  study  design will  terminate  early  if there  are  no 
responses or  prolonged stability  (> 24  weeks) using  irRC among  the first  10 patients enrolled. 
Otherwise  we  will enroll a maximum  of 40 and reject  the null hypothesis if we  observe  4 or more  
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202147positive  responses. For a null hypothesis with a 5% ORR and alternative with a 19% ORR, t his 
criterion has significance  level 0.1  and power  greater  than 85%. The null and alternative hypothesis 
rates are not motivated by experimental evidence but rather, are examples of one pair of 
hypotheses that can be tested using this design.  
An operating characteristic of this design with other ORRs is plotted here:
We anticipate  enrollment  at a  rate of at least  2 patients per month. Patients who drop out or leave 
the study before receiving any experimental treatment will be replaced.  Patients who leave the study 
after receiving any study treatment will be considered as treatment failures and not be replaced.
Our secondary analyses correlate ORR, time-to-event measures and correlative metrics listed in 
Section 7. Specifically, duration of response, progression-free  survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
will be estimated along with the corresponding  95%  CI, plotted using  the Kaplan-Meier  method. 
These plots will also be prepared separately by RECIST v 1.1 criteria and irRC and tested using the log-rank 
test.  Duration of response, OS, and PFS are defined in Section 8. 
Marker data and other metrics listed in Section 7 will be correlated to ORR and PFS using Cox 
proportional hazard regression methods. These values will be analyzed marginally using heatmaps 
and single linkage to identify any subpopulations.
The following analysis  sets will be defined in this trial:
Full  Analysis Set: All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of any trial treatment.
Completer  Analysis Set: All subjects who complete the trial, all scheduled treatments, all 
biomarker assessments, and all tumor assessments.
Safety  Analysis Set: All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of any trial treatment but 
subsequently drop out of the study for any reason.
Correlative  Biomarker Set: All subjects who receive at least one dose of any trial treatment 
and have at least one set of correlative marker data listed in Section 7.
No formal statistical ORR analyses will be conducted on the 10 additional  patients with acquired

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202148resistance, though the finding  of  immune  related response  in 1 or more  patients would be 
unexpected, and should prompt  further  study.
Demographics and baseline  laboratory results will be summarized by cohort (primary and acquired 
resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy) and by all patients using descriptive statistics.
Safety analysis  will be performed in all treated subjects. Descriptive statistics of safety will be 
presented using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.0 by cohort (primary and acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 axis therapy) and by all 
patients.  All on-study AEs, drug-related AEs, SAEs and drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using 
worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria by system organ class and preferred term. On-study lab 
parameters including hematology, coagulation, chemistry, liver function and renal function will be 
summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria.

Measurability of Tumor at  Baseline 
Definitions
At baseline, tumor  lesions/lymph nodes  will be categorized measurable  or  non-measurable  
as follows:
a. Measurable Tumor Lesions
Tumor Lesions. Tumor  lesions must  be  accurately  measured in at  least  one  dimension 
(longest  diameter in the plane of measurement  is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
- 10  mm by CT or MRI scan (CT/MRI  scan slice  thickness/interval  no greater  
than 5 mm)
- 10-mm  caliper  measurement  by clinical  examination (lesions that  cannot  be 
accurately measured with calipers should be  recorded as non-measurable)
- 20  mm by chest X-ray
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202151Malignant  Lymph  Nodes. To be  considered pathologically  enlarged and measurable,  a  
lymph node must  be  15 mm in the short  axis when assessed by  CT scan (CT scan slice  
thickness recommended to be no greater  than 5 mm). At baseline  and in follow-up,  only 
the short  axis will  be measured and followed. See also notes below on “Baseline  
Documentation of Target and Non-Target Lesions” for information on lymph node  
measurement.
b. Non-Measurable Tumor Lesions
Non-measurable  tumor  lesions encompass small lesions (longest  diameter   10 mm 
or pathological  lymph nodes with  10 to  15 mm  short  axis), as well  as truly
non-measurable  lesions. Lesions considered truly  non-measurable include:  
leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, pleural  or pericardial effusion,  inflammatory  breast  
disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  of skin or  lung,  peritoneal spread, and abdominal 
masses/abdominal  organomegaly  identified by physical examination that is not  
measurable  by reproducible  imaging  techniques.
c. Special  Considerations  Regarding Lesion  Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic  lesions, and lesions previously  treated with local therapy  require  
particular  comment, as outlined below.
Bone lesions:
- Bone  scan, positron emission tomography  (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequate  imaging  techniques to measure  bone  lesions. However,  these  techniques 
can be  used to confirm the  presence or  disappearance of bone lesions.
-Lytic  bone  lesions or mixed lytic-blastic  lesions, with identifiable  soft  tissue  
components, that can be evaluated by  cross-sectional imaging  techniques such as CT or  
MRI can be  considered measurable  lesions if the soft tissue  component  meets  the 
definition of measurability  described above.
-Blastic  bone lesions are  non-measurable.
Cystic  lesions:
-Lesions that meet  the criteria for  radiographically  defined simple  cysts should not be  
considered malignant  lesions (neither  measurable  nor non-measurable) since  they  are,  
by definition, simple  cysts.
-Cystic  lesions  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases can be considered measurable  
lesions if they meet the  definition of measurability  described above. However, if non- 
cystic  lesions are present  in the same  patient, these  are preferred for  selection as 
target lesions.
Lesions with prior  local treatment:
- Tumor  lesions situated in a previously  irradiated area, or  in an area subjected to other  
loco-regional  therapy, are usually  not considered measurable  unless there  has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. For this study, such lesions will be considered 
measurable  if they are clearly  progressing  and meet  other  RECIST 1.1  criteria.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202152Target  Lesions:  Specifications  by  Methods  of Measurements
a. Measurement  of Lesions
All measurements should be  recorded in  metric  notation, using  calipers if clinically  
assessed. All
 baseline  evaluations should be performed as close  as possible to the 
treatment  start  and never  more than 4 weeks before  the beginning  of the treatment.
b. Method  of Assessment
The same  method of  assessment  and the same  technique  should be used to characterize  
each identified and reported lesion at  baseline  and during  study. Imaging-based 
evaluation should always be the preferred option.
Clinical Lesions. Clinical lesions  will only  be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and  10 mm  in diameter as assessed using  calipers (e.g., skin nodules). For the 
case  of skin lesions, documentation by  color  photography, including a ruler to estimate  the 
size of the lesion,  is suggested.
Chest  X-Ray. Chest CT is  preferred over chest X-ray, particularly  when progression is  an 
important endpoint, since  CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly  in identifying   
new lesions. However,  lesions on chest  X-ray may  be considered measurable  if they  are 
clearly  defined and surrounded by aerated lung.
CT, MRI. CT is  the best currently  available  and  reproducible  method to  measure lesions 
selected for  response assessment. This guideline  has defined measurability  of lesions on 
CT scan based on  the assumption that  CT slice  thickness is 5 mm or less. When CT scans 
have slice  thickness greater  than 5 mm, the minimum  size  for a measurable lesion should 
be twice the slice  thickness. MRI is also acceptable.
If prior  to  enrollment  it is known that  a patient  is unable to undergo CT scans
with intravenous (IV) contrast  due  to allergy  or  renal insufficiency, the decision as to  
whether  a non-contrast  CT or  MRI (without IV contrast) will  be used to evaluate the  
patient at baseline  and during  the study should be guided by the tumor  type  under  
investigation and the anatomic  location of the disease. For patients who develop 
contraindications to contrast after  baseline  contrast CT is  done,  the decision as to  whether  
non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) will be performed should also be  
based on the tumor  type and the anatomic  location of the  disease and should be   
optimized to allow  for comparison with the  prior studies if possible. Each case should be  
discussed with the radiologist  to determine  if substitution of these  other approaches is 
possible and, if not, the patient should be  considered not  evaluable from  that  point   
forward. Care must  be  taken in  measurement  of target lesions on a different  modality  and 
interpretation of  non-target  disease  or new lesions since  the same  lesion may appear  to 
have a different  size using  a new  modality.
Ultrasound. Ultrasound is  not useful in assessment  of lesion size and should not  be used 
as a method of measurement.

techniques for  objective  tumor evaluation cannot  generally  be advised.
Tumor Response Evaluation
Assessment  of Overall  Tumor Burden  and  Measurable Disease
To assess objective response  or future  progression, it  is necessary  to  estimate  the overall 
tumor burden at baseline  and to  use this as a comparator  for subsequent  measurements. 
Measurable  disease  is defined by the presence of at least  one  measurable  lesion, as 
detailed above.
Baseline Documentation  of  Target  and  Non-Target  Lesions
When more  than one measurable  lesion is  present  at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum  
of five lesions total  (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target  lesions and will be recorded and  measured                  
at baseline. This means in instances where  patients have only  one or two organ sites 
involved, a maximum of two lesions (one site) and four  lesions (two sites), respectively,   
will be recorded. Other  lesions (albeit  measurable) in  those organs will be  recorded as
non-measurable  lesions (even if the  size is  10 mm by CT scan).
Target  lesions  should be selected on the basis  of their size  (lesions with the longest  
diameter) and be representative  of all involved organs, but  additionally, should lend 
themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements. It may  be the case  that, on occasion,  
the largest  lesion does  not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance  
the next  largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly  should be  selected.
Lymph nodes merit special  mention since  they  are normal anatomical structures that may  
be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above,  pathological nodes 
that are defined as measurable  and may  be identified as target  lesions must  meet  the 
criterion of a short  axis of  15 mm by CT scan. Only the  short  axis of these  nodes will 
contribute  to the baseline sum.  The  short  axis of the node is the diameter  normally  used 
by radiologists to judge  if a node  is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally  
reported as two dimensions in the  plane in which the image  is obtained (for CT scan, this is  
almost  always the axial plane;  for MRI the plane  of acquisition may be axial, sagittal,  or 
coronal). The  smaller  of these  measures is the short  axis. For  example, an abdominal  
node that is reported as being 20 mm  30 mm has a short  axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a 
malignant, measurable  node. In this  example,  20 mm should be recorded as the node  
measurement. All  other  pathological  nodes (those  with short  axis  10 mm but  15 mm)  
should be considered non-target  lesions. Nodes that  have a short  axis  10 mm are  
considered non-pathological and  should not  be recorded or  followed.
A sum  of  the diameters (longest  for non-nodal  lesions, short  axis for  nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the  baseline sum of diameters. If lymph 
nodes are to be included in the sum,  then,  as noted above,  only the short  axis is added into 
the sum. The baseline  sum  of diameters will be used  as a reference  to further  characterize  
any objective  tumor  regression in the measurable  dimension of the disease.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202154All other  lesions (or sites of  disease), including  pathological lymph nodes,
should be  identified as  non-target  lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements are  not required and  these  lesions should be  followed as “present,” 
“absent,” or  in rare  cases “unequivocal progression.”
In addition, it is  possible  to record multiple  non-target  lesions involving the same  organ as 
a single  item  on the Case  Report  Form (CRF) (e.g.,  “multiple enlarged pelvic  lymph nodes” 
or “multiple  liver  metastases”).
Response Criteria
a. Evaluation  of Target  Lesions
This section provides the  definitions  of the criteria used to determine  objective  tumor  
response  for target lesions.
-Complete  response  (CR):  disappearance  of  all target  lesions
Any pathological  lymph nodes  (whether  target or  non-target) must have  reduction in short  
axis to  10 mm.
- Partial  response  (PR):  at least  a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  
lesions, taking as reference  the baseline  sum of diameters
-Progressive  disease  (PD):  at  least a 20%  increase  in the  sum  of diameters of target  
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir),  including baseline
In addition to  the relative increase  of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute  
increase  of at  least  5 mm.
The appearance  of one or more  new lesions is also considered progression.
- Stable  disease (SD):  neither sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor sufficient  increase  
to qualify for PD, taking as reference  the smallest  sum on study
b. Special  Notes  on the Assessment  of Target  Lesions
Lymph  Nodes. Lymph nodes identified as target  lesions  should always have the  actual 
short
 axis measurement  recorded (measured in the same  anatomical plane  as the baseline  
examination),  even if the  nodes regress to  10 mm on study. This means that  when 
lymph nodes are included as target  lesions, the sum of lesions may  not be zero even if CR  
criteria are met  since a normal lymph node is defined as having  a short  axis  10 mm.
Target  Lesions  That  Become Too  Small  to Measure. While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at  baseline  should have  their  actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent  evaluation,  even when very  small (e.g.,  2 mm). However,  sometimes lesions 
or lymph nodes that  are recorded as target  lesions at baseline  become so faint  on CT scan 
that the  radiologist  may not feel comfortable  assigning  an exact  measure  and may report  
them as being too small to  measure. When this occurs, it is important  that  a value  be 
recorded on the CRF as follows:
-If it  is the opinion of the radiologist  that  the lesion has likely  disappeared,  
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.
-If the lesion is  believed to be present  and is faintly  seen but  too small to  measure, a 
default value of 5 mm should be assigned and BML (below measurable  limit) should be

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202155ticked. (Note:  It is  less likely that  this rule will  be used  for lymph nodes since  they  
usually have a definable  size when normal  and are frequently  surrounded by fat such 
as in the retroperitoneum;  however,  if a lymph node is believed to  be present  and
is faintly  seen but  too small to measure, a default  value of 5 mm should be assigned in 
this circumstance  as well  and BML should also be  ticked.)
To reiterate, however,  if  the radiologist  is able  to provide an actual measure, that  should  
be recorded, even if it  is  below 5 mm, and,  in that  case, BML should not be ticked.
Lesions  That  Split  or  Coalesce on Treatment. When non-nodal  lesions fragment, the  
longest  diameters of the  fragmented portions should be added together  to calculate the 
target lesion sum. Similarly,  as lesions coalesce, a plane  between them  may  be maintained 
that would aid in obtaining  maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If 
the lesions have truly  coalesced such that they  are no longer separable,  the vector  of the 
longest  diameter in this instance  should be  the maximal longest  diameter for the  
coalesced lesion.
c. Evaluation  of Non-Target  Lesions
This section provides the  definitions  of the criteria used to determine  the tumor response  
for the group of non-target lesions. While some  non-target  lesions may actually be 
measurable,  they need not  be measured and,  instead, should be  assessed only  
qualitatively at the timepoints specified in  the protocol.
-CR: disappearance of all  non-target  lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor  
marker  level)
All lymph  nodes must  be non-pathological in size  ( 10 mm short  axis).
-Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence  of one  or more  non-target lesion(s) and/or  (if applicable) 
maintenance
 of tumor  marker  level above  the normal limits
- PD:  unequivocal  progression of existing  non-target lesions
The appearance  of one or more  new lesions is also considered progression.
d. Special  Notes  on Assessment  of Progression  of Non-Target  Disease
When  the Patient  Also  Has Measurable Disease. In this setting, to achieve  unequivocal  
progression on the  basis
 of the non-target  disease, there  must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening  in non-target  disease  in a magnitude that, even in  the presence  of 
SD or PR in target  disease, the  overall tumor  burden has increased sufficiently  to merit  
discontinuation of therapy. A  modest  increase in the  size of one  or more  non-target  
lesions is usually not  sufficient  to qualify for unequivocal  progression status. The  
designation of overall progression solely  on the basis of change  in non-target  disease  in 
the face of SD or PR of target  disease will  therefore  be extremely  rare.
When  the Patient  Has  Only  Non-Measurable Disease. This  circumstance  arises in some  
Phase III  trials when it  is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable  disease. The  
same  general concepts apply  here  as noted above;  however, in  this instance, there is no 
measurable  disease assessment  to factor into the  interpretation of an increase in  non- 
measurable  disease  burden. Because  worsening  in non-target  disease cannot  be easily
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202156quantified (by  definition:  if all lesions are  truly non-measurable), a useful test  that  can be  
applied when assessing  patients for unequivocal  progression is to consider if the increase  
in overall disease  burden  based on the change in non-measurable  disease  is comparable in 
magnitude to the increase  that  would be required to declare PD for measurable  disease,  
that is, an increase  in tumor burden representing  an additional 73%  increase in volume  
(which is equivalent  to a 20% increase  in diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples 
include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to  “large” or an increase in  
lymphangitic  disease  from  localized to widespread or may be described in protocols as 
“sufficient  to require a change in therapy.” If unequivocal  progression is seen, the patient  
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While  it would be ideal to have  
objective criteria to apply  to non-measurable  disease, the  very  nature  of that  disease  
makes it impossible  to do so;  therefore,  the increase  must  be substantial.
e. New Lesions
The appearance  of  new  malignant lesions denotes disease  progression;  therefore,  some  
comments on detection of new  lesions are  important. There  are no specific  criteria  for the 
identification of new  radiographic  lesions; however, the  finding of a new lesion should be  
unequivocal, that is, not  attributable to differences in  scanning  technique,  change in 
imaging modality, or  findings thought  to represent  something  other  than tumor (for  
example, some “new” bone lesions may  be simply  healing  or flare of preexisting  lesions). 
This is particularly  important  when the patient’s baseline lesions show  partial or complete  
response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report  as a 
“new” cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified during  the study in an anatomical location that  was not  scanned  at  
baseline is  considered a new lesion and will indicate  disease  progression.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example  because  of its small size, continued therapy  and 
follow-up evaluation will  clarify if it  represents truly  new disease. If repeat scans confirm  
there  is definitely  a new  lesion,  then progression should be  declared using  the date  of the 
initial scan.
Evaluation  of  Response
a. Timepoint  Response (Overall  Response)
It is assumed that  at each protocol-specified timepoint, a response  assessment  
occurs. Table A3.1  provides a summary  of the  overall response status calculation 
at each timepoint for  patients who have measurable  disease  at baseline.
When patients have  non-measurable  (therefore  non-target) disease  only, Table A3.2  is 
to be used.

Unequivocal PD Yes or no PD
Any Yes PD
CR  complete  response;  NE  not evaluable;  PD  progressive  disease.
a   “Non-CR/non-PD” is preferred over  “stable  disease” for  non-target  disease  since  
stable disease  is increasingly  used as an endpoint  for assessment  of efficacy  in some  
trials; thus, assigning “stable  disease” when no  lesions can be measured is not 
advised.
b. Missing Assessments  and  Not-Evaluable Designation
When no  imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular  timepoint, the  patient  is not 
evaluable  at that  timepoint. If only  a subset  of lesion measurements are made at  an 
assessment, usually  the case is  also considered not  evaluable at  that  timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument  can be made that the contribution of the individual missing  lesion(s) 
would not change  the assigned timepoint  response. This would be most likely  to happen 
in the case  of PD. For  example, if a patient  had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three  
measured lesions and,  during the study,  only  two lesions were assessed,  but those gave  a 
sum of 80 mm; the patient will have achieved PD status, regardless of the  contribution of 
the missing  lesion.
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202158If one  or  more  target  lesions were  not assessed either  because  the scan was not done  or 
the scan could not  be assessed because of poor  image  quality or obstructed view,  the 
response for  target  lesions should be  “unable  to assess” since  the patient  is not evaluable. 
Similarly,  if one or more  non-target lesions are  not assessed, the  response  for non-target  
lesions should be “unable to  assess” except  where  there  is clear  progression. Overall 
response  would be “unable  to assess” if  either  the target  response  or the non-target  
response  is “unable  to assess,” except  where  this is clear evidence  of progression as this 
equates with the case  being not evaluable at  that  timepoint.

a   If a CR  is truly met at the first timepoint, any disease  seen at a subsequent   
timepoint, even disease  meeting  PR criteria relative  to baseline, qualifies as PD  at 
that point  (since  disease  must have  reappeared after  CR). Best  response would 
depend on whether  the minimum duration for SD was met. However,  sometimes CR  
may be claimed when subsequent  scans suggest  small lesions were likely  still  
present and in fact the patient  had PR, not CR, at  the first timepoint. Under these  
circumstances,  the original CR  should be  changed to PR and the  best response is PR.
c. Special  Notes  on Response Assessment
When nodal  disease  is included in  the sum of target  lesions and the  nodes decrease  to 
“normal” size ( 10 mm),  they  may  still have  a measurement  reported on scans. This 
measurement  should be  recorded even though  the nodes are normal in order  not to
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/2021
APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202159overstate  progression should it  be based on increase in  size  of the nodes. As  noted earlier,  
this means that  patients with CR may  not have  a total sum of “zero” on the CRF.
Patients with a  global deterioration of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment  
without objective  evidence of disease  progression at that time  should be reported as 
“symptomatic  deterioration.” Every  effort should be made  to document  objective  
progression even after  discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic  deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response;  it is a reason for stopping study  therapy. The   
objective response  status of such patients is  to be determined by evaluation of target  and 
non-target  disease  as shown in  Tables A3.1-A3.3.
For equivocal findings  of progression (e.g., very  small and uncertain new lesions;  
cystic  changes or necrosis in existing  lesions),  treatment may continue  until  the next  
scheduled assessment. If at  the next scheduled assessment  progression is confirmed,  
the date  of progression should be  the earlier  date when progression was suspected.
In studies for  which patients with advanced disease are eligible  (i.e., primary  disease  still or  
partially present),  the primary  tumor should also be  captured as  a target  or non-target   
lesion, as  appropriate. This is  to avoid an incorrect  assessment  of complete  response if the   
primary tumor  is still present  but not evaluated as a target  or non-target  lesion

APPROVED BY THE YALE UNIVERSITY IRB 4/1/202160Appendix 4: Immune-Related  Response Criteria  
INTRODUCTION
Increasing  clinical  experience  indicates that  traditional response  criteria (e.g.,  Response  
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,  Version 1.1  [RECIST v1.1]  and  World Health 
Organization [WHO]) may  not be sufficient  to characterize fully  activity  in the  new era of 
target therapies and/or  biologics. In studies with cytokines, cancer  vaccines,
and monoclonal  antibodies, complete  response, partial response, or  stable  disease  has 
been shown to occur  after an increase  in tumor  burden as characterized by  progressive  
disease  by traditional response  criteria. Therefore,  conventional  response  criteria may not 
adequately  assess the  activity of immunotherapeutic  agents because  progressive  disease  
(by initial radiographic  evaluation) does not  necessarily  reflect therapeutic  failure.
Long-term  effect  on  the target disease  must also be  captured. The  immune-related 
response  criteria19 (irRC) are criteria that attempt  to do that by enhancing  characterization 
of new response  patterns that  have been observed with immunotherapeutic  agents
(i.e., ipilimumab). (Note:  The irRC only  index and measurable  new  lesions are taken 
into account.)

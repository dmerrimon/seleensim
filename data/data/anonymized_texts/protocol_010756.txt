Name of Sponsor/Company:  Bausch & Lomb Incorporated   
Name of  Investigational Device : enVista ® Trifocal Intraocular Lens   
 
Title of Study:  A Prospective Multicenter , Randomized, Active -Controlled  Clinical Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of the enVista ® One -Piece Hydrophobic Acrylic Trifocal 
Intraocular Lens in Subjects Undergoing Cataract Extraction  
 
Number of clinical centers:  Approximately  twenty  (20) clinical centers  in North America  
 
Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the enVista  trifocal intraocular l ens (IOL) 
when implanted in the capsular bag.  
 
Methodology:  The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained to the 
potential participant. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the treatment and follow -up 
requirements will be determined .  Written informed consent will be obtaine d from each study 
subject prior to performin g any study- specific procedures that are not part of the Investigator’s 
routine standard of care. Enrolled subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be seen at 11 or  12

Approximately five hundred and one (501) subjects ( approximately 1,002 eyes) will be enrolled in 
this study  to obtain complete follow -up for one year on at least 300 T est subjects  and 150 active 
Control subjects : 
- Group 1 (Test) : Approximately 334 subjects will be treated  bilaterally with the enVista  
MX60EF ( trifocal ) multifocal  IOL  (MIOL) ; 
- Group 2 (Control) : Approximately 167 control subjects will be implanted bilaterally  with 
the enVista  MX60 E monofocal IOL  
 
“Treatment” is defined here as the IOL touching the eye. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will 
be randomly assigned to Group 1 or 2 in a 2:1 ratio.  Enrollment and randomization will occur at 
the first eye’s Operative Visit (Day 0).  Subjects and designated postoperative evaluator(s)  will be 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 111 
 masked to the IOLs assigned.  The Investigator implanting the IOL and designated site personnel 
will be unmasked to the Group assignment for a subject.   
 
The first eye implanted will be designated eye A, and the second eye implanted will be designated 
eye B.  The eye w ith the worse  best-corrected distance visual acuity ( BCDVA , CDVA) at the 
Preoperative Visit will be treated first (eye A) and used in the primary monocular evaluations. Glare 
testing of both eyes will be done if either requires it to determine eligibility.  If the qualifying visual 
acuity is obtained with a glare source, the eye with the worse BCDVA with glare will be designated 
as eye A.   If BCDVA is the same for both eyes, the right eye will be treated first. Postoperatively, 
all eyes will undergo ophthalm ic examinations at regular intervals per the study visit schedule 
through Visit 5 (330 -  420 days after second eye IOL implantation).   
 Study enrollment will occur  in three Phases as follows:   
Phase I/Pilot – Approximately 27 Group 1 (Test IOL) subjects will be enrolled and followed 
to Post -Operative Visit 3B  (30 to 60 days after second eye IOL implantation) before a decision 
is made to initiate Phase II enrollment .  Approximately 14 s ubjects wi ll also be randomized to 
Group 2 (Control IOL) during this phase.  A designated unmasked statistician(s) will 
summarize P hase I/Pilot distance -corrected near visual acuity ( DCNVA)  and distance -
corrected intermediate visual acuity ( DCIVA)  data from Group 1 first implanted eyes for 
review  by a clinical team not associated with the study , and the best near and intermediate 
distances will be selected for Phase II and Phase III evaluation . Phase I safety data will also be 
summarized for review by an unmasked clinical review er not associated wit h the study, and a 
decision to initiate Phase II will be made by the FDA based on Phase I data.  
Phase II – Approximately 48 additional Group 1 subjects will be enrolled.  Approximately 24 
subjects will also be randomized to Group 2 during this phase.  When a minimum  of 50  Phase 
I and Phase II Group 1 subjects have been enrolled and followed through Visit 4, summaries 
and/or listings of all available safety data through Visit 4 will be prepa red by an unmasked 
statistical team.  Aggregated safety data for the minimum first 50  Phase I and Phase II Group 
1 subjects  who complete  Visit 4 will be presented to the FDA to request expansion to Phase 
III.  Safety data for approximately the corresponding minimum first 25 Phase I and Phase II 
Group 2 subjects who complete Visit 4 also will be submitted concurrently to the FDA.   While 
safety data submission and FDA review for these subjects is occurring, additional subjects may 
be enrolled up t o a maximum of approximately 72 Phase II  subjects  (including those whose 
data were submitted to FDA) .    
Phase III -  Remainder of subjects will be enrolled and followed to Post -Operative Visit 5 or for 
subjects who have consented and enrolled in the Trial Frames Astigmatism sub -study, to Visit 
6.

 Planned enrollment in all Phases is schematized in the following diagram.   
 
A pilot test will be conducted as Phase I /Pilot to identify  the best near and intermediate distance s 
to be  tested during Phase s II – III. Fixed near and intermediate distances of 40 cm and 6 6 cm, 
respectively, will be measured for all  enrolled subjects .  During Phase I/Pilot,  DCNVA will be 
collected at three candidate distances: 30  cm, 35  cm, and 40 cm, and DCIVA will be collected at 
three candidate distances: 56, 66 and 76 cm. This phase will include approximately the first 27 
subjects  implanted with the enVista  trifocal  MIOL in Group 1 and approximately the first 14 
subjects  implanted with the enVista  monofocal IOL  in Group 2. Photopic mon ocular DCNVA and 
DCIVA will be assessed at each candidate distance at Visit  3A using ETDRS charts normalized f or 
letter size as a function of  distance tested . The near and intermediate distance VA data from  Phase  
I/Pilot subjects will be excluded from near and intermediate VA hypothesis testing and will be 
summarized separately from the near and intermediate  distance VA data of the other  subjects. For 
all assessments other than near and intermediate VA  measurements, Phase I/Pilot  subject s’ data 
will be pooled with the other  subject s’ data.  
The best distances of 40 cm and 66 cm will be used for near and intermediate visual acuity testing, 
respectively, in Phases II and III of the study, an d intermediate visual acuity will also be tested at 
60 cm in Phases II and III.   
 
Number of S ubjects Planned:  Approximately  five hundred and one (501) subject s 
(approximately 1,002 eyes) will be treated  in this study. Approximately 334 subjects will be 
implanted bilaterally  with the enVista  MX60EF trifocal MIOL, and approximately 167 control 
subjects will be implanted bilaterally with the enVista MX60 E monofocal IOL .

Statistical Methods:   
 
The statistical analyses described in ISO 11979 -7 1, ISO 11979-9 2, and ANSI Z80.12 3 will be 
performed unless otherwise specified in the statistical  analysis plan. 
 Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. Summaries for discrete (categorical) variables will include the tabulation 
of frequencies and percentages.  
 
After IOL implantation for  Phase I/Pilot subjects, enrollment will pause until the Phase I /Pilot 
subjects have completed Visit 3B (30 to 60 days after second eye IOL  implantation ) and their data 
have been reviewed . Data listings  and/or summaries of test lens DCNVA and DCIVA data will be 
prepared by an unmasked statistician and presented for review  by an unmasked clinic al review er 
not associated with the study, and t he best distances for near and intermediate VA testing will be 
determined . Safety data will also be prepared by an unmasked statistician and presented for review 
by the unmasked clinical reviewer not associated with the study. Phase I safety and VA data will be submitted to the  FDA for review and acceptance to initiate Phase II .  Statistical comparisons 
between Group 1 and Group 2 will not be made or evaluated. The decision to proceed or not to 
proceed to Phase II will not be based on formal statistical stopping rules. 
 
When a minimum of 50 Phase I and  Phase II  Group 1  subjects have been enrolled and  followed 
through Visit 4, s ummaries and/or listings of all available safety data through Visit 4  will be 
prepared by an unmasked statistical team. Aggregated safety data for the minimum first 50 Phase 
I and Phase II Group 1 subjects who complete Visit 4 for these subjects will be presented  to the 
FDA to request expansion to Phase III .  Safety data for approximately a corresponding minimum 
first 25 Phase I and Phase II Group 2 subjects who complete Visit 4 als o will be submitted 
concurrently to the FDA.   While safety data submission and FDA review for these subjects is 
occurring, additional subjects may be enrolled up to a maximum of approximately 72 Phase II 
subjects (including those whose data were submitted  to FDA) .  Statistical comparisons between 
Group 1 and Group 2 will not be made or evaluated. The decision to proceed or not to proceed to 
Phase III will not be based on formal statistical stopping rules.  Phase III enrollment will be initiated 
only after a cceptance to proceed is received from FDA . 
 
Primary Safety Analyses 
 
The proportion of first modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) eyes  with at least one serious adverse event 
will be summarized using categorical summary statistics by treatment received. Each eye will be counted only once in the calculation of the rate.  
 
Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be summarized categorically by treatment received for first mITT Set eyes. Non -
inferiority of the test lens 
compared to the control lens will be evaluated.  
 
Adverse events in first mITT Set eyes will be compared to the ISO Safety and Performance Rates 
(SPE) as described in ISO 11979-7.

The incidence of all other types of AEs will be summarized by treatment for primary eyes, fellow eyes, and “all” eyes for the mITT Set.  
 Additional supportive safety analyses  are described in Section 13.5.5 and/or  the study St atistical 
Analysis P lan (SAP). 
  
Primary Effectiveness Analyses 
 
The statistical success of the trial will depend on the statistical success of all three primary 
effectiveness endpoints.  
 
Photopic monocular logMAR  BCDVA in first implanted eyes at Post -Operative Visit 4 will be 
summarized using continuous summary statistics by treatment group for the mITT Set. Imputation 
of missing data is not conservative in non- inferiority testing. Therefore, missing data will not  be 
imputed for a BCDVA non -inferiority test. The treatment effect ( mean Test group IOL VA minus 
mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be estimated  in addition to a two- sided 90 % 
confidence interval. If the upper confidence limit (equivalent to a  one- sided upper 95% confidence 
limit for the treatment effect) is less than 0.1, then the Test lens will be statistically non -inferior to 
the Control lens.4 
  The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set.  
Howev er, non- inferiority will not be evaluated with the PP Set , and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis.   
BCDVA at Visit 4 for the Test group will be summarized categorically (20/20 or better, 20/25 or 
better, 20/32 or bette r, 20/40 or better, and worse than 20/40)  for the mITT  and Best Case Sets .  
Two-sided exact binomial 90% confidence interval s around the proportion s of eyes 20/40 or better 
will be presented.  
 
For the analyses of the mITT  and Best Case Sets, one- sided exac t binomial tests comparing the 
proportion of m ultifocal IOL eyes with BCDVA 20/40 or better to the relevant control rate (92.5% 
for all eyes and 96.7% for best case eyes) will be performed and p- values will be presented. If the 
p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then the null hypothesis will be rejected. If the  null hypothesis 
is not rejected for the mITT  and Best Case Sets in the primary analyses, then it will be concluded 
that the m ultifocal IOL is statistically successful in this outcome.  
 
Photopic monocula r distance- corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm, and distance -
corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 66 cm , in first eyes at Post -Operative Visit 4 will 
be summarized using continuous summary statistics in logMAR units by treatment assignment for 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 111 
 the mITT  Set Phase II and III subjects  (comb ined) . The DCNVA and DCIVA data from the Phase 
I/Pilot subjects will be excluded from hypothesis testing and will be summarized separately from 
the data of the other subjects.  
 
If there are missing mITT  analysis set  monocular DCNVA or DCIVA data at Visit 4 , then missing 
data will be imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation method. After 
imputation of missing data, the statistical hypothes es will be tested using two -sided two -sample t -
tests by imputation.  
 
For each endpoint, an overall p -value resulting from the multiple imputation method will be 
estimated. The treatment effect ( mean Test group IOL  VA minus mean Control group IOL  VA) in 
logMAR units will be summarized using continuous summary statistics and a two -sided 95% 
confidence interval. If the p-value from the multiple imputation analysis of treatment effect is less 
than or equal to 0.05 and the treatment effect is less than or equal to -0.10 logMAR units for DCIVA 
(i.e., the Test lens mean logMAR VA is at least 0.10 less than the mean for the control)  or less than 
or equal to - 0.20 logMAR units for DCNVA, then it will be concluded that the T est IOL is 
statistically and clinically successful in th e corresponding  outcome. 
 The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set.  
However, superiority  will not be evaluated with the PP Set, and statistical success will not depend 
upon the results of the PP analysis.  
Secondary Effectiveness Analyses  
 
Photop ic binocular DCNVA, UCNVA, DCIVA, and UCIVA at 40 cm and 66 cm for near and 
intermediate VA, respectively,  at Post -Operative Visit 4 will be compared between treatments 
using the methods described above for monocular DCNVA and DCIVA. The endpoints will be 
evaluated hierarchically in the following order: DCNVA,  UCNVA, DCIVA, and  UCIVA.  
 First eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA (all in logMAR units) at Visit 5 will be summarized using 
descriptive  statistics  (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the ITT Set by 
treatment group  (MX60EF Trifocal MIOL, MX60E Monofocal IOL) . The means at Visit 5 for each 
of these outcomes will be compared between the treatment groups qualitatively.  
 Any additional supportive effectiveness analyses  will be  described  in Section 13.5.5 and/or the 
SAP. 
 
Sample size calculations:  
 
General Justification  
 The sample size of 300 T est lens group subjects and 150 C ontrol group subjects is specified in 
ANSI Z80.12- 2007 (R2012)  and ISO 11979- 9:2006. Moreover, ISO 11979- 7 specifies that a 
minimum of 300 subjects should complete a clinical evaluation of an IOL.   
To allow for losses of up to 10%, approximatel y ⌈300 /(1−0.1)⌉ = 334 Test group subjects and 
approximately  ⌈150 /(1−0.1)⌉ = 167 Control group subjects will be enrolled.  
 
Phase I/ Pilot Phase to Select Distance s for Near and Intermediate VA Testing  
 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 111 
 A sample size of 24 DCNVA measurements at each of three distances will yield a probability of at 
least 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between the best 
distance and the second best distance is at least 0.1 and the data are normally dis tributed with a 
standard deviation of 0.15. The first 27 Test group subjects will be enrolled in Phase I/Pilot to allow 
for at least 24 Test group subjects  at Visit 3 A. 
 
A sample size of 24  DCIVA measurements at each of three distances will yield a probability of at 
least 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between the best 
distance and the second best distance is at least 0.1 and the data are normally distributed with a standard deviation of 0.15. The first 27 Test group subjects will be enrolled in Phase I/Pilot  to allow 
for at least 24 Test group subjects  at Visit 3 A. 
 
Primary Safety Endpoints 
 Regarding the rate of all serious adverse events in first eyes, for a sample size of 300  subjects, the 
probability of observing at least one event will be at least 95% when the probability of an event is 1% or greater .  
 
Regarding the rate of secondary surgical interventions due to the optical properties of the lens, the 
expected Control group rate is  0.1% and the expected Test group rate is 0.5%. With 150 eyes in the 
Control group and 300 eyes in the Test group, the upper limit of the observed one -sided 95% 
confidence interval will be expected to be less than 0.034 with 99% power when the Control 
proportion, 𝝅𝝅𝑪𝑪, is 0.001 and the Test expected proportion, 𝝅𝝅𝑻𝑻, is 0.005; results are based on 10000 
simulations using the Newcombe- Wilson score method to construct the confidence interval.  
 ISO 11979-7 Annex B shows the relevant sample size calculations and assumptions for th e ISO 
grid safety endpoints. 
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints 
 
Regarding the rates of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by subjects, as well as the rates 
of visual disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by subjects, using the QoV questionnaire 
measure through Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation) , no 
statistical hypotheses  will be tested. Therefore, no sample size calculation  is required . 
 
Regarding mean c ontrast sensitivity  at Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye 
IOL implantation) and Post -Operative Visit 5 (Day 330 to 420 after second eye IOL implantation), 
no statistical hypotheses will be tested. Therefore, no sample size calculation is required.   
 
Primary Effectiveness Endpoints 
 
The primary effectiveness objective s are  to demonstrate non- inferiority  of the T est lens when 
compared to  the Control lens  and satisfactory performance of the Test lens when compared to  the 
ISO grids (ISO 11979- 7 Safety and Performance Endpoints)  in photopic monocular best -corrected 
distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and to demonstrate superiority of the Test lens over the Control 
lens in distance- corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm , and distance -corrected 
intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 66 cm , in first eyes  at Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 
180 after second eye IOL implantation) . Approximately the first 24 evaluable Test group subjects 
and first 12 evaluable  Control group subjects will be excluded from the near and intermediate visual 
acuity hypothesis tests, leaving an expected  evaluable  sample size of approximately 276 Test group 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 111 
 subjects implanted with the Test IOL and 138 Control group subjects to be included in the near and 
intermediate visual acuity effectiveness hypothesis test s. 
 
Regarding the non -inferiority test of BCDVA, when the sample sizes in the groups are 300 (Group 
1) and 150 (Group 2), a two group 0.050 one -sided t -test will have 99% power to reject the null 
hypothesis that the Test and Control IOLs are not equivalent (the difference in means, µT - µS, is 
0.10 or farther from zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the means 
of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0.000 and the 
common standard deviation is 0.150.  
 
Regarding the comparisons of BCDVA to the ISO grid, ISO 11979- 7 specifies a sample size of 
approximately 300 completed subje cts for this type of investigation.  
 Regarding statistical superiority tests of DCNVA and DCIVA, a two -group t- test with a 0.05 two-
sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in means of -0.10, assuming 
that the common standard deviation is 0.15, when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 
138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414  subjects).  
 
Regarding the assessment of clinical superiority in DCNVA and DCIVA, the probability that the 
Test group’s mean logMAR VA will be at least 0.1 units less than the C ontrol group’s mean 
logMAR VA will be 89 % if the true difference is -0.12 units , 97% if the true difference is -0.13 
units , and 99% if the true difference is -0.14 units , assuming that the common standard deviation 
is 0.15 when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total 
sample size of 414 subjects).  
 
Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints 
 Secondary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses will be tested hierarchically in the order : DCNVA, 
UCNVA, DCIVA,  and UCIVA.  
 All Phase I  evaluable Test group subjects evaluable Control group subjects will be excluded from 
the near and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests, leaving an expected evaluable sample size 
of approximately 276 Test group subjects and 138 Control group subjects to be included in the near 
and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests.  Regarding photopic binocular distance- corrected near visual acuity (D CNVA) at 40 cm  at Post -
Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two-group t -test with a 
0.050 tw o-sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in means of -0.10 
logMAR units , assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.20 units , when the sample  sizes 
in the two groups are 276  and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414  subjects).  
 
Regarding photopic binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) at 40 cm  at Post -Operative 
Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two-group t -test with a 0.050 two-
sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in means of -0.10 logMAR 
units , assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.20 units , when the sample sizes in the two 
groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414 subjects).  
 
Regarding photopic binocular distance- corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 66 cm  at 
Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation),  a two group t -test with 
a 0.050 two -sided significance level will have 99% power to de tect a difference in means of -0.10 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 111 
 logMAR units , assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.15  units , when the sample sizes 
in the two groups are 276  and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414  subjects ). 
 
Regarding photopic binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA) at 66 cm  at Post -
Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second  eye IOL implantation),  a two group t -test with a 
0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a d ifference in means of - 0.10 
logMAR  units , assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.20 units , when the sample sizes 
in the two groups are 276  and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414  subjects ).

 5 Introduction  
Cataracts are a common condition in adults over 40 years of age , and surgical replacement of 
the cataractous lens with an intraocular lens (IOL) remains an effective way to restore vision 
to cataract patients .4  Monofocal IOLs provide adequate distance vision but require spectacle 
use for near or intermediate distance vision activities.  Subsequent to monofocal IOL 
development and commercialization, m ultifocal intraocular lenses ( MIOLs) , including bifocal 
and trifocal IOLs, have been successfully developed to improve near and intermediate distance 
vision and increase spectacle independence following cataract surgery.  5-9   
There are currently no approved trifocal IOLs available in the United States, despite a desire 
by cataract surgery patients for a product that provide s improved near and intermediate vision 
in comparison to a conventional monofocal IOL without compromising distance vision. 
Clinical studies have  show n that intermediate add power tri focal diffractive IOLs have 
substantially improved intermediate vision compared to bifocal IOLs, resulting in better visual 
quality and excellent spectacle independence for individuals with active lifestyles.  10-14 
Observational  clinical studies and clinical studie s comparing trifocal to bifocal IOLs  also have 
show n high patient satisfaction in patients with trifocal MIOLs.  11, 15, 16  These s tudies and 
others indicate contras t sensitivity and levels of photic phenomena in patients with trifocal 
MIOL implants are similar to that of  patients with bifocal M IOLs under both photopic and 
mesopic conditions, and spectacle independence in up to 100% of the patients has been reported . 
12-19    
The enVista® MX60EF trifocal MIOL is a 1 -piece hydrophobic acrylic ultraviolet- absorbing 
lens with  aspheric biconvex optic s, designed to have - 0.15 µm of spherical aberration, with 
apodized diffractive structures on the anterior surface, a square edge on the posterior surface and modified C -loop haptics. The design and material of the lens allow  it to be folded and 
inserted into the capsular bag through a small incision to minimize the possibility of surgically 
induced astigmatism.   The MX60EF lens is a modification to the Bausch + Lomb enVist a® 1 -
piece hydrophobic acrylic monofocal IOL, model MX60 E, approved under PMA Suppleme nt 
P920056/S024 by the FDA on 05/23/2017 as an update to PMA P910056/S010, approved on 
05/30/2012 for the parent enVista MX60 monofocal IOL .  PMA P910056/ S010 approved a 
material change and design modifications to the previously approved Bausch +  Lomb mode l 
C31UB IOL, including a design change from 3- piece to 1 -piece design and the addition of 
aspheric optics with zero spherical aberration.  
The enVista® Trifocal Model MX60EF will be manufactured, packaged and sterilized with the same materials and processes  used for the enhanced enVista® IOL Model MX60E.  The 
enVista Model MX60E lens material is a  modification to the enVista Model MX60 material, 
designed to enhance the unfolding rate of the lens at the lower eye temperature encountered 
during surgical procedures. 
The induced -0.15 µm negative spherical aberration MX60EF trifocal M IOL lens design 
(incorporated on the enVista EF base refractive design to give a residual spherical aberration  
of ~0.10µm ) is expected to produce comparable decentrati on performance t o a spherical 
aberration -free lens design and best contrast -related performance in the presence of other 
higher order aberrations.  Mathematical m odeling and optical bench experiments have shown 
that increased d epth of focus due to residual  spherical aberration  comes at the cost of lower 
modulation transfer function ( MTF ). 
20-22 Since  the enVista ® MX60 EF lens is distance 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 111 
 dominant under  mesopic (low light ) condit ions, any level of corneal spherical aberration  
compensation using the MX60EF trifocal MIOL should result in improving the MTF.  
 
Thus, the rationale for the investigation described in this document  is to collect and analyze 
data suggesting potential clinical benefit that clearly outweighs any potential risks associated with use of the MX60EF product.  
6 Study Objectives and Purpose

7 Investigational plan  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description  
This will be a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active- controlled binocular study of the 
enVista  one-piece hydrophobic acrylic trifocal M IOL (model MX60EF) in subjects 
undergoing cataract ext raction compared to the enVista one-piece hydrophobic acrylic 
monofocal intraocular lens (model MX60E ).  
Subjects sched uled to undergo cataract surgery by phacoemuls ification and implantation of 
bilateral intraocular lens es (IOL s) will be screened for eligibility. Subjects will be examined 
preoperatively to obtain a medical history, establish a baseline for ocular conditio n, and 
determine eligibility. Both e yes of each  subject will be included in the study and must meet 
eligibility criteria at the Pre -Operative Visit. At the time of the first surgery, subjects will be 
enrolled and randomly assigned by an interactive response technology ( IRT) system in a 2:1 
ratio to either the enVista trifocal M IOL or the enVista monofocal IOL, respectively .  
Postoperatively, subjects will undergo ophthalmic examinations at regular intervals per the 
study visit schedule. The Investiga tor will provide standardized pre -, peri -, and postoperative 
care for all study subjects at hi s/her  clinical  site (refer to Section 11  for additional information). 
A delegated examiner (s) at each site who is masked to the randomized assignment of each 
subject will perform  postoperative measurements.   Every effort will be made to e nsure that 
postoperative assessments for a subject are completed by the same examiner.   
7.2 Investigators  
The clinical investigation will be  conducted at approximately twenty  (20) investigative sites  in 
North America .  
The clinical investigation will be conducted by Investigators who are determined by the 
Sponsor  to be suitably qualified by training and experience to conduct this study in compliance 
with all applicable GCPs and FDA Federal Regulations or l ocal regulations  and who are 
willing to demonstrate use of the MX60E product, if they have not already done so.  Additionally, the Device Investigator Agreement (on file for each site) also verifies Investigator obligations.   
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 111 
 Each Investigator site will attempt to enroll approximately twenty- five (25) subjects . In the 
event that selected sites do not meet expected enrollment, the Sponsor may decide to increase 
enrollment as needed at other currently active sites , replace non- enrolling s ites and/or add 
additional site(s) for a total of up to 25 actively enrolling  sites, to satisfy study enrollment 
requirements . No Investigator shall  contribute more than 10% of the total number of treated 
subjects  in the study.  
7.3 Study Duration  
Eligible subjects who are enrolled in this study will be followed for approximately one year 
following the  second eye surger y. 
8 Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects  
Approximately five hundred and one (501)  subjects ( approximately 1,002 eyes) at 
approximatel y twenty (20) clinical sites in North America scheduled to undergo bilateral 
phacoemulsification cataract surgery and IOL implantation will be enrolled in this clinical 
study.  
The study purpose, procedures, and subject responsibilities will be explained t o the potential 
participant. The subject's willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements will be 
determined. When it has been established that the subject is willing to participate, written 
informed consent will be obtained (Section 15.3) . In order to determine  eligibility, w ritten 
informed consent must be obtained from each study subject  prior to performing any study 
specific procedures that  are not part of the Investigator’s routine standard of care. Enrollment 
will be consecutive enrollment of all eligible subjects. A complete ophthalmic examination will be done at the Preoperative Visit scheduled within 30 days before  the first eye surgery.  
Application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the following sections will result in the selection of an investigational population which is representative of the intended target population.

8.3 Subject  Disposition Criteria  
8.3.1 Subj ect Enrollment  
The subject is considered enrolled in the study at the time of randomization at the first 
Operative Visit ( Visit 00A) .  Randomization should follow the completion of uncomplicated 
cataract extraction in the first eye.  
8.3.2 Subject Screen Failures  
A subject who fai ls to meet eligibility criteria and/or discontinues from the study before 
randomization will be  considered a screen failure.   
8.3.3 Subject Completion  
For those who are eligible and have consented to participate in the sub- study, a Visi t 6 (Day 
2- 30 post Visit 5) will be conducted as the final visit to complete the study.  For those subjects 
who have not consented to the sub -study, Visit 5 will be the final visit to complete their 
participation.  If the subject consented to Visit 6 but did not complete the final Visit 6, Visit 5 will be considered as the final visit for that subject, ending their participation in the study. 
A subject who has missed visits or is missing study measurements will remain  in the study. 
Subjects who require fur ther follow -up for an AE will be followed according to Section 12.4.    
8.3.4 Subject Discontinuation 
A subject may  be discontinued prior  to the final study visit for any of the following reasons , 
including but not limited to:  
• Investigator’s request (e.g., subje ct non- compliance or medical decision ) 
• voluntary withdrawal (subject’s request)   
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 111 
 • death  
• lost to follow -up 
• study terminated by Sponsor  
Prior to discontinuing a subject, every effort should be made to contact the subject, schedule a 
final study visit, and obtain as much follow -up data as possible. Adverse events will be 
followed as described in Section 12.4. Subject withdrawals will be documented clearly on the  
source document and applicable C ase Report Form (CRF).  Subjects who discontinue from the 
study should be seen for routinely scheduled visits according to the standard of care by the Investigator or their ophthalmologist.  
Notification of subject withdrawals will be made immediately to the Sponsor.  
Only subjects who are randomized but did not have the lens inserted into the eye  may be 
replaced. Subjects for whom the lens was inserted but not implanted will not be replaced.  A 
new subject number will be assigned,  as long as the total number of tr eated subjects at the site 
does not exceed 10% of t he total treated eyes in the study. Subjects who are discontinued from 
the study following treatment will not be replaced.  Discontinued subjects should be followed outside of the study protocol according to the  
Investigator’s normal standard of care.  
8.3.5 Lost  to Follow -Up 
Subjects who do not return for scheduled Postoperative Visit (s), as defined by the visit 
window , and cannot be contacted, may be considered lost to follow -up.  The inves tigator  will 
try at least twice to reach the subject by telephone and/or electronic mail and will send a follow -
up letter by certif ied mail before considering the s ubject lost to follow -up. These actions will 
be recorded in the source documents  and a copy of the follow -up letter ma intained in the 
investigator’s file.  The date of discontinuation for subjects lost to follow -up will be seven days  
after the date that the unanswered certified letter was sent.    
Efforts shall be made to keep the number of subjects lost to follow -up to a minimum, below  
10% of the number of subjects treated.   
9 Treatment Plan  
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 501 subjects (1,002 eyes) will be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio to receive the 
enVista  trifocal (T est) IOL or enVista monofocal (C ontrol) IOL in both eyes . 
9.1.1 Treatment Allocation  
At the time of the first surgery  following uncomplicated cataract extraction , subjects will be 
randomly assigned to either the enVista trifocal M IOL or enVista monofocal IOL in a 2:1 ratio 
based upon a predetermined randomization scheme.  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 111 
 9.1.2 Randomization Rationale & Method 
Randomization of subjects is performed to reduce potential bias.  Subjects  will be randomly 
assigned t o receive either the trifocal (T est) IOL bilaterally or the monofocal (C ontrol) IOL 
bilaterally  according to the randomization scheme to be provided.  
IRT will be utilized for randomization in this study. The randomization codes will be stratified 
by site  such that the ratio of subjects assigned to the Test MX60EF trifocal M IOL or C ontrol 
MX60 E IOL at each site will be approximately 2:1.  
Randomization will occur following uncomplicated cataract extraction  on the date of  first 
surgery. 
9.1.3 Treatment or Subject Replacement  
There is no treatment  or subject  replacement planned for this study. 
9.2 Masking  and Postoperative Masked Examiner(s) 
The Investigator implanting the IOL and designated site personnel will be unmasked to the 
assignment of IOLs.  Subjects and designated postoperative evaluator(s) will be masked to the 
IOLs assigned.    
A qualified masked examiner at each site, who is unaware of which IOL has been implanted 
for each subject , shall perform  post- operative measurements  including manife st refraction,  
visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and defocus curves . Every attempt should be made to have 
the same masked examiner perform  the same post- operativ e measurements for an individual  
subject  throughout the subject’s study participation. 
  Pupil size measurements should be taken by an unmasked staff member. 
9.3 Concomitant Medications 
Documentation of all medications  used by the subject within 30 days of informed consent and 
during the study will be made in study source documents.  
Pre-, intra -, and postoperative  medications may be administered per the Investigator’s standard 
of care.  A complete list of the Investigator’s standard regimen of these medications will be 
provided to the Sponsor or its  designee and approved by the Medical Monitor prior to initiation 
of the study.  All Investigators will be required to use Amvisc
® Plus viscoelastic ( see Appendix 
C). 
Medications known to interfere with visual performance , pupil dilation, or iris structure  are 
prohibited within 30 days of enrollment and for the duration of the study.  A list of prohibited 
medications (including alpha-1- selective adrenoceptor blocking agent or an antagonist of alpha 
1A adrenoceptor (e.g., Flomax® (tamsulosin HCl), Terazosin, or Cardura) will be included as part of the Study Reference Manual provided to the site. 
9.4 Protocol Deviations  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by the S ponsor and the IRB/IEC and agreed to by the 
Investigator.  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 111 
 The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subjects’ source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. Protocol waivers will not be allowed under any circumstances.  The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented  deviation or change, the reasons for it, 
and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.  
Documentation of the deviation proces s and follow up (as applicable) can be found in the Study 
Refence Manual.  Deviation impact on data analysis is described in Section 13.5.8.   The date of, and reason for , deviations in all cases will be documented.  Protocol deviations affecting  the 
safety  of the subject or the integrity of the study must be reported by the Investigator to the 
IRB/IEC promptly. Reporting of all other protocol deviations must adhere to the requirements 
of the governing IRB/IEC.   
Protocol assessments will continue for a subj ect until the end of the study, unless the protocol 
deviation puts the subject at risk or the subject’s condition requires that he/she be discontinued 
from the study.   Scheduled assessments missed or conducted out of window due to COVID -19 disruption will 
be recorded as protocol deviations.

(subjects that consent at 
participating sites)  Both Eyes Day 2 - 30 post Visit 5 
  
Refer to Appendix B  for the schedule of visits and procedures and Appendix B  for methods 
of clinical evaluation.  
 Following identification of a potential subject, the Investigator (or designee) will explain the purpose of the study, procedures, risks/benefits .  and subject responsibilities to the potential 
subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow -up requirements of the study 
will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the  investigation, written informed 
consent will be obtained. The subject or his/her legal representative and the person obtaining 
written consent will sign and date the IRB/I EC approved ICF , at which point the subject is 
considered part of the study population. The original signed document will be retained in the subject records, and a copy will be provided to the subject. In addition, the applicable privacy 
regulation requirements must be met.  
 
The subject identification number will be assigned by IRT, which will consist of a 3 -digit site 
number (pre -assigned) and a 3- digit chronological order screening number, assigned by IR T 
and starting with 001 (e.g., 101- 001, 101- 002; in t his example the site number is 1 01). That 
subject number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study. It will not be necessary for the surgical procedures to occur in subject number order.   
11.1.1 Mitigation of COVID- 19 Related Disruption to Study Visits  
Study procedures performed during the COVID -19 pandemic will be conducted in accordance 
with medical guidance to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission between study staff and 
subjects (available at www.aao.org/covid-19).  It is recommended Investigators periodically 
revisit the aao.org/covid-19 website to identify and implement any updated recommendations 
made by AAO.  Local, state, and federal public health guidance also will be followed, and it is 
recommended these guidances also be visited once a month to see if they have changed . 
 Where in -person study visits are not possible  due to the pandemic , remote  contact with subject s 
may be instituted by the investigational site, as feasible, to collect any relevant safety data on 
health and medication changes.   The decision to conduct a remote contact in lieu of an in-person visit will b e made using the professional judgment of the PI - prioritizing safety , as well 
as adherence to local, state, and federal guidelines related to COVID -19, and in consideration 
of relevant guidance from national, professional ophthalmic organizations , including the 
American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons.   Remote contact s will limit data collection to safety oversight and medication changes . 
Scheduled assessments missed or conducted out of window due to COVID -19 disruption will 
be recorded as protocol deviations. 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 111 
 11.1.2 Preoperative Visit  0: Day -30 to -5 
Informed consent must be obtained prior to the Investigator performing study specific 
procedures that are not part of his/her routine standard of care. After obtaining written informed 
consent, prospective subjects will be screened to determine whether they meet the entry criteria for the study. Demographic information, medical history, and current medication use will be collected. The preoperative clinical evaluation will be conducted no more than 30 days prior 
to the first surgery and will consist of a complete ophthalmic examination .   
Note: Potential subjects may be identified for screening in conjunction with routine clinic 
cataract evaluations involving standard of care testing.  To avoid having to repeat t his testing 
within a short time period to qualify for the study, standard of care measurements , including 
corneal topography, targeted refraction / IOL power calculation / axial length determination  / 
anterior chamber depth  / chord length µ, keratometry, IOP, slit- lamp e xamination, and dilated 
fundus exam, may be used as qualifying pre -operative assessments, provided t hey meet the 
following criteria:  
• Performed by a qualified investigator who is participating in the study;  
• Performed as  specified  in the protocol to verify subject eligibility ; 
• Conducted within the pre -operative window specified in the protocol. 
11.1.3 Operative Visit 00A: Day 0 
Subjects will be assessed to reconfirm eligibility. In addition, any changes in concomitant 
medications or AEs will be recorded. If the subject is no longer eligible, he/she will be screen 
failed  from the study. If the subject is eligible, s urgery will be performed using the surgical 
procedure described in Appendix C . If the subject continues to meet eligibility criteria after 
cataract extraction , the sub ject will be rand omized . 
 The eye with the wors e best-corrected distance visual acuity ( BCDVA) or worse BCDVA with 
glare at the P reoperative Visit will be treated first (eye A) and used in the primary monocular 
evaluations. If BCDVA is the same for both eyes, the right eye will be treated first.  
11.1.4 Operative Visit 00B: Day 7 to 30 
Subjects will undergo the second eye surgery (eye B) between 7 and 30 days from the first eye 
surgery .  Postoperative Visit 2 A must be completed before Visit 00B. These visits may be 
performed the same day at the Investigator’s discretion, provided that Visit 2A is done first , 
and both visits are performed within window .  If the subject continues to meet eligibility 
criteria , surgery will be performed using the surgical procedure described in Appendix C
. 
11.1.5 Postoperative Visits (1A through 5): Day 1 to Day 420 
All treate d subjects will be seen for a minimum of eight (8) postoperative visits. Postoperative 
Visits 3A and 3B may be performed the same day at the Investigator’s discretion, provided that Visit 3A  is done first, and both visits are performed  within window.   
 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 111 
 11.1.6 Postoperative Visit 6 : Day 2- 30 post Visit 5 
This visit applies to those s ubjects who have consented to V isit 6 at investigative sites  where 
the trial frame astigmatism simulation sub-study is being performed.  The procedure for this 
visit is described in  Section 8.0 of Appendix B .  
 
11.1.7 Unscheduled Visit(s)  
Additional visits may be scheduled, as necessary, to ensure the safety and well -being of 
subjects. All additional exam ination s should be fully documented in the source documents and 
on Unscheduled Visit CRFs, as appropriate. Visits intended to fulfill scheduled visit 
requirements that fall outside the d esignated scheduled visit window will be collected and 
transcribed to the appropriate visit CRF.   If a subject is seen for multiple visits during a given visit timeframe, the data from the visit that is inte nded to meet the protocol requirements for the scheduled visit will be captured on 
the visit CRF. Where such a determination cannot be made, the first visit within the scheduled visit interval will be used for completion of the protocol required scheduled visit CRF. Data from any additional visits within a scheduled visit interval will be captured on an Unscheduled Visit CRF.  
11.1.8 Missed Visit(s)  
If a subject misses any scheduled follow -up visit and cannot be seen prior to the start of t he 
visit range for the next scheduled follow-up visit, the visit is considered missed.   
11.2 Post-Study Follow-Up 
If a subject requires further follow -up upon discontinuation or completion of the study, the 
Investigator should schedule post -study follow -up vis its, as necessary. Refer to Section 12.4.5 
for follow -up of AEs following study exit. 
 
Post- surgical follow up study visits are described in the protocol sections above. Once 
participation in the study is complete the subjects are encouraged to see their ophthalmologist for routinely scheduled standard of care visits . 
11.3 Study Completion  
The Sponsor or its representative will notify the Investigator or the IRB/ IEC, as applicable, to 
inform them when  the study is complete. 
11.3.1 Early Study Termination 
If during the study it becomes evident to the Sponsor that the study should be stopped prematurely, the study will be terminated and appropriate notification will be given to the Investigator(s), IRB/ IEC, and FDA or Local Health Authority, as applicable. The Sponsor or 
its representative will instruct the Investigators to stop enrolling and dispensing study materials/treatment and to arrange for study closeout at each site as appropriate.

 12 Primary and Secondary Safety and Effectiveness Variables  
12.1 Evaluation of Safety 
The p rimary safety endpoints will be:  
• The incidence  of all serious adverse events, including SSIs related to the optical 
propert ies of the IOL,  in first eyes through study exit  
• The rate of secondary surgical interventions due to the optical properties of the lens for 
first eyes  through study exit  
• The incidence of adverse events in first eyes compared to ISO Safety and Performance Endpoint (SPE) rates as defined in ISO 11979- 7 through study exit   
 
The secondary safety endpoint s will be : 
• The rates  of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by subjects, as well as the rates of 
visual disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by subjects, using the QoV questionnaire  measure through Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye

• Photopic monocular best -corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) in first eyes at 
Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic monocular distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) in first eyes at 40 
cm at Post -Oper ative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation)  
• Photopic monocular distance -corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) in first

• First eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA evaluated at Visit 5  
12.3 Risk Assessment, Risk Mitigation, and Anticipated Benefit  
The model MX60EF IOL has similar properties to the FDA approved model MX60 IOL that 
has been shown to be safe for implantation in humans. 29, 30   Reduced contrast sensitivity and  
increased  visual  disturbances, such as glare and halo, are known to occur more frequently with 
multifocal IOLs and will be evaluated in this study through subject questionnaires and a 
contrast sensitivity sub -study. 
The known risks of multifocal IOL implantation that exis t in addition to the risks of monofocal 
IOL surgerie s (cf. ISO standard 11979-7 Annex Table B.1) include the following: 
• Under scotopic and mesopic conditions the patient has reduced contrast sensitivity, and  
• There is an increased risk of post-operative photic effects such as halos and glare.  
Studies on other adverse perception effects following multifocal IOL implantation, such as stereo acuity disturbances and aniseikonia, have generally indicated an acceptable performance range. 
31  
Multifocal IOLs achieve correction of presbyopia by dividing incoming light into two or more 
focal points.  Patient selection and counselling are particularly important with these IOLs. 
There may be a symptomatic reduction in the quality of distance vision, particularly if other ocular pathology is present. Therefore, the candidacy of patients with amblyopia or abnormalities of the cornea, optic disc, and macula for a multifocal IOL must be carefully 
considered.  Although uncommon, explantation of multifocal IOLs may becom e necessary if 
optical side effects are intolerable.
 32  
A Cochrane systematic review concluded  that multifocal IOLs are effective at improving near 
vision relative to  monofocal IOLs , although there is uncertainty as to the size of the effect. 
Whether that  improvement outweighs the adverse effects of  multifocal IOLs, such as glare and 
haloes, will vary between people. Motivation to achieve spectacle independence is likely to be 
a deciding factor. 33  
Mitigation of the risks related to un desirable optical ph enomena of multifocal IOLs includes 
exclusion of potential subjects with ocular pathology which may limit the quality of postoperative vision such as abnormalities of the cornea, lens capsule -zonular apparatus and 
macula, as well as thorough discussion of the characteristics of dysphotopsia such as halos, glare and reduced contrast sensitivity during the informed consent process.  As noted above, 
candidacy of patients for multifocal IOL implantation depends not only on objective findings during a complete ophthalmologic examination, but also on patients’ motivation to achieve spectacle independence.   The risks and benefits must be weighed on an individual basis by the 
investigator in consultation with each potential subject.  Ensuring the subject’s thorough 
understanding of the optical side -effects of multifocal IOLs and ascertaining the subject’s 
degree of enthusiasm for spectacle independence form the basis of informed consent and risk mitigation.   
Despite concern  about risks of multifocal IOL implantation, the value of conducting a clinical 
study to support approval of a multifocal IOL is substantial in terms of assessing potential 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 111 
 continuing or new patient vision difficulties  and possible improved near vision as well as 
providing another IOL option to increase potential patient satisfaction and improved near and 
intermediate vision while maintaining good distance vision .  Prior studies of multifocal IOLs 
have shown a high degree of patient satisfaction, both in absolute terms and in comparison to monofocal IOLs, improved near vision, and a very low rate of IOL explantation due to optical side-effects .
 33-36  
These results  indicate that application of the principles of informed consent and patient 
selection to the r isk of dysphotopsia and contrast sensitivity reduction will provide greater 
benefit than risk and justify the enrollment of subjects in this study of a multifocal IOL.  
 Another anticipated benefit which a subject may experience from participation in this study is an improvement of their vision as a result of the removal of cataracts.  If the subject is randomized to receive the enVista MX60E monofocal IOL, it is expected they may have improvement in their distance vision and would then only require the use  of corrective lenses 
(such as glasses or contact lenses) for near and intermediate vision. If a subject is randomized to receive the enVista MX60EF trifocal IOL, they may have improvement in their near and intermediate vision while maintaining distance visual acuity comparable to a monofocal IOL, possibly allowing them to be able to read, use a computer, and watch television without reading glasses or bifocals.   Further discussion of potential or actual risks during cataract surgery and with the use of multifocal or monofocal enVista IOLs as well as IOL injectors to be used in this study can also 
be found in the study Investigator’s Brochure.   
 
12.3.1 Risk Assessment of COVID- 19 Specific Risks  
New and unforeseen risks have arisen during the COVID -19 pandemic , including risk of 
infection and disruptions or delays in study conduct.   
 To reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission, careful precautions for interactions between subjects and study personnel, and study personnel and Sponsor and/or CRO staff  must be taken  
when in contact , including following local, state, and national recommendations and guidance 
found at www.aao.org/covid -19.  It is recommended Investigators periodically revisit the 
aao.org/covid -19 website to identify and implement any updated recomm endations made by 
AAO.     
 New risks  to all study participants beyond those described in the preceding section include:  
 
• Possible transmission of Coronavirus infection, and possible further complications 
(including but not limited to hospitalization and/or death) , beyond the risk of adverse 
events  due to the investigational test lens and/or procedure(s).  
• Risk will be higher in an ophthalmic clinical study because of the close contact subjects  
will have with health care professionals during in -clinic  procedure s and assessments 
(since Investigators and post -surgical examiner s must make measurements close to t he 
face of subjects ), in addition to the need for multiple follow -up visits/exam ination s 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 111 
 which will expose  individuals to other study participants or patients and/or healthcare 
professionals who could be transmitting the virus even if they do not have symptoms.  
• Potential disruptions to the study due to current or future pandemic -related emergency 
restrictions, such as possible disruption of the study as a result of COVID -19 control 
measures  (e.g., quarantining of subjects or study staff) that  may lead to de lays in 
scheduled follow -up visits.  
• If a subject experiences  an adverse safety event (i.e., a safety complication) and they 
delay seeing their  doctor because of COVID -19 restrictions and/or have  concerns or 
fears about COVID -19 risk, a dangerous situation with serious permanent visual side 
effects including loss of vision could potentially occur .  Adverse outcomes typically 
require subjects  to return for additional and possibly frequent follow -up office visits 
and examinations, thus increasing COVID -19-related risks  to subjects, Investigators, 
and study staff . 
• If subjects are found to have contracted COVID -19 or feel ill with flu -like symptoms 
during participation in the study, they may not be permitted to continue routine 
scheduled study follow -up, thereby increasing the risk that diagnosis and treatment of 
potential adverse safety outcomes will be missed or delayed.  
12.4 Adverse Events  
Each subject eye treated mu st be examined for the presence/absence of adverse events at all 
visits, whether scheduled or not.  If an adverse event ( AE) occurs, the first concern will be the 
safety and welfare of the subject; treatment should be provided as appropriate for the event.  
12.4.1  Adverse Events Definitions  
For the purposes of this study, adverse events include: all ocular AEs; all ocular and non -ocular 
serious adverse events (SAEs); adverse device effects (ADEs); and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs).  AEs, SAEs, ADEs and UADEs are defined as follows.  
 An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease or injury, or 
untowa rd clinical sign  (including abnormal laboratory finding)  in a subject , user  or other 
persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device .  This definition includes 
events related to the medical device or procedures involved.  For  users or other persons, this 
definition is restricted to events related to  the study device . 
 A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an 
AE that leads to:  
• death  
• a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that  either results in :  
o a life -threatening illness or injury, or  
o a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function (e.g., blindness), or 
o in-patien t or prolonged hospitalization, or  
o a potentially vision- threatening condition, or  
o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life- or vision-threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 111 
 An Adverse Device Effects ( ADE) is any adverse event related to the use of an investigational 
medical device.  This definition includes any events resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use , deployment, implantation, installation or operation, or any malfunction of 
the investigational medical device.  This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
 An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on healt h or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death is not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a s upplementary plan or application), or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

adverse event  must be reported only if there is a worsening)  
Note: Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is NOT to be reported as an AE, per ISO 11979-7.   
Severe or Very Bothersome Visual Disturbances on the Quality of Vision questionnaire 
Visual  disturbances reported will be evaluated by the PI through furt her clinical investigation 
to determine if the reported symptoms are related to the optical properties of the IOL (Section 13.5.1.2).  Any visual disturbance that leads to secondary surgical intervention should be considered a serious adverse event; however, the following conditions may lead to visual disturbance and secondary surgical intervention but may or may not be  considered related to 
the optical properties of the IOL . Detailed case narratives will be created for each of these 
subjects for future ana lyses and final determination as to whether the AE is related to the optical

24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 111 
 6) Surgical complications noted at the operative visit that may reasonably be expected to 
affect postoperative outcomes. 
The investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine if an SSI is warranted.  
If there is any uncertainty as to whether the SSI is related to the optical properties of the IOL or to some other unrelated factor, the Investigator should cons ult with the Medical Monitor.   
12.4.2 Identification and Collection  
Identification and collection of an AE begins after informed consent has been obtained and documented. Standard sources of  identifying AEs include:  
• direct observation by the Investigator  
• askin g the study participant a non- specific question (e .g., “Have you had any 
problems since the last visit?”)  
• unsolicited volunteering of information by the study participant (e .g., “Doctor, I have 
had blurred vision since I started using this lens.”)  
• laboratory or test results that meet protocol requirements for classific ation as an AE   
 
Specific to this protocol, ocular  AEs in the study eye(s)  and all SAE s (ocular and non -ocular) 
observed or elicited by the Investi gator, reported by the subject, or resulting from a test result, 
etc., occurring during the clinical investigation must be reported in the CRF . During the study, 
the Investigator should treat the study subject as appropriate to ensure his/her safety and welfare. Refer to Section 12.4.5 for additional information pertaining to ongoing AEs at subject 
exit.   
Pre-existing conditions  will not be considered AE s but will be collected at the Preoperative 
Visit as medical history . A worsening of a pre -existing condition during the study should be 
documented as an AE and evaluated accordingly.  
Hospitalizations for admission without a medical AE should be captured as a serious AE until the 
cause of hospitalization can be identified. However, the following reports of hospitalization 
without a medical AE should not be considered either serious or an AE : 
• Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition not associated with the 
development of a new AE or with worsening of the pre -existing condition (e .g., for 
work -up of  persistent pretreatment lab abnormality)  
• Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep)  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam)  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipitating medical AE (e.g., for elective 
cosmetic sur gery)  
12.4.3 Evaluations  
When evaluating AEs, the Investigator must determine if the event is serious (refer to Section 
12.4.1 for criteria), assess the severity of symptoms , and determine  the relationship of the event 
to the device, using the following guidelines:  
a. Severity  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 111 
 - Mild : Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, requires no 
treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities  
- Moderate: S ubject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low level of 
concern to the subject and may inter fere with daily activities, but can be relieved by 
simple therapeutic care  
- Severe: A  sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and requires 
systemic therapy or other treatment 
 
b.  Relationship to Study Device or Surgical Procedure 
- Related : There is at least a reasonable possibility the AE is related to the study device  
or surgical procedure.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest either 
a causal relationship or association between the study device  or surgical procedure and 
the AE.  
- Unrelated : There is little or no reasonable possibility the AE is related to the study 
device or surgical procedure .  No reasonable possibility means there is no evidence to 
suggest either a causal relationship or association between the study device or surgical procedure and the AE.

12.4.4.2 Off-Site UADE Reporting  
When participating in multicenter clinical investigations, Princ ipal Investigators may receive 
off-site UADE reports. These are Sponsor reports of UADEs which occurred at other clinical 
sites for the same trial, or in different trials using the same test article, that met the criteria for 
reporting to a regulatory agency. These should be reported to the reviewing IRB/ IEC within 
10 working days or per their established reporting procedures, whichever is shorter. 
12.4.4.3 Reporting Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is defined as an ina dequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling.  
 Investigators must evaluate, record, and report via applicable forms any 
complaints /deficiencies  or malfunctions experienced with a Test or Control lens during this 
trial to the Sponsor and its representative  promptly.   The Sponsor shall review all device 
deficiencies,  and, upon the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional 
information related to the safety reporting of a particular event. 
The contact for reporting device deficiencies is:  
12.4.5 Adverse Events at Subject  Exit 
Ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, no further change in the condition is expected 
(i.e., event stabilized) , or as dictated by standard of care. Documentation in the CRF of this 
follow-up is not required although subject care should continue as appropriate.  
Ongoing UADEs will be followed by the Sponsor and its representative(s) and the Investigator 
until the outc ome is determined or until no further change in the condition is expected.  
12.4.6 Pregnancy  
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late 
menstrual period).  Female s ubjects who become pregnant during the study will be followed 
until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant or fetus (in cases of miscarriage or the rapeutic abortion)  at term .  Pregnancy 
itself is not considered an AE.  All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor and CRO contact within 48 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed 
pregnancie s must be reported via confirmed facsimile or email transmission and must be

13.3 Sample Size Determination  
13.3.1 Phase I / Pilot  
A sample size of 24 DCNVA measurements at each of three distances will yield a probability 
of at least 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between 
the best distance and the second -best distance is at least 0.1 and the data are normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of 0.15. The first 27 Test group subjects will be enrolled 
in Phase I/Pilot to allow for at least 24 Test group subjects at Visit 3 A. 
 A sample size of 24 DCIVA measurements at each of three distances will yield a probability 
of at least 98% of selecting the best distance when the difference (in logMAR units) between 
the best distance and the second -best distance is at least 0.1  and the data are normally 
distributed with a standard deviation of 0.15. The first 27 Test group subjects will be enrolled 
in Phase I/Pilot to allow for at least 24 Test group subjects at Visit 3 A. 
13.3.2 Primary Safety Endpoints  
 Regarding the rate of all serious adverse events,  for a sample size of 300 subjects, the 
probability of observing at least one event will be at least 95% when the probability of an event is 1% or greater.  
Regarding the rate of secondary surgical interventions due to the optical properties of the lens, t he expected Control group rate is 0.1% and the expected Test group rate is 0.5%. With 
150 eyes  in the Control group and 300 eyes  in the Test group, the upper limit of the observed 
one-sided 95% confidence interval will be expected to be less than 0.034 with 99% power 
when the Control proportion, 𝝅𝝅
𝑪𝑪, is 0.001 and the Test expected proportion, 𝝅𝝅 𝑻𝑻, is 0.005; 
results are based on 10000 simulations using the Newcombe -Wilson score method to 
construct the confidence interval.38 
ISO 11979- 7 Annex B shows the relevant s ample size calculations and assumptions for the 
ISO grid safety endpoints . 
13.3.3 Secondary Safety Endpoint s 
Regarding the rates  of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by subjects, as well as the rates 
of visual disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by subjects, using the QoV questionnaire  
measure through Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), 
no statistical hypotheses  will be tested . Therefore, no sample size calculation  is required .

subjects will be excluded from the near and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests, leaving 
an expected evaluable sample size of approximately 276 Test group subjects and 138 Control 
group subjects to be included in the near and intermediate vi sual acuity hypothesis tests. 
 
Regarding the non- inferiority test of BCDVA, when the sample sizes in the groups are 300 
(Group 1) and 150 (Group 2), a two group 0.050 one -sided t -test will have 99% power to reject 
the null hypothesis that the Test and Cont rol IOLs are not equivalent (the difference in means, 
µT - µS, is 0.10 or farther from zero in the same direction) in favor of the alternative hypothesis 
that the means of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the expected difference in means is 0.00 and the common standard deviation is 0.15.   Regarding the comparisons of BCDVA to the ISO grid, ISO 11979- 7 specifies a sample size 
of approximately 300 completed subjects for this type of investigation.  Regarding the superiority tests of DCNVA at 40 cm  and DCIVA  and 66 cm , a two -group t -
test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in 
means of - 0.10, assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.15, when the sample sizes 
in the two  groups are 276  and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 414 subjects).  
 Regarding the assessment of clinical superiority in DCNVA at 40 cm  and DCIVA  at 66 cm , 
the probability that the T est group’s mean logMAR VA will be at least 0.1 0 units  less than the 
Control group’s mean logMAR VA will be 89% if the true difference is - 0.12 units , 97% if the 
true difference is - 0.13 units , and 99% if the true difference is - 0.14 units , assuming that the 
common standard deviation is 0.15 when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 
subjects, respectively (a total  sample size of 414 subjects).  
13.3.5 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
Secondary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses will be tested hierarchically in the order : 
DCNVA, UCNVA, DCIVA, and UCIVA. Approximately the first 24 evaluable  Test group 
(Group 1) subjects and 12 evaluable  Control group (Group 2) subjects will be excluded from 
the near and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests, leaving an expected evaluable sample 
size of approximately 276 Test group subjects and 138 Control group subjects to be included 
in the near and intermediate visual acuity hypothesis tests.  
 Regarding photopic binocular distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm  at 
Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two-group t -test 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 111 
 with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in means 
of -0.10 logMAR units, assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.200 units , when the 
sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 
414 subjects).  
 
Regarding photopic binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) at  40 cm  at Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two-
group t -test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference 
in means of -0.10 logMAR units, assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.20 units , 
when the sample sizes in the two groups a re 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample 
size of 414 subjects).  
 Regarding photopic binocular distance -corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 66 cm  
at Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two group t -
test with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in 
means of -0.10 logMAR units, assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.15 units , 
when the sample sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample 
size of 414 subjects).  
 Regarding photopic binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UCIVA) at 66 cm  at 
Post-Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation), a  two group t- test 
with a 0.05 two- sided significance level will have 99% power to detect a difference in means 
of -0.10 logMAR units, assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.20 units , when the 
sample  sizes in the two groups are 276 and 138 subjects, respectively (a total sample size of 
414 subjects) . 
There are no hypothesis tests associated with first eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA 
evaluated at Visit 5, so no sample size calculations are necessary for these endpoints. 
13.3.6 Sub- Studies  
13.3.6.1 Defocus Curves  
At least t en (10) Best Case Group 1 subjects  and ten  (10) Best Case Group 2 subjects will be 
evaluated to obtain defocus curves as described in Appendix B
, Section 10.0, in each of the 
following pupil size groups : small (≤ 3.0 mm), medium (> 3.0 mm and ≤  4.0 mm), and large 
(> 4.0 mm), as determined under photopic lighting  conditions . If ten subjects are not available 
in any pupil size category for a treatment group, then the maximum number available will be 
used.  
13.3.6.2 Contrast Sensitivity  
At least a pproximately 122 bilaterally implanted Group 1 subject s and 61 bilaterally implanted 
Group 2 subjects will participate in the contrast sensitivity sub -study. To allow for losses of 
up to 10%, a t least approximately 136 Best Case Group 1 subjects and 68 Best Case Group 2  
subjects will be enrolled  in the sub-study.

 13.3.6.3 Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Imaging 
Approximately 20 Group 1 subjects and 10 Group 2 subjects will participate in OCT imaging 
at 2-3 clinical sites having similar or identical OCT equipment. Fundus photographs  will be 
taken if OCT images cannot be obtained.  
13.3.6.4 Trial Frame Astigmatism Simulation  
Approximately 30 Group 1 subjects and 15 Group 2 subjects will participate in the  trial frame 
astigmatism sub -study at up to 10  clinical sites .  A total of 50 subjects will be enrolled in the 
sub-study to allow for a 10% loss. Enrollment will be sequential with consecutive subjects 
enrolled onto the Trial Frame astigmatism simulation sub-study at each site in order of their 
completion of post -operative Visit 5 and based on their eligibility . The purpose of the Trial 
Frame Astigmatism Simulation sub-study is to evaluate the effect of simulated  residual 
astigmatism on distance, intermediate, and near visual acuities in eyes implanted with the enVista trifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs).  
 
13.3.7 Overall Sample Size and Adjustment for Dropouts  
The sample size of 300 study lens group subjects and 150 control group subjects is specified 
in ANSI Z80.12- 2007 (R2012) and ISO 11979- 9:2006. Moreover, ISO 11979- 7 specifies that 
a minimum of 300 subjects should complete a clinical evaluation of an IOL.  
To allow for losses of up to 10%, approximately ⌈300 /(1−0.1)⌉ = 334 Test group subjects 
and approximately  ⌈150 /(1−0.1)⌉ = 167 Control group subjects  will be enrolled . 
13.4 Analysis Populations  
13.4.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Set  
The Intent -to-Treat Set will include all randomized subjects. Summaries and analyses of the 
ITT Set will classify subjects according to the treatment to which they were randomized.  
13.4.2 Modified  Intent -to-Treat Set  
The Modified Intent -to-Treat Set w ill include all randomized subjects with at least one eye in 
which the IOL touches the eye  with a study lens . Summaries and analyses of the mITT  Set will 
classify subjects according to the treatment to which they were randomized.  
13.4.3 Modified Safety Set  
The Modified Safety Set will include all subjects with at least one eye in which the IOL touches 
the eye with a study lens. Summaries and analyses of the Modified Safety Set will classify 
subjects according to the treatment received . 
13.4.4 Per Protocol Set

deviations. Major  protocol deviations are described in Section 13.5.8. 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 111 
 13.4.5 Best Case  Set 
The purpose of the Best Case Set is to evaluate BCDVA as a part of the primary safety analysis 
as described in ISO 11979- 7. The Best Case Set will include subjects with all of the following 
characteristics:  
• No clinically significant preoperative ocular pathology in the first eye, including any 
of the following present prior to the operative visit  
− Pseudoexfoliation 
− Glaucoma  
− Uveitis  
− Retinal detachment  
− Diabetic retinopathy  
− Macular degeneration  
− Amblyopia  
− Other preoperative pathologies that are likely to affect central acuity  
• No macular degen eration detected at any time in the first eye  
• No previous surgery for the correction of refractive errors in the first eye  
13.5 Statistical Analysis  
Summaries for continuous variables will include the sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Summaries for categorical variables will include the tabulation of frequencies and percentages.  
 All effectiveness analyses will be pr esented for the ITT Set in addition to the analysis Set(s) 
mentioned below.  
13.5.1 Primary Safety Analyses  
13.5.1.1 First Eyes with at Least One Serious Adverse Event  
The proportion of first mITT  Set eyes  with at least one serious adverse event will be 
summarized using ca tegorical summary statistics by treatment received. Each eye will be 
counted only once in the calculation of the rate. 
13.5.1.2 Secondary Surgical Interventions Related to the Optical Properties of the IOL 
Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be defined as IOL explantation, replacement, or repositioning due to subject intolerance of visual symptoms not adequately improved by spectacle correction. The investigators will apply this definition to classify each secondary sur gical intervention as either related to the optical properties of the 
IOL or not related to the optical properties of the IOL .  
 Each eye will be classified as either having undergone a secondary surgical intervention related to the optical properties of t he IOL or not having undergone such an intervention. Missing data 
will not be imputed. Secondary surgical interventions related to the optical properties of the IOL will be summarized categorically (Yes, No) by actual treatment received for mITT  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 111 
 subjects  in a table. Secondary surgical interventions will be further subcategorized and 
summarized categorically as Exchange, Removal, Repositioning, or Other.  
 
A two -sided 90% confidence interval around the difference in proportions (Test minus 
Control) will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score method without continuity 
correction. If the upper confidence limit (which is equivalent to a one -sided 95% upper 
confidence limit) is less than 0.034 or if the proportion in both groups is zero, then the  null 
hypothesis will be rejected and it will be concluded that the Test IOL is statistically non -
inferior to the Control IOL in this outcome.   
13.5.1.3 ISO Grid Adverse Events  
Cumulative and persistent ISO  grid AEs will be summarized categorically for first eyes of the 
mITT Set by treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment actually received. 
The primary statistical analysis will include first eyes of the mITT Set  implanted with the Test  
IOL.  
 The numerator for each cumulative AE will be the numbe r of first Test group eyes reporting  
the AE at least once after surgery. The denominator for cumulative AEs will be the number of first Test  group eyes.  
 The numerator for each persistent AE will be the number of first Test group eyes with the event 
at Vi sit 5 in the first eye at exit. The denominator for persistent AEs will be the number of first 
Test group eyes  present at Visit 5 . 
 
For each ISO grid AE, a one -sided exact binomial test comparing the proportion of Test group  
eyes with the AE to the relevant control rate will be completed. If the resulting p- value is less 
than or equal to 0.05, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.  
 Success with respect to comparing these endpoints to the historical controls will have been achieved if none of the null hypotheses are rejected for the Test IOL treatment group.  
 
13.5.2 Secondary Safety Analyses  
13.5.2.1 Rates of  Severe or Very Bothersome Visual Disturba nces 
The rates  of visual disturbances reported as “severe” by subjects , as well as the rates of visual 
disturbances reported as “very” bothersome by subjects, using the QoV questionnaire  
measure through Post -Operative Visit 4 (Day 120 to 180 after second eye IOL implantation) 
will be summarized categorically by treatment received for Modified Safety Set subjects. 
Each subject will be counted only once in the calculation of the rate .   
 
 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 111 
 13.5.2.2 Contrast Sensitivity  
Mean  photopic (with glare)  and mesopic  (with and without glare)  contrast sensitivity  at Post -
Operative Visits 4 or 5 will be summarized  using continuous summary statistics by lighting 
condition, spatial frequency, treatment group, and visit.  Estimates of the differences between 
treatment gr oups, with two- sided 95% confidence intervals, will be provided by lighting 
condition and spatial frequency.   
13.5.2.3 Incidence of the Types of AEs S pecified in the Co- primary Safety E ndpoints  
The incidence of the type of AE specified in each co -primary safety endpoint will be 
summarized by treatment for fellow and “all” eyes. No hypothesis tests will be conducted. 
13.5.2.4 Incidence of All Other  Types of Ocular AEs  
The i ncidence of all other types of AEs will be summarized by treatment for primary eyes, 
fellow ey es, and “all” eyes for the mITT Set. No hypothesis tests will be conducted. 
13.5.3 Primary Effectiveness Analyses 
13.5.3.1 Photopic Monocular BCDVA  
Photopic monocular BCDVA in first eyes will be assessed at Post- Operative Visit 4 using the 
methods described in Appendix B  on Methods of Clinical Evaluation. The total number of 
letters correct will be entered into the electronic case report form.  
 
The number of letters correct will be converted to logMAR units using the following equation:  
 
𝑙𝑙
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙  𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑙𝑙= 1.7−0.02×𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙  𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙
𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙
𝑐𝑐𝑙𝑙 
 P
hotopic monocular logMAR BCDVA in first implanted eyes at Post -Operative Visit 4 will 
be summari zed using continuous summary statistics by treatment group for the mITT  Set. 
Imputation of missing data is not conservative in non- inferiority testing. Therefore, missing 
data will not be imputed for the BCDVA non- inferiority test. A statistical model will be 
constructed with BCDVA as the dependent variable and treatment and site as fixed factors. The treatment effect (least squares mean Test group IOL VA minus least squares mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be estimated in addition to a two -sided 90% confidence 
interval. If the upper confidence limit (equivalent  to a one -sided upper 95% confidence limit 
for the treatment effect) is less than 0.1, then the Test lens will be statistically non -inferior to 
the control lens.   The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set. However, non- inferiority will not be evaluated with the PP Set and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis.  BCDVA at Visit 4 for the Test group will be summarized categorically (20/20 or better, 20/25 
or better, 20/32 or better, 20/40 or better, and worse than 20/40) for the mITT  and Best Case 
Sets.  Two -sided exact binomial 90% confidence interval s around the proportions of eyes 20/40 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 111 
 or better will be presented.   Categorical summaries will use whole line binning as shown in the 
following logMAR to Snellen conversion table ( Table 3 ): 
 
Table 3.  logMAR to Snellen Conversion Table 
logMAR Value  Snellen Value  
≤ 0.00 20/20 or better  
≤ 0.10 20/25 or better  
≤ 0.20 20/32 or better  
 ≤ 0.30  20/40 or better  
> 0.30  Worse than 20/40  
   For the analyses of the mITT  and Best Case Sets, one- sided exact binomial tests comparing 
the proportion of Multifocal IOL eyes with BCDVA 20/40 or better to the relevant control rate 
(92.5% for all eyes and 96.7% for best case eyes) will be performed and p- values will be 
presented. If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, then the null hypothesis will be rejected.   If the null hypothesis is not rejected for the mITT  and Best Case Sets in the primary analyses, 
then it will be concluded that the Multifocal IOL is statistically successful in this outcome.  
13.5.3.2 Photopic Monocular DCNVA  
Photopic monocular distance -corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) at 40 cm  in first eyes at 
Post- Operative Visit 4 will be summarized using continuous summary statistics in logMAR 
units by treatment assignment for the mITT  Set Phase II and III subjects  (com bined) . The 
DCNVA best distance data from the Phase I/Pilot subjects will be excluded from hypothesis testing and will be summarized separately from the data of the other subjects.  
 If there are missing mITT  analysis set  monocular DCNVA data at Visit 4, then missing data 
will be imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation method. 
After imputation of missing data, the statistical hypotheses will be tested  using a statistical 
model with treatment a nd site as fixed factors by imputation.  
 An overall p- value resulting from the multiple imputation method will be estimated . The 
treatment effect (mean Test group IOL VA minus mean Control group IOL VA) in logMAR units will be summarized using continuous summary statistics and a two -sided 95% confidence 
interval. If the p- value from the multiple imputation analysis is less than or equal to 0.05 and 
the treatment effect is less than or equal to -0.20 (i.e., the Test lens mean logMAR VA is at 
least 0. 20 less than the mean for the control), then it will be concluded that the T est IOL is 
statistically and clinically successful (i.e., superior to the Control IOL) in this outcome.  The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set. However, superiority will not be evaluated with the PP Set and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis.
 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 111 
 13.5.3.3 Photopic Monocular DCIVA  
Photopic monocular distance -corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) at 66 cm  in first 
eyes at Post -Operative Visit 4 will be converted from letters correct to logMAR units using the 
method described above for BCDVA and summarized using continuous summary statistics in 
logMAR units by treatment assignment for the mITT  Set Phase II and III subjects  (combined) . 
The DCIVA data from the Phase I/Pilot subjects will be excluded from hypothesis testing and will be summarized separately from the data of the other subjects.  
 If there are missing mITT  analysis set monocular DCIVA data at Visi t 4, then missing data 
will be imputed using the MCMC  multiple imputation method. After imputation of missing 
data, the statistical hypotheses will be tested using a statistical model with treatment and site 
as fixed factors by imputation.   An overall p- value resulting from the multiple imputation method will be estimated . The 
treatment effect (mean Test group IOL VA minus mean Control group IOL VA) in l ogMAR 
units will be summarized using continuous summary statistics and a two -sided 95% confidence 
interv al. If the p -value from the multiple imputation analysis is less than or equal to 0.05 and 
the treatment effect is less than or equal to -0.10 (i.e. the T est lens mean logMAR VA is at 
least 0.10 less than the mean for the control), then it will be conclude d that the T est IOL is 
statistically and clinically successful (i.e., superior to control) in th is outcome. 
 The previous continuous summary statistics will also be provided for the Per Protocol Set. However, superiority will not be evaluated with the PP S et and statistical success will not 
depend upon the results of the PP analysis
 
13.5.4 Secondary Effectiveness Analys es 
Photopic binocular DCNVA, UCNVA, DCIVA, and UCIVA at Post -Operative Visit 4  will be 
converted from letters correct to logMAR units and compared between treatments using the 
methods described above for DCNVA  and DCIVA . The near and intermediate VA data from 
Phase I/Pilot subjects will be excluded from near and intermediate VA hypothesis te sting and 
will be summarized separately from the near and intermediate VA data of the other subjects. The endpoints will be evaluated hierarchically in the following order: DCNVA, UCNVA, 
DCIVA, and  UCIVA.   
 First eye BCDVA, DCNVA, and DCIVA (all in logMAR units)  at Visit 5 will be summarized 
using descriptive  statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the ITT 
Set by treatment group (MX60EF Trifocal MIOL, MX60E IOL). The means at Visit 5 for each 
of these outcomes will be compared between the treatment groups qualitatively.  
13.5.5 Other Analyses  
13.5.5.1 Clarity of Fundus Visualization  
Clarity of fundus visualization will be presented using categorical summary statistics by treatment for the mITT  Set.

24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66 of 111 
 13.5.5.2 Adverse Events   
mITT  Set eyes experiencing each type of adverse event at least once will be summarized 
categorically by treatment group. In addition, categorical summary statistics will be provided 
for each AE type by relationship to the study device , by relationship to surgi cal procedure,  and 
by severity.  
The incidence of the following further defined AEs will be summarized categorically by 
treatment group.  
• Endophthalmitis - intraocular inflammation requiring vitreous tap and use of 
intraocular antibiotics  
• Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) -  An acute, noninfectious inflammation of 
the anterior segment of the eye that develops within 24 to 48 hours after surgery and is characterized by corneal edema and accumulation of white cells in the anterior chamber  
of the eye  
• Mechanical pupillary block -  Mechanical pupillary block represents a shallowing of the 
peripheral and/or central anterior chamber with or without elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) by obstruction of the flow of aqueous humor from the post erior chamber 
through the pupil to the anterior chamber. This may be induced by the crystalline lens, vitreous face, or implanted devices  
• Chronic anterior uveitis -  anterior segment inflammation characterized by grade 1+ cell 
or greater (using the SUN cri teria)
31 persistent for greater than 3 months after surgery, 
or relapses in less than 3 months after discontinuation of therapy, or the subject is maintained on therapy for more than 3 months to control inflammation  
• Corneal edema -  Corneal swelling (strom al or epithelial) resulting in BCDVA of 20/40 
or worse, at ≥1 month postoperatively  
• Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) – partial or complete RD associated with 
retinal tear  
• Increased IOP - Elevation of IOP > 10 mmHg above the baseline and to a minimum  of 
25mmHg  
• Clinically significant cystoid macular edema -  Macular edema diagnosed by clinical 
exam and adjunct testing (e.g., OCT, fluorescein angiography or other method) and which results in reduced BCDVA to 20/40 or worse at Visit 3A for the first eye or Visit 3B for the second eye or later  
13.5.5.3 Subject Questionnaires  
Results of the  quality of vision questionnaire  and domain scores  will be presented using 
descriptive statistics by treatment group and visit, and no comparison will be made between 
treatment gr oups .  Data from the near activity vision questionnaire will be presented in a listing.

The following additional outcomes will be presented through the use of descriptive statistics  
and compared between treatment arms : 
• All categories of uncorrected visual acuities, by visit  
• All mesopic visual acuities, by visit  
• The distribution of grades of anterior chamber cells and flare, by visit  
• All cases of prolonged use of anti -inflammatory med ication beyond 6 weeks  
The following safety analyses will also be performed:  
• subject -by-subject analysis of reasons why subject failed to achieve 0.3 logMAR visual 
acuity  
• rate of visual acuity decreases of 10 letters or more on an early treatment of diabetic 
retinopathy study (EDTRS) chart (or equivalent) between a form evaluation and a later form evaluation with the cause of the visual acuity decrease described in each case . 
Cases of such visual acuity loss will be identified programmatically from the vis ual 
acuity data rather than from the CRF question about 10 letter drops.  
• Posterior capsular opacification grades and rates of posterior capsulotomies.  
13.5.5.6 Additional Analyses  
The accuracy of the preliminary A -constant used in the study will be assessed in a p ost-hoc 
analysis  to be included in a premarket approval supplement .  
Any additional supportive safety or effectiveness analyses will be described in the SAP.  
13.5.6 Subject  Disposition  
Enrollment status will be summarized in a table by investigator and overall fo r the  mITT  
analysis set. The number of randomized subjects will be summarized as well as the number 
and percentage of subjects that completed the entire trial, discontinued before implant, 
discontinued after the first implant but before the second surgery, and discontinued after  the 
second  surgery. In addition, for those subjects that did not complete the entire trial, the 
reason (s) for discontinuation will be summarized.     
 Subject and eye accountability at each visit will b e summarized for the ITT, mITT, PP, and 
Best Case Sets in tables. The subject and eye accountability tables for the mITT Set will also be stratified by investigator and by treatment assignment.  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 111 
 Subjects  and eyes  in the ITT , mITT , PP, and Best Case analysis sets will be summarized 
categorically by treatment and overall.  
13.5.7 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Race, sex, ethnicity , and age will be presented by treatment group and overall in a table using 
discrete summary statistics. Age will also be  presented using continuous summary statistics by 
treatment group.  
13.5.8 Protocol Deviations  
The number of subjects within each type of protocol deviation will be presented using discrete 
summary statistics.   A major protocol deviation will be  defined as a deviation that is expected  to impact  the key 
safety  or effectiveness outcomes,  or w hich has an effect on subject safety . 
13.5.9 Interim Analyses  
After IOL implantation for Phase I/Pilot subjects, enrollment will pause until the Phase I/Pilot subject s have completed Visit 3B  (30 to 60 days after second  eye IOL implantation) and their 
data have been reviewed. A snapshot  of DCNVA and DCIVA data will be obtained. Data 
listings and/or summaries of T est lens DCNVA and DCIVA data will be prepared by an 
unmasked statistician and presented for review by an unmasked clinical review er not 
associated with the study , and the best distances for near and intermediate VA testing will be 
determined. Safety data will also be prepared by an unmasked statistician and  presented for 
review by an  unmasked clinical review er not associated with the study. Phase I safety and VA 
data will be submitted to the FDA for review and acceptance to initiate Phase II.  Statistical 
comparisons between Group 1 and Group 2 will not be m ade or evaluated. The decision to 
proceed or not to proceed to Phase II will not be based on formal statistical stopping rules.   When  a minimum of 50 Phase I and Phase II Group 1 subjects have been enrolled and followed 
through Visit 4, s ummaries and/or l istings of all available safety data through Visit 4 will be 
prepared by an unmasked statistical team. Aggregated safety data for the minimum first 50 
Phase I and Phase II Group 1 subjects who complete Visit 4 f or these  subjects will be presented 
to the FDA to request expansion to Phase III . Safety data for approximately the corresponding 
minimum first 25 Phase I and Phase II Group 2 subjects who complete Visit 4  also will be 
submitted concurrently to the FDA.  While safety data submissio n and FDA review for these 
subjects is occurring, additional subjects may be enrolled up to a maximum of approximately 72 Phase II subjects (including those whose data were submitted to FDA) .  Statistical 
comparisons between Group 1 and Group 2 will not be  made or evaluated. The decision to 
proceed or not to proceed to Phase III will not be based on formal statistical stopping rules.   
Phase III enrollment will be initiated only after acceptance to proceed is received from FDA .

 13.6 Additional  Statistical Consid erations  
13.6.1 Handling of Missing Data 
Imputation of missing primary endpoint data is described in Section 13.5.3 above. Unless 
otherwise specified in the SAP , missing data will not be imputed.  
13.6.2 Multicenter Issues  
Randomization will be stratified by site.  
Consistency of treatment effects across sites will be evaluated using statistical methods that 
will be described in the SAP . A p -value less than or equal to 0.15 for treatment by site 
interactions will be consider ed statistically significant.  
13.6.3 Multiplicity Issues  
As all primary  safety and effectiveness endpoints with success criteria described in Section 
13.1 are required to demonstrate statistical success , adjustment for multiplicity is not necessary 
for these endp oints. 
Statistical testing of the secondary endpoints with success criteria will not be evaluated for success unless all primary endpoi nts with success criteria are met.  Primary and secondary 
endpoints without success criteria will not affect the evaluatio n of secondary endpoints with 
success criteria. The secondary endpoint hypotheses will be evaluated hierarchically; therefore,  
adjustment for multiplicity is also not necessary for these endpoints.  
Any statistical tests of endpoints that are not primary or  secondary endpoints will be considered 
exploratory and will not be adjusted for multiplicity. 
13.6.4 Visit Windows  
Only in- window visit  data will be included in the analysis of a scheduled visit’s data. All 
adverse events will be included in the safety analysis even if occurring or reported outside of scheduled visit windows. If a scheduled visit is completed outside of the prescribed visit window, then the visit and its window will be handled as follows:  
 
• The out -of-window scheduled visit will be reclassified as an interim (unscheduled) 
visit.  
• If one or more unscheduled visits occurred in the window, then the unscheduled visit that occurr ed closest to the center of the visit window will be reclassified as the in -
window (scheduled) visit.  
•     If two unscheduled visits occurred in the visit window, are the closest visits to its center, 
and are equidistant from its center, then the later o f the two visits will be reclassified 
as the in -window (scheduled) visit. 
 Each summary of unscheduled visit data will display the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum of the absolute value of days outside of the visit windows that the summarized data were collected .

 13.6.5 Management of Bias  
Potential bias will be managed by randomization of subjects to treatment groups and by 
masking of  examiners performing postoperative refractions and visual acuity testing.  
Randomization will be completed using a computer system so that subjects’ treatment assignments cannot be revealed prematurely. Each subject will be randomized independently, and no randomization result will be reassigned to another subject. This process should ensure there is no systematic bias in baseline characteristics, thus producing groups comparable in known and unknown potential confounding factors. The Berger -Exner test will be used to 
evaluate potential selection bias.  
The masking of subjects and postoperative examiner s described in Section 9.2 of this document 
will remain in effect throughout the trial. Mean logMAR DCNVA and DCIVA by site and treatment, along with the difference in means between the test and control groups by site, will be examined to determine whether  any site had an unusually large or small treatment effect .  
13.6.6 Management of Potential Confounding Factors  
Randomization will be stratified by site. Site will be included in the statistical models for the analyses of continuous primary endpoints.  
14 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
14.1 Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor and its representatives must be allowed to visit all study site locations to assess the data, quality, and study integrity in a manner consistent with applicable health authority regulations and the procedures adopted by the Sponsor or its representative. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, when access to study site locations may be restricted, remote monitoring 
methods may be implemented to ensure data quality and integrity, as per the monitoring plan.  Prior to the start of the study, member(s) of the Sponsor (or designees) will review the protocol,  
CRF, regulatory obligations, and other material or equipment relevant to the conduct of the study with the Investigator/Sub- Investigator and relevant study s ite personnel.  
 Monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, as per the monitoring 
plan, during the course of the investigation to verify the following:  
 
• The rights and well -being of subjects are protected  
• The conduct of the investigation is in compliance with the currently approved 
protocol/amendment;  21 CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 812;  ISO 14155 ( 2020 E) 
Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects – Good Clinical 
Practice; ISO 11979- 7:2006/Amd.1:2012(E)  Ophthalmic implants —  Intraocular 
lenses — Part 7 ; ISO 11979- 9: 2006/Amd 1:2014 Ophthalmic implants — Intraocular 
lenses — Part 9; ANSI Z80.12- 2007 (R2012), 42 USC 282(j) ; and IRB/ IEC 
requirements  
• The integrity of the data, including adequate study documentation  
• The facilities remain acceptable  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 111 
 • The Investi gator and site personnel remain qualified and able to conduct the study  
• Test article accountability  
 
During the study, if the Sponsor (or desig nee) determines that an Investigator is non- compliant 
with the study plan and/or applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor (or designee) will 
take remediation action to secure compliance. In addition, the Sponsor may terminate the 
Investigator’s part icipation in the study, if appropriate, if the Investigator remains non -
compliant despite the remediation  actions.  
14.2 Source Documentation  
All medical information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject’s record 
(source docume ntation) in real-time as it is collected. Source documentation consists of 
original subject documents, as well as data and records with information relevant to the subject and his/her participation in the study.   Source documentation worksheets may be provided by the  Sponsor or its designee to record 
pertinent information. The completed worksheets can then be incorporated into the subject’s medical chart. If it is preferred not to use the worksheets in the subject’s permanent record, 
then the worksheets should be used as a reference to determine the type of study data to record 
in the subject’s permanent record.  
14.3 Case R eport  Forms and Data Verification  
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) should be understood to refer to an electronic data record de veloped as part of the electronic data capture method utilized in this 
study. 
 Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded on CRFs. The Investigator and his/her study site personnel will be responsible for completing the CRFs  in a timely manner . The 
Investigator is required to verify that all of the requested information is accurately recorded on the CRFs. All information requested on the CRFs needs to be supplied, including subject identification and initials, date(s), assess ment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy 
will require explanation. All information on CRFs must be traceable to source documents.   The study monitor will be responsible for reviewing and verifying the data recorded on the 
CRFs utilizing the orig inal or certified copies of  all source documentation and querying 
discrepant findings   
 The Investigator and study site personnel will be responsible for answering all queries  in a 
timely manner .  
14.4 Recording of Data and Retention of Documents  
Subject data recorded on CRFs during the study will be documented in a coded fashion. The subject will only be identified by the unique subject number. Confidentiality of subject records 
must be maintained to ensure adherence to applicable local privacy regulations. Data entry 
information and guidelines are found in the Study Reference Manual.  
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 111 
 The Investigator must retain essential documents indefinitely after the completion of the study, 
unless otherwise notified by the Sponsor. The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention procedures when signing the protocol Investigator Statement of Approval.  
 Essential documents include , but are not limited to , the following:  
• IRB/ IEC approvals for the study protocol, all amendments, ICF(s), and 
advertisem ents  
• IRB/ IEC annual study review  
• IRB/ IEC correspondence and reports (e .g., SAE reports, protocol deviations, and 
safety updates)  
• Regulatory documents (e .g., financial disclosure and delegation of authority forms)  
• All source documents  
• CRFs  
• Subject’s s igned ICF  
• Device Investigator Agreement  
• Accountability records for the test article(s)  
• Correspondence from and to the Sponsor and CRO  
• Any other documents relevant to the conduct of the study  
 
In the event  the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., retirement  or relocation), study 
records will be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator  or 
the site IRB/I EC). The Investigator will provide notice of such transfer in writing to the 
Sponsor and/or its representative.  
14.5 Audits and Inspections  
Audits of clinical research activities in accordance with the Sponsor’s internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to evaluate compliance with the principles of GCP may take place. A regulatory authority also may wish to conduct an inspection during the study or after 
its completion . If an inspection is requested by a regulatory authority and/or IRB/ IEC, the 
Investigator mu st inform the Sponsor and its representative immediately that this request has 
been made.  
15 Ethics and Administrative Issues  
It is the responsibility of the site’s principal investigator to assure that all aspects of the ethics review are conducted in accord ance with ISO 14155. The protocol and any information 
supplied to the subject to obtain informed consent, including written informed consent form(s), subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), and written information to be provided to subjects (information leaflets), will be reviewed and approved by a qualified IRB/IEC prior 
to enrollment of participants in the study. Prior to initiation of the study and release of test 
articles to a clinical site , the Sponsor or its designee will receive docume ntation of the IRB/IEC 
approval, which specifically identifies the approved study/protocol and a list of the IRB/IEC 
committee members. Protocol amendments will be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design in the amendment . 
Protocol #945  
24 April 2023, Version 8 .0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 111 
 Investigators will submit progress reports to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the IRB/IEC 
requirements.  
15.1 Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and ISO 14155, applicable 
regulations  and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
15.2 Ethics Review  
The Investigator should ensure his/her participation in the study, the protocol, subject 
recruitment materials  (e.g., written information or materials including web pages, radio 
advertisements, television spots or written text developed to encourage subject enrollment) and 
the ICF to be used in this study are approved by his/her  institution IRB/ IEC, or , if not using 
his/her  institution ’s IRB/ IEC, by the reviewing central IRB/ IEC prior to entering any subjects 
in the study. Documentation of IRB /IEC approval of the study protocol and informed consent 
must be provided to the Sponsor and any designee prior t o initiation of the study. In addition, 
the Investigator must ensure that the reviewing IRB/ IEC has provided approval for any 
protocol amendments prior to their implementation. If the amendment necessitates a revision 
to the ICF, the Investigator should ensure the revised form is also submitted to and approved by the Sponsor or its designee and the IRB/ IEC prior to its implementation.   
15.3 Written Informed Consent  
Before entry into the study, the Investigator or an authorized membe r of the investigational 
staff will explain to potential subjects (or their legally acceptable representatives) the aims, 
methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort it may entail. The subject (or legally acceptable representative) w ill be given 
sufficient time to read the IC F and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and 
before entry into the study, consent will be appropriately recorded by means of either the subject ’s or his /her legally acceptable representative’ s dated signature. After having obtained 
the consent, a copy of the signed and dated ICF will be given to the subject. 
 If the subject (or legally acceptable representative) is unable to read or write, an impartial witness will be present for the entire in formed  consent process (which includes  reading and 
explaining all written information) and will personally date and sign the IC F after the oral 
consent of the subject (or legally acceptable representative) is obtained.  
 The informed consent form will be si gned before the performance of any study- related activity.  
15.4 Financial Disclosure , Clinical Trial Agreements, and Site Contact Information

 Appendix B  METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATIONS  
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover.  S tudy procedures performed during the COVID -19 pandemic will be conducted in 
accordance with medical guidance to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission between s tudy 
staff and subjects (available at www.aao.org/covid-19 ).  It is recommended Investigator s 
periodically  revisit the aao.org/covid-19 website to identify and implement any updated 
recommendations made by AAO.  Local, state, and federal public health guidance also will be followed, and it is recommended these guidances also be visited once a month to see if they have changed . 
 
1.0 MANIFEST SUBJECTIVE REFRACTION (WITHOUT CYCLOP LEGIC EYE 
DROPS)  
It is essential that a consistent and standard procedure be used to obtain manifest refraction  
measurements.  The measurements will  be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, 
optometrist or trained ophthalmic technician using a phoropter  or tria l frame with loose lenses , 
in 0.25 D steps, in a calibrated refraction lane. The principal of maximum plus prescription 
while maintaining optimum visual acuity (not just darker letters) should be adhered to. At no time during the study will autorefraction be utilized as a final endpoint r efraction. 
Autorefractor or lensometer readings may only be utilized to obtain a starting point for the refraction , if necessary.   
To ensure consistency, all r efraction s will be performed at an optical distance of 4 meters  using 
the M&S Clinical Trial Suite . This refraction will be co nsidered the “unadjusted manifest 
refraction at 4 m ”.  The “adjusted manifest refraction” is the “unadjusted manifest refraction  “ 
minus 0.25 D used t o correct for optical infinity at 4 m .  Both “adjusted” and “unadjusted” 
manifest refraction values will be recorded on source documentation, but only the adjusted value will entered as eCRF data.   Note that the “ adjusted  manifest refraction ” (“unadjusted 
manifest refraction ” at 4 meters minus  0.25 D) is the value that is used for DCIVA and 
DCNVA measurements .  
1.1 Preoperative Manifest Subjective Refraction  
 
If the subject has a current pair of glasses for distance vision, they can be measured with a lensometer and these measurements used as the b eginning approximate refraction. If the 
subject does not have glasses for distance vision, retinoscopy or autorefraction may  be 
performed by an examiner proficient in this procedure  as the beginning approximate refraction.  
If the subject is a contact lens wearer, they should be advised to arrive for the preoperative testing wearing spectacles  and not their contact lenses.  
 AUTOREFRACTION ALONE IS NOT ALLOWED AT ANY POINT IN THIS STUDY. RESULTS MUST BE REFINED USING SUBJEC TIVE TECHNIQUES.  
 The manifest subjective refraction at 4 meters  MUST be transferred to the trial frame for  
BCD VA testing. If for any reason (e.g., dense cataract) manifest refraction  cannot be obtained, 
the results should be documented as not done (ND) and not entered as zeros. In the event of 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 88 of 111 
 this occurrence, BCDVA will not be tested and the reason for ND will be required in the source 
document and eCRF.  Contact lens wearers must demonstrate a stable refraction (within ± 0.50 D  for both sphere and 
cylinder ) on two consecutive exam dates. Stability of the refraction is determined under the 
following conditions:  
• Lenses are not worn for at least 1 week (rigid contact lenses) or 3 days (soft contact lenses) 
prior to the first refraction used to establish stability and  through the day of surgery;   
• The two refractions are performed at least 7 days apart.  
 1.2 Postoperative Manifest Subjective Refraction  
 
The subject should be refracted using the same method and procedure as described in Section 1.1 of this appendix.   2.0 VISUAL ACUITY TESTING  
It is essential that a standard procedure be used to obtain visual acuity ( VA) measurements. 
The VA measurements should be obtained by a qualified ophthalmologist, optometrist or trained ophthalmic technician using the  Clinical Trial Suite (M&S Technologies, Niles, IL) 
hardware and software that will be supplied by the Sponsor.  Tra ining on the use of Clinical 
Trial Suite instrumentation will be conducted and documented by a qualified representative of 
M&S Technologies prior to its use with enrolled subjects.  VA testing will be performed by masked study personnel using a trial frame . 
Visual Acuity Testing  for all subjects : 
• Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) will be measured at distance of 4 meters 
with the manifest refraction obtained at 4 meters  (Unadjusted Manifest Refraction)  
• Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA) will be measured at distance of 4 meters with 
a +0.25D lens to adjust for optical infinity  
• Distance corrected intermediate visual acuity (DCIVA) will be measured at distance(s) 
specified in Appendix A
 with the “adjusted manifest refraction”, which is the  manifest 
refraction obtained at 4 meters minus 0.25 D  to obtain the optical infinity manifest 
refraction  (Adjusted  Manifest Refraction)  
• Uncorrected intermediate  visual acuity  (UCIVA) will be  measured with Phase II and Phase 
III subjects a t distance(s)  specified in Appendix A  at 66  cm with no corrective lens  
• Distance corrected near visual acuity  (DCNVA) will be  measured at distance(s) specified 
in Appendix A  with the “adjusted manifest refraction”, which is the  manifest r efraction  
obtained at 4 meters  minus 0.25 D ( Adjusted  Manifest Refraction ). 
• Uncorrected near visual acuity  (UCNVA) will be  measured at distance(s)  specified in 
Appendix A  with no corrective lens 
 2.1 Description and Testing Methodology  The Clinical Trial Suite is a computerized vision testing system consisting of a computer tablet and frame to hold the tablet that allows it  to be stationed at different distances from a seated 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 89 of 111 
 subject.  The tablet frame also has lights attached to it that allow vision testing to be conducted 
with or without glare.  The frame can be moved so that near, intermediate, or far VA can be 
determined, with the ETDRS optotype display adjusted for distance from subject to display to accommodate the effect of distance of the size of the ETDRS letters.  The Clinical Trial Suite will use high contrast ETDRS letters and randomiz e the letter display during every use to 
eliminate any effect of memorization bias.  The distance from subject to display for near, 
intermediate, and far distance VA testing will be standardized for all clinical sites  and for all 
subjects .    
 The chart display on the tablet should be at a comfortable viewing angle for the subject, approximately head high.  The subject should attempt t o read each letter, line by line, left to 
right, beginning with line 1 at the top of the chart.  The subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers.  The subject should be asked to read slowly, about 1 letter per second, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter .  Subjects should be instructed not 
to squint, and the tester should closely watch the subject during testing and warn him/her if  
squinting is observed.  The subject is not to proceed to the next letter until a defi nite response 
is given.  If the subject changes a response (e.g., “that was a ‘C’ not an ‘O’) before the next letter has been read aloud, then the change must be accepted.  If the subject changes a response having read the next letter, then the change is n ot to be accepted.  The examiner should never point to 
the char t or to specific letters o n the chart during the test.  A maximum effort should be made 
to identify each letter on the chart.  This may include encouraging the subject to guess.  If the subject  identified a letter as 1 of 2 letters, he or she should be asked to choose 1 letter and, if 
necessary, to guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be 
made, despite encouragement to read or guess, the examine r should stop the  test for that eye 
and those testing conditions .  However, all letters on the last line should be attempted as lett er 
difficulties vary and the last letter may be the only one read correctly.  The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be note d.  In order to provide standardized and well 
controlled assessments of visual acuity during the study, all visual acuity assessments at a single site must be consistently done using the same lighting conditions during the entire study.  2.2 Room Illumination  
 Standard lighting conditions to be used in VA testing are Photopic: 85 (± 2) cd/m
2 and Mesopic: 
3 (± 0.5) cd/m2. If an Investigator is unable to use these lighting conditions or has lighting 
conditions that vary slightly from these target illuminations, they should discuss their current lighting conditions with the Sponsor . 
 2.3 Subject Instructions  
 Subjects will be instructed that their vision will be tested  at different distances, sometimes with 
the room lights on and sometimes with the room  lights off.  They will be asked  to sit quietly 
during testing, with no head movements relative to the chart display allowed.  If subjects need one or more  brief  breaks from the testing, this will be  allowed.

24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 90 of 111 
 2.4 Visual Acuity Assessments 
See Appendix A for schedule of VA assessments.    VA assessments should be done only once  
per visit for each eye (or subject, in the case of binocular VA) , distance to eye chart, and 
lighting condition.  
   
3.0 SLIT LAMP EXAM

 Posterior Capsular Haze Assessment of the severity of any PCO will be done with pupil dilation at the slit lamp using the following grading scale: 
Grade 0 – None    No growth is seen on any portion of the visible lens capsule.  
Grade 1 – Trace or Mild  Lens epithelial cells can be seen in the periphery where the 
anterior capsule has retracted from the front of the IOL and is now interacting with the posterior capsule, but there are very few central cells.  
Grade 2 – Moderate  The peripheral cells have become much denser and are starting to invade the central area.  
Grade 3 – Severe  The lens epithelial cells have met one another in the middle and 
are forming a sheet over the posterior capsule.  
 4.0 INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP)  
IOP measurements will be obtained using a calibrated Goldmann Type Applanation Tonometer 
in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.  5.0 PUPIL SIZE  
Pupil size will be measured with a  pupil lometer at the corneal plane to the nearest 0. 1 mm.  
Eye illumination for pupil measurement will be identical to the photopic and mesopic illumination used for visual acuity testing  – 85 (± 2)  cd/m
2 and 3 (± 0.5)  cd/m2, respectively . 
Pupil measurement  will be initiated only after the eye has had time to full y adapt to the testing 
conditions (approximately 10 minutes).    6.0 DILATED FUNDUS EXAM  
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 93 of 111 
 Using an Ophthalmoscope, light is shone into the eye and the retina and the optic nerve are 
examined. This exam is used to evaluate the internal structures of the eye. The Investigator will classify the fundus as “normal” or “abnormal.”   If abnormal, the i nvestigator will describe 
the abnormality.  The investigator will also rate the clarity of fundus visualization as “adequate” or “inadequate” .   
 7.0 OCT  IMAGING  
Approximately 20 Group 1 subjects and 10 Group 2 subjects will participate in OCT imaging at 2-3 clinical sites having similar or identical OCT equipment.   For sites and subjects 
participating in OCT imaging, images of first implanted eye will be taken .   OCT images will 
be obtained after the dilated exam, and eyes found to have any abnormality of the visual axis or retinal structures will be excluded  from the imaging sub- study.  For each first implanted 
eye, three images of the macula and three images of the optic nerve will be obtained by qualified site personnel, labeled with the Subject ID numbe r, and submitted to the Sponsor (or 
designee) for assessment.  The image quality will be assessed to determine adequacy for visualization of retinal structures, with the results rated on the following scale:  
0 = Ungradable (including failure to visualize the macula or optic nerve)  
1 = Poor quality image  
2 = Fair quality image  
3 = Good quality image  
4 = Excellent quality image  
 If difficulty with visualization  is encountered during the process of obtaining OCT images , 
conventional fundus photographs will be taken .   
 8.0 TRIAL FRAME ASTIGMATISM SIMULATION 
Participating subjects should have the following characteristics  (in both eyes)  upon having 
consented to the Trial Frame Astigmatism Simulation  sub- study:  
1. Signed consent (no later than Visit 5) to participate in the sub- study 
2. Completed visit 5  
3. Have a best -corrected distance visual acuity of 20/25 or better as noted in each eye at 
Visit 5   
4. Subject s should not have corneal edema, increased IOP or any AE / SAE at Visit 5, as 
per the reportable AEs/ SAEs clarified in section 12.4.1 of the protocol . 
5. In addition, subjects must be willing to complete their participation on the Trial Frame 
sub-study betwe en 2 and 30 days after completion of Visit  5. 
6. Subjects  with oblique post -operative residual astigmatism (axis between 30 to 60 
degrees or 120 to 150 degrees)  will be excluded from participation in the sub- study. 
Enrollment will be sequential with consecutive subjects enrolled onto the Trial Frame 
astigmatism simulation sub -study at each site in order of their completion of post -operative 
Visit 5 and based on their eligibility.  The subject will provide  consent for the Trial Frame 
astigmatism simulation sub -study by completion of Visit 5  and return at Visit 6 to  undergo the 
trial frame evaluation to assess distance- corrected visual acuities with various amounts of 
astigmatism. Eligibility for the sub -study will be confirmed by the completion of V isit 5 and 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 of 111 
 subject s will be enrolled in it when  the Informed Consent  document is signed. V isit 6  will 
include review/update of  concomitant medication s, adverse events, and measurement of 
monocular distance corrected visual acuity for far (4 m), intermediate (66 cm), and near (40 
cm) distance under photopic conditions with varying degrees of simulated residual astigmatism 
with 2.00 D, 1.5 D, and 1.0 D  CYL .  Participants in the sub-study will be seen at only one visit  
(Visit 6)  for the  trial frame evaluation  which will complete their participation in the study .   
Assessments are shown in the Study Flow Chart in Appendix A . 
 The below assessments  will be recorded : 
 
i. For the (4 -meter) manifest -corrected distance (4 m) testing : 
▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation) ;  
 ii. For the distance corrected intermediate (66 cm) testing  : 
▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout  astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation)  iii. For the distance corrected near (40 cm) testing: ▪ Visual acuity will be assessed w ithout astigmatic blur; and  
▪ With astigmatic blur for each astigmatic condition (power/axis orientation) 
 The order of testing will follow the  A and B Eye pre -operative assignments relating to the 
order of surgical implantation of the IOL  and each eye of the subject will be tested for each 
distance and astigmatic condition, followed by a repeat of the same testing with the other eye.    The purpose of the Trial Frame astigmatism sub- study is to evaluate the effect of simulated 
residual astigmatism on distance, intermediate, and near visual acuities in eyes implanted with the enVista trifocal toric intraocular lenses (IOLs).  
 The trial frame evaluation will assess distance -corrected visual acuities with various amounts 
of additional astigmatism at distance / far, intermediate, and near distances, in that order, for 
each eye of each  subject  monocularly.  ETDRS charts appropriate for each distance will be 
used in measuring visual acuity for the vario us cylinder power conditions.  Each eye of the 
participating  subjects will be evaluated monocularly, beginning with the subject’s A eye 
(Right/ Left) and repeating for the subject’s B eye (Left/ Right) .   
 The Trial Frame is placed on the subject and adjus ted to sit comfortably on the subject’s face . 
The subject’s eyes are centered relative to the lens wells of the frame via adjustments to the 
temple length, to the nose pad for frame height , pantoscopic  tilt and leveling of the frame and  
the interpupillary distance.  The subject’s distance -corrected refraction and testing will begin at f ar distance (4 m) using 
the Clinical Trial Suite system (M&S Technologies, Niles, IL) with no  additional cylinder tria l 
lens in the trial frame for  measurement of monocular distance corrected  visual acuity for each 
eye. The distance correction used in the trial frame for testing at far distance (4 m) is the 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 95 of 111 
 unadjusted manifest refraction performed  at 4 m ; however, the distance correction used in the 
trial frame for testing at intermediate (66 cm) and near (40 cm) distances is the adjusted  
manifest refraction ( i.e., the manifest refraction at 4 m adjusted by adding an additional -0.25 
D).  See Table 4  below 
 
In order to ensure the spherical equivalent is kept at a constant ,  the examiner must modify 
the spher ical power  with each p lus cylinder power added to the trial frame. This procedure is 
necessary to avoid increasing the spherical equivalence and blurring the vision with induced Hyperopia.  For example, when adding a residual plus cylinder power of 1.0D to the Trial Frame, 0.5D of spherical power must be subtracted to ensure spherical equilavence is maintained at a  consta nt.  
The following examples demonstrate the proper subtraction of spherical power with the addition of each cylindrical power to maintain a constant spherical equivalent compared to the manifest refraction.   
 Examples  
1)            -0.75 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +1.50 cylinder,  2)            -0.50 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +1.00 cylinder, 3)            -1.00 sph should be placed in the trial frame with the +2.00 cylinder.  
 Residual astigmatism then will be optically simulated for each subject at distance  / far (4 m), 
intermediate (66 cm), and near (40 cm) distances (in that order) using additional plus cylinder trial lenses placed at  the 180⁰ axis (i.e., simulating A TR astigmatism) and then at the 90⁰ axis 
(i.e., simulating W TR astigmatism).  The order of trial lenses to be used with a subject will be 
the 2.00 D plus cylinder lens  (placed first at 180⁰ and then at 90⁰) followed successively by use 
of the 1.50 D plus cylinder lens  (placed first at 180 ⁰ and then at 90⁰) and then the 1.00 D plus 
cylinder lens (placed first at 180⁰ and then at 90⁰).  The A eye will be measured first, using the 
various cylinder lenses for distance / far, intermediate, and near distances .   The same ord er 
will then be repeated for the B eye.

   9.0 ASSESSMENT OF LENS TILT AND DECENTRATION 
If upon postoperative examination, tilt  and/or decentration of the IOL are  not seen or deemed 
insignificant, rather than entering any score, a box marked “Not Detectable” will be checked.  
Otherwise, significant lens tilt  and decentration  will be assessed according to the method 
described by Guyton et al, 
39 as refined by the Am erican Academy of Ophthalmology Task 
Force Summary Statement for Measurement of Tilt, Decentration, and Chord Length. 40    
 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 97 of 111 
 The Guyton method is a simple, rapid and accurate procedure for determining the tilt and 
decentration of an IOL.  
 Method of Determ ining Lens Tilt and Decentration 
 Using a penlight, identify the III
rd and IVth Purkinje images.   The  relative lack of parallax 
movement of the first Purkinje  image, with respect to the pupil, helps to identify it.  
  
 
                 
Figure 3 from Chang and Waring  
41 
Purkinje images as seen through a pupilometer.  
 With the patient looking at the examiner's finger,  the examiner moves his finger  in the frontal 
plane until  Purkinje images III and IV, as sighted by the examiner's  eye, become aligned with 
one another. The apparent IOL  tilt (𝚹𝚹') and decentration ( Δ) are directly determined from  this 
viewing situation , as described below . 
 

Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 98 of 111 
  
Figure 6 from Guyton et al  39 
 
In Figure 6, the appa rent amount of tilt of the IOL ( 𝚹𝚹') is equal to the angle between the patient's 
line of sight  and the aligned Purkinje images III and IV. This angle is  formed by the examiner's 
finger, the patient's pupil, and the penlight.   In the  example in Figure 6, the direction of tilt is 
from the examiner's  finger toward the pen light, directly down, in the 90° meridian.  
 
Also , illustrated in Figure 6 is the examiner's view of  the Purkinje images as projected onto the 
patient's pupil. Notice that images III and IV are superimposed on each other but do not 
coincide with image I.   This is a right  eye, with the first Purkinje image being displaced nasally  
from the center of the pupil. Also, the first Purkinje image  is displaced downward, because it 
always falls on the line  connecting the light source with the center of curvature  of the 
cornea.   With the patient's eye looking upward, therefore, the first Purkinje image (the corneal 
light reflex)  is displaced downward with respect to the center of the  pupil.  
 The superimposition of Purkinje images III and IV mar ks the  optical axis of the IOL as it passes 
through the entrance  pupil of the eye. Because the desired center point for the  IOL is the center 
of the entrance pupil, the amount of  decentration and direction of decentration of the IOL are  
immediately apparen t from this view. The IOL is decentered  directly upward, approximately 
0.6 mm, in Figure  6. The decentration can be measured from this vantage  point, if desired, by 
holding a ruler in the frontal plane  of the patient's eye, perpendicular to the patient's l ine of  
sight as illustrated.  
 If the IOL is not decentered at all, but simply tilted  about its anterior vertex, the relationship 
of the apparent  angle of tilt to the actual angle of tilt can be calculated .   For clinical purposes, 
it is sufficient to remember that  the actual tilt of a centered IOL is 80%  to 85%  of the  apparent 
tilt (𝚹𝚹').   Pure decentration of the IOL, without actual tilt, will produce a certain amount of 
apparent tilt, because the optical axis of the IOL will no longer be perpendicular to the cornea. 
By trigonometric ray tracing analysis, l  mm of decentration produces 1.7° of apparent tilt, and 
2 mm  of decentration produces 4.14 ° of apparent tilt.  
 
10.0 CHORD LENGTH  µ AND KERATOMETRY 

Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 99 of 111 
 Chord length μ measurements will be recorded at the Pre- Operative Visit, Visit 4 and Visit 5 
using either IOL Master or LENSTAR. Chord length μ measurements will be regarded as an 
adequate surrogate for angle kappa measurements . 41,42    
 
Keratometry values at the Pre- Operative Visit which are required for eligibility and IOL 
power calculations, as well as keratometry values at Post -Operative Visits 3, 4 and 5, may be 
obtained from automated keratometry (e.g., IOL Master or LENSTAR) or simulated keratometry (e.g., topography, Scheimpflug photography or optical coherence tomography).  Note that the steep and flat axes which are reported should be orthogonal.  The same method should be used for a specific subject/eye throughout the study.     
11.0 DEFOCUS CURVES  
Subjects  will be identified  based on photopic pupil size to have defocus testing performed.  
Approximately 10 subjects from each lens group at each of three photopic pupil sizes (small - 
<3.0mm;  medium -  ≥3.0mm and ≤ 4.0 mm ; large -  >4.0 mm) will be evaluated.  If 10 subjects 
are not available in any one pupil size category, the maximum number available will be used.    
Data will be stratified by photopic pupil size (small -  <3.0mm; medium -  ≥3.0mm and ≤4.0 
mm; and large - >4.0 mm) and axial length (short -  <21.0 mm; medium -  21.0 to 26.0 mm; and 
long -  >26.0 mm). 
 Binocular  defocus testing will be performed under photopic lighting conditions using the 
Clinical Trial Suite (M&S Technologies) at Visit 4 (120- 180 days after second eye IOL 
implantation). Each subject will be defocused with spherical minus trial lenses from their best distance- corrected (Unadjusted ) manifest refraction between +1.50 D and - 3.50 D in 0.5 D 
increments , except in the range of +0.50 D through - 0.50 D, which will  be in 0.25 D 
increments .   
 12.0 CONTRAST SENSITIVITY  
At least a pproximately 136 Best Case Group 1 subjects and 68 Best Case Group 2 subjects will 
be enrolled  to have contrast sensitivity testing performed.  Binocular best -corrected distance 
contrast sensitivity testing will be performed using the M&S Clinical Trial Suite at all sites , 
using the Una djusted Manifest Refraction . The CTS is calibrated for distance- to-subject and 
pixels -per-inch so that optotypes follow ANSI and ISO standards .
 
Sine-wave gratings will be produced on a high- resolution monitor . Outer edges of the grating 
will incorporate the Gabor effect , and all edges will be surrounded by a uniform field equal to 
the grating in space -averaged luminance.   Subjects will practice the contrast sensitivity test 
once at all orientations, each at a different spatial frequency, under photopic conditions before 
beginning tests for recorded data.  
Subje cts undergoing contrast sensitivity testing will be dark adapted for at least 10 minutes 
before beginning testing to collect recorded data.  Mesopic contrast sensitivity testing will be performed before photopic contrast sensitivity testing.  Mesopic ( 2.5 to 3.2 cd/m
2) contrast 
sensitivity with and without glare will be tested at spatial frequencies of 1.5, 3, 6 and 12 cycles per degree ( cpd) and photopic (approximately 85 cd/m
2) contrast sensitivity with glare will be 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 100 of 111 
 tested at spatial frequencies of 3, 6,  12, and 18 cpd.  Contrast  sensitivity will be assessed  twice  
for each subject at each test condition. 
 
 
13.0 SUBJECT  QUESTIONNAIRES  
The concepts to be explored in this study with the QoV and NAVQ subject questionnaires 
(each developed using patients requiring refractive correction, including cataract surgery patients) are directly related to the original concepts for which the questionnaires were developed. Results of the QoV questionnaire will find use as a secondary safety endpoint to assess subject visual disturbances (see Section 13.5.5.3).  The NAVQ is being studied as an exploratory subject survey to assess the similarity of subject-perceived near vision functional task limitations and uncorrected near visual acuity (UCNVA) for subjects in both treatment groups, without comparison between treatment groups or seeking correlations.  
 
The QoV Questionnaire  
The QoV questionnaire 23,24 will be used to provide a standardized measure of subjective 
vision symptom and will allow for subjective evaluation of visual disturbances for the IOLs of each treatment group. The QoV questionnaire is specifically a non-comprehensive collection of visual dysphotopsias evaluated by frequency, intensity, and bothersomeness that may occur within a patient group.  Items in the QoV questionnaire were developed through extensive literature r eview, discussion with subject matter experts in refractive correction, 
iterative focus groups with non-experts, cognitive interviews and evaluation with 900 subjects (150 subjects who were spectacle wearers, 150 contact lens wearers, 300 LASIK or 
LASEK or  photorefractive keratectomy  patients, 150 pre-operative cataract patients, and 150 
cataract surgery patients who received monofocal, multifocal, or accommodative IOLs). Reliability of the QoV questionnaire was obtained through Rasch analysis of person and item separation statistics for instrument precision, questionnaire fit statistics, correlation with clinical findings (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual aberrations), and test- retest 
reliability.  
23    
 The NAVQ Questionnaire  
The NAVQ
25-28 will be used as an exploratory measure of difficulties completing tasks 
requiring uncorrected near vision. Its use in this study is not intended to support labeling claims  for the enVista MX60EF IOL and is only exploratory in nature. The NAVQ use in 
this study was halted upon acceptance of version 5.0  of the #945 protocol (see footnote in synopsis ).   
 13.1  Subject Questionnaire  Instructions  
 Questionnaires should be completed independently by subjects in a private space at the 
beginning of each applicable visit, prior to other study assessments being performed.  
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 101 of 111 
 1. The QoV questionnaire 23, 24 has two main elements:  
• Ten questions, each asked for frequency, intensity, and bothersomeness of the queried 
symptom and each graded on a 4-point grading scale. 
• Seven photographs which relate to the first 7 questions.  
 
Each photograph page will be printed in color and displayed on photographic paper. The 
questionnaire is Rasch -scaled based on data derived from the original validation study. The 
questionnaire is scored across three subscales with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse quality of vision. Subjects will not be provided with any 
specific instructions other than to read the written instructions that are displayed at the top of the answer page.  No clinical staff are to help in answering the questions or respond to queries from subjects other than to ask subjects to answer as best they can.  The QoV questionnaire instructions for subjects 
will state : 
• Look at the pictures on the accompanying page that relate to the first 7 symptoms and familiarize yourself with the meaning of each symptom. 
• Now answer the questions below about your eyesight in your everyday life. 
• If you have had surgery, please respond based on how you are now, not prior to surgery. 
• Please respond based on how you feel in the past week. 
• Please circle your answer . 
2. The NAVQ
  25, 26 has 10 questions, each scored on a 5- point grading scale, and a general 
vision satisfaction question.  The NAVQ questions were developed through literature reviews, 
27 focus groups including 10 presbyopic patients, 27 refinement of the questions, 
26, 27 and test -retest reliability with 150 patients requiring vision correction, including 80 
patients receiving monofocal or multifocal IOLs. 26 Rasch analysis of the responses 
reduced the NAVQ to a 10- question data set and confirmed a 5- point grading scale was not 
different from the original 6 -point NAVQ grading scale; 28 the 5 -point grading scale is 
therefore being used in the present study.  
Verbal instructions to subjects  on how to complete the NAVQ will include  the following: 
 
• The questionnaire assesses how you feel about your current vision without additional 
near correction such as spectacles and how it allows you to function with near and intermediate tasks . 
• Please read the questions carefully and answer them as you feel is appro priate for how 
you feel – there are no right or wrong answers. If you feel a particular question in not 
applicable to your situation, please respond with the NA option, but otherwise answer 
all questions. 
• Let the coordinator know when you have finished or have any questions. 
• Please answer ALL questions for the situation IF/WHEN YOU DO THE DESCRIBED ACTIVITY WITHOUT EXTRA READING SPECTACLES.  
• Circle the relevant option.  
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 102 of 111 
 • If you do not do the described activity or you have stopped for reasons that are not 
related to your vision then please circle the ‘N/A’ option. 
Written  NAVQ questionnaire instructions will be displayed at the top of the first answer 
page and will re state:  
 
• Please answer ALL questions for the situation IF/WHEN YOU DO THE DESCRIBED 
ACTIVITY WITHOUT EXTRA READING SPECTACLES.  
• Circle the relevant option.  
• If you do not do the described activity or you have stopped for reasons that are not 
related to your vision, then please circle the ‘N/A’ option.

 Appendix C  SURGICAL PROCEDURE  
All cataract surgical procedures will be perfo rmed by a qualified Investigator , using a 
phacoemulsification system adjusted according to the surgeon's usual settings (power 
modulation should be used).  All pre -operative, operative, and post -opera tive procedures 
performed during the COVID -19 pandemic will be conducted in accordance with medical 
guidance to reduce risk of COVID -19 transmission between study staff and subjects (available 
at www.aao.org/covid-19 ).  It is recommended Investigators periodically  revisit the 
aao.org/covid-19 website to identify and implement any updated recommendations made by 
AAO.  Local, state, and federal public health guidance also will be followed, and it is 
recommended these guidances also be visited once a month to see if they have changed . 
Surgery to implant the study IOL s will be performed on Day 0 of the study for the first eye and 
Day 7 to 30 for the second eye, using standard microsurgical techniques. Surgery will be 
performed under either local or topical with or without intracameral ophthalmic anesthesia. A 
viscoelast ic (Amvisc® Plus) should be used for the procedure. If the investigator determines 
that a supplemental  ophthalmic viscoelastic device ( OVD)  is necessary, based on individual 
subject conditions or surgical circumstances, the use of a commercially available dispersive 
OVD will be permitted.   In such cases, the investigator should document the reason for use of 
a supplemental  OVD in the source document.  
  
The study lens should not be implanted if there is zonular rupture or if the anterior or posterior capsul e has been compromised, or if any complication occurs, which, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, may cause untoward effects.  
The surgical procedure will be performed as follows: 
1. The eye will be prepared for surgery and draped according to the surgeon’s standard 
procedure. 
2. Phacoemulsification and any routine adjunctive procedures will be performed according to the Investigator’s usual standard of care. 
3. A clear corneal or limbal incision of approximately 2.4 mm for a wound- assisted technique 
or 2.8 mm for direct in -the- bag placement will be made using the surgeon's standard 
instrumentation and technique.  
4. The anterior chamber will be entered through the incision opening and Amvisc® Plus  will 
be used to fill the anterior chamber . If the investigator determin es that a supplemental OVD 
is necessary, based on individual subject conditions or surgical circumstances, the use of a commercially available dispersive  OVD will be permitted.   In such cases, the investigator 
should document the reason for use of a supplemental OVD in the source document. 
5. The cataract will be extracted by phacoemulsification.  
NOTE: The study lens should not be implanted if any of the following intraoperative 
complications occur: 
• Capsulorhexis tear, iris damage, posterior capsular rupture, vitreous prolapse, or 
zonular weakness or dehiscence  
• Zonular rupture 
• Evident zonular weakness or dehiscence 
Protocol #945   
24 April 2023, Version  8.0  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 104 of 111 
 • Posterior capsule rupture 
• Vitreous loss

6. The study IOL will be removed from the vial and rinsed with sterile saline in accordance 
with the IOL instructions for use. The IOL is introduced into the eye using the BLIS IOL Injector according to inserter package insert and placed into the capsular bag.  To ensure the subject remains masked to the lens type ass igned, the Investigator and any unmasked 
surgical personnel must not verbally or visually disclose the lens type assigned. 
7. Residual viscoelastic should be aspirated from the eye using the surgeon's preferred removal technique. Care should be taken during irrigation/aspiration to ensure a thorough removal of the viscoelastic material from both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the lens. It is recommended that the irrigation/aspiration handpiece be positioned behind the posterior surface of the IOL to en sure complete viscoelastic removal.  
8. Incision closure will be left to the discretion of the Investigator.  As a routine, no suture should be required.  However, depending on the needs of the case, the cornea may be 
sutured at the Investigator’s discretion.  
9. Following completion of the surgery, topical  steroid, antibiotic and anti -inflammatory 
medications may be applied to the eye, followed by a patch or shield, per the Investigator’s standard post -operative regimen.  Additional ophthalmic medications as deemed necessary 
may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion. 
 
IOL Explantation 
The indication of IOL explantation will be made at the discretion of the Investigator if he/she 
judges it appropriate and beneficial for the safety and welfare of the subject.

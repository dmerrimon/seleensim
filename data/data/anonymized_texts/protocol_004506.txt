Name of Sponsor/Company:  
Amicus Therapeutics (Amicus)  
Name of Investigational Product:  
Migalastat hydrochloride (HCl)  
Name of Active Ingredient:  
Migalastat  
Title of Study:  
A Long- term, Open- label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacodynamics, and Efficacy of Migalastat 
in Subjects > 12 Years of Age w ith Fabry Disease and Amenable GLA Variants  
Study Centers:  Global, multicenter  
Protocol Number:  AT1001- 036 
Studied Period:  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: Fourth quarter 2019 
Estimated date last subject completed: Second quarter 2022  Phase of Development:  
Phase 3b  
Objectives:  
Primary  
• to assess the long -term safety of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects diagnosed with 
Fabry disease and who have variants in the gene encoding α -galactosidase A (α -Gal A) 
(GLA ) amenable to treatment with migalastat  
Secondary  
• to characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of migalastat in pediatric subjects diagnosed 
with Fabry disease and who have GLA  variants amenable to treatment with migalastat  
• to assess the efficacy of migalastat in pediatric subjects diagnosed with Fabry disea se and 
who have GLA  variants amenable to treatment with migalastat  
Methodology:  
This is a long- term, open- label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, PD, and efficacy 
of migalastat treatment in subjects over 12 years of age with Fabry disease and with amenable GLA  
variants. Subjects will enroll in this study following completion of migalastat Study  AT1001- 020. 
Enrollment in this study should immediately follow completion of Study AT1001- 020 in order to 
maintain the continuity of treatmen t. As appropriate, assessments performed at the End of Treatment 
visit for Study AT1001- 020 will be utilized for Visit 1 (baseline) assessments for this study.  
Subsequent visits for this study will be scheduled every 6 months with interim telephone contac ts at 
intervening 3- month intervals in order to monitor safety. In general, subjects must have completed 
Study AT1001- 020 to be eligible for enrollment in this study. However, subjects who withdrew from 
that study for a reason not related to the safety or efficacy of migalastat may be eligible to participate 
in this study upon approval by the Amicus medical monitor.  
Subjects will remain on the same dose of migalastat that they were receiving in Study AT1001- 020. If 
a subject’s weight decreases to below 43 k g, an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 to 4 weeks later in 
order to monitor the subject’s weight.

Confidential  Investigational Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Migalastat will be supplied as 150- mg capsules. Migalastat capsules contain 123 mg migalastat free 
base, which is equivalent to 150 mg migalastat HCl.  
Administration  
Migalastat will be administ ered every other day (QOD) during the treatment period. Capsules are to be 
taken with water at the same time of day during the QOD dosing schedule.  
Subjects will be instructed not to eat for at least 2 hours before and for 2  hours after administration of 
study drug. Water can be consumed during this period. 
Duration of Treatment:  
Subjects will continue on the study until the date of regulatory approval or marketing authorization for 
pediatric patients with Fabry disease and availability of reimbursed product in the participating 
subject’s country, or study termination by Amicus. Since subjects will be entering this study as they complete Study AT1001- 020, the duration of treatment will vary among subjects.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
There is no reference therapy for this study.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 
physical examinations, body weight and height , 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, 
and Tanner staging of sexual development.  
Safety endpoints are as follows:  
• incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), 
and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug  
• change from baseline in clinical laboratory test results over time  
• change from baseline in vital signs over time  
• change from baseline in physical examination findings over time  
• change from baseline in body weight and height over time  
• change from baseline in ECG results over time  
• change from baseline in echocardiogram parameters over time  
• change from baseline in Tanner Stage  
Pharmacodynamic Assessments:  
The primary PD biomarker to be evaluated in this study is lyso- Gb 3 levels in plasma. Exploratory 
evaluation of lyso- Gb 3 analogues and other potential Fabry biomarkers (non- genetic) also may be 
explored from these samples.  
The PD endpoint is change from baseline in plasma levels of lyso -Gb 3. 
Efficacy Assessments:  
Efficac y assessments include eGFR, urine protein and albumin levels, left ventricular mass index 
(LVMi) and other cardiac parameters using echocardiograms, and subject questionnaires 
(Fabry -Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire [FPHPQ], and Pediatric Q uality of Life 
Inventory™ [PedsQL™]).  
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 7 of 60  
Confidential  Efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
• change from baseline in eGFR (Schwartz formula)   
• change from baseline in urine protein and albumin levels  
• change from baseline in LVMi  
• change from baseline in FPHPQ scores  
• change from baseline in PedsQL scores  
For analysis purposes, baseline value for efficacy endpoints for subjects enrolled in this study will be 
the baseline visit of Study AT1001- 020. 
Note: Estimated GFR will be calcula ted using the Schwartz formula throughout the study, regardless of 
the subject's age at the time of assessment. For subjects ≥ 18 years of age, the Schwartz formula will be 
applied by the sponsor at the time the value is entered into the database.  
Statistical Methods:  
The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug. 
All safety and PD analyses will be performed using the safety population.  
The intent -to-treat population will include all enrol led subjects. All efficacy analyses will be performed 
using the intent -to-treat population.  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized by 
number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Discrete 
variables will be summarized by counts and percentages. In general, data will be summarized by age 
group at baseline, by sex, and combined across all subjects.

Confidential  5. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE  
5.1. Fabry Disease  
Fabry disease is a rare, progressive and devastating X -linked lysosomal storage disorder 
affecting males and females, with an estimated prevalence of 1:1 17,000 up to 1:40,000 live 
births ( Desnick, Schindler 2001;  Germain 2010;  Meikle, Hopwood et al. 1999;  Eurordis 2005). 
Newb orn screening studies have identified a higher incidence of variants in GLA , the gene 
encoding the lysosomal enzyme, α -galactosidase A (α- Gal A) ( Spada, Pagliardini et al. 2006;  
Mechtler, Stary et al. 2012), although the impact of these findings on disease prevalence has not 
been established. Disease -causing variants in the GLA  gene result in a deficiency of α -Gal A, 
which is required for glycosphingolipid metabolism ( Brady, Gal et al. 1967 ). Beginning early in 
life, the reduction in α -Gal A activity results in an accumulation of glycosphingolipids, including 
globotriaosylceramide (GL -3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosi ne (lyso- Gb3), and leads to the 
symptoms and life -limiting sequelae of Fabry disease, which include pain, gastrointestinal 
symptoms, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and early mortality 
(Germain  2010 ). Early initiation of therapy and lifelong treatment may provide an opportunity to 
slow disease progression and prolong life expectancy. 
Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age of onset, although it has 
traditionally been divided into 2 main phenotypes, “classic” and “late -onset” ( Desnick, Ioannou 
et al. 2001;  Filoni, Caciotti et al. 2010 ; Topaloglu, Ashley et al. 1999;  Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 
2002;  Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 2006;  Ishii, Chang et al. 2007). The classic phenotype has been 
ascribed primarily to males with undetectable to low α -Gal A activity and is associated with 
earlier onset of renal, cardiac, and/or cerebrovascular manifestations. The late- onset phenotype 
has been ascribed primarily to males and females with higher residual α -Gal A activity and is 
associated with later onset of di sease. Heterozygous female carriers typically express the 
late-onset phenotype, but may also display the classic phenotype depending on the pattern of 
X-chromosome inactivation. 
More than 1000 Fabry disease -causing GLA  variants have been identified (data on file). 
Approximately 67% are missense variants, resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the 
α-Gal A enzyme ( Germain 2010;  Gal, Schäfer et al. 2006). M issense GLA  variants often result in 
the production of abnormally folded and unstable forms of α -Gal A (Fan, Ishii et al. 1999;  
Ishii,  Chang et al. 2007 ) and the majority are associated with the classic phenotype 
(Filoni,  Caciotti et al. 2010;  Topaloglu, Ashley et  al. 1999;  Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 2002;  
Shabbeer, Yasuda et  al. 2006;  Ishii, Chang et al. 2007). Normal cellular quality control 
mechanisms in the endoplasmic  reticulum block the transit of these abnormal proteins to 
lysosomes and target them for premature degradation and elimination. Many missense mutant 
forms are targets for migalastat, an α -Gal A -specific pharmacological chaperone ( Yam, Zuber 
et al. 2005;  Yam, Bosshard et al. 2006;  Benjamin,  Flanagan et al. 2009).  
Note: In the Migalastat Clinical Development Program, all subjects were previously, and 
continue to be, required to have a GLA  variant that is amenable to migalastat treatment. 
Historically in Amicus documents, these variants were referred to as “mutations .” Mutation 
will be referred to as “variant” in all new or revised Amicus sponsored protocols, consistent with the guidelines of the American Medical College of Genetics and Genomics.

Confidential  5.2. Migalastat  
Migalastat, a low molecular weight iminosugar, is an analogue  of the terminal galactose of GL -3. 
Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that migalastat acts as 
a pharmacological chaperone, selectively and reversibly binding with high affinity to the active site of wild -type α -Gal A and specific mutant forms of α -Gal A ( Ishii, Chang et al. 2007), the 
genotypes of which are referred to as amenable variants. Migalastat is a precision medicine targeted specifically to patients with Fabry disease who express s pecific mutant variants of the 
GLA  gene that can be functionally restored by migalastat. Migalastat binding stabilizes these 
mutant forms of α -Gal A in the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating their proper trafficking to 
lysosomes where dissociation of miga lastat allows the now active α -Gal A to reduce the level of 
GL-3 and other substrates ( Yam, Zuber et al. 2005;  Yam, Bosshard et al. 2006;  Benjamin, 
Flanagan et al . 2009).  
The Migalastat Amenability Assay, which is compliant with Good Laboratory Practices and has been clinically validated, was developed to identify patients with variants amenable to treatment 
with migalastat. Amenable variants are those that translate to mutant forms of the enzyme and 
that show a relative increase in enzyme activity that is ≥ 1.20- fold above the baseline value and 
an absolute increase of ≥ 3.0% of wild- type at a threshold of 10 μM migalastat in the Migalastat 
Amenability Assay ( Benjamin, Delle Valle et al. 2017 ). Approximately 35% to 50% of patients 
with Fabry disease are currently estimated to have amenable variants, the majority of which are associated with the classic phenotype of the disease ( Benjamin, Flanagan et al. 2009; 
Filoni,  Caciotti et al. 2010 ; Germain, Shabbeer et al. 2002; Shabbeer, Yasuda et al . 2006).  
5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Safety Data  
5.3.1. Nonclinical Data  
Available results from single -dose and repeat -dose nonclinical studies with migalastat having a 
wide margin of safety (ie, with doses that were ≥ 25- fold higher than those used in clinical 
studies) suggest no specific hazard regarding chronic toxicity to humans, based on values for 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC), with the exception of possible transient, 
fully reversible male infertility. In addition, a 39- week  toxicity study in juvenile monkeys did not 
demonstrate a concern for toxicity, suggesting that migalastat does not induce adverse effects in 
the developing organ systems evaluated in that study. 
In nonclinical studies using hR301Q α -Gal A Tg /knockout mice, a 30- mg/kg dose of migalastat 
was found to be optimal (AUC, 18400 ng•hr/mL; Study RR1001- 08); at this dose, significant 
increases in α- Gal A activity and GL -3 substrate reduction were demonstrated across all tissues. 
At higher doses, no fur ther improvements were observed.  
Nonclinical studies also demonstrated that greater GL -3 reductions were observed with a 
regimen less frequent than daily administration, including every- other -day administration.  
In regard to safety, the pivotal chronic dosing studies utilized rats and monkeys of approximately 
6 weeks and 21 to 27 months of age, respectively, at the initiation of dosing. Developmentally, 
this corresponds to a human of approximately 12 years of age with respect to the rat, and less 
than 12 years of age with respect to the monkey ( Beck, Padgett et al. 2006 ). 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 16 of 60  
Confidential  The main finding identified with migalastat in nonclinical studies was reversible infertility in 
male rats. Full fertility returned to the previously migalastat- treated animals after a 4 week 
washout period, a period of less than a full spermatogenic cycle (> 2 months). No effects on 
sperm count, morphology, or motility were detected to account for the reduction in male fertility. 
These observations wit h migalastat, and the published information on other iminosugars 
including miglustat, strongly suggest that the infertility is due to effects on sperm maturation or 
function ( Zavesca Package Insert 2017 ). Numerous studies indicat e that these effects are related 
to sexual maturation processes that only occur after puberty, and not an adverse effect on testicular spermatogenesis. There is no indication of adverse effects on the germinal epithelium or testicular spermatogenesis that would be of particular concern for the proposed pediatric use 
of migalastat. There were also no effects on sperm motility, count or morphology in rats, and no 
changes in organ weights or pathology in the testes or accessory sex organs reported in rats, mice, or monkeys. In addition, there were also no observations suggesting that the reproductive 
effects may be mediated by endocrine disruption which also would be of importance in developing animals and relevant for the proposed use in young people. Based on these findings, the fertility effects are not considered to pose any increased risk to pediatric patients compared to 
adults. In addition, a 39- week toxicity study in juvenile monkeys did not demonstrate adverse 
effects in the developing organ systems eva luated in that study.  
5.3.2. Clinical Data  
Clinical data for migalastat are available for healthy adults, and adolescents (16 to < 18 years of 
age) and adult patients with Fabry disease.  
5.3.2.1. Pharmacology 
In adult subjects with Fabry disease and amenable variants, the  dose and regimen of migalastat 
were selected to obtain the optimal balance between  migalastat concentration and its subsequent 
clearance, in order to maximize in situ α -Gal A activity and GL -3 substrate reduction. Dose 
selection was based on findings from  nonclinical and clinical studies. Exposure observed 
following a single oral dose of migalastat hydrochloride (HCl) 150 mg in humans (AUC, 13521 ng•hr/mL) was similar to that observed after a 30- mg/kg dose in mice (see Section 5.3.1).  
In a Phase 1 repeat -dose study in healthy subjects, greater increases in wild -type α -Gal A activity 
levels were observed in white blood cells (WBCs) after oral admini stration of 150 mg 
migalastat HCl twice daily (BID) for 7 days as compared to that seen after 50 mg BID. In five Phase 2 studies, ranges of regimens and doses were explored in 27 subjects (18 males and 9 females): BID (25, 100, 250 mg), once daily (50 mg), once every other day (QOD) (50, 150, 
250 mg), and 3 days on/4  days off (250, 500 mg). In these studies, 150 mg migalastat HCl QOD 
resulted in the best balance of substrate (ie, urine GL -3) reduction and safety in subjects with 
amenable variants compared w ith other doses and regimens. Treatment with 150 mg 
migalastat HCl QOD also resulted in decreases in kidney interstitial capillary GL -3 levels and 
was associated with long- term stability of renal function. In Study FAB -CL-205, when subjects 
were switched f rom 150 mg migalastat HCl QOD to higher, less frequent doses (250/500 mg 
3 days on/4 days off), no further increases in WBC α -Gal A activity or reductions in urine GL -3 
levels were observed. Additionally, a higher incidence of treatment -related adverse events (AEs) 
was observed at the 250-  and 500- mg dose levels. On the basis of these collective data, 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 17 of 60  
Confidential  150 mg  QOD was selected as the dose and regimen for Phase 3 studies of migalastat in adults 
(ie, ≥  16 years of age).  
Migalastat is to be taken 2 hours before  and 2 hours after a meal based on 2 food- effect studies 
(Study FAB -CL-103 and AT1001- 016), which demonstrated that food reduces the bioavailability 
of migalastat as assessed using area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 
time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), and 
time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (t max) (Johnson, Mudd et al. 2015). 
Details of these studies are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
5.3.2.2. Safety  
Migalastat has a favorable safety profile in adults based on results from a comprehensive 
development program. The extent of exposure to migalastat among subjects with Fabry disease 
in Phase 2 and Phase  3 studies is approximately 595.2 patient -years, with the longest subject 
exposure in a clinical trial being 12.76 years. The subject transferred to commercial migalastat 
(Galafold®) in 2018.  
No treatment -related deaths have been reported in clinical studies, and most serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were not considered treatment -related. In Pha se 1 studies, the most frequently 
reported AE was headache. In completed Phase 2 studies in subjects with Fabry disease (Study FAB -CL-201 through Study FAB -CL-204), the most frequently reported AEs were 
headache, arthralgia, diarrhea, and nausea. In comple ted Phase 3 studies in subjects with Fabry 
disease (Study AT1001- 011, Study AT1001- 012, and Study AT1001- 041), the most frequently 
reported AEs were diarrhea, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity, nausea, fatigue, 
nasopharyngitis, dizziness, and influenza, though the order by frequency was not necessarily the same in all 3 studies.  
5.4. Study Rationale  
This is a Phase 3b, open- label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the long- term safety, 
pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of migalastat treatment i n pediatric subjects over 12 years 
of age with Fabry disease and amenable GLA  variants. The youngest pediatric subjects included 
in previous studies with migalastat were 16 years of age.  
Early signs and symptoms of Fabry disease tend to manifest during chi ldhood and adolescent 
years (ie,  < 18 years), particularly in males with the classic phenotype, and are followed later in 
life by the development of overt kidney, cardiovascular, and central nervous system complications. In the 2 largest disease registries , the Fabry Outcome Survey and the Fabry 
Registry ( Ramaswami, Whybra et al. 2006; Hopkin, Bissler et al. 2008), the median age of 
symptom onset is reported to be approximately 6 years in boys a nd 8 to 9 years in girls. 
Diagnosis is often delayed due to the different manifestations of the disease, its relative rarity, and the lack of clinical awareness of the condition, making the median age of diagnosis approximately 9 years in boys and 9 to 13 years in girls.  
Data from these Fabry disease registries indicate that the most common symptom among pediatric subjects was neuropathic pain (eg, episodic pain crises, chronic pain, and 
acroparesthesia), which was reported more frequently by boys than by girls (58.8% versus 
40.5%), and with an earlier age of onset (7 versus 9 years). The gastrointestinal tract was the 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 18 of 60  
Confidential  second most commonly involved organ system with 18% of children experiencing signs and 
symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and diarrhea); the median age at onset of symptoms was 5 years 
in boys and 9.5 years in girls. The next most common sign was skin findings such as angiokeratomas. As with neuropathic pain, these symptoms and signs were more prevalent in boys than girls and occurred at an earlier a ge of onset.  
Renal involvement appears less commonly in the younger population; however, a limited number of older adolescents have been reported to have impaired glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR), proteinuria, and hyperfiltration, along with cardiac abnorm alities, pain, and 
gastrointestinal symptoms.  
Considering the young age of symptom onset, diagnosis, and the progressive nature of Fabry 
disease, early intervention and treatment for pediatric patients could be important in slowing the 
progression of this  disease ( Hopkin, Jefferies et al. 2016). This study provides continued 
migalastat treatment for pediatric subjects previously enrolled in Study AT1001- 020, allowing 
for continued assessment of safety and efficacy in this population.  
5.5. Dose Selection  
The dose regimen of migalastat proposed for evaluation in pediatric subjects with Fabry disease (150 mg QOD) weighing ≥  45 kg (99 pounds) is the same as the adult dose and is supported by 
simulation results from a population pharmacokinetic model derived using data from adults, based on body weight (Migalastat Abbreviated Report of the Simulations of Migalastat in Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease, 20  October 2016).

Confidential  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Study Design  
This is a long- term, open -label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, PD, and 
efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects over 12 years of age with Fabry disease and 
with amenable GLA  variants. Subjects will enroll in this stu dy following completion of 
migalastat Study AT1001- 020.  
Enrollment in this study should immediately follow completion of Study AT1001- 020 in order to 
maintain the continuity of treatment. As appropriate, assessments performed at the End of 
Treatment visit for Study AT1001- 020 will be utilized for Visit 1 (baseline) assessments for this 
study.  
Subsequent visits for this study will be scheduled every 6 months with interim telephone contacts 
at intervening 3- month intervals in order to monitor safety. In general, subjects must have 
completed Study AT1001- 020 to be eligible for enrollment in this study. However, subjects who 
withdrew from the prior study for a reason not related to the safety or efficacy of migalastat may be eligible to participate in this stu dy upon approval by the  Amicus medical monitor.  
Subjects will remain on the same dose of migalastat that they were receiving in 
Study AT1001- 020. If a subject’s weight decreases to below 43 kg, an unscheduled visit will be 
arranged 2 to 4 weeks later in or der to monitor the subject’s weight.  
Subjects who are eligible and able to receive reimbursed product at the completion of Study AT1001- 020 or during the current study will be switched to Galafold, if continued 
treatment with migalastat is desired. Subjects who are unable to secure reimbursed product may 
continue treatment in the study, or via an early access or other program. Regardless of treatment 
choice, subjects may also enroll in the Fabry Registry that is being conducted under a separate 
protocol. 
7.2. Duration of Treatment 
Subjects will continue on the study until the date of regulatory approval or marketing 
authorization for pediatric patients with Fabry disease and availability of reimbursed product in 
the participating subject’s country, or study termi nation by Amicus. Since subjects will be 
entering this study as they complete Study AT1001- 020, the duration of treatment will vary 
among subjects. 
7.3. Details of Study Treatment  
Migalastat will be supplied as 150 -mg capsules. Migalastat capsules contain 123 m g migalastat 
free base, which is equivalent to 150 mg migalastat HCl.  
7.3.1. Administration of Study Treatment 
Migalastat will be administered QOD during the treatment period. Capsules are to be taken with 
water at the same time of day during the QOD dosing sche dule.  
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 21 of 60  
Confidential  Subjects will be instructed not to eat for at least 2 hours before and for 2 hours after 
administration of study drug. Water can be consumed during this period. 
Study drug should not be taken on 2 consecutive days. If a dose is missed entirely for the day, 
the subject should take the missed dose of study drug only if it is within 12 hours of the time the 
dose normally is taken. If more than 12 hours have passed, the subject should resume taking 
study drug at the next planned dosing day and time according to the every- other -day dosing 
schedule.  
7.3.2. Study Drug Interruptions  
The investigator may choose to interrupt administration of study drug in case of an AE (eg, abnormal result of an assessment or laboratory test) or for administrative reasons.  
Any inter ruption in dosing must be documented in the subject’s electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) and source medical record. The medical monitor/Clinical Project Manager should be informed as soon as possible after the decision is made to interrupt study drug for  a subject.  
7.3.3. Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed at each clinic visit through subject interview, and by 
comparing the amount of study drug that should have been taken since the last study visit with 
the amount of study drug returned. If a subject is not compliant with study drug administration, 
the investigator (in consultation with the medical monitor) will consider whether the noncompliance should warrant withdrawal of the subject from the study.  
7.4. Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant m edications, including vaccinations, and any medication taken at any time 
throughout the study must be recorded in the eCRFs, along with the reason for use, dates of 
administration, dosage, frequency, and route of administration. Medication continuing from the 
previous study also must be recorded.  
7.5. Prohibited Medications  
Use of the following medications or treatments during this study is prohibited and will result in withdrawal from the study:  
• investigational/experimental therapy  
• gene therapy  
• Enzyme replacement therapy (eg, Replagal
® [agalsidase alfa], Fabrazyme® 
[agalsidase beta])  
• Glyset® (miglitol)

8.4. Subjects of Childbearing Potential  
Female subjects of reproductive potential, and all male subjects must use a medically accepted contraceptive regimen during their partici pation in the study and for 30 days after the last dose of 
migalastat. A medically acceptable birth control method is defined as one which results in a low 
failure rate (ie, < 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. 
A female subject is considered of reproductive potential if she has functional ovaries, ducts, and 
uterus with no impairment that would cause sterility. This includes females with oligomenorrhea (even severe), and females who have just begun to menstruate.  
A female is considered of no n-reproductive potential if she is at least 26 weeks status -post 
documented surgical sterilization (includes hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or salpingectomy). 
The allowed methods of contraception described in the following text are only effective when 
used consistently, correctly, and, if applicable, in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. 
Medically acceptable m ethods of contraception for female subjects enrolled in the study include 
the following:  
• total abstinence, which refers to refraining from penile -vaginal intercourse, when this 
is the female’s preferred and usual lifestyle  
• hormonal contraception (ie, combi nation oral contraceptive pills, implant, injection, 
ring, or patch) for at least 12 weeks before baseline 
• intrauterine device that meets the < 1% failure per year rate, as stated in the product 
label, for at least 12 weeks before baseline  
• double -barrier method, defined as condom and occlusive cap (eg, diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) used in combination with spermicide (eg, foam, gel, film, cream, 
suppository)  
Note: The double -barrier method does not satisfy the requirements for an effecti ve 
method of birth control in all countries and may not be utilized as a contraceptive method by subjects participating at sites in those countries  
Medically acceptable methods of contraception for male subjects enrolled in the study include the following:  
• total abstinence, which refers to refraining from penile -vaginal intercourse, when this 
is the male’s preferred and usual lifestyle 
• surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the subject’s entry into the study

designee’s medical examination of the subject or review of the subject’s medical 
history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the  subject’s medical records.  
• double -barrier method, defined as condom and occlusive cap (eg, diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) used in combination with spermicide (eg, foam, gel, film, cream, suppository)

Any pregnancy (in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject) occurring during the study must be reported as described in Section 10.5.1. 
In the event of pregnancy in a female subject, migalastat must be discontinued immediately upon 
becoming aware of the pregnancy. Female subjects or a female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be monitored by the investigator until the outcome of 
the pregnancy is known. Both the detection and the outcome of the pregnancy must be reported 
to Amicus.  
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom -thermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Study AT1001- 036. The blood volume from baseline assessments should not be counted for subsequent years.  
9.1. Description of Study Visits  
9.1.1. Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits for medical reasons such as evaluation of AEs and/or repeat laboratory tests 
can be performed at any time at the investigator’s discretion. The date and reason for the visit, in 
addition to all information collected during the visit, should be captured in source documents and 
on the appropriate eCRFs. 
9.1.2. Baseline Visit  
Baseline assessments will be performed pre -dose on Day 1. Since subjects will be transitioning 
from a previous migalastat study, the final visit of that study will be utilized to satisfy any 
duplicate Visit 1 (baseline) procedures required for the current study. The desired intent is for treatm ent with migalastat to continue without a break. However, any subject who did not receive 
migalastat for more than 30 days will be required to repeat all Visit 1 procedures.  
All inclusion/exclusion criteria must be reviewed and verified at this visit to en sure that there 
have been no changes to a subject’s health that would affect that subject’s eligibility to participate in the study.  
9.1.3. Treatment Period Visits/Telephone Contacts  
Periodic visits are scheduled every 6 months during the treatment period (ie, a t Months 6, 12, 
etc). Telephone contacts are scheduled at 3 -month intervals in between site visits (ie, Months 3, 
9, 15, 21, etc). A month will be defined as 30 days. After the first year on study, visits will continue at 6- month intervals with interim telephone contact at intervening 3- month intervals. 
Following Month 24, the schedule of assessments as displayed in Table 2 will repeat starting with the Month 3 telephone contact (which will be Month 27). 
Telephone contacts will include questions regarding any AEs  or pregnancies (ie, including delay 
in menstrual period for female subjects with regular menses) that may have oc curred and any 
changes in concomitant medications.

Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 30 of 60  
Confidential  9.1.4. Early Termination Visit  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study should complete early termination procedures as 
soon as possible. If early termination coincides with a scheduled visit, all procedures out lined for 
the early termination visit should be performed.  
9.1.5. 30-day Safety Follow -up Visit  
All subjects, including subjects who discontinue study drug or withdraw from the study, should complete a 30 -day safety follow -up visit, to be scheduled at least 30 da ys after the last dose of 
study drug. This visit may be accomplished by a telephone contact, similar to the scheduled 
telephone contact. In these instances, in lieu of a urine pregnancy test for female subjects, 
subjects will be questioned about any pregna ncies (ie, including delay in menstrual period for 
female subjects with regular menses) that may have occurred.  
9.2. Description of Study Assessments  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule presented in T able 2. Assessments 
may be repeated if requested by the medical monitor.  
9.2.1. Medical History  
Medical history will be collected by subject interview. Additionally, medical history deemed 
related to the subject’s Fabry disease will be identified in the subject’s medical records by the 
investigator or designee for entry into the appropriate eCRF, including, but not limited to such things as past serum creatinine results.  
Since subjects will have  participated in a previous migalastat study, historical medical history 
(ie, events or conditions that had their onset at least 90 days prior to Visit 1) will be considered 
as medical history for this study. 
9.2.2. Safety Assessments 
9.2.2.1. Adverse Events and/or Seriou s Adverse Events  
Throughout the study, subjects will be given an opportunity to report AEs. The definitions, 
reporting, and monitoring of AEs and SAEs are described in Section  10. 
9.2.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
9.2.2.2.1. Safety Laboratory Tests

Safety laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory. Instructions for the collection, 
processing, and shipment of clinical laboratory samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.  
The investigator or a designee will review laboratory results and assess any out -of-range 
laboratory results as “not clinically significant” or “clinically significant.” Any results that are 
considered clinically significant may be confirme d in a repeat test at the investigator’s discretion. 
The investigator should consider repeat testing of persistent clinically significant results until the 
analyte returns to normal levels or until an etiology is determined. The investigator or a designee will sign and date all laboratory reports.  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities must be captured as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate.

Confidential  9.2.2.2.2. Other Laboratory Tests  
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential (as 
defined in Section  8.4); date of last menstrual peri od, as applicable, will be recorded during 
telephone contacts.  
Any subject who has a positive urine pregnancy test result should have a serum pregnancy test 
performed as soon as possible for confirmation. Any subject who becomes pregnant must 
discontinue study drug. Procedures for pregnancy reporting are described in Section  10.5.1.  
9.2.2.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), respiration rate, heart rate, and body 
temperature. Measurements are to be taken with the subject in a sitting or supine position after 
having rested for 5 minutes, and the same position should be used at all visits. Blood pressure should be obtained using the same arm for all measurements.  
9.2.2.4. Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will include assessment of head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, skin, thyroid, neurological system, lungs, cardiovascular system, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes, and extremities . 
9.2.2.5. Body Weight and Height  
Body weight (kg) must be measured with the subject’s shoes and clothes (except underwear) 
removed and will be rounded to 1 decimal place. The same scale should be used for individual subjects throughout the study and scales should be calibrated periodically throughout the study to ensure accuracy of measurement.  
Height (cm) must be measured with the subject’s shoes removed.  
9.2.2.6. Electrocardiograms  
A standard 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed.  
Subjects will rest for approximately 5 minutes before the ECG recording begins and will be in 
the supine position throughout the ECG evaluation. Electrocardiograms will be read centrally. Clinically significant findings not present before the start of treatmen t, which meet the definition 
of an AE, must be recorded in the eCRF.  
9.2.2.7. Echocardiogram  
Echocardiogram parameters considered for safety include left ventricular mass index (LVMi), ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular internal diameter end  diastole and end 
systole, midwall fractional shortening, and wall thickness.  
Echocardiograms will be read centrally.  
9.2.2.8. Tanner Staging  
Tanner Staging will be performed for all subjects.

Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 33 of 60  
Confidential  Because reversible infertility was noted in nonclinical studies with male rats, Tanner Staging will 
be used to assess sexual development, ie, breast development (B1 to B5) and pubic hair 
development (Ph- 1 to Ph- 5) in females and pubic hair and genital development (G -1 to G -5) in 
males (see Appendix A ).  
9.2.2.9. Concomitant Medications  and Procedures  
Subjects will be asked to report any new or changes in previously reported prescription and non-prescription medications, including dosage, frequency, and administration dates. 
Information will be entered in the eCRF and source records. Information regarding any procedures performed since the last visit will also be collected.  
9.2.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments  
Blood samples will be collecte d for measurement of lyso- Gb
3 levels in plasma, and analogues. In 
addition, to get a better understanding of early PD biomarkers for Fabry disease, samples may be 
used for exploratory cardiac biomarkers such as high sensitivity tropin and NT -proBRN. Plasma  
levels of lyso- Gb3 will be measured using a validated liquid chromatography mass spectrometry 
(LCMS) assay.  
9.2.4. Efficacy Assessments  
9.2.4.1. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate  
Estimated GFR will be calculated using the Schwartz formula according to the standards of  the 
central laboratory. Subjects who reach the age of 18 and remain on study will continue to have 
eGFR calculated by this method by the sponsor at the time the value is entered into the database.  
9.2.4.2. Urine Protein and Albumin Levels  
Protein and albumin (or microalbumin) levels in urine (as part of urinalysis) will be measured.  
9.2.4.3. Echocardiogram  
The key echocardiogram parameter considered for efficacy is LVMi. In addition, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular internal diameter e nd diastole and end systole, 
midwall fractional shortening, and wall thickness will be assessed.  
Echocardiograms will be read centrally.  
9.2.4.4. Subject Questionnaires  
All questionnaires will be provided in a separate Patient Outcomes Manual. 
9.2.4.4.1. Dosing Diary 
Subject s are to record the date and time of each migalastat administration in the Dosing Diary 
provided in the dosing wallet containing their study drug. Subjects will be asked to complete 
diary entries in order to track migalastat administration beginning on Day 1 and for the duration of the study.

Confidential  9.2.4.4.2. Fabry -Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire  
The Fabry -Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire (FPHPQ) includes questions about 
Fabry disease -specific symptoms (eg, sweating, pain, dizziness and tir edness, heat and cold 
intolerance, swollen eyelids, gastrointestinal symptoms, feeling thirsty, difficulty hearing, 
ringing or buzzing noise in the ears, and ability and enjoyment to participate in sports). The 
frequency of these symptoms will be rated usi ng a 5- point Likert scale (always, often, 
sometimes, seldom, never). Pain intensity is measured on a 10- point scale, numeric responses are 
given for onset of pain and school days missed, and yes/no questions are posed about difficulty hearing and other problems not specifically mentioned. There are 2 age -specific self -report 
versions for children 8 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years, respectively.  
9.2.4.4.3. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory  
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory
™ (PedsQL™) is a modular approach to measuring 
health -related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and chronic 
health conditions. It consists of 23 items and includes questions about physical functioning, 
emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning relative to the prior 7 days, 
using a 5- point scale. Both parents or legally- authorized representatives and subjects complete 
the appropriate version of the PedsQL independently of one another. Parents or 
legally -authorized repres entatives and subjects may self -administer the questions after 
introductory instructions are given by study site personnel.

Confidential  10. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Investigators and study site personnel are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
AEs and SAEs. For each subject, reporting of AEs and SAEs begins after written informed 
consent is provided.  
10.1. Definitions  
10.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a  pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not  
considered related to the medicinal product.  
Therefore, AEs include the following:  
• The onset of new signs, symptoms, conditions, and illnesses  
• Exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or illnesses  
• Abnormal laboratory findings deemed clinically significant by the investigator  
• Physical examination changes deemed clinically significant by the investigator  
• Abnormal medical evaluation findings (eg, ECG) that are not documented at baseline and/or, in the investigator’s opinion, represent a clinically significant change in the subject’s health during study participation 
− Baseline medical evaluation findings (eg, ECG) that were not previously provided 
as medical history and can be determined as starting before baseline, are not considered AEs and will be recorded as medical history. 
Adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF and subject’s source record beginning from the 
time written consent (assent) is provided through the follow -up visit (at least 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug).  
Subjects will be enrolling in this study following completion of Study AT1001- 020. Therefore:  
• Adverse events that are ongoing as of the last study visit of Study AT1001- 020 will 
be entered in the AE eCRF.  
− The start date recorded in Study AT1001- 020 will be the start date entered in the 
current study AE eCRF.  
− The event will be noted as continuing from Study AT1001- 020 in the current 
study’s AE eCRF.  
A single diagnos is should be entered when known. If a clear diagnosis cannot be determined at 
the time of eCRF completion and the subject’s source record entry, each sign and symptom must 
be recorded individually, until a final diagnosis is established. Conditions, signs, symptoms, etc that are present in the subjects’ medical history at baseline should only be reported as AEs if  they 
worsen (ie, increase in severity) since baseline.  
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 36 of 60  
Confidential  Adverse events that begin after the first dose of investigational product in Study AT1001- 036 
will be considered treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
10.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE occu rring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening event  
− This includes any AE that in the view of either the investigator or sponsor places 
the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization 
− Hospitalization signifies the subject has been admitted, regardless of duration, for 
observation and/or treatment that woul d not have been appropriate in a 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. 
− Hospitalizations for elective or pre -planned treatment of a pre -existing condition 
do not have to be reported as SAEs if the following criteria are met:  
− the condition is documented in the subject’s medical history and has not worsened since the informed consent form was first signed; and 
− the condition and planned procedure are documented in the subject’s source records at baseline.  
− Emergency room/department or outpatient t reatments that do not result in 
admission do not have to be reported as an SAE, unless another SAE criterion is met. Events assessed and treated in these circumstances should be captured as AEs in the eCRF and documented in the subject’s source records.  
− Hospitalizations solely based on subject logistics ( eg, subject is admitted due to 
limited hospital accessibility for what would otherwise be an out -subject 
procedure) do not have to be reported as SAEs provided that the hospitalizations are clearly defined as such in the subject’s source record.  
• persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An important medical event that does not result in one of the above serious outcomes may be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the listed serious 
outcomes. Examples of such medical events include allerg ic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 37 of 60  
Confidential  If the following 4 elements are known, the eve nt must be reported as described in Section  10.4.2:  
• identifiable subject  
• event term  
• study drug 
• identifiable reporter  
Additionally, the investigator’ s assessment of an event’s relationship to study drug 
(see Section  10.2)  is essential for Amicus to appropriately process the report and must be 
included. 
Subjects and parents or legally- authorized representatives must be informed and understand that 
they should report events meeting the definition for SAE to study site personnel as soon as 
possible (and not wait until their next study visit).  
If a non -serious event becomes serious, the change in status must be appropriately entered in the 
eCRF and the subject’s source record, and reported to Amicus as described in Section  10.4.2. 
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and considers the event possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug, the investigator should contact the medical monitor (see Table 1 ) or the Clinical Operations Lead to 
determine how the SAE should be documented and reported.  
10.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator or a medically qualified sub- investigator will review each event and assess its 
relationship to study drug based on available information and according to the following guidelines:  
• Definite: a reaction that follows a distinct temporal relationship from administration 
of study drug; that follows a known reaction to the agent or chemical group of the study drug; and that cannot be explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors  
• Probable:  a reaction that follows a reas onable temporal sequence from administration 
of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
study drug; and that could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics 
of the subject’s clinical state  
• Possible:  a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors  
• Unlikely:  a reactio n that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug; however, causality from the study drug cannot be ruled out 
• Unrelated:  a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to study dr ug 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 38 of 60  
Confidential  For the purpose of expedited SAE regulatory reporting obligations (ie, to regulatory authorities 
and Institutional Review Boards [IRBs]/Independent Ethics Committees [IECs]), events assessed 
by the investigator as definitely, probably, or possibly relat ed to study drug will be considered 
“related” to study drug (ie, associated with the use of study drug). Events assessed as unlikely or 
unrelated will be considered “not related” to study drug (ie, not associated with the use of study 
drug).  
10.3. Severity Assessment  
The investigator or a qualified sub- investigator will review each event and use the following 
definitions for rating intensity:  
• Mild: awareness of sign, symptom or event, but the AE is easily tolerated and does 
not interfere with daily activity  
• Moder ate: discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may 
warrant intervention, but the subject is still able to function  
• Severe:  incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects 
clinical status, and requires med ical intervention  
It is important to distinguish the difference between events that meet the definition of serious and 
events that are deemed as severe in intensity. Adverse events assessed as severe in intensity are 
not SAEs unless at least 1 of the definitions in  Section  10.1.2 is met. Adverse events of any 
intensity must be reported as SAEs if at least 1 definition in  Section  10.1.2 is met.  
10.4. Reporting Events  
10.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events  
Information regarding AEs is to be obtained by questioning or examining the subject and/or  
parents or legally -authorized representatives.  
As noted in Section  10.1.1, AEs will be recorded in the eCRF and subject source record 
beginning from the time written consent (assent) is provided through the follow -up visit (at least 
30 days after the last dose of study drug). Required information will be detailed in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.  
10.4.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events must be documented and reported to Amicus immediately, but no later 
than within 24 hours of  any knowledge by study site personnel of events . Serious adverse 
event reports must be faxed to the designated safety fax number ( Table 1)  to ensure appropriate 
dissemination and processing of the information. An alternate email address is provided as a backup, if the fax transmission is unsuccessful.  
Serious  adverse event forms, which will be provided by Amicus, should be as complete as soon 
as possible, and should include all information known at the time. All relevant supporting 
documentation (eg, admission and progress notes, results of diagnostic evaluati ons/procedures/ 
examinations, etc) available at the time of reporting, should be included in the fax (or email, if 
necessary) along with the SAE report form. All supporting documents must be thoroughly

Confidential  reviewed and de -identified in accordance with local da ta privacy regulations prior to sending to 
Amicus. The subject’s study number must be included on each page included in the faxed report 
or in the subject line of the email. Reporting timelines (as described above) must not be delayed while obtaining or pr eparing supporting information.  
If more than 1 SAE is identified in 1 subject simultaneously, separate SAE reports should be generated for each event.  
Information not available at the time of the initial report (eg, event end date and outcome, 
supporting documents [eg, discharge summary, etc]) must be reported to Amicus within 
24 hours of any knowledge/receipt by study site personnel  of the information . Information 
must be faxed (or emailed, if necessary) to the designated safety fax number (or email addre ss) 
(Table 1) to ensure appropriate dissemination and processing. All supporting documents must be 
thoroughly reviewed and de -identified in accordance w ith local data privacy regulations prior to 
sending to Amicus. The subject’s study number must be indicated on each page included in the fax or in the subject line of the email.  
Medical history, concomitant medication, and AE information obtained through S AE reporting 
must also be consistently recorded in the eCRF.  
10.4.3. Additional Reporting Requirements for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction  
The sponsor is responsible for processing suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs). SUSARs are also referred to as alert reports, expedited safety reports, and investigational new drug application (IND) safety reports.  
A SUSAR is defined as any SAE that is determined to be associated with the use of study drug and is unexpected (not curre ntly listed in the safety reference information or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that been observed). The sponsor will notify all investigators currently 
conducting migalastat clinical studies of all SUSARs in accordance with applicable regu lations. 
SUSARs will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs according to the 
rules in effect in each country where study sites are located:  
• If the SUSAR is fatal or life -threatening, regulatory authorities and ethics committees 
will be notified within 7 calendar days after Amicus learns of the event.  
• If the SUSAR is not fatal or life -threatening, regulatory authorities and ethics 
committees will be notified within 15 calendar days after Amicus learns of the event.  
These notificat ions will need to be filed in each site’s Study File Notebook and submitted to each 
site’s IRB/IEC in accordance with policy.  
Safety updates will be provided periodically to the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs responsible for the study according to the rules in effect in each country where study sites are located. These updates will include information on SUSARs and other relevant safety findings.

Confidential  10.5. Other Reporting Situations  
10.5.1. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy information for female subjects and female partners of male  subjects participating in 
the study is collected by Amicus. Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE (unless 
there is a suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication).  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, or if the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the subject’s participation in the study, Amicus must be informed within 5 working days of any knowledge of the pregnancy by study site pers onnel. If 
an SAE occurs in conjunction with the pregnancy, the SAE must be reported as described in Section  10.4.2. The sponsor will provide pregnan cy report forms (initial and follow -up) and 
instructions to study site personnel regarding collection of pregnancy and outcome information 
(subject to receipt of data privacy release approvals where required under local privacy laws). 
Pregnancy report form s must be faxed (or emailed, if necessary) to the designated safety fax 
number (or email) (Table  1) to ensure appropriate dissemination and processing of the 
information.  
10.5.2. Medication Errors, Including Overdose and Under Dose  
Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dispensing or administration of a study 
drug.  
If a subject experiences an overdose (defined as ≥  20% higher than the assigned dose of study 
drug for that period in the protocol) or an under dose (defined as ≥  20% lower than the assigned 
dose of study drug for that period in the protocol) during the course of the study (whether 
symptomatic or not), the Amicus’ medical monitor must be notified within 5 working days of the 
investigator or study staff first becoming aware of the overdose.  
Medication errors, including overdose and under dose, should be captured in subjects’ source records and recorded in the eCRFs. Any AE or SAE that occurs as a result of a medication error 
should be reported according to AE/SAE reporting requirements (see Section 10.4).  
10.5.3. Reporting of Possible Study  Drug Product Quality Defects  
Any defect or possible defect associated with study drug must be reported to Amicus 
(clinicalcomplaints@amicusrx.com)
 within 1 working day of any study site personnel knowledge 
of the possible defect. The study drug and packaging components in question, if available, 
must  be segregated and stored in a secure area at the site under the specified storage conditions 
(see Section  12.3.1)  until it is determined whether or not the study drug and/or packaging is 
required for investigation of the possible defect. If the possible defect is associated with an SAE, 
the SAE must be reported as described in Section  10.4.2. The SAE report must include the 
possible study drug defect complaint.

13.1. Documentation of Protocol- required Information and Study 
Findings  
For this study, eCRFs with remote electronic data capture (EDC) provided through a qualified 
third party vendor will be used. The data will be entered on the eCRFs in a timely manner on an 
ongoing basis as defined in the Data Management Plan. The investigator, or designated 
representative, should complete the eCRF pages as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that the subject is seen for an examination, treatment, or 
any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the 
final examination. All da ta must be documented separately in source records. An explanation 
should be given for all missing data. 
Details of eCRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator. The investigator 
is responsible for ensuring that data are properly re corded on each subject’s eCRFs and related 
documents. If the investigator authorizes other persons to make entries onto the eCRFs, the 
names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be documented in writing and 
supplied to Amicus.  
The co mpleted eCRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed by the investigator who 
signed the study protocol signature page to ensure that the observations and findings are recorded 
on the eCRFs correctly and completely. 
At the end of the study, eCRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained by Amicus 
and copies will be sent to the investigator to maintain as the investigator’s copy. 
13.2. Data Management  
Only data specified in the protocol will be collected as part of this study. All eCRF data will be  
entered into the EDC system and managed by a contract research organization (CRO). Additional protocol -specified data, such as laboratory and ECG data, may be collected through 
third party vendors and integrated with eCRF data by the CRO to create complet e datasets for 
analysis. All protocol -specified data will be transmitted electronically to Amicus (or the CRO).  
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable standards and data 
cleaning procedures as defined in the Data Management Plan to ensure the integrity of the data 
(eg, determining errors and inconsistencies in the data, and ensuring data are corrected by study 
site personnel or designees).  
After database lock, each site will receive their site- specific eCRF data as entered into the EDC 
system for the study in a secure electronic format, including full discrepancy and audit history. Additionally, an electronic copy of all data from the study collected at that study center will be retained by Amicus (or designee) for stora ge. 
13.3. Study Monitoring, Source Data Verification, and Onsite Audits  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or endorsed by Amicus will be followed, in compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Direct access to the onsite study documentation and sour ce documents must be ensured by the investigator.

Confidential  Monitoring will be performed by personal visits from a sponsor representative (ie, study 
monitor) who will check the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, and crosscheck them with 
source documents (see essential documents, Section  13.5). In addition to the m onitoring visits, 
frequent communications (eg, letter, e -mail, telephone, and fax) by the study monitor will ensure 
that the study is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements.  
Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the I RB/IEC, and/or an auditor authorized by 
Amicus may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study- related 
documentations for onsite audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provi de support at all times for these activities. 
Medical records and other study documents may be copied during audit or inspection provided 
that subject names, family member names, telephone numbers, and addresses are obliterated on 
the copies to ensure conf identiality.  
The investigator should contact Amicus immediately if contacted by a regulatory authority regarding an inspection or audit. 
13.4. Study Site Closure  
Upon completion or termination of the study, the study monitor will conduct site closure activities with the investigator or site staff (as appropriate), in accordance with applicable 
regulations, GCP, and Amicus or its designee’s Standard Operating Procedures. Amicus or the 
investigator has the right to close any study site at any time. The reason(s) for closure will be documented in writing. To the extent possible, premature closure would occur after mutual 
consultation. Completion or premature termination of the study will be reported by Amicus to 
the regulatory agency and by Amicus or investigator to the IRB/IEC as required by the IRB/IEC or by local regulation. Study materials must be returned, disposed of, or retained as directed by Amicus  
13.5. Records Retention  
The investigator must obtain approval in writing from Amicus before destruction of any records . 
Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of migalastat. However, because of international regulat ory requirements or 
country- specific r equirements, Amicus may request retention for a longer period. 
Prior to any decision regarding the disposal or destruction of study documents, the investigator should contact Amicus. The sponsor may request that the site take alternative actions other than disposal or destruction of study documents.

14.1.4. Posting of Information on Publicly Available Clinical Trial Registers  
The sponsor will be responsible for registering this study in a public registry that meets the requirements specified by the International Council of Medical Journal Editors, such as ClinicalTrials.gov and Eudra CT for publication of study results. Investigators contact information will be included in the study listing.  
14.1.5. Quality Control  
In accordance with applicable regulations, GCP, and sponsor  procedures, Amicus  or its designee 
will contac t the site prior to the start of the study to review with the study site personnel the 
protocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and Amicus’s or its designee’s  requirements. When reviewing data collection proc edures, the 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 53 of 60  
Confidential  discussion will include identification, agreement, and documentation of data items that will be 
recorded in the eCRF  and requirements for source documentation.  
The sponsor or its designee  will monitor the study to ensure the following:  
• data are authentic, accurate, and complete  
• safety and rights of subjects are being protected  
• study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other 
study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to allow the 
monitor direct access to all relevant documents.  
14.1.6. Quality Assurance  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, Amicus may conduct a quality assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and the regulatory 
authorities may conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during or after completion of the 
study. In the event of an assessment, audit or inspection, the investigator (and medical institutio n) must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all 
relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss the conduct of the study, any findings/relevant issues and to implement any correct ive, and/or preventative 
actions to address any findings/issues identified during the regulatory audit or inspection. 
14.1.7. Confidentiality  
Subject names (and the names of family members, telephone numbers, and addresses) will not be supplied to Amicus. A unique  subject number will be recorded in the eCRF, and if the subject 
name appears on any other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of 
the document to be supplied to Amicus. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws (eg, EU Directive 95/46/EC, EU Directive 94/45/EC, and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679). The subject and the subject’s parent 
or legally -authorized representative will be informed that represe ntatives of Amicus, IEC/IRB, or 
regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and 
that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with loc al data protection laws.  
The investigator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with the corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified.  
14.1.8. Protocols Amendments and Deviations  
Any non- administrative changes to the protocol, initiated either by Amicus or by the 
investigator, will require a formal amendment procedure. Approval of all amendments must be obtained from Amicus, relevant IEC/IRB, and regulatory authorities (in accordance with local requirements) prior to implementation.  
If a clarification on a procedure or an error is found in the protocol, a protocol clarification 
memo may be sent to all sites and the IRB/IEC before an amendment is issued. 
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 54 of 60  
Confidential  Changes to the administrative aspects of the study will not re quire formal protocol amendments 
or IEC/IRB approval, but can be treated as administrative amendments. However, the IEC/IRB 
should be kept informed of such changes. Changes in study staffing or contact information are examples of administrative changes not  requiring formal protocol amendments. 
Protocol deviations to eligibility criteria, addition or deletion of tests, dosing, duration of treatment, and/or any other  aspect of the study design that may significantly impact subject 
safety or scientific integri ty, are not permitted under GCP or by Amicus, unless necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject(s). Where Amicus and/or investigator must take 
urgent safety measures to protect the subjects from an immediate hazard, a protocol deviation may be allowed prior to obtaining approval from the relevant IEC/IRB (and/or regulatory 
authorities) according to the US CFR Title 21 Part 312.30(b)(2). In such cases, Amicus and the 
IEC/IRB must be notified within 1  business day. 
Amicus and the relevant IEC/I RB, where required by local law, must be informed of all protocol 
deviations and violations and the investigators will document such protocol deviations and violations in subject source documents  and eCRFs.  
14.1.9. Delegation of Investigator Duties  
The investigator must ensure that all persons assisting with this study are adequately qualified 
and informed about their study- related duties and functions, the protocol and any amendments to 
the protocol, and the study treatment.  
Investigators must maintain a list of sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons 
to whom they delegate significant study- related duties.  
Should the investigator delegate the supervision of the administration of the study drugs to a 
designated person, the des ignee should have the appropriate medical qualifications to effectively 
conduct or supervise any potential resuscitation procedures.  
14.2. Legal and Financial Aspects  
14.2.1. Liability and Insurance  
Liability and insurance provisions for this study are given in separate  agreements.  
14.2.2. Financial Disclosure  
Before the start of the study, the investigator will disclose to Amicus any proprietary or financial 
interests he or she might hold in the investigational products, migalastat, or Amicus as required 
by CFR Title 21 Part 54 and outlined in the financial disclosure form provided by Amicus. The investigator agrees to update this information in case of significant changes during the study and 
within 1 year of its completion. The investigator also agrees that, where required by law or 
regulation, Amicus may submit this financial information to domestic or foreign regulatory authorities in applications for marketing authorizations.  
Where required by regulation:  
• The investigator will disclose his/her financial interests to the sub jects in the informed 
consent information.  
Amicus Therapeutics   Protocol AT1001- 036 
Amendment 2 
19 August 2021 Page 55 of 60  
Confidential  • The investigator or Amicus, on behalf of the investigator, will submit the financial 
arrangements for the study to the regulatory authorities or to the IRB/IEC.  
Financial disclosures will also be provided by each  sub- investigator to whom the investigator 
delegates significant study -related responsibilities.

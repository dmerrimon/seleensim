Response:  111 
Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of extended pre-quit  varenicline therapy on smoking cessation.  112 
Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of extended pre-quit  varenicline therapy on smoking behavior and 113 
related processes prior to cessation.  114 
Aim 3: Evaluate the degree to which changes in pr e-quit smoking behavior (Aim 2) truly account 115 
for, or mediate, the impact of extended pre-qu it varenicline on smoking cessation (Aim 1).  116 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : As detailed in 117 
our administrative supplement request (EvarQuit Admin Supp Appl ication – 2020-04-21.pdf), “…to 118 
enhance this R01’s ability to inform and link to precision medi cine approaches, we propose to evaluate the 119 
role of variants in two families of genes previously associated  with varenicline concentrations, nausea, 120 
and/or smoking cessation” (select SNPs related to drug transpor t [OCT2] and nicotinic  receptor subunits 121 
[CHRNA4/CHRNB2]). 122 
1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested, if applicable. 123 
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to happen in your study 124 
that corresponds with your above listed objectives. 125 
Response:  126 
We hypothesize that extended run-in varenicline will improve bio-verified continuous abstinence 127 
rates at end-of-treatment and at long-term follow- up (6- months), compared to the standard run- 128 
in. Because extended pre-quit treatment may be particularly helpful fo r women (Becker et al., 129 
2008; Hawk et al., 2012), the study is powered to  evaluate moderation of treatment by gender. 130 
 4
Consistent with extinction theory, we predict that  the extended run-in group will exhibit greater 131 
pre-quit reductions in smoking (cigarettes per da y, CO) than the standard run-in group. Effects 132 
on other biological (cotinine, total nicotine expo sure), self-report (subjective effects of smoking, 133 
craving, withdrawal, nausea, expectancies), and behavioral (laboratory reinforcement task) 134 
outcomes will also be evaluated to better characterize potential treatment mechanisms. 135 
The extinction model predicts that the cessation be nefits of extended run-in varenicline will be 136 
explained by greater pre-quit reductions in smokin g. We will also test whether this mechanism is 137 
particularly strong among wome n (i.e., moderated mediation). 138 
2.0 Scientific Endpoints 139 
 140 
2.1    Describe the scientific endpoint(s), the main result or occurrence under study.   141 
 142 
NOTE:  Scientific endpoints are outcomes defined before the study begins to determine whether the 143 
objectives of the study have been met and to draw conclusions from the data.  Include primary and 144 
secondary endpoints.  Some example endpoints are:  re duction of symptoms, improvement in quality of life, 145 
or survival.  Your response should not be a date.   146 
Response: 147 
Our primary outcome measure (for  Aims 1 and 3) is bio-verified self-report of continuous abstinence from 148 
smoking during the final four weeks of treatment (Weeks 8-11 po st-quit, the typical  primary outcome in 149 
varenicline trials; e.g., Gonzal es et al., 2006; Hawk et al., 2 012; Jorenby et al., 2006). Continuous 150 
abstinence will also be evaluated for weeks 8-26 and 8-26 post- quit (with bio-verifi cation at 6M  visits, 151 
respectively). Secondary clinical  outcomes include rates of sid e effects and pill count measures of 152 
adherence. 153 
Our primary mediator of interest will be smoking behavior (ciga rettes smoked per day, or CPD) during the 154 
pre-quit phase of the study (Weeks -5 through -1), as reported during daily morning EMA assessments. 155 
Secondary measures for understanding the causal process include  expired-air CO and varenicline levels 156 
will also be examined, as will la boratory measures of reinforce ment, craving, withdrawal, subjective effects 157 
of smoking, and nausea. 158 
3.0 Background 159 
3.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance of the research based on 160 
the existing literature and how it will contribute to existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in 161 
current knowledge.  Include relevant preliminary findings or prior research by the investigator.  162 
Response: Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cau se of death in the US, killing an estimated 163 
480,000 people per year and linked to 1 in 3 cancer deaths. The  2014 Surgeon General’s Report (US 164 
DHHS, 2014) suggests that the consequences of smoking are even worse than previously thought. Cigarette 165 
design changes have increased the risk smoking poses for lung c ancer, and smoking is now linked to an 166 
even larger number of cancers ( including colorectal and liver).   Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that 167 
smoking increases the risk for cancer recurrence and treatment toxicity (US DHHS, 2014).  168 
Although quitting smoking markedly lowers disease risk and impr oves health (US DHHS 2014), there are a 169 
limited number of effective smoking cessation therapies, and lo ng-term cessation rates remain low. Three 170 
evidence-based pharmacotherapies are available for smoking cess ation in the US:  nicotine replacement 171 
therapy (NRT), bupropion, and var enicline. Both NRT and bupropi on approximately double the odds of 172 
long-term cessation (6 months or more) when compared to placebo  (e.g., Fiore et al., 2008). Varenicline, 173 
approved by the FDA in 2006, triples the odds of quitting compa red to placebo and outperforms single- 174 
NRT and bupropion (for a review , see Cahill et al., 2013; c.f. Baker et al., 2016). Nevertheless, long-term 175 
abstinence rates remain low, with  only 1 in 4 varenicline users  smoke free 6+ months after quitting (Cahill 176 
et al., 2013). 177 
Given the tremendous costs of smoking and the benefits of quitt ing, the development of cessation 178 
approaches with greater efficac y is critical.  The typical drug  discovery path is un likely to generate an 179 
answer. Despite enormous investm ents in evaluating numerous med ications in the decade since varenicline 180 
 5
reached the US market, “no new s moking cessation aid is nearing …FDA approval” (e.g., Rigotti, 2015). 181 
Certainly, there is nothing looki ng likely to do better than th e treatments we already  have – but that is 182 
exactly what we need. 183 
To advance clinical pr actice, we build on basic research, theor y, and compelling preliminary data from 184 
small-scale RCTs to evaluate a treatment approach that appears likely to beat our current “best in class” 185 
cessation approach, standard varen icline therapy. We take the p erspective that improved understanding and 186 
targeting of treatment mechanisms  is the best path forward (e.g ., Kraemer et al. 200 6; MacKinnon, 2008; 187 
Rigotti, 2015; TRIP, 1988). Varenicline binds to the alpha-4 be ta-2 receptor subun it of nicotinic 188 
acetylcholine receptors  (nAChR), exerting effects as both a par tial nicotine agonist, by stimulating 189 
dopamine release, and as an antagonist, by blocking the binding  of nicotine to this site. In clinical trials, 190 
varenicline robustly decreased post-cessation smoking cravings and satisfaction with cigarettes during 191 
lapses (e.g., Gonzales et al., 2006; Jorenby et al., 2006). For  varenicline, which is typically administered for 192 
a week prior to quitting and is hypothesized to work partly by reducing the reinforcing effects of smoking 193 
(e.g., Rollema et al., 2007), it is also critical to examine pr e-quit treatment mechanis ms (e.g., Cummings & 194 
Mahoney, 2008; Fiore et al., 2008; Hawk et al., 2015; Rose, 200 9, 2011; Rose & Levin, 1991).  195 
From a learning perspective, when favorable consequences of a b ehavior are removed, the behavior 196 
decreases in frequency, or is extinguished. Consistent with the  hypothesis that varenicline diminishes the 197 
reinforcing value of smoking in humans, varenicline dose-depend ently reduces self-administration of 198 
nicotine in rats (O’Connor et al., 2010; Rollema et al., 2007).  For varenicline to promote extinction in 199 
human smokers, they must continue smoking while taking the drug  in order to learn that the reinforcing 200 
effects are attenuated. The typi cal one-week run-in period for varenicline is likely insufficient, as extinction 201 
requires numerous “trials” (see B outon et al. 2012) and does no t generalize well from one situation or 202 
context to another (Bouton, 20 00, 2004a; Collins & Brandon, 200 2; see also Conklin & Tiffany, 2002).  203 
How can we effectively promote such extinction in smokers? The pioneering work of Rose et al. (1988) 204 
with the nicotine patch suggested a straightforward method: ext end the pre-quit run-in medication period to 205 
allow greater repeated natural e xposure to attenuated reinforce ment from smoking prior to the target quit 206 
date (TQD). We recently tested this approach in small-RCTs of b oth bupropion (Hawk et al., 2015 /Prelim 207 
Study 1) and varenicline (Hawk et  al., 2012 / Prelim Study 2; s ee also Ashare et al., 2012, Gass et al., 208 
2012); treatment-seeking smokers  were randomized to either a St andard run-in group (3 weeks of placebo, 209 
1 week of pre-TQD medication) or an Extended run-in group (4 we eks of pre-TQD medication); all 210 
participants received counseling and typical regim ens of post-T QD medication.  Hajek et al. (2011) 211 
conducted an independent but very similar small-scale RCT of va renicline. In all three pilot RCTs, the 212 
results were consistent with an extinction hypothesis: the exte nded run-in resulted in greater reductions in 213 
smoking rate (and tended to reduce craving and smoking satisfac tion) prior to the TQD and improved 214 
abstinence rates at short-term f ollow-up. (In both Hawk et al. studies, there was evidence that the extended 215 
run-in had a greater impact among women more than men; Hajek et  al. did not examine gender effects). 216 
Overall, the results of these th ree studies are promising, part icularly because the c ontrol condition was an 217 
approved cessation medication; in the case of varenicline, the extended run-in beat the current “best in 218 
class” treatment (standard run- in varenicline). However, the st udies were limited by their small sample 219 
sizes (Ns=60-100) and short-term follow-up (4 weeks – 3 months) .  220 
The proposed study tak es the next critical step in evaluating t he degree to which extended-run in 221 
varenicline will set a new effi cacy standard in smoking cessati on, a large-scale RCT with long-term follow- 222 
up. Thus, the primary significance of the proposed RCT is that it will, if successful, provide a marked 223 
advance in the treatment of cigarette smoking, the leading prev entable cause of death in the US. Moreover, 224 
it would do so at far less cost and far more quickly than tradi tional pharmaceutical d evelopment pathways 225 
(see Chong & Sullivan, 2007; Collins, 2011). Although every inn ovation in treatment faces challenges in 226 
bridging the science-practice gap, the proposed treatment and R CT are designed to facilitate and inform 227 
widespread dissemination and implementation (see the Introducti on to the revision), further enhancing the 228 
significance of the work. 229 
 The proposed RCT will also evaluate the mechanisms by which ex tended run-in varenicline exerts 230 
its clinical effects. This addre sses a critical split in our fi eld and gap in our knowledge – whereas most 231 
varenicline RCTs have been weak i n testing mechanisms with anyt hing other than retrospective self-report 232 
at clinic visits (e.g., Gonzales  et al., 2006; Jorenby et al., 2006; Ebbert et al., 2015), most laboratory 233 
 6
behavioral pharmacology studies of varenicline mechanisms have focused on participants who are not 234 
actively trying to quit (Mostchman et al., 2014). As in our pil ot RCT with varenicline (Hawk et al., 2012; 235 
Prelim Study 2), we will obtain b iochemical measures of changes  in smoking behavior and real-world, real- 236 
time measures of smoking reinforcement and related constructs v ia ecological momentary assessment 237 
(EMA). In addition, we have adapted laboratory paradigms from b ehavioral pharmacology to more 238 
thoroughly evaluate changes in reinforcement in the pre-quit pe riod (see Prelim Study 4). Most 239 
importantly, we will use these da ta to directly evaluate the de gree to which extinc tion of reinforcement 240 
accounts for, or m ediates, the effect of extended run-in vareni cline therapy. Our evaluation of putative 241 
treatment mechanisms will both advance knowledge and provide cl earer targets for subsequent treatment 242 
development and personalization (e.g., Kraemer et al., 2006).   Additional details are provided in the 243 
attached grant application and administrative supplement applic ation. 244

4.0 Study Design 249 
4.1 Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case-control, cross-sectional, ethnographic, 250 
experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational). 251 
Response: This study, which will be conducted 252 
over a 5-year period, will employ a two-group, 253 
balanced, randomized, double-blind, placebo- 254 
controlled parallel-group design. The research 255 
design is summarized in the Figure at right. 256

5.0 Local Number of Subjects 263 
5.1 Indicate the total number of subjects that will be enrolled or records that will be reviewed locally. 264 
Response: Participants will be 320 treatment-seeking adult smok ers (160 female). 265 
 266 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : An optional 267 
saliva sample for genetic analysis will be obtained from up to 200 of the 320 participants. 268 
5.2 If applicable, indicate how many subjects you expect to  screen to reach your target sample (i.e. your 269 
screen failure rate).  270 
Response: To accrue 320 ITT participants across 44 months, we h ave developed conservative projections 271 
for accruing 9 ITT participants per month: screening approximat ely 55 potential partic ipants by phone each 272 
month, with 50% (28) of those e ligible after phone prescreen, 5 0% (14) of those attend ing the intake visit, 273 
75% (10) of those at intake consenting and remaining eligible a fter full screening, a nd 90% (9) of those 274 
eligible ultimately achieve ITT status. 275 
2019-11 Update (approved/implemented early 2020-01):   In recent months, we have extensively 276 
reviewed our accrual process.  Accrual flow projections that we  made in the grant p roposal (e.g., 50% 277 
eligible on phone screen, 75% e ligible at intake visit) have be en accurate, with one c ritical exception.  We 278 

 7
predicted that we would lose no more than 10% of prospective pa rticipants between the intake visit and 279 
beginning treatment 1-2 weeks later (and counting as one of our  320 intent-to-treat, or  ITT, participants). In 280 
reality, we have lost more than twice that many people (21%) at  this stage. Importantly , the loss of potential 281 
participants between the intake visit and ITT disproportionatel y affects the represen tation of racial/ethnic 282 
minorities. That is, participant lo ss at this stage is 36% for people from minorities compared to 15% for 283 
non-Hispanic Caucasians.  284 
In an effort to improve the proportion of intake-eligible parti cipants who ultimately achieve ITT status, 285 
we made the following changes w ith the 2019-11 IRB modification : 286 
1. Increase remuneration for the lab visits (see Section 26.1),  which provide no clin ical benefit and last 287 
longer than clinic visits. 288 
2. Eliminate the 50% adherence requirement for the device-initi ated assessments in the Ecological 289 
Momentary Assessment (EMA ; see section 11.1). 290 
 291 
5.3 Justify the feasibility of recruiting the proposed numb er of eligible subjects within the anticipated 292 
recruitment period. For example, how many pot ential subjects do you have access to? What 293 
percentage of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? 294 
Response: Roughly 20% of adults in NY smoke, and most smokers s ay they would like to  quit. Thus, there 295 
is a large number of eligible p articipants in WNY. Indeed, our success enrolling 12 I TTs/month in a more 296 
demanding and restrictive trial (see Lerman et al., 2015) from 2011-2015 supports the feasibility of meeting 297 
our accrual target. 298

6.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 300 
6.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study sample.  301 
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion. 302 
Response:  303 
• Baseline smoking rate and CO: 304 
o Prior to 2019-11 modification: Sm oking at least 10 cigarettes p er day for the past 6 305 
months and CO >7 at intake. 306 
o Beginning with the 2019-11 modification : Smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day (CPD) 307 
for the past 6 months. (In November 2019, we noted that smoking  5-9 was the most 308 
single common reason for exclusion at phone screen. This was pa rticularly notable for 309 
people from racial and ethnic minority groups [e.g., 2% of phon e screens for non- 310 
Hispanic whites vs. 12% of phon e screens for Black/African Amer ican participants] In 311 
light of the growing number of daily smokers who smoke <10 CPD [e.g., Jamal et al., 312 
MMWR, 2018) and our desire to increase the diversity and repres entativeness of the 313 
sample, we reduced the CPD crite rion from 10 to 5. With lighter  smokers, the expired air 314 
CO criterion would be less accurate/reliable for indexing daily  smoking; therefore, it was 315 
eliminated.) Once the modifica tion is approved, we will contact  people who were 316 
previously deemed ineligible onl y because they smoked 5-9 CPD a nd offer to re-screen if 317 
they are interested.   318 
• At least moderately motivated to quit smoking (3 or 4 on phone screen; modified MTSS) and 319 
intention to make a quit attempt with varenicline 1 month after  treatment begins. 320 
• Planning to remain in western NY during the study period (intak e) 321 
• Willing to use varenicline and to  refrain from other cessation treatments and tobacco products 322 
during the study period. (intake) 323 
• Age 18-70 years. (phone screen) 324 
• Fluent English speaker (clinical judgment) 325 
• Capable of providing informed consent, which includes complianc e with the requirements and 326 
restrictions listed in the combined consent and HIPAA form (cli nical judgment) 327 
 8
• To be ITT, the participant must complete Lab Visit 1 and meet m inimal completion rate for real- 328 
world (EMA) assessments (detailed below; see also Section 6.2).  329 
• Normal or corrected vision required for study. 330

6.3 Indicate specifically whether you will include any of the following special populations in your study 382 
using the checkboxes below.   383 
 384 
NOTE:  Members of special populations may not be targeted for enrollment in your study unless 385 
you indicate this in your inclusion criteria. 386 
Response:  N/A – We will not incl ude any of the following speci al populations. 387 
☐ Adults unable to consent 388 
☐ Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenage rs) 389 
☐ Pregnant women 390 
☐ Prisoners 391 
6.4 Indicate whether you will include non-English speaking individuals in your study.  Provide 392 
justification if you will exclude non-English speaking individuals.  393 
In order to meet one of the primary ethical principles of equitable selection of subjects, non-English 394 
speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded from research as a matter of convenience. 395 
In cases where the research is of therapeutic intent or is designed to investigate areas that would 396 
necessarily require certain popula tions who may not speak English, the researcher is required to 397 
make efforts to recruit and include non-English spea king individuals.  How ever, there are studies in 398 
which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak English.  Some examples include 399 
pilot studies, small unfunded studies with validated instruments not available in other languages, 400 
studies with numerous questionnaires, and some non-therapeutic studies which offer no direct 401 
benefit. 402 
Response:  We will not include non-English speaking individuals because the study foc uses on extensive 403 
self-report measures, including 35 days of daily assessments wi th electronic reporting, that have not 404 
validated in languages other than English. 405 
 406

During the baseline lab visit, participants wi ll complete the laborato ry reinforcement task 462 
(discussed below) and will be trained in comple ting a baseline week of ecological momentary 463 
assessments (EMA; discussed below). Participants mu st attend the baseline lab visit and complete 464 
at least 40% of baseline week (E MAs) in order to continue in th e study. (Participants who do not 465 
meet these requirements can schedule one additional baseline week.) 466

9.0 Recruitment Methods 468 
 11
☐ N/A:  This is a records review only, a nd subjects will not be recruit ed.  NOTE:  If you 469 
select this option, please make s ure that all reco rds review pr ocedures and 470 
inclusion/exclusion screening ar e adequately described in other  sections.  471 
9.1 Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited.  472 
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and introducing them to 473 
the study.  Include specific methods you will use (e.g. searching charts for specific ICD code 474 
numbers, Research Participant Grou ps, posted advertisements, etc.). 475 
Response:  476 
We plan to enroll participants from January 2017 through Januar y 2021. 477 
Community participants will be recr uited primarily via radio an d television ads, intern et (e.g., Craigslist, 478 
Facebook), flyers around the co mmunity and via email list serve s, and newspaper advertisements, as in our 479 
recent large-scale tria l. We also pla n to use researchmatch.org , Urban Family Practice, and the Buffalo 480 
Research Registry.  481 
The Urban Family Practice will send a co-signed letter out to their patients, providing them more 482 
information about the EvarQuit Program. Should a person become interested in the program, they could 483 
call us for more information. Additionally, names and phone numbers of those to whom letters were sent 484 
will be provided to our team. We w ill call those participants that we have not heard fr om within 2 weeks of 485 
letter postmark date to see if they r eceived the information (f ollowing the attached script). We will only 486 
make two contact attempts by phone to each person.  487 
We will also use I2B2 in UB CTSI t o recruit participants from t he UBMD medical data base. A letter will 488 
be sent to the Physician (see a ttached letter) prior to contact ing participants (see attached letter). We will 489 
not contact prospective particip ants by phone, allowing them gr eater control over their participation.  490 
The New York State Department of  Health has approved of the New  York State Smokers Quit Line 491 
(NYSSQL) sending out letters to smokers in our region who recen tly contacted the quit line. We will not 492 
have access to any names or any contact information. We will no t be cosigning the letter. Folks who get the 493 
letter will have the option of contacting us for more informati on. 494 
A project website also allows potential participants to find ou r information and cont act us, if they are 495 
interested in being screened for  our program (s ee attached scre en shots & http://quitforgoodwny.com/ ). 496 
9.2 Describe how you will protect the privacy interests of prospective subjects during the recruitment 497 
process.   498 
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.   499 
Response: Most importantly, we  will recruit via public advertis ements so that interested participants self 500 
identify, and we will only contact participants and collect stu dy data by methods to which they have 501 
requested/consented. To enhance privacy and confidentiality dur ing the phone screen,  all phone screens 502 
will be conducted from secure offices on the third floor of Die fendorf Hall, and messages will be quite 503 
general (see phone script overview, App08-01a).  504 
9.3 Identify any materials that will be used to recruit subjects.  505 
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for telephone calls, in person announcements / presentations, 506 
email invitations.  507 
For advertisements, include the final copy of printed advertisements with your submission. When 508 
advertisements are taped for broadcast, attach the final audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may 509 
submit the wording of the advertisement prior to taping to ensure there will be no IRB-required 510 
revisions, provided the IRB also revi ews and approves the final version. 511

10.0 Procedures Involved 525 
10.1 Provide a description of all research procedures or activities  being performed and when they are 526 
performed once a subject is screened and determined to be eligible. Provide as much detail as 527 
possible.   528 
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint for your study and include enough detail so that another 529 
investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  For studies that have multiple 530 
or complex visits or procedures, consider the a ddition of a schedule of events table in in your 531 
response.  532 
Response:  Procedures. Study proc edures generally follow standa rd practice and our prior work.   533 
 534 
 Lab visits . In addition to the measures not ed in the table above, the two  lab visits include two 535 
additional procedures, describe d below.  During the baseline la b visit (L1; Week -5), participants will 536 
complete the laboratory reinfo rcement task (CBU CC; see below) a nd will be trained in completing a 537 
baseline week of EMA assessments (details below). Lab visit 2 ( L2; Week -2) is completed in the final 538 
week of the medication manipulation phase and offers clear expe rimental data regarding the impact of 539 
varenicline versus placebo on t he laboratory task (CBUCC).  540

 CBUCC. Participants will be instructed 545 
to arrive at the lab visits having not smoked 546 
since midnight; most sessions will be scheduled 547 
in the morning to provide modest overnight 548 
abstinence from smokin g (expired-air CO must 549 
be at least 40% lower than the CO obtained at 550 
intake or the session will be rescheduled). 551 
During CBUCC (Gass & Tiffany, under review), 552 
smokers are exposed to a lit cigarette, a cup of 553 
water, or a portion of highly preferred food (12 554 
trials each, counterbalanced). These stimuli are 555 
located behind a movable glass door. On each 556 
trial, smokers rate their craving in the presence 557 
of the cue and then indicate the amount of 558 
money they are willing to spend to gain access 559 
to the cue. During the task, they will be video 560 
recorded. This video recording will be used to examine behavior during the lab task via coding paradigm. . 561 
Participants are given $10 at the beginning of the procedure and told they can keep whatever 562 
amount they do not spend during CBUCC. Participan ts may spend $.01 to $.25 on each trial. The 563 
more the participants spend, the greater the prob ability that the door will be unlocked and they 564 
will be able to sample the cue on that trial (proba bilities range from 5% to  95%). At each trial, 565 
participants are shown the CBUCC choice screen. Af ter deciding how much to spend, participants 566 
are told to try to open the door. If the door is unlocked, they can sample the cue (1 cigarette puff, 567 
sip of water, or bite of food).  568 
 CBUCC generates multiple indi ces of reinforcement, including self-reported craving, the 569 
amount of real money paid for th e opportunity to puff a cigarette, latency to attempt to open the 570 
door, and actual consumption (observed puff durati on). In contrast to conventional laboratory 571 
assessments of cigarette choice in which smokers delay smoking a single cigarette in exchange for 572 
money (e.g., McKee et al., 2012), CBUCC generate s multiple indices of smoking motivation and 573 
reinforcement and does so across numerous trials . Thus, CBUCC produces very reliable estimates 574 
of these variables within a single laboratory session. Moreover, unlike conventional cigarette 575 
choice procedures, CBUCC allows us to examine the relative reinforcing value of consumable 576 
reinforcers. 577 
 Ad-Lib Cigarette, Food, and Water Period. Following CBUCC administration at L2 (not 578 
L1), we will now offer participants a brief ad-lib  consumption period. Typically, participants have 579 
at least 8 cigarettes left after CBUCC, and there is often leftover food/w ater from the procedure 580 
that is typically discarded. Participants will ha ve 15 minutes and can choose how much, if any, 581 
cigarettes, food, and water they wish to consume. During this period, they will be informed that 582 
research assistants have tasks to complete in the control room , and that they have 15 minutes to 583 
consume as much or as little as they wish. Part icipants will continue to be passively recorded 584 
during this period. We are expecting to use data fr om this period (i.e., count of cigarettes smoked, 585 
weight of food eaten, puff number /puff duration/interpuff interval of  cigarettes) as an additional 586 
naturalistic measure of consumption reinforc ement against which to measure the behaviors 587 
obtained during CBUCC. Based on the average time s of L2 observed thus far, we do not expect 588 
that this will significantly lengthen the session on  average from what is described in the consent 589 
(i.e., 2 hours). If they smoke or eat at all, they will also complete the Subjective Effects 590 
Questionnaire (same questions answered in CBUCC/on EMA).  591 
UPDATE 2020-06-12 - elimination of lab visits for remaining par ticipants: 592 
The COVID lockdown obviously too k a toll on all clinical resear ch, and now we are modestly behind 593 
in our accrual. Moreover, there i s the concern th at, as New Yor k slowly reopens, community members 594 
will be especially war y of trials such as ours because of the m any visits to campus. Finally, there’s 595 
always the possibility of additional lockdowns if COVID rebound s in the fall.  We h ave reviewed our 596 
trial components for opportunitie s to reduce the number of visi ts and amount of unnecessary exposure 597 

 14
to procedures participants might find most burdensome or concer ning – without aff ecting the overall 598 
design of the study or our ability to realize the specific aims  of the project.  599 
With the approval of our funding agency (the National Cancer In stitute), this modification requests that 600 
we eliminate the two laboratory a ssessments of smoking reinforc ement for the fo llowing reasons:  601 
- They are the two lo ngest study visits, and they are purely fo r research purposes, with no therapeutic 602 
component.  603 
- The lab task employed in these  visits requires participants t o repeatedly receive cigarettes, food 604 
samples, and glasses of water fro m the researcher. Even thought  we take all COVID-19-related 605 
precautions to reduce the risk of virus transmission, participa nts may still be concerned/distressed 606 
about the possibility of contrac ting the virus during this proc edure. 607 
- Although we value the mechanis tic data that comes from the la b visits, these data are secondary to 608 
our primary outcomes (smoking cessation outcomes, ecological mo mentary assessments (EMA), and 609 
biochemical measures of smoking exposure. The core study design  (a double-blind, placebo-controlled 610 
trial with follow-up through 6 m onths post-quit) is unaffected.  611 
Training for the EMA will be move d from Lab Visit 1 to the end of the Intake Visit. 612 
 613 
 Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA).  Daily EMA data will be co llected for 5 weeks before 614 
TQD through 4 weeks post TQD (i.e., Weeks -5 to +4) using an ap plication (app) that can be loaded onto 615 
the participants’ personal smart phone/tablet (significantly red ucing participant burden; e.g., Ginexi et al., 616 
2014) or onto a study cell phone or tablet provided to the part icipant. The app – mobile EMA (mEMA; 617 
http://mobileema.com; ilumivu, In c.) allows de-identified data (linked only to participant ID) to be 618 
synchronized with a secure serve r.  EMA training and assessment  procedures will follo w our recent work 619 
(Gass et al., 2012; Hawk et al., 2012). During the baseline lab  visit, participants will be trained on proper 620 
use of the app and will demonstrate the ability to complete bot h self-initiated assessments (questionnaires 621 
that the participant initiates, e.g., morning assessment) and d evice-initiated assessments (alerts to 622 
participant are provid ed on a pseudo-random  basis). Participant s will be informed that they will receive $1 623 
for completing each morning assessm ent and $1 for completing ea ch device-initiated assessment.  To 624 
improve adherence and reduce bur den/intrusiveness, participants  will select a 12-hour p eriod during which 625 
EMA prompts occur each day. Par ticipants will be contacted by r esearch staff ~3 days into the baseline 626 
week to review adheren ce (based on incoming synchronized data) and troubleshoot any problems. 627 
 Morning assessment . Participants will be instructed to complete the morning asses sment before 628 
smoking their first cigarette of the day and within one hour of  waking. In addition to reporting total number 629 
of cigarettes smoked during the previous day (CPD), participant s will report wake time and medication 630 
adherence on the previous day. T hey will also complete a brief measure of craving, withdrawal, or 631 
nausea/appetite. Altering the dom ain of assessment reduces both  burden and reactivity, and 632 
counterbalancing will ensure adequ ate coverage of all domains a cross the pre-quit period. At the end of this 633 
assessment, the participants will be thanked for their report a nd reminded of the remuneration earned. In 634 
our pilot work, most participants  completed far more (mean=94%)  than the 43% (3 days per week) 635 
minimum required (Hawk et al., 2012).  636 
 Device-initiated assessments . Device-initiated prompts will be  delivered 4 times per day (e .g., 637 
randomized within 3-hour blocks) to assess time since last ciga rette and two of the following four domains: 638 
subjective effects of smoking, craving, withdrawal, and nausea/ appetite (see Measures f or details).  Thus, 639 
each domain will be asse ssed up to twice per day. Counterbalanc ed presentation of domains across device- 640 
initiated assessments will maximi ze coverage of time of day and  distribution of domains across each week, 641 
while reducing participant burd en and reactivity compared to as sessing every domain in each device- 642 
initiated assessment. Sessions en d with a reminder about remune ration earned. In our pilot work, 643 
participants completed far more than the 50% minimum required ( mean = 89%; Gass et al 2012).  644 
2019-11 update:  Note that in the 2019-11 IRB m odification, we eliminated the 5 0% minimum (see 645 
also Section 6.2) for the device-initiated prompts. Review of d ata for participants alr eady screened for the 646 
study demonstrated that participants had little trouble complet ing the morning assessments. This is 647 
 15
important, as the morning assessment contains measures central to the aims of the project. The device- 648 
initiated assessments, which are  less critical to the aims of t he project, were asso ciated with greater 649 
challenges for participants, and  roughly 10% of participants ei ther had to complete a second week of 650 
baseline or never met the 50% bas eline adherence threshold and were excluded or withdrew. To more 651 
efficiently complete the trial, w e eliminated the 50% requireme nt for device-initiated assessments. We do, 652 
of course, continue to encourage and remunerate completion of t hese assessments. 653 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONA L TROUBLESHOOTING SOFTWARE: As detailed above, 654 
participants are required to complete a minimum number of EMA a ssessments during the baseline week. 655 
Even after the baseline week, mi ssed assessments reduce both th e data available to the project and 656 
remuneration to participants. Consequently, it is important to quickly resolve any problems participants 657 
have with the EMA app. To date, troubleshooting has generally r equired lengthy phone conversations 658 
and/or ad hoc participant visits  to the clinic for assistance. To minimize participant burden and more 659 
quickly address technical problems with the EMA app, participan ts will be offered (at Intake) the option 660 
install a free, HIPPA-compliant a pp (TeamViewer, https://www.te amviewer.com/en-us/) for 661 
troubleshooting. Participants h ave the option to decline having  this app installed on their device and, if it is 662 
installed, participants can remove it at any time. 663 
It will be explained to participants that, should they choose t o install the TeamViewer app: 664 
• TeamViewer allows research staff to, with the participant’s con sent, view and remotely control the 665 
participant’s smartphone for a remote troubleshooting session.  666 
• TeamViewer will only be used for troubleshooting EMA problems. During any troubleshooting 667 
session, research staff will use TeamViewer only to navigate in to the EMA app and related 668 
settings to address problems and demonstrate how to avoid furth er issues, all while the participant 669 
observes the staff member’s actions. 670 
• Staff cannot use the app without real-time consent (the partici pant must click a pop-up to start a 671

Study-Within-A-Trial (SWAT) on EMA Remuneration  – added to protocol on 2018-12-06. Pending 676 
funding from the Buffalo CTSI Pilot Studies program, we plan to  conduct a SWAT to evaluate methods to 677 
improve adherence Adherence in the current trial has not been a s strong as in the pilo t work reported above, 678 
likely in part because  the pilot study was shorter (only 5 week s of EMA instead of 9). In the current study, 679 
adherence has been strong at the outset but then dropped, with rates at their lowest during the critical 4- 680 
week post-quit period. We also observe that adherence is lower among African-Americans than among 681 
Caucasians. The goal of the SWAT is to evaluate two potential m ethods for improving adherence during 682 
the post-quit period : increased frequency of payment (from onc e every two weeks to t hree times per week) 683 
and increased amount of payment (from $1/assessment to $2/asses sment.  684 
In order to complete the EMA SWAT, over the course of a one-yea r period participants (equal 685 
numbers of male and female, and of Caucasian and African-Americ an) will be randomly assigned to each 686 
of three conditions in advance of  the TQD until we accrue 20 pa rticipants in each co ndition. At the TQD, 687 
participants in the SWAT will receive a wr itten consent addendu m. 688 
 For the three versions of the addendum, see EvarQuit Addendum –  EMA SWAT – 2018-12-06.doc. 689 
Participants randomly assigned to the standard condition would simply be informed that it is 690 
important to continue the EMA over the next four weeks. Partici pants randomly assigned to the increased 691 
frequency of payment and increased  amount of payment will have the opportunity to acce pt or decline the 692 
modified payment plan. If they decline, they will simply contin ue to participate in EVarQuit, but will be 693 
not be enrolled in the SWAT.  694 
We chose individualized addenda o ver a single broad consent for m because the SWAT will only 695 
pertain to a subset of EVarQuit participants. We considered exp laining all three conditions to SWAT 696 
 16
participants, but ultimately d ecided against it because doing s o could cause unnecessary distress to 697 
participants randomized to the standard condition (who might fe el they were ‘losing out’ even though 698 
nothing had changed).  699 
The results of the SWAT will info rm our decision of whether to alter remuneration for subsequent 700 
participants in the EVarQuit project. 701 
 Clinic visits (Weeks -4, -3, -1, 0 [TQD], 2,  and 4), randomization,  and study medication.  At Clinic 702 
Visit 1 (Week -4), participants a re randomized (within gender) to the extended or standard run-in group, 703 
complete study measures (see be low), receive brief behavioral c ounseling (see below) and study 704 
medication (details below), and are instructed to begin the med ication the next day. Subsequent study visits 705 
are similar in pro cess and content. Randomization.  The study statistician (Co-I Dr. Colder) will implement 706 
and monitor the small-urn randomization (within-gender in urns/ blocks of 8 [4 extended run-in, 4 standard 707 
run-in]), leaving remaining personnel blinded to group membersh ip. Participants are considered part of the 708 
intent-to-treat (ITT) sample once they are dispensed medication  at Clinic Visit 1 (C1). 709 
 Study medication.  At visit C1 (Week - 4), participants will be provided an initia l 1-week supply of 710 
study medication (either varenicline or identical appearing pla cebo) and instructed on use (one 0.5 mg 711 
tablet orally daily x 3 days, t hen one 0.5 mg tablet twice dail y x 4 days, then two 0.5 mg tablets twice 712 
daily). One week prior to TQD (Vi sit C3 / Week -1), participant s assigned to placebo will be switched over 713 
to varenicline with standard dos e increases during the initial week of use.  During the pre-quit period, all 714 
study medication (active & placeb o) will be dispensed as 0.5 mg  tablets. This approach was successfully 715 
used in Hawk et al. (2012) and will facilitate switching over f rom placebo to active medication while 716 
maintaining blinding.  From TQD through EOT, all participants w ill receive open-label varenicline (one 1.0 717 
mg tablet twice per day).  718 
Pfizer will provide varenicline and matching placebo for the st udy at no cost. Should this change, or should 719 
we run low on study medication between shipments from Pfizer, t he research pharmacy will produce 720 
matching opaque capsules containing varenicline (which they can  purchase in bulk) and placebo 721 
(methylcellulose), as they have done in many prior studies. 722 
 Instructions for medication us e will be reviewed at each clini c visit. Subjects will return any 723 
unused medication at the following clinic visit and will be dis pensed enough medication to last until the 724 
next visit.   725 
 EVQ2CRFs – Intake (self-report and staff) pdfs include our side  effect checklist from our previous 726 
trial, supplemented with additiona l screening using the Columbi a Suicide Severity Rating Scale 727 
(CSSSRS).  Our emphasis will be o n detecting, addressing, and r eporting symptoms that are new or 728 
increase from baseline. Consist ent with App10-02, any new or in creased suicidal ideation or behavior 729 
will be evaluated by Drs. Hawk, Tiffany, or Mahoney (all study PIs are either clini cal psychologists or 730 
physicians trained in conducting further evaluation); the study  PIs will make external (non-study) 731 
referrals for additional evaluati on or treatment as clinically indicated. 732 
 Counseling.  As in our prior work (Hawk et al., 2012),  participants will re ceive brief individual 733 
behavioral counseling at 6 clinic visits (Weeks -4, -3, -1, 0 [ TQD], 2, and 4) from counselors blind to 734 
treatment group. Pre-quit sessions focus on topics common in be havioral counseling, including honing the 735 
motivation to quit, identification of smoking triggers and trig ger management, and social support (e.g., 736 
Abrams & Niaura, 2003; Fiore et a l., 2008), without explicitly discussing extinction. However, to allow 737 
extinction to occur, we will not include active nicotine fading  as part of the counseling . Instead, participants 738 
will be asked to follow their smoking urges, smoking at least 2 5% of their baseline rate to allow their 739 
bodies time to adjust to the medication, as in prior extended p re-quit work (Hawk et al., 2012, 2015; Rose 740 
et al., 1998). In response to feedback from participants in pri or studies, we will also offer brief counseling 741 
“check-ins” by phone 1 and 7 weeks post-TQD. 742 
 App10-03a-EVQ2 Counseling SOP 2017-09-21.docx provides the Coun selor Manual and App10-03b- 743 
EVQ2 Counseling Handouts 2017-09-21.docx provides the participa nt workbook. 744 
 End-Of-Treatment (EOT) and 6-months post-TQD (6M) visits  allow for biochemi cal verification 745 
of self-reported abstinence, the  primary outcome measure. Reten tion has been strong in our prior 746 
varenicline studies (Hawk et al ., 2012; Lerman et al., 2015). C lear explanations of the importance of 747 
 17
follow-up data for clinical app lication, ongoing contact with p articipants (including reminder calls), and 748 
increased remuneration for attenda nce at EOT and 6M visits (whe n medication is no longer being provided) 749 
bolster retention, which is expect ed to be 95% at TQD, 82% at E OT, and ~75% at 6M (based on Hawk et 750 
al., 2012 and the Buffalo varenic line arm data from Lerman et a l, 2015). 751 
Update 2019-11: Retention at EOT and 6M follow-up  has been substantially lower than anticipated. We 752 
believe this is related to several inter-related factors. First , because of the EMA remuneration (up to 753 
$35/week), remuneration at Clinic Visits is much higher than in  our prior studies. Second, remuneration at 754 
EOT and 6M is actually somewhat lower than in our prior work – we did this in an effort to stay under the 755 
$600 threshold at which a 1099 would have to be issued, requiri ng participants to provide us with their 756 
SSN. We now re-balance the remuneration by shifting some remune ration from Clinic visits (which already 757 
have greater value because of t he treatment received and the EM A remuneration) to the follow-up period 758 
(see Section 26). 759 
 In addition, we have observed that  many participants do not ans wer the reminder calls for follow- 760 
up visits, and when they do not answer the phone call they are very likely (70-90%) to miss the subsequent 761 
follow-up. After extensive disc ussion with staff, and considera tion of anecdotal information from 762 
participants, we will replace th e reminder calls with brief (1- 2 questions) REDCap surveys (see App 11.1 – 763 
Template for REDCap Follow-Up Sur vey) delivered via a text mess age link to the participant’s phone. We 764 
have designed a plan we believe offers multiple advantages: 765 
1) Rather than requiring that a participant answer our phone ca ll at a specific time, participants can respond 766 
to a REDCap survey whenever they are available. Because partici pants have already completed 9 weeks of 767 
electronic assessments, this should be convenient and low-burde n. 768 
2) REDCap allows us to automate reminders to participants’ who do not respond to the initial text of a 769 
survey link. We will send up to 3 reminde rs for each survey. 770 
3) In contrast to phone calls, which could be associated with s hame or embarrassment for participants who 771 
report relapsing to smoking, the REDCap surveys allow participa nts to report electronically without direct 772 
mention of the behavior to study staff. 773 
4) Because the surveys are so brie f, we can actually have more frequent contact with participants during the 774 
follow-up period (1, 3, and 5 weeks before EOT and 4 and 8 week s before 6M follow-up), which should 775 
enhance retention rates.    776 
Participant Satisfaction Surveys (C4 and EOT) Participants will be given s atisfaction surveys at 777 
Clinic visit #4 (C4) an d the End of treatment (EOT) visits. The se surveys will be distr ibuted in an unsealed 778 
enveloped. The participant will be asked to complete the survey  on paper, in private, to answer honestly, 779 
and to seal the survey into the envelope after completion. Surv eys will be delivered t o Dr. Hawk; research 780 
assistants will not read the surv eys of their participants. The  C4 survey was not completed by those who 781 
had C4 before the 2019-05 modification. The EOT survey was mail ed to participants who completed EOT 782 
prior to approval of the 2019-05 modification. Please see Satis faction for EVQ 2019-05-02.docx.  783 
Update 2020-04 – COVID-19 impact:  Anecdotally, our smoking cessation trial participants have 784 
reported varied impact of COVID-19 on their quit smoking effort s. To more formally collect qualitative 785 
and quantitative data regarding t he impact of COVID-19, we adde d a questionnaire (App - COVID-19 786 
Quitting Questions_v3.5 - EVarQu it 2020-04-20.docx) to be admin istered once per participant. The 787 
COVID-19 questio nnaire will be assessed at  each participant's e nd-of-treatment (EOT) (remote) visit.  If 788 
the person has already passed the EOT appointment, but has not yet reached the 6-mont h visit, we will ask 789 
them to complete it at the 6-month (remote) visit. The question naire is completely optional.  The 790 
questionnaire would be employed  until the stay-at-home order is  lifted or all currently e nrolled participants 791 
reach the 6-month milestone or gov ernment-mandated social dista ncing measures are eliminated in New 792 
York, whichever is later. 793 
Update 2020-5-21 – Further assessing COVID-19 impact :  The EvarQuit project was forced to 794 
implement changes to the provision of treatment due to the COVI D-19 pandemic.  One of the primary 795 
changes involved the transition from in-person counseling to re mote counseling via Zoom software (when 796 
possible) or phone calls.  In order to understand the opinions and experiences of participants in the 797 
EvarQuit project who completed at least one at-home counseling session as a result of the COVID-19 798 
 18
pandemic, we will be conducting voluntary individual interviews  with about 25 currently enrolled 799 
participants.  The goal of these  one-on-one structured intervie ws is to improve the quality of the remote 800 
visits and enhance the subjectiv e experience of o ur participant s.  Trained research a ssistants will contact 801 
participants by phone as close a s possible following the Clinic  6 visit to introduce the interview.  If the 802 
participant agrees to the procedures and provides verbal consen t, the interview will be  audio recorded so it 803 
can be coded by independent staff members. Audio recordings, la beled only with a par ticipant number, will 804 
be stored on our secure server, and will be used to generate wr itten transcripts for qualitative analyses. We 805 
will keep the audio recording for up to 6 months as they will b e used to clarify information in the 806 
transcripts and will help to clar ify the context of information  obtained during interviews. Participant 807 
responses will remain anonymous. 808 
Update 2020-05-29:  COVID-19 -related procedural changes :  Per the UB Human Studies guidance 809 
05212020.docx, the following pro cedural changes will be impleme nted in an effort to minimize 810 
transmission of the virus: 811 
Engineering Measures:  812 
• The clinic hallway (3rd floor in  Diefendorf Hall) is approximat ely 11 ft wide; taped lines will be 813 
placed 2.5 ft from either wall all of the  way down the hallway.   People moving west to east will walk 814 
down one side of the hallway and those moving east to west will  walk down the other side of the 815 
hallway.  This will ensure that a distance of > 6ft can be main tained in the hallway at all times.  816 
• Participants typically sit in cha irs located in the main hallwa y of the clinic to wait for their 817 
appointment to start.  The chairs will be removed from the hall way and participants will be escorted to 818 
a private interview room upon arrival to the clinic.  819 
Administrative Measures:  820 
• Staff will be asked to enter the clinic using the elevator OR t he stairwell on the east end of the building 821 
and to leave using the stairwell on the west end. Staff arrival  and departure times will be staggered as 822 
well to minimize stairwell traffic.  823 
• Staff will be asked to wash their hands thoroughly and often, i ncluding immediately upon arrival, 824 
using CDC guidelines and to avoid touching their face.  825 
• Room occupancy will be limited to maintain distances of at leas t 6 feet between staff and research 826 
participants except for brief procedures (such as blood pressur e), during which staff will wear gloves, 827 
face mask, and eye protection (cons istent with UB  Human Studies  guidance 05212020.docx).  828 
• Signage outside the elevator and in the hallway will inform par ticipants regarding the above measures 829 
as well as the need to have only one person on the elevator at a given time.  830 
Prescreening of Resea rch Participants: 831 
As per the UB Human Studies guidance 05212020.docx, the followi ng will be done prior to all participant 832 
visits: 833 
During the reminder call the day before a visit: 834 
• Participants will be asked to take their temperature; if they d on’t have a thermometer, they will be 835 
asked whether they  feel feverish. 836 
• Participants will be asked about the presence of a ny COVID-19 s ymptoms including: fever, cough, 837 
shortness of breath , sore throat, muscle aches, headache, new l oss of taste or smel l, and repeated or 838 
shaking chills (as noted on page 2 of the UB Human Studies Guid ance 05212020.docx).    839 
• Anyone known to be COVID-19 positive or who exhibits COVID-19 s ymptoms will be restricted from 840 
enrollment / attending in-person  visits until symptom free and at least 14 days since date of diagnosis. 841 
For enrolled participants, remo te visits (telemedicine) will be  scheduled in the interim as the health of 842 
the participant allows.  843 
Before leaving home on the day of a visit 844 
 19
• Participants will be asked to take their temperature at home.  845 
• Participants will be asked to report any new symptoms on the da y of the visit to the project coordinator 846 
prior to coming to the clinic/lab. 847 
• Participants will be asked to w ear a face covering prior to ent ering the building; if they arrive without a 848 
face covering, a mask will be provided. 849 
Revised Visit Scheduling Enha nces Social Distancing:    850 
• To support physical distancing an d prevent congestion, intake a ppointment times will be arranged so 851 
that no more than 4 participants  are present on site at any one  time. There is ampl e space in Diefendorf 852 
to assure appropriate physical distancing with up to 8 private office spaces for participant 853 
interviews/counseling sessions.   854 
• Clinic visits will be scheduled w ith at least 15 minutes stagge ring of arrivals and departures of other 855 
participants and clinic staff, a nd allocated duration of visits  will be increased by 15 minutes to ensure 856 
time for disinfection of hard su rfaces at the conclusion of eac h visit.  857 
Consent Addendum:  A consent addendum will be emplo yed that advises participants o f all COVID- 858 
related requirements and procedu res. See Section 29.0: Process to Document Consent. 859 
Disinfection of Shared Equipment and Spaces: 860 
• Before and after each in-person appointment or use of a shared room or piece of equipment, all hard 861 
surfaces such as equipment (incl uding the shared copier), count ertops, keyboards, computer mice, 862 
office chair arms, and doorknobs will be disinfected with EPA-a pproved disinfectant wipes or spray.  863 
• A disinfecting checklist will be  placed on the door of each par ticipant room or shared space; staff will 864 
provide the date, time, and sta ff initials after each disinfect ion.   865 
• Participants will be given a pen  to use during their visit that  then will then take with them so multiple 866 
people aren’t using the same pen. 867 
Remote Study Visits : 868 
Study visits will be conducted re motely, rather than in person at UB, under the following circumstances. 869 
• If a participant reports COVID-19  symptoms or diagnosis, then r emote visits will be scheduled at least 870 
until the participant is symptom -free and it has been at least 14 days since the da te of diagnosis.  871 
• If UB determines that research p rojects cannot have in-person v isits for a period of time (for example, 872 
if there were a surge of COVID -19 cases in the area), all appoi ntments will be conducted remotely 873 
during that period of time. 874 
• Other circumstances in which stud y staff and the participant ag ree that one or more remote visits are 875 
appropriate in order to ensure uninterrupted smoking-cessation treatment 876 
• To enhance compliance with follo w-up appointments at which prim ary outcome measures are 877 
collected, these visits may be conducted remotely as well 878 
 879 
Participants will be instructed regarding the details of remote  study visits, including the need for privacy, 880 
the methods for delivery and return of study materials, and the  technology (Zoom or telephone; REDCap) 881 
for completing study visits. Informed consent for remote study visits will be obtained with the aid of the 882 
attached EVarQuit Consent Addendum – COVID-19.docx. 883 
 884 
UPDATE 2020-06-12 - ELI MINATION OF LAB VISITS FOR REMAINING PAR TICIPANTS. As 885 
noted above, due to concerns ab out enrollment, participant burd en, and perceived ppt risks, we are 886 
eliminating the lab visits for the remaining participants. 887 
 888 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS . Consistent with 889 
the administrative supplement submitted to NCI, ITT participant s will be asked to pr ovide an optional 890 
additional saliva sample for gene tic analysis. In brief, 30 min utes after eating, drinking, or smoking, 891 
 20
participants who consent to pr ovide a genetics sample will prov ide a 2 mL saliva sample using an Oragene 892 
kit (DNA Genotek, Inc.). 893 
 For participants enrolled after approval of the genetics sampl e, an overview and the consent 894 
addendum (see EVarQuit Genetics Sub-Study - Consent Addendum  -  onsite - 2020-06-30.docx) will be 895 
presented at Clinic 2 (future p articipants).  Reasons for waiti ng until Clinic 2 (as opposed to including with 896 
the initial study consent at intake) inc lude: a) Because the ma jor focus of these analyses is to better 897 
understand variability in response to varenicline, and varenicl ine is first measurable at Clinic 2, we do not 898 
wish to obtain samples from participants who are found ineligib le or withdraw prior to Clinic 2, and b) 899 
Providing the consent addendum in close temporal proximity to o btaining the sample, rather than adding 900 
the information to the already lengthy consent form at intake, should enhance participant understanding of 901 
what is required versus optional and improve understanding of t he specific issues rel ated to the optional 902 
genetics sample.  903 
 For participants who have already completed Clinic 2, an overv iew and the consent addendum will 904 
be presented at their next st udy visit (see EVarQuit Genetics S ub-Study - Consent Addendum  - onsite - 905 
2020-06-30.docx). If the participant has already completed all required study visits, st udy staff will attempt 906 
to reach the participant by ph one and/or email (see EVarQuit Ge netics Sub-Study Initial Contact – Phone 907 
and Email Scripts 2020-06-30.docx). No more than two attempts w ith each method will be made, to avoid 908 
“hounding” the participant. If th e participant is reached and e xpresses interest, or if the participant was not 909 
reached by phone/email, the fo llowing will be sent by postal ma il: 910

 - EVarQuit Genetics Sub-Study - Consent Addendum  - home - 202 0-06-30.docx 912 
Participants who return written consent to providing the sample  will be mailed stan dard DNA Genotek 913 
Oragene saliva sample kit and pr e-paid return mailer. Participa nts will be remunerate d upon receipt of the 914 
sample (see Remuneration). 915 
 916 
Regarding issues relevant to Section 2 of HRP-399 (WORKSHEET: A dditional Requirements for Genetic 917 
Testing (NY State)): 918 
• Consent will be obtained directly  from the participant (no samp les taken from deceased individuals). 919 
• As described in the consent a ddendum, samples will be stored in dependent of other participant 920 
information, making it impossible that genetic information woul d ever be incorporat ed into the records 921 
of a nonconsenting individual. 922 
• Consent for banking and additional genetic testing are explicit ly obtained in the consent addendum. 923 
• As explicitly stated in the consen t addendum:  “If you say yes now, but you change your mind later, it 924 
will not be held against you or af fect your participation in EV arQuit. You can alw ays call (716-829- 925 
2323) or email us (EVarQuit@buffalo.edu) to say that you have c hanged your mind, and the DNA 926 
sample will be destroyed.”  In suc h an event, the PI (Dr. Hawk)  will contact Dr. Tyndale at the 927 
University of Toronto to ensure the deidentified sample is dest royed. 928 
• “Family members of an individual who provided a stored tissue s ample will NOT be contacted for 929 
clinical, research, or o ther purposes without consent from the individual who provided the tissue 930 
sample with respect to the specif ic family members who will be contacted and the specific purpose of 931 
the contact.” (HRP-399) As of this version of the protocol, we do not anticipate ever contacting family 932 
members of participants  and would submit a modification in adva nce of any such contact. 933 
• “Information about an individual derived from genetic tests per formed on stored human tissue or 934 
information linking an individual with specific results of gene tic tests will NOT be released to any 935 
organization or person without the explicit written consent of the individual who donated the stored 936 
tissue to release of the informa tion for the purposes set forth  in the written consent document” (HRP- 937 
399). 938 
 21
• “DNA samples will be stored for no more than ten years in the a bsence of genetic testing, if authorized 939 
in writing by the subject. If g enetic testing will be performed  on the stored samples or samples will be 940 
stored for more than 10 years, i nformed consent will be obtaine d” (HRP-399). 941 
 942

NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long-term follow up, consider the 944 
addition of a schedule or table in your response. 945 
Response: Measures reflect the a ims of the project: evaluating the efficacy of a prom ising approach to 946 
smoking cessation (Aim 1, with a focus on abstinence at EOT and   6M), and gaining insight into the 947

NOTE:  Examples of acceptable response may be :  “A classroom setting in the Department of 1015 
Psychology equipped with a computer with relevant survey administration software,” “The 1016 
angiogram suite at Buffalo General Medical Center, a fully accredited tertiary care institution 1017 
within New York State with  badge access,” or, “Commun ity Center meeting hall.” 1018 
Response:  1019 
The proposed clinical trial will take place in Dr. Hawk’s lab o n the third floor of Diefendorf Hall at the 1020 
State University of New York at Buffalo. The third floor is sec ured with swipe card access and video- 1021 
enabled two-way intercoms for en hanced security, privacy, and c onfidentiality. Within the lab are a range 1022 
of individual rooms, each of which can be l ocked independently.  Clinical assessments and cessation 1023 
counseling are easily accommodated in the five interview rooms.  Two medical exam rooms allow a range 1024 
 23
of health-related assessments.  A  room dedicated to phlebotomy and urine toxicology i s located adjacent to 1025 
the lab restrooms; the room is e quipped with a - 5C freezer for short-term storage prior to transfer of 1026 
samples to a 17-foot -80C freezer  in the adjacent room for long -term storage. The research pharmacy has 1027 
an on-site, alarmed room for sto rage of medications, reconcilia tion and randomization procedures, and 1028 
relevant documentation. A white noise system enhance confidenti ality between assessment rooms. A 1029 
waiting room and kitchen with refreshments provide a welcome en vironment for participants, and a large 1030 
seminar room provides ample space for study overview sessions. 1031 
Dr. Hawk and project staff will have access to approximately 15  PC computers data-entry, word 1032 
processing, and clerical activitie s. All computers are on a net work with centrally-maintained backups on a 1033 
secure server that is accessible through Citrix software; the s erver is maintained by the Office of Medical 1034 
Computing.  1035 
Laboratory assessments of reinfo rcement will take place in spec ialized research space  dedicated to Dr. 1036 
Hawk in Farber Hall (Rooms 155 and 157); backup smoking labs de dicated to Co-I Dr. Tiffany on the third 1037 
floor of Park Hall may be used as a backup.  This separation of  laboratory assessments is by design; it 1038 
separates the clinical smoking cessation and the lab assessment s that involve smoking in a controlled 1039 
environment. Drs. Hawk and Tiffany have offices on both campuse s, allowing frequent interaction on the 1040 
project.  Swipe card (Hawk lab) and punch locks (Tiffany lab) s eparates the lab from hallway traffic, and 1041 
each room within the lab is also s ecured with a st andard door l ock. Each lab consists of 500+ square feet of 1042 
testing space, including two subj ect rooms and a master control  room outfitted with equipment for 1043 
complete CBUCC testing (test a pparatus, computers, monitors, mo dified response boxes, keyboards, mouse 1044 
for measuring response times w ith millisecond accuracy), refrig erators, high definition cameras in subject 1045 
rooms, and secure access to the U B Box server that will maintai n all study data. This test space is 1046 
customized with ventilation and air handling systems that isola te the rooms from the rest of the building 1047 
and allow for smoking in the test rooms with very high turnover  air exchange ventilate directly to the 1048 
exterior of the building. 1049

Principal Investigator and staff to perform the research.  When applicable describe their knowledge 1074 
of the local study sites, culture, and society.  Provide enough information to convince the IRB that 1075 
you have qualified staff for the proposed research.  1076 
NOTE:  If you specify a person by name, a change to that person will require prior approval by the 1077 
IRB.  If you specify a person by role (e.g., coordinator, research assistant, co-investigator, or 1078 
pharmacist), a change to that person will not usually require prior approval by the IRB, provided 1079 
that the person meets the qualifications described to fulfill their roles. 1080 
Response:  1081 
Co-PIs Hawk, Mahoney, and Tiffa ny will share lead ership of the study, as described in the attached grant 1082 
proposal (see Shared Leadership Plan in App00). This team has w orked together on previous clinical trials, 1083 
including the EvarQuit pilot study that led to the current tria l (e.g., Hawk et al., 2012). 1084 
Dr. Hawk  is a Professor of Psychology. H is doctoral training in clinica l health psychology provided him 1085 
with an excellent background in theory, methods, and interventi ons for a range of health behaviors, and this 1086 
expertise was enhanced by his post-doctoral fellowship in the D ivision of Behavioral Oncology at the 1087 
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.  Over the past decad e, he has developed expertise in smoking 1088 
behavior and clinical cessation tr ials; he has co nducted numero us smoking studies, including four 1089 
randomized clinical trials (RCTs;  two as Co-I, one as PI, one a s site PI), all of which included 1090 
pharmacotherapy and counseling. The two most recent trials (wit h Co-PI Mahoney) focused on an 1091 
extinction-based model, using extended pre-quit pharmacotherapy  to enhance smoking cessation; they 1092 
provide the foundation for the proposed RCT. Dr. Hawk has provi ded and supervised delivery of cessation 1093 
counseling and developed the treatment materials for the presen t study.  Beyond RCTs, Dr. Hawk has 1094 
published mechanism-oriented experimental work on the effects o f nicotine, varenicline (the medication 1095 
employed in the current proposal), and other drugs on basic rei nforcement, cognitive, and subjective 1096 
processes, as well as the role of  these basic processes on the development of substance use. Overall, he is 1097 
well-suited to serve as PI on th e current proposal to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of extended pre- 1098 
quit run-in varenicline for smoking cessation.  1099 
Dr. Mahoney  is a Professor of Oncology and Staff Physician at Roswell Park  Cancer Insitute (and has an 1100 
appointment at UB). As PI or co-investigator, Dr. Mahoney has p layed key roles in the design, successful 1101 
implementation and analyses of multiple smoking cessation clini cal trials which have relied upon a variety 1102 
of pharmacotherapies/interventions including: nicotine free cig arettes, St. John’s Wort, bupropion, a 1103 
nicotine conjugate vaccine, a nicotine liquid delivery system a nd varenicline. Together with Dr. Hawk, he 1104 
recently participated i n a multi-site cessatio n trial which use d nicotine metabolism ratios (NMR) to 1105 
randomize 1400+ smokers to either  varenicline + placebo NRT, NR T + placebo varenicline or placebo.  1106 
Dr. Tiffany  is an Empire Innovation Professor in Psychology. He brings con siderable expertise derived 1107 
from his ongoing research on the assessment of smoking and crav ing using ecological momentary 1108 
assessment (EMA) technology (including work with Drs. Hawk and Mahoney; e.g., Gass et al., 2012; 1109 
Hawk et al., 2012), processes of drug craving, the causes of dr ug dependence, the diagnosis of dependence, 1110 
adolescent drug use, and the interaction of biological and psyc hological factors in the control of addictive 1111 
behaviors. Dr. Tiffany’s craving work focuses on understanding the role of drug craving in addiction. One 1112 
of his longstanding interests is on the development and validat ion of instruments to sensitively and 1113 
accurately measure drug craving; h e has led development of wide ly used measures of alcohol, cigarette, 1114 
cocaine, and heroin craving. Dr. Tiffany has also developed and  validated multiple methods to study cue- 1115 
specific craving and, of particul ar relevance to this research,  have conducted research on the assessment of 1116 
cue-reactivity in the natural environments of cigarette smokers . Dr. Tiffany was awar ded the American 1117 
Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for Ea rly Career Contribution to Psychology in 1118 
1993, and he has served as a memb er of several NIH scientific r eview panels. 1119 
Dr. Colder , who will handle the biostatis tics and randomization for the c urrent project, is a Professor of 1120 
Psychology at UB.  He has activ ely studied developmental models  of psychopathology and adolescent 1121 
 25
substance user for over 20 years.  Dr. Colder has been Principa l and Co-Investigator on multiple NIH 1122 
funded longitudinal studies that span infancy to young adulthoo d.  Dr. Colder’s  background also includes 1123 
extensive training in quantitativ e methods, such as hierarchica l linear models, structural equation modeling, 1124 
growth modeling, mixture modeling, and testing moderation and m ediation. Dr. Colder and Dr. Hawk have 1125 
co-authored numerous publications from several collaborative st udies at UB over the past 10 years. 1126 
Jennifer Adams , M.S.W., Research Coordinator, ha s worked for several years wi th Drs. Hawk and 1127 
Mahoney on another large smoking cessation trial. Ms. Adams is familiar with the proposed assessments 1128 
and procedures and will oversee a ll day-to-day aspects of the p roposed study. She is a lready assisting with 1129 
the development of the current  IRB proposal and is familiar wit h UB IRB procedures, monitoring/reporting 1130 
of side effects and adverse events. Ms. Adams, an M.S.W. with e xtensive experience in smoking cessation 1131 
trials, will assist with implementation and training on psychia tric screening and cessation counseling. She 1132

 1141 
Describe other resources available to conduct the research.  1142 
14.2 Describe the time and effort that the Principal Investigator and research staff will devote to 1143 
conducting and completing the research. 1144 
NOTE:  Examples include the percentage of Full Time Equivalents (FTE), hours per week.  The 1145 
question will elicit whether there are appropriate resources to conduct the research. 1146 
Response: Larry Hawk, Ph.D., Principal Investigator, (1.8 acade mic months and 1.8 summer months in all 1147 
years). Dr. Hawk will be responsible for the scientific and tec hnical direction of the p roposed research. He 1148

use of ecological momentary assessment. RSSs will work with the  Coordinator to implement the daily 1184 
operations of the study, including data entry, maintaining supp ly levels, and respond ing to data queries. 1185 
14.3 Describe the availability of medical or psychologica l resources that subjects might need as a result 1186 
of anticipated consequences of the human research, if applicable. 1187 
NOTE:  One example includes: on-call availability of a counselor or psychologist for a study that 1188 
screens subjects for depression. 1189 
Response: Study staff will be a vailable by phone during normal business hours, and they will have prompt 1190 
access to Co-PIs Hawk (a clinical  psychologist) and Mahoney (a physician) for clinical  issues that arise in 1191 
the course of smoking cessation w ith varenicline, as in our pri or trials.  As in ou r prior work, we will 1192 
provide participants with contact information and reminder card s and, when appropriate, referrals for 1193 
resources external to the focus of the project. 1194 
14.4 Describe your process to ensure that all persons a ssisting with the research are adequately informed 1195 
about the protocol, the research procedures, and their duties and functions. 1196 
Response: All staff will be provi ded with copies of the grant p roposal. Study protocols are provided in 1197 
binders in the relevant rooms, a nd training of study staff will  include direct observation of mock 1198 
procedures, followed by supervision in real patient interaction s.  Duties will be documented in a 1199 
continuously updated delegation log that will be signed by the staff member whenever there is a change. 1200 
15.0 Other Approvals 1201 
15.1 Describe any approvals that will be obtained prior to commencing the research (e.g., school, 1202 
external site, funding agency, laboratory, radiation safety, or biosafety). 1203 
Response:  1204 
☒  N / A :   This study does not require any other approvals. 1205 
 1206 
16.0 Provisions to Protect the  Privacy Interests of Subjects 1207 
16.1 Describe how you will protect subjects’ privacy in terests during the course of this research. 1208 
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.  Privacy applies 1209 
to the person.  Confidentiality refers to how data collected about individuals for the research will be 1210 
protected by the researcher from release.  Confidentiality applies to the data.   1211 
Examples of appropriate responses include:  “participant only meets with a study coordinator in a 1212 
classroom setting where no one can overhear”, or “the participant is reminded that they are free to 1213 
refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering.”   1214 
Response: Above (sections 9 and 12) we describe how we will pro tect subjects’ privacy  interests during the 1215 
recruitment and consent phases . Throughout the research process , we respect participan t’s rights to refuse 1216 
to complete any assessment and to  withdraw from the study at an y time, thus giving them control of 1217 
 27
information access to themselve s.  (When appropriate, we will r emind participants that refusal to complete 1218 
assessments may lead the study i nvestigators to withdraw the pa rticipant from the trial.) 1219 
Many of the measures will be sel f-administered, so participants  will directly enter their responses into a 1220 
computer/tablet/smartphone without the interviewer seeing their  responses.  This increases privacy and 1221 
reduces potential discomfort. 1222 
Participants will meet individually with study investigators an d staff in private offices ; privacy is enhanced 1223 
by the swipe card security sys tem (limiting access) and the whi te noise system (reducing concerns about a 1224 
conversation being overheard). 1225 
UPDATE 2020-05-29: COVID-19: 1226 
For remote visits during the COV ID-19 pandemic, the use of tele medicine technology (Zoom; telephone 1227 
calls), we will advise participan ts to attend the visit in a pr ivate setting. Zoom mee tings will be password- 1228 
protected, and a telephone (aud io-only) option will be availabl e. 1229 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONA L TROUBLESHOOTING SOFTWARE: As noted above, 1230 
participants will have the option to download the TeamViewer ap p to assist with EMA app troubleshooting. 1231 
The purpose of this software is to allow research staff to navi gate to the EMA app and its settings to 1232 
address problems more quickly and remotely so participants are less likely to miss assessments which could 1233 
negatively impact their study eligibility and payment. The Team Viewer software will not be used for any 1234 
other purposes beyond addressing problems with the EMA app. Sta ff will not access private information on 1235 
the participant phone, such as photos, email, or texts messages , nor will they access functions such as the 1236 
phone’s camera. Partic ipants have the option to decline having this app installed on their device. 1237 
Additionally, the TeamViewer app r equires the participant to ac tively consent to a troubleshooting session 1238 
by clicking a pop-up to allow access each time research staff r equests a remote access session. The 1239 
participant can also end the remote session at any time. 1240 
16.2 Indicate how the research team is permitted to acce ss any sources of information about the subjects.   1241 
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:   school permission for review of records, 1242 
consent of the subject, HIPA A waiver.  This question does apply  to records reviews. 1243 
Response: Consent of the subject. 1244 
17.0 Data Management and Analysis 1245 
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures.  This section applies to both 1246 
quantitative and qualitative analysis.  1247 
Response:  1248 
Our primary outcome of interest (Aims 1 and 3) is smoking cessa tion, a dichotomous variable indicating 1249 
bio-verified (cotinine ≤15 ng/ml) self-report (TLFB) of continu ous abstinence from smoking assessed at 1250 
end-of-treatment (weeks 8-11 post-quit) and long-term follow-up  (weeks 8-26 post-quit). We also propose 1251 
to examine potential mechanisms  of treatment effects, and our p rimary mediator of interest will be a 1252 
continuous variable representing percent reduction in smoking b ehavior (CPD from daily EMA 1253 
assessments) during the pre-quit phase of the study ([Week -5 C PD minus Week -1 CPD] / Week -5 CPD). 1254 
Our proposed analyses and power estimates focus on these primar y measures.   1255 
We focus above on percent reduction in CPD during the pre-quit period (from Week -5 to Week -1) 1256 
because this measure is both feas ible to assess in clinical pra ctice and is emphasized in prior work on pre- 1257 
quit pharmacotherapy (Hajek et al ., 2011; Hawk et al., 2012, 20 15; Rose et al., 1998). Indeed, some have 1258 
suggested that achieving a 50% pre-quit reduction in smoking ma y be a clinically useful target (e.g., Rose 1259 
& Behm, 2013), a hypothesis that  could be evaluated in suppleme ntary analyses. 1260 
In addition, our assessment strate gy will allow us to examine t he time course of changes during the pre-quit 1261 
period in ways that may inform both theory and practice. This i s true for reductions in CPD as well as the 1262 
other proposed mediators.  In prior work with small samples, ex tended run-in varenicline had, on average, a 1263 
gradual impact on smoking and cra ving (Ashare et al., 2012; Haj ek et al., 2011; Hawk et al., 2012; Poling 1264 
et al. 2010). We will explore th ese trajectories at the group l evel but also consider individual differences in 1265 
 28
change. For example, even among participants with comparable ov erall reductions in smoking, it is 1266 
important to determine the degree to which abstinence is associ ated with a marked early  decline in smoking 1267 
(which may reflect a s tronger blockade of reinforcement by pre- quit varenicline) or a more gradual 1268 
reduction in smoking across the pre-quit period (which would al low more extinction “trials” to occur). 1269 
Consideration of additional measures of key constructs. Similar ly, we plan to explore models of patterns of 1270 
change across multiple pre-quit variables that are proposed med iators and their relation to smoking 1271 
outcome. Of particular interest is whether we can identify a gr oup characterized by a decline in smoking 1272 
during the pre-quit pe riod that is accompanied by declines in s moking satisfaction and/or craving. If the 1273 
mechanism of the extended run-in operates as we hypothesize, th is pattern should be more likely in the 1274 
extended run-in than the standar d run-in treatment group and be  predictive of abstinence.  Such analysis 1275 
would involve growth mixture modeling to identify groups based on trajectories of smoking, smoking 1276 
satisfaction, and craving during the pre-quit phase. Our team h as extensive experience to extend our 1277 
proposed analysis to growth modeling and growth mixture modelin g (Colder et al., 2002, 2006, 2013, 1278 
2014; Trucco, Wright, & Colder, 2014). 1279 
In addition, we will ha ve a rich data set to examine a variety of alternative outcomes and potential 1280 
mediators and moderators; examples are provided below. An advan tage of our study is that it includes 1281 
multiple measures of smoking intake (CPD, CO, COT and 3HC) and additional measures relevant to 1282 
reinforcement and ex tinction (subjective effects of smoking; la boratory-based indices of the relative 1283 
reinforcement from cigarettes, f ood, and water), and measures o f alternative (though not mutually 1284 
incompatible) mechanisms of treat ment effects such as craving, withdrawal, and naus ea. This provides 1285 
broad coverage of the variables that are both theoretically rel evant and empirically supported as key 1286 
processes in abstinence and relapse. Another advantage of our s tudy is that we have assessed many of our 1287 
variables using multiple methods.  To maximize conceptual clari ty and reduce the number of statistical 1288 
tests, we will use confirmatory factor analysis, including Mult itrait-Multimethod Measurement Models  1289 
(MTMM, Kenny & Kashy, 1992) when appropriate, to inform constru ction of within-domain composites 1290 
and/or selection of a subset of secondary measures for analysis . For each of the aims, it will also be 1291 
important to consider a range of potential moderators and covar iates, such as degree of nicotine 1292 
dependence, NMR, age, education, and treatment outcome expectan cies.   1293 
Primary analyses. Most of our ana lyses will be done in Mplus an d SAS (Proc Mixed and Proc Glmmix), 1294 
both of which are very flexible and can handle continuous, cate gorical, and non-normal  data, and allow for 1295 
the inclusion of cases  with missing data.  1296 
Aim 1 . We hypothesize that bio-verified continuous abstinence rates at end-of-treatment and at long-term 1297 
follow-up will be greater in the extended run-in group compared  to the standard run-in group.  Logistic 1298 
regression will be used to test this aim.  Abstinence will be r egressed on treatment group (a binary 1299 
indicator).  Given evidence that extended pre-quit varenicline will be particularly helpful for women (Hawk 1300 
et al., 2012), we will include ge nder and the gender x treatmen t interaction to evaluate the hypothesis that 1301 
gender moderates the impact of varenicline run-in duration.  1302 
Aim 2 . We hypothesize that the exten ded run-in group will exhibit gr eater pre-quit reductions in smoking 1303 
(percent reduction in CPD, as we ll as decreases in biochemical measures), as predicted by an extinction-of- 1304 
reinforcement framework. Each h ypothesized mediator will be reg ressed on treatment group (a binary 1305 
indicator) using regression models appropriate for the nature o f the mediator.  As in Aim 1, gender and the 1306 
gender x treatment group interac tion will be included in the mo del. Comparable models will evaluate pre- 1307 
quit changes in other candidate mediators (withdrawal, craving,  subjective effects of smoking, nausea, and 1308 
behavioral measures of smoking, food, and water reinforcement f rom the laboratory CBUCC paradigm).  1309 
Together, these analyses provide critical information about the  degree to which run-in group differences in 1310 
smoking reduction reflect smoking-specific changes in reinforce ment and related constructs, such as 1311 
reinforcer devaluation (i.e., from nausea). In addition to thei r conceptual and theoretical significance, a 1312 
clearer understanding of treatme nt mechanism may be important f or predicting success prior to quitting, 1313 
thereby allowing adjustments to treatment to prevent patients f rom experiencing a failed quit attempt (e.g., 1314 
Rose et al., 2013) and providing precise targets to further enh ance treatment effectiveness. 1315 
Aim 3 .  We hypothesize that changes in pre-quit smoking behavior (i. e., percent reduction in CPD during 1316 
the pre-quit period) will mediate the effect of extended pre-qu it varenicline on smoking cessation. This aim 1317 
will be tested with a path mode l whereby treatment will predict  pre-quit reduction in smoking (a continuous 1318 
 29
variable), which in turn, will predict smoking abstinence.  Sep arate models will be estimated for abstinence 1319 
at EOT and 6M follow-up.  Base line levels of smoking will be in cluded as a statistical control variable. 1320 
Bootstrapped indirect effects with asymmetrical confidence band s will be used to t est the proposed 1321 
mediational path (MacKinnon 20 08). We will also evaluate whethe r gender moderates this mediated path 1322 
(moderated mediation, P reacher et al., 2007). 1323 
17.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis.   1324 
NOTE:  This may not apply to certain types of  studies, including chart/records reviews, survey 1325 
studies, or observational studies.  This question is asked to elicit whether the investigator has an 1326 
adequate sample size to achieve the study objectives and justify a conclusion.  1327 
Response: Altho ugh our analyses will u tilize methods to handle missing data (e.g., full-information 1328 
likelihood estimation; Enders & Bandalos, 2001), we conservativ ely estimated power b ased on N=320 ITT 1329 
participants and attrition estimat ed to be 5% at TQD, 18% at EO T, and 25% at 6-M (based on our 1330 
varenicline data from Hawk et al., 2012 and Lerman et al., 2015 ).  Our power estimat es are based on an 1331 
alpha level of .05 and adequate power considered ≥ .80. For the  main effects of treatment run-in group on 1332 
outcome (Aim 1) and hypothesized m ediators (Aim 2), power was c omputed using Proc Power in SAS 1333 
based on effect size estimates fr om Hawk et al. (2012) and Haje k et al. (2011); treatment run-in group 1334 
effect sizes are expected to be i n the range of small to medium  for Aim 1 (Odds ratios 1.3 to 2.3) and Aim 2 1335 
(f2 .05 to .12). Our proposed sam ple will provide adequate powe r to detect these effects.  For gender 1336 
interactions in Aims 1 and 2 and  all effects in Aim 3, we estim ated power using Monte Carlo simulations 1337 
estimated in Mplus (Muthén, & Muthén, 2002) with 10,000 replica tions and parameter s taken from our 1338 
pilot study (Hawk et al., 2012). Our monte carlo simulation sug gested adequate power to detect the 1339 
proposed gender x treatment interactions, with minimal bias in the regression coefficients and 1340 
corresponding standard errors (bias < 3%). For Aim 3, our Monte  Carlo simulation suggested adequate 1341 
power to detect the proposed med iational pathway (collapsing ac ross gender) with minimal bias in the 1342 
estimated indirect effect and corresponding standard error (bia s < 2%).  Furthermore, our Monte Carlo 1343 
simulation suggested adequate power to detect the gender x trea tment interaction predicting the proposed 1344 
mediator, and the proposed indirect effect for women with minim al bias for these effects and the 1345 
corresponding standard errors (bias < 1%).  Hence, we have adeq uate power to detect moderated mediation. 1346 
Please note that our power calcu lations are unusually strong in  that all effect size estimates were based on 1347 
existing data, rather than hypoth etical estimates , which we bel ieve provides greater  confidence in our 1348 
calculations. 1349 
17.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data. 1350 
Response:  As part of the data a nd safety monitoring process, t he team will ensure that all  fields are 1351 
completed appropriately, and a ll corrections are done according  to Good Clinical Pr actice (GCP). Any 1352 
inconsistencies/deviations will be documented. The Study Physic ian will review inclusion/exclusion data 1353 
for each participant, documenti ng reviews of each  report. The P roject Manager will conduct quality control 1354 
reviews of data on an on-going basis. 1355 
 1356 
18.0 Confidentiality 1357 
 1358 
A. Confidentiality of Study Data  1359 
 1360 
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of confidentiality of study data and any records that will be 1361 
reviewed for data collection .   1362 
 1363 
18.1 A.  Where and how will all data and records be stored?  Include information about:  password 1364 
protection, encryption, physical controls, authorization of access, and separation of identifiers and data, as 1365 
applicable.  Include physical (e.g. paper) and electronic files. 1366 
Response:  1367 
 30
Paper-based records, including source documents and an original  consent form, will be maintained in 1368 
locked filing cabinets in 306/307/308 Diefendorf Hall; keys are  maintained in a safe in the office of the 1369 
project-coordinator.  1370 
All participants will be assigned a numeric code. Electronic as sessments and data management will be set 1371 
up on secure web-based programs: https://ilumivu.com/solutions/ecological-momentary-assessment-a pp/ 1372 
for daily EMA assessments and RED Cap for electronic case report  forms and overall project data 1373 
management system. RedCap will temporarily be implemented throu gh the University of Rochester CTSI. 1374 
Due largely to the newness of our CTSA, UB does not have extens ive RedCap suppor t. UB CTSI COO 1375 
Mary Sienkiewicz connect ed us with the U of Rochester CTSI (Car rie Irvine) for support. The websites are 1376 
all HIPPA-compliant, have an SSL  certificate (Secure Sockets La yer, a cryptographic protocol that 1377 
provides communication security over the Internet), and use https  (Hypertext Transfer  Protocol Secure, a 1378 
widely used communications protocol for secure communication ov er a computer network, with especially 1379 
wide deployment on the Internet). No identifying information wi ll be included in web-based electronic data 1380 
files. 1381 
Local computer files (such as the recruitment database and a fi le linking identifying information with each 1382 
participant’s unique numeric c ode) will be maintained on a secu re, password-protected  UB server subject to 1383 
regular backup. Files will be acce ssible only by study investig ators and staff. The videos will be stored 1384 
(labeled only with ID# ) in a password prot ected database, behin d an electronic firewall, and will only be 1385 
accessed by the research team. 1386 
UPDATE 2020-05-29 – COVID-19: 1387 
For any remote visits, all assessments will be labeled with the  numeric code representin g the participant ID; 1388 
they will not be labeled with the  participant’s name or other P II. 1389 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONA L TROUBLESHOOTING SOFTWARE:  During remote 1390 
troubleshooting sessions, resea rch staff will document, for qua lity improvement purposes, basic 1391 
smartphone information (e.g., model, operating system), the nat ure of the problem reported by the 1392 
participant, steps taken to resolve the problem, and whether th ey were successful. No  other information or 1393 
data will be collected. According  to the TeamViewer privacy pol icy, during remote access the software 1394 
uses “…end-to-end encryption t echnology. This means that TeamVi ewer will not be awar e of the content 1395 
and subject matter of such exchan ges.” The TeamViewer software will collect and process information 1396 
during remote access connection in cluding “a Session ID, a meet ing ID, and the start and end times of your 1397 
session.” No personal information is collected by the TeamViewe r app during remote access sessions. 1398 
18.2 A.  How long will the data be stored? 1399 
Response:  Records containing identifying information will be s tored for 3 years after completion of the 1400 
project; they will then be destroyed.   1401 
As described in our grant pro posal (App00), we  will follow the NIH mandate for data-sharing. Our data- 1402 
sharing plan is consistent with  the 2015 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Sharing C linical Trial Data: 1403 
Maximizing Benefits, Minimizing Risk (National Academies Press) ; we plan to make the full de-identified 1404 
analyzable data set with metadat a available through the Nationa l Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program 1405 
(NAHDAP) within 18 months of st udy completion.  NHADAP is a NID A-funded platform for data sharing.  1406 
As recommended by NHADAP, we will work with NHADAP staff to beg in the data-sharing plan prior to 1407 
beginning data collection so that maximal study data are availa ble to the public without compromising 1408 
participant protections. NAHDAP h as a standard data deposit for m and required list of files 1409 
(http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/NAHDAP/deposit/inde x.html ). The data deposit includes a 1410 
standard procedure for ensuring participant protections (includ ing NAHDAP recoding or dropping 1411 
variables that might compromise confidentiality). 1412 
18.3 A.  Who will have access to the data? 1413 
Response: Access to source documents and identifying informatio n will be limited to project investigators 1414 
and staff.  1415 
18.4 A.  Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data? 1416 
Response: Study inves tigators and staff. 1417 
 31
18.5 A.  How will the data be transported? 1418 
Response:  N/A  Data will not be physically transported. 1419 
B. Confidentiality of  Study Specimens 1420 
 1421 
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of confidentiality of study specimens .   1422 
☐ N/A:  No specimens will be collected o r analyzed in this research.   1423 
(Skip to Section 19.0)  1424 
 1425 
18.6 B.  Where and how will all specimens be stored?  Include information about:  physical controls, 1426 
authorization of access, and labeling of specimens, as applicable.   1427 
Response: Urine samples will be u sed immediately for on-site dr ug and pregnancy screening and then 1428 
discarded. 1429 
As in our recent trial, and saliv a samples will be collected in  Diefendorf 329 by the Nurse/Phlebotomist.  1430 
Samples labeled with unique ide ntifiers will be stored in Diefe ndorf 330 (which has both a key lock and an 1431 
alarm), in a -80C fr eezer until batch shippe d to the University  of Toronto for analysis, as detailed in App00.  1432 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 –OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS :  1433 
As stated in the consent addendu m:  “To protect your confidenti ality, the DNA sample will be stored 1434 
without any identifyi ng information, just an identification num ber. That number will be different from the 1435 
code used to identify other data you provide in the EVarQuit pr ogram. An electronic master list linking 1436 
your DNA identification number t o your EVarQuit participation n umber will be password-protected and 1437 
stored securely, separate from your other information.”  1438 
As with our other saliva sample s (for cotinine and varenicline concentrations), the saliva sample for genetic 1439 
analysis will be assayed in the l aboratory of Rachel Tyndale, P h.D., at the University of Toronto.  To 1440 
protect participant confidentia lity, Dr. Tyndale will not have access to any participant data except the 1441 
uniquely coded samples. 1442 
 Samples are obtained, labeled, tr ansferred, stored, and shipped  according to detailed protocols. see 1443 
App10.3-03- Saliva_Collection_PNAT_120111-1_UB.pdf. 1444 
18.7 B.  How long will the specimens be stored? 1445 
Response: All specimens will be d estroyed after completion of a ssays described in the protocol/grant or 1446 
within one year of completion of the project, whichever comes f irst. 1447 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 –OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : Dr. Tyndale’s 1448 
lab will store the genetic samples  for up to 10 years for futur e analysis for a ll participants who consent to 1449 
banking. 1450 
18.8 B.  Who will have access to the specimens? 1451 
Response: PIs, project coordinator, study nurse/phlebotomist, a nd any other staff member trained in sample 1452 
acquisition or shipping. 1453 
18.9 B.  Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the specimens? 1454 
Response: PIs, project coordinator, study nurse/phlebotomist, a nd any other staff member trained in sample 1455 
acquisition or shipping. 1456 
18.10  B.  How will the specimens be transported? 1457 
Response: Specimens will be shipp ed via overnight on dry ice, a s in our previous trials.  1458 
19.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data t o Ensure the Safety of Subjects  1459 
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects, or is limited to record s review procedures only.  This 1460 
section does not apply. 1461 
 32
 1462 
NOTE:  Minimal risk studies may be required to mo nitor subject safety if the research procedures 1463 
include procedures that present unique risks to su bjects that require monito ring.  Some examples 1464 
include:  exercising to exertion, or instruments that elicit suicidality  or substance abuse behavior.  In 1465 
such cases, N/A is not an acceptable response. 1466 
 1467 
19.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to 1468 
determine whether subjects remain safe. 1469 
Response: In this single-site t rial, all participants receive v arenicline (Chantix) fo r its approved use, 1470 
smoking cessation.  1471 
Participant safety is a priority. The safety of individual part icipants will be assessed at  each clinic visit, and 1472 
aggregate data will be r eviewed annually by the study team and by the IRB. 1473 
We will use a two-tiered system t o assess potential side effect s and adverse events. At each clinic visit, 1474 
participants will complete an esta blished checklist of symptoms  and an open-ended evaluation for potential 1475 
adverse events. Study staff will be trained to follow the proce dures in App10-02 to trigger timely reporting 1476 
of side effects and potential AE s to the Study P hysician. Parti cipants will also be given information 1477 
(verbally and in a reminder wallet card) regarding how to conta ct the study personnel and under what 1478 
circumstances to proceed to the emergency department. At any ti me, participants will have the option to 1479 
stop taking the study medication and can drop out of the study if they desire. In addition, if any adverse 1480 
event requires treatment and follow-up, participants will be pr ovided with appropriate  referrals. The Study 1481 
Physician will determine the cour se of action for the subject r eporting a serious a dverse event (e.g., 1482 
discontinuing medication, dose adjustment). The PI or Study Phy sician/Clinical Research Nurse will 1483 
clinically follow all subjects wh o are discontinued due to a se rious adverse event until the event is resolved. 1484 
In accordance with NIH  and IRB guidelines, this study will empl oy the following mechanisms for adverse 1485 
event reporting: 1) al ert the site IRBs of any and all reports of serious adverse events; 2) inform all 1486 
members of the study team of any and all reports of serious adv erse events; and 3) notify NIH of any 1487 
actions taken by IRBs with regar d to data safety monitoring.  D etailed procedures are  formalized in App10- 1488 
02. 1489 
Although we considered establishing a formal DSMB, this does no t appear to be warranted for the current 1490 
single-site trial that employs varenicline for its approved ind ication, smoking cessation. However, we do 1491 
plan to summarize and review rat es of side effects, adverse eve nts, and efficacy data – all blind to treatment 1492 
condition – as part of  each renewal applica tion to the IRB.   1493 
19.2 Describe what data are reviewed, including safety data, untoward events, and efficacy data. 1494 
Response: Standard assessments o f side effects, detailed record s of adverse events, a nd overall rates of 1495 
smoking cessation. 1496 
19.3 Describe any safety endpoints. 1497 
Response: Standard assessments o f side effects, detailed record s of adverse events. 1498 
19.4 Describe how the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study visits, by 1499 
telephone calls with participants). 1500 
Response: With case report forms at study visits. 1501 
19.5 Describe the frequency of safety data collection. 1502 
Response: At all 6 clinic visits , which occur at 1- to 2-week i ntervals in the first 2 months of treatment. 1503 
19.6 Describe who will review the safety data. 1504 
Response: As detailed in App10-02 , study staff will review side  effect reports at each study visit; standard 1505 
decision rules are used to trigger reporting to the PI/Study Ph ysician within 24 hours (often within 1506 
minutes).  1507 
19.7 Describe the frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data. 1508 
 33
Response: Annually. 1509 
19.8 Describe the statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm is occurring. 1510 
Response: N/A.  The base rates of serious adverse events are to o small to be detected b y statistical tests in 1511 
the proposed sample size. 1512 
19.9 Describe any conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the research. 1513 
Response: Given the nature of th e trial, it is h ard to foresee conditions that would lead to immediate 1514 
suspension of the research. Howe ver, we would seek IRB input to  consider immediate suspension if there 1515 
were more than 2 SAEs (Codes 3 and 4 in App10-02) determined to  be probably/definitely related to study 1516 
participation during a single calendar month. 1517 
 1518 
20.0 Withdrawal of Subjects 1519 
☐ N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects.  This section does not apply. 1520 
 1521 
20.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be withdrawn from the research 1522 
without their consent. 1523 
Response: As described in th e informed consent document: 1524 
Can I be removed from the research without my OK? 1525 
The principal investigator of the study can remove you from the  research study without your approval. 1526 
Possible reasons for removal include: 1527 
• The Principal Investigators feel it is necessary for your healt h or safety. Such an action would not 1528 
require your consent, but you wou ld be informed if such a decis ion was made and the reason for this 1529 
decision. 1530 
• You have not followed program requirements.  1531 
• The Sponsor, University, or Investigators have decided to stop the program.  1532 
20.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination.   1533 
NOTE:  Examples may include return of study drug, exit interview with clinician.  Include whether 1534 
additional follow up is recommended for safety reasons for physical or emotional health. 1535 
Response:  PI or designee will attempt to inform participants ( by phone; if unable to contact, then by postal 1536 
service) of the reason for with drawal. No additional follow-up is necessary; however, in some situations it 1537 
may be reasonable to provide alte rnative referral information, as discussed in other sections of the protocol.  1538 
20.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including 1539 
retention of already collected data, and partial withdrawal from procedures with continued data 1540 
collection, as applicable. 1541 
Response: As described in App10 -02:  “For all side effects that  require attention, t he site physician, 1542 
qualified medical staff and PI w ill determine a course of actio n (i.e., continuation and monitoring, dose 1543 
reduction, subject withdrawal).  All side effects that are consi dered a Serious Adverse Event (see below) 1544 
will be reported to PIs and IRBs …, as well as to the FDA and N IH (see below for protocol for adverse 1545 
event reporting)… PIs and Study Physicians will determine if an y serious adverse event requires additional 1546 
care. Such events may be referred to the out-patient department  … or to the emergency department … 1547 
(…have access to 24-hour emergency  services, including extensiv e in-patient and out-patient services for 1548 
psychiatric conditions).” 1549 
 1550 
UPDATE 2020-06-30 – OPTIONAL SALIVA SAMPLE FOR GENETIC ANALYSIS : As also noted 1551 
in Procedures and explicitly sta ted in the consent addendum:  “ If you say yes now, but you change your 1552 
 34
mind later, it will not be held a gainst you or affect your part icipation in EVarQuit. You can always call 1553 
(716-829-2323) or email us (EVarQuit@buffalo.edu) to say that y ou have changed your mind, and the 1554 
DNA sample will be destroyed.”  In  such an event, the PI (Dr. H awk) will contact Dr . Tyndale at the 1555 
University of Toronto to ensure the deidentified sample is dest royed. 1556 
 1557 
21.0 Risks to Subjects 1558 
21.1 List the reasonably foreseeable risks,  discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the subjects related 1559 
to their participation in the research. Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic 1560 
risks.  Include a description of the probability, ma gnitude, duration, and reve rsibility of the risks.  1561 
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data. 1562 
Response: The potential risks to  participants, and their likeli hood and seriousness, are described below. 1563 
Participants can choose, as an a lternative, to not enroll in th is study. Overall, there  is minimal risk for 1564 
serious adverse reactions as a consequence of enrolling in this  study.  1565 
Assessments. Subjects may experience emotional distress during assessments from discussing feelings and 1566 
attitudes about smoking or from learning about the risks from s moking. These events happen very rarely 1567 
and in almost all cases are shor t-lived and of low intensity, l asting for 1-2 weeks. Study personnel will be 1568 
alerted to expect this from a sm all number of subjects and will  be trained to make referrals for mental 1569 
health services as needed. Person nel will be trained to query f or adverse emotional reactions during 1570 
assessments and will be trained t o deal with such reactions and  to provide additional re ferrals if needed. In 1571 
addition, if assessments indicate psychiatric concerns, referra ls to appropriate psychological services will 1572 
be provided. 1573 
Withdrawal symptoms following ce ssation. Most participants will  experience some nicotine withdrawal 1574 
upon quitting. Symptoms include craving, anxiety, irritability,  problems concentrating, appetite change and 1575 
weight gain, and insomnia. Becau se all subjects will use vareni cline, withdrawal s everity should be 1576 
reduced. Moreover, withdrawal symptoms typically decrease marke dly within 1-2 weeks. Study counseling 1577 
will advise participants of these symptoms and discuss methods to cope with them. 1578 
Varenicline.  In clinical trials , the most common side effects of Chantix include:  nausea, sleep problems 1579 
(trouble sleeping, changes in dr eaming), constipation, gas, and  vomiting.  Chantix may also contribute to 1580 
difficult sleeping, vivid, unusua l, or strange dreams. Particip ants will be informed of the need to use 1581 
caution driving or operating mach inery until they are comfortab le with how Chantix might affect them.  1582 
Chantix should not be used with other quit-smoking products.  1583 
Some people have had reported changes in behavior, including ho stility, agitation, depressed mood, 1584 
suicidal thoughts or actions while using Chantix to help them q uit smoking, with these symptoms 1585 
developing when they began tak ing Chantix, and on occasion afte r several weeks of treatment or even after 1586 
stopping Chantix. Participants will be counseled on these poten tial risks and encourag e to contact us if they 1587 
and/or their family/friends notice agitation, hostility, depres sion, or changes in behavior, thinking, or mood 1588 
that are not typical, or if they develop suicidal thoughts or a ctions, anxiety, panic, a ggression, anger, mania, 1589 
abnormal sensations, hallucinations, paranoia, or confusion.  1590 
Varenicline also carries “warni ngs and precautions” regarding c ardiovascular events, interactions with 1591 
alcohol, seizures, and accidental  injury. Varenicline may be as sociated with an increas ed risk of certain 1592 
cardiac and vascular side effects, including chest pain, heart attack, and stroke.  These risks are rare and are 1593 
still being studied to determine how real they ar e.  However, o ur study staff follows strict procedures to 1594 
monitor for the presence of thes e side effects, including monit oring blood pressure at each in person visit 1595 
and asking specific side effect questions related to cardiovasc ular events (e.g. chest pain, weakness on one 1596 
side, etc) during each telephone session.    1597 
Because varenicline safety for a n unborn baby is  unknown, parti cipants who are pregnant or nursing a 1598 
baby, or planning to become preg nant, will be excluded from par ticipation. All women of childbearing 1599 
potential must agree to use an adequate form of contraception t hroughout the study an d will be asked to 1600 
take a pregnancy test at study i ntake. Women who become pregnan t during the study will be removed from 1601 
varenicline therapy but may still participate in counseling and  study follow-up. 1602

Threats to privacy/confidentia lity. Since self-report and biolo gical data will be collected and stored as part 1603 
of this study, it is possible that subject privacy or confident iality can be threatened. 1604 
 1605 
UPDATE 2020-05-29 - COVID-19: 1606 
In the context of the pandemic, any interaction with another pe rson or objects they h ave touched carries 1607 
some risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 1608 
In the case of remote visits, it is possible that subject priva cy or confidentiality can be threatened.  1609 
21.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probab ility or magnitude of risks, including procedures 1610 
being performed to monitor subjects for safety. 1611 
Response:  1612 
To further minimize the likelih ood and severity of the aforemen tioned risks of varenicline: 1613 
1. We will employ select exclusi onary criteria. For example, po tential participants  will be screened for 1614 
current suicidal behavior and severe mood disorder and for very  high levels of alcohol consumption. 1615 
2. We will administer the standa rd varenicline dose run-in and will not exceed the sta ndard dose of 1 mg 1616 
B.I.D. 1617 
3. We will discuss the potential risks of varenicline with pros pective participants, including their likelihood. 1618 
We will monitor self-reported si de effects and Adverse Events a t each of the clinic visits during the 1619 
treatment period. Study Physician /PI will be alerted to side e ffects /Adverse Events, following our 1620 
standardized protocol (see App10- 02). The Study MD/PI will revi ew the information provided by the 1621 
research staff and if applicable , will contact the study partic ipant directly to gather more information and 1622 
determine the appropriate course  of action for the subject. Ult imately, the Study Physician will decide if the 1623 
AE is related to study medication and whether the subject shoul d discontinue taking study medication.  1624 
 1625 
To protect privacy and confiden tiality, we have several safegua rds against unauthorized access to study 1626 
data – please see the sections of Privacy and Confidentiality s ections of this document for details. We have 1627 
not experienced the unauthorized use of study data. 1628

21.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects that are currently 1633 
unforeseeable. 1634 
Response: There may be risks tha t we do not know about at this time. We will notify pa rticipants of any 1635 
new information that may affect  their willingness to continue p articipation in this study. 1636 
21.4 If applicable, indicate which research procedures may have risks to an embryo or fetus should the 1637 
subject be or become pregnant. 1638 
Response: Because varenicline safety for an unborn baby is unkn own, participants will be told that they 1639 
should not become pregnant while on this study. Women on the st udy should not nurse a baby. If the 1640 
woman is of childbearing potential, she must use an adequate fo rm of contraception wh ile study medication 1641 
is being taken and for at least one month after the end of the trial. If the woman is  pregnant or breast 1642 
feeding, she may not participat e in this study, and if she beco mes pregnant during the study, she will be 1643 
removed from the study. Women w ill be asked to take a pregnancy  test before starting the study. 1644

NOTE:  If your research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no 1896 
procedures for which written documentation of consent is normally required outside of the research 1897 
context, the IRB will generally waive the requirement to obtain written documentation of consent.  1898 
This is sometimes referred to as ‘verbal cons ent.’  Review “CHECKLIST: Waiver of Written 1899 
Documentation of Consent (HRP-411)” to ensure that you have provided sufficient information.  1900 
If you will document consent in writing, attach a consent document with your submission.  You 1901 
may use “TEMPLATE CONSENT DOCUMENT (HRP-502)”.  If you will obtain consent, but 1902 
not document consent in writing, attach the script of the information to be provided orally or in 1903 
writing (i.e. consent script or Information Sheet).   1904

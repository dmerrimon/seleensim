Study Drug Nintedanib (BIBF1120: provided by Boehringer Ingelheim)
ObjectivesPrimary:
To  assess progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time 
interval from initiation of therapy, to its cessation for 
documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death
Secondary:
To  assess the clinical response (complete response + partial 
response) in all patients with measurable disease (using 
standard RECISTv1.1 criteria).
To  assess overall survival (OS) in all patients.
Assess changes in QOL throughout treatment using the 
EORTC QLQ – GI.NET21 questionnaire for carcinoid patients 
with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, in all patients who 
have filled out at least two QOL questionnaires and, will be 
reported by groups based on response (response, stable disease 
or progressive disease).
Steady-state  PK of nintedanib, biomarkers, Treg and cytokine 
expression and growth factors will be analyzed for all patients 
and reported in groups based on response.
Gene  mutations and copy number alterations analysis in the 
mTOR pathway (will be performed only on the first 10 
patients), protein expression of activation of Akt (as well as 
other downstream targets).
Toxicity  (graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0) will be 
closely monitored and all toxicities will be tabulated
Study DesignThis is an open label, multi-center phase II study in all patients with 
advanced
 low and intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancers 
(carcinoids), excluding PNETS (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors).
Target Accrual and Study DurationTwo participating institutions will enroll maximum of 30 evaluable 
patients over a 24 month period .

Statistical AnalysisSample Size  Determination: Two participating institutions will 
enroll maximum of 30 evaluable patients over a 24 month 
period.The sample size calculation is based on testing the 
hypotheses concerning the PFS rate at 16 weeks in patients treated 
under the proposed therapy: H0: p ≤ p0 versus HA: p > p 0. This 
single-stage design requires a total of n patients in order to achieve 
approximately 1-β power to detect differences of ∆ percentage 
points (p 0 versus p0 +∆). For this study α = 0.10 and 1-β =0.90; with 
p0=0.40 and =0.24 for this population of carcinoid patients. 
Efficacy Analysis:  The  primary objective of this study is to assess 
the efficacy of the investigational agent nintedanib in carcinoid 
patients. Let p represent the PFS rate at 16 weeks. A true PFS rate 
at 16 weeks of less than p0 =0.40 is considered unacceptable in

of further study. The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are 
H0: p ≤ p0 versus HA: p > p 0. A one-sided exact binomial test (at a 
nominal α=0.10) and corresponding decision rules will be used to 
evaluate these hypotheses:
If  15 patients or less have not progressed at 16 weeks, 
then it is concluded that the therapy is not promising.
If  16 patients or more have not progressed at 16 weeks, 
then it will be concluded that the therapy is promising.
Secondary Analysis: The time-to-event outcomes (PFS and OS) will 
be reported using standard Kaplan-Meier methods. Ninety-five 
percent confidence intervals for the median PFS and OS will be 
calculated using Greenwood's formula. Exact 90% confidence 
interval estimates using the Clopper-Pearson method will be given 
for the response and toxicity rates. An exact 90% confidence 
interval will be given for the rate of improved QOL. Changes in 
pre- and post- treatment cytokine expression and growth factors will 
be analyzed using permutation paired t-tests. Dichotomous 
variables, such as response and QOL, will be analyzed using the 
logistic regression to investigate their association with quantified 
variables, such as biomarker expression and gene mutation. The 
association between survival and quantified variables will be 
investigated using the Cox-proportional hazard model.
Safety Analysis: The frequency  of toxicities will be tabulated by 
grade across all dose levels and cycles. All participants who receive 
any study treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity.

030818 Page 16 of 831 BACKGROUND
1.1 Carcinoid  (Neuroendocrine) Tumors
Neuroendocrine tumors,  also known as carcinoids, are uncommon tumors arising from various 
primary sites. Although thought to be rare, the incidence of neuroendocrine tumors is rising and 
the estimated prevalence in the United States is 103,312 cases, which is more than gastric and 
pancreatic cancer combined(1). Nearly 50% of patients with neuroendocrine tumors have 
metastatic disease at presentation, and 65% will die within 5 years of diagnosis.
Carcinoids are  generally slow growing tumors, but in the advanced setting can be very disabling 
and impact quality of life (QOL) due to diarrhea, bowel obstructions, pain, weight loss, 
depression and fatigue. Many of the abdominal symptoms are caused by the dense adhesions. 
Mid gut carcinoids often secrete serotonin that acts synergistically with platelet derived growth 
factor (PDGF) and stimulates DNA synthesis in fibroblasts acting through 5–HT 1B receptors 
coupled to a G i-protein(2). This may, in part explain the dense fibrotic reaction seen in small 
bowel carcinoids and subsequent obstructive symptoms. Carcinoids are highly vascular and 
VEGF, PDGF and FGF are all also thought to drive disease with the additional serotonin 
mediated fibroblast proliferation driving symptom progression.
Nintedanib is  a promising new orally bioavailable targeted agent that targeted VEGFR1-3, FGFR 
1/3 and PDGFR. Several agents targeting VEGF and PDGF have shown promising activity in 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However response rates for patients with non-pancreatic 
carcinoid tumors have been low. We hypothesize, that since fibroblast proliferation is a major 
driver of disease and clinical progression in non-pancreatic carcinoids that is shown in animal 
models to be driven by serotonin (5-HT) through FGFR2 (3) that targeting angiogenesis and 
FGFR merits study in this tumor. There are no prospectively validated predictors of response to 
FGFR inhibitor, but studies in in a study done by(4) in lung NET (neuroendocrine tumor) patient 
samples, FGFR1 amplification was seen in 52% of small cell neuroendocrine cancer and 19% of 
bronchial carcinoids. These expression data are much higher than those reported in breast, lung 
or bladder cancers, and make it much more likely to see activity with FGF inhibition.
Targeting angiogenesis  with sunitinib has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with 
PNETs (5). Similar benefit was seen in patients with PNETs with everolimus, an oral agent that 
targets the mTOR pathway known to drive NET progression (6). Unfortunately median treatment 
duration was ~ 8 months and progression free survival was ~ 11 months in both trials and upon 
progression, unfortunately patients have no further options that palliate symptoms that can be 
disabling for PNETs due to hormonal overproduction and pain from bony metastases that seem 
to occur with reasonable frequency in these patients.
Furthermore, this is  an area of unmet need as there are no approved anti-tumor agents for 
patients with carcinoids that are not of pancreatic origin. Octreotide is shown to improve 
symptoms and frequently used in these patients. Recently in a phase 3 trial, therapy with 
everolimus and octreotide was shown to prolong PFS compared to placebo (7). Results from 
RADIANT-4 may confirm PFS with everolimus in this population of ~11 months but, given the 
long overall survival of these patients and morbidity from symptoms, clearly there remains a 
need for newer tolerable agents to continue to offer symptom and tumor control. These data form 
the background and rationale for our hypothesis that the combination of nintedanib with

and PNETs.
Lastly, a  landmark study in carcinoid (small intestinal NETs) was recently published. They 
sequenced 48 small bowel tumors using massively parallel, next-generation DNA sequencing.  
Not surprisingly a paucity of mutations were identified: however, 197 protein-altering somatic 
SNVs affected a preponderance of cancer genes, including FGFR2, MEN1, HOOK3, EZH2, 
MLF1, CARD11, VHL, NONO, and SMAD1 were noted(8). Integrative analysis of SNVs and 
somatic copy number variations identified recurrently altered mechanisms of carcinogenesis: 
chromatin remodeling, DNA damage, apoptosis, RAS signaling, and axon guidance. Candidate 
therapeutically relevant alterations were found in 35 patients, including SRC, SMAD family 
genes, AURKA, EGFR, HSP90, and PDGFR. Mutually exclusive amplification of AKT1 or AKT2 
was the most common event in the 16 patients with alterations of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. All 
of these genes are included in our IMPACT next generation sequencing platform. (8)We will 
therefore sequence 10 tumors to see if response and/or resistance to nintedanib is influence by 
these deregulated pathways.
Given the  mutation alterations identified in the AKT1 or AKT2 genes, we also hypothesize that 
Akt activation may predict response and/or resistance to treatment. Pre-archived and post-
treatment biopsies will be assessed for activity and will be determined by blotting for the 
phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets including p-Foxo, p-GSK3, p-PRAS40. IHC analysis 
of total AKT, p-Akt Ser473, PTEN, total 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1Thr70, p-eIF-4G Ser1108 (peIF-
4G), total S6, p-S6 Ser235/236 and Ser240/244, and proliferation marker Ki-67 will also be 
performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from the tumor samples
1.2 Nintedanib
Nintedanib (BIBF  1120) is a small molecule TKI of VEGFR 1/2/3 (IC 50 34/21/13 nM), FGFR 
1/2/3 (IC 50 69/37/109 nM), and PDGFR A/B (IC 50 59/65 nM), with additional activity against 
Flt-3, RET, Src, Lck, and Lyn. In preclinical colorectal cancer models, anti-tumor efficacy has 
been demonstrated, with a marked reduction in tumor vessel density. Maximum plasma 
concentrations occur 2-4 hours following administration with a terminal half-life of 7-19 hours. 
Based upon phase I data, the recommended phase II dose is 200 mg orally twice daily, as a single 
agent as well as in combination with chemotherapy. When administered as monotherapy, the 
most common side effects are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue. Liver 
enzyme increases were the most common DLT in early phase trials and a common AE in later 
stage studies, though predominantly seen at higher doses (>200 mg bid) and largely reversible 
with cessation of therapy.
1.3 Preclinical Development and Pharmacokinetics of Nintedanib
Nintedanib (BIBF1120)  is a potent, orally available triple kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFRs, 
PDGFRs, and FGFRs.
Nintedanib inhibits  the signalling cascade mediating angiogenesis by binding to the adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) binding pocket of the receptor kinase domain, thus interfering with cross-
activation via auto-phosphorylation of the receptor homodimers.
The specific  and simultaneous abrogation of these pathways results in effective growth inhibition 
of both endothelial and, via PDGF- and FGF-receptors of perivascular cells which may be more 
APPROVED RPCI IRB

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 18 of 83effective than  inhibition of endothelial cell growth via the VEGF pathway alone. Furthermore, 
signaling by FGF-receptors has been identified as a possible escape mechanism for tumour 
angiogenesis when the VEGF pathway is disrupted.
Besides inhibition of  neo-angiogenesis, it may alter tumour maintenance by inducing apoptosis 
of tumour blood vessel endothelial cells. Inhibition of receptor kinases may also interfere with 
autocrine and paracrine stimulation of tumour angiogenesis via activation loops involving 
VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF utilized by vascular and perivascular cells such as pericytes and 
vascular smooth muscle cells.
In addition  preclinical models show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a direct anti-tumour 
effect on those malignant cells which overexpress PDGFR and/or FGFR (e.g. H1703 NSCLC 
cells). In vitro, the target receptors are all inhibited by nintedanib in low nanomolar 
concentrations ( Table 1).

In in vivo  nude mouse models, nintedanib showed good anti-tumour efficacy at doses of 50 – 
100 mg/kg, leading to a substantial delay of tumour growth or even complete tumour-stasis in 
xenografts of a broad range of differing human tumour types. Histological examination of treated 
tumors showed a marked reduction of tumour vessel density by approximately 80% (9).
The metabolism  of nintedanib (BIBF1120) was predominantly characterized by the ester 
cleavage of the methyl ester moiety yielding BIBF 1202, which was further metabolized by 
conjugation to glucuronic acid yielding the 1-O-acylglucuronide.  Data collected in this study 
show that nintedanib (BIBF1120) has a favorable PK and excretion profile with almost no 
elimination via the urine, only 0.7% of total [14C] radioactivity was eliminated via the urine [5]. 
The metabolic characteristics are predominantly independent of cytochrome P450-catalysed 
metabolic pathways (10).
A soft  gelatin capsule formulation of nintedanib is used in man. After oral administration, 
nintedanib is absorbed quickly. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) generally occur 2 to 4 
hours after administration. So far, no evidence for a deviation from dose proportionality of the 
PK of nintedanib has been observed. Steady state is reached latest after one week of dosing. The 
terminal half-life of nintedanib is in the range of 7 to 19 hr. Nintedanib is mainly eliminated via 
faeces (10).
Nintedanib (BIBF1120) is non-mutagenic, even at high doses.

030818 Page 19 of 83Two exploratory  studies in rats revealed a teratogenic effect of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with a 
steep dose/effect relationship and an early onset of embryofetal deaths at low dosages. This 
effect was observed at dose levels resulting in plasma drug concentrations comparable to or 
below those in humans. Because the concentration of nintedanib (BIBF1120) in semen is 
unknown, males receiving nintedanib (BIBF1120) and having sexual intercourse with females of 
childbearing potential should use latex condoms. Women of childbearing potential should be 
advised to use adequate contraception during and at least 3 months after the last dose of 
nintedanib.
A detailed  discussion of the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
nintedanib can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
1.4 Clinical  Studies with Nintedanib
Nintedanib is  being evaluated in several cancers. Additionally, nintedanib has been FDA 
approved for the non-cancer indication idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). As of 15 Feb 2013, 
3556 cancer patients, over 1000 patients with IPF, and 140 healthy volunteers had been treated 
with nintedanib or nintedanib matching placebo, in monotherapy or in combination with 
chemotherapy.
1.4.1 Phase  I
Phase I  dose selection studies revealed that nintedanib (BIBF1120) is generally well tolerated 
with mild to moderate adverse effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain) and reversible elevations of liver enzymes. Initial signs of clinical 
activity including an encouraging rate of patients with stabilization of their tumour of 54% and 
68%, respectively; have been observed in patients with various solid tumors(11).
Based on  the Phase I dose escalation trials with nintedanib (BIBF1120) monotherapy, the 
maximum tolerated dose was defined to be 250 mg for twice daily dosing in Caucasians and 
200 mg twice daily in Japanese patients with a manageable safety profile in advanced cancer 
patients. Based on the overall safety profile, the RP2D for nintedanib as monotherapy is 200 mg 
bid.
The maximum  tolerated dose for combination therapy of nintedanib (BIBF1120) in combination 
with pemetrexed, docetaxel, paclitaxel/carboplatin and FOLFOX is 200 mg bid. Combination of 
nintedanib (BIBF1120) with other anti-cancer drugs revealed a similar adverse event profile as 
compared to nintedanib (BIBF1120) monotherapy except for the chemotherapy related toxicities. 
There was no change of the pharmacokinetic parameters of nintedanib (BIBF1120) or of the 
cytotoxic compounds due to the combined treatment. Dose limiting toxicity consisted mostly of 
liver transaminase elevations as in the monotherapy phase I trials with the exception of the 
combination of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with pemetrexed, where fatigue was the most relevant 
dose limiting toxicity.
Available pharmacokinetic  data indicate that the systemic exposure needed for biological activity 
can be achieved starting with doses of 100 mg nintedanib (BIBF1120) once daily.
The predominant  adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue of 
mostly low to moderate severity. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) were mainly confined to 
reversible hepatic enzyme elevations (AST, ALT, γ-GT) which increased dose-dependently. 
Most cases occurring at doses of 250 mg and above, and a very low incidence at doses below

observed after single administration of single doses of nintedanib to healthy volunteers were only 
of CTCAE grade 1 severity and fully reversible (10).
1.4.2 NSCLC
In a  phase II trial in NSCLC patients the safety profile of nintedanib (BIBF1120) observed in 
phase I trials could be confirmed. Most commonly reported drug-related AEs were nausea 
(57.5%), diarrhea (47.9%), vomiting (42.5%), anorexia (28.8%), abdominal pain (13.7%) and 
reversible alanine transaminase (13.7%) and aspartate aminotransferase elevations (9.6%) In 
conclusion it was generally well tolerated and displayed single agent activity in advanced or 
recurrent NSCLC patients. Median overall survival (OS) was 21.9 weeks. Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) 0–1 patients (n = 56) had a median PFS of 11.6 weeks and a median 
OS of 37.7 weeks. Tumour stabilization was achieved in 46% of patients (ECOG 0–1 patients: 
59%), with one confirmed partial response (250 mg bid.)(12).
LUME-Lung 1  was an international, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial assessing the 
efficacy and  safety of docetaxel plus nintedanib as second line therapy for non-small-cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC).  In total, 1314 patients with Stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC (all histologies) 
who had progressed after 1st line chemotherapy were randomized in 1:1 fashion to either receive 
Nintedanib 200 mg BID + Docetaxel (n=655) or Placebo BID + Docetaxel (n=659). 
LUME-Lung 1  met its primary endpoint by showing a statistically significant improvement of 
PFS for all patients regardless of histology (median PFS 3.4 versus 2.7 months; HR 0.79, 
p=0.0019) for Nintedanib in combination with docetaxel.
A significant  improvement in OS was demonstrated in patients with adenocarcinoma (HR 0.83, 
p=0.0359, median 10.3 to 12.6 months).
Patients with a poor  prognosis defined as time since start of 1st line therapy <9 months also 
experienced significant OS improvement from the addition of nintedanib to docetaxel (HR 0.75, 
p=0.0073, median OS 7.9 to 10.9 months).
The predominant  adverse events were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fatigue of 
mostly low to moderate intensity after monotherapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120). Dose limiting 
toxicities were dose dependent hepatic enzyme elevations that were reversible after 
discontinuation of nintedanib (BIBF1120) treatment. These liver enzyme elevations were only in 
few cases accompanied by a simultaneous increase of bilirubin. In general common terminology 
criteria for adverse events (CTCAE version 3, grade three liver enzyme increases were reported 
in the dose groups of 250 mg twice daily or higher. They also were reversible and usually 
occurred within the first two months of treatment. 
Hypertension or  thromboembolic events were rare and did not suggest an increased frequency as 
a consequence of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120)(13).
LUME-Lung 2  was a similar randomized, double-blind, phase III study of nintedanib plus 
pemetrexed versus  placebo plus pemetrexed in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small 
cell lung cancer after failure of first line chemotherapy.
Based on  a preplanned futility analysis of investigator-assessed PFS, enrolment was halted after 
713/1300 planned patients had been enrolled. The analysis (based on conditional power for PFS 
by investigator assessment) suggested that the study was futile and that the primary endpoint of

030818 Page 21 of 83centrally assessed  PFS would likely not be met. The futility analysis was based on conditional 
power; there was no formal testing of null hypothesis as planned for primary analysis no safety 
issues were identified.
Even though  the study was stopped prematurely, the primary endpoint of this Phase III trial was 
met; treatment with nintedanib plus pemetrexed resulted in a significant prolongation of centrally 
reviewed PFS compared with placebo plus pemetrexed (median PFS 4.4 vs. 3.6 months with a 
HR 0.83; p=0.0435). The disease control rate was also increased significantly in nintedanib-
treated patients. There was no improvement in OS in nintedanib-treated patients. Nintedanib 200 
mg bid in combination with pemetrexed had an acceptable and manageable safety profile, with 
no new or unexpected safety findings. The most frequent AEs were reversible increases in liver 
enzymes and gastrointestinal events (14).
1.4.3 Ovarian  Cancer
A randomized  phase II maintenance trial in ovarian cancer in which the efficacy and safety of 
nine months of continuous twice daily doses of nintedanib (BIBF1120) following chemotherapy 
was investigated, has identified the potential activity of nintedanib (BIBF1120) with a 36-week 
PFS of 16.3 % compared to 5.0 % in the control group. The safety profile was consistent with 
findings previously reported for nintedanib (BIBF1120) administered as monotherapy as 
mentioned above(15).
Nintedanib was  evaluated in a Phase III randomized, placebo ‐controlled, double‐ blind, 
multicentre ovarian study with 1366 patients.  Patients received nintedanib plus paclitaxel and 
carboplatin or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin for six cycles. This was followed by 
monotherapy nintedanib or placebo for up to 120 weeks. The trial met its primary endpoint by 
demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (HR 0.84; 
95%CI 0.72 - 0.98; p=0.0239, median PFS 17.3 months for nintedanib and 16.6 months for 
placebo). Overall survival data are immature but currently show no trend in either direction. 
Main adverse events were GI side effects and increased hematological toxicity(16).
1.4.4 Renal  Cell Cancer
Nintedanib has  been studied in a randomized phase II study in metastatic clear cell RCC with 
sunitinib as the control arm. Similar efficacy was seen in both arms of this study. AEs observed 
more frequent in the nintedanib arm included diarrheal, nausea, fatigue and infection, whereas 
AEs more frequent in the sunitinib arm consisted of bleeding, anaemia, hypertension, hand-foot 
syndrome and stomatitis(17).
1.4.5 Hepatocellular  Cancer
The efficacy and safety  of nintedanib versus sorafenib in Asian Patients with Advanced 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma was investigated in a randomized phase II trial. Nintedanib showed 
similar efficacy to sorafenib, with a favorable and manageable AE profile. More patients in the 
sorafenib arm had severe AEs and drug-related AEs compared with patients in the nintedanib 
arm, and more patients in the sorafenib arm required dose reduction compared with the 
nintedanib arm. Nintedanib AEs were manageable; in the nintedanib arm there were fewer 
hypertension, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and transaminase elevation events(18).

A Phase  I/II, open-label, randomized study of nintedanib plus mFOLFOX6 compared to 
bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 in 120 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was performed, 
demonstrating an acceptable safety profile of nintedanib in combination with mFOLFOX 6. In 
comparison to bevacizumab, nintedanib showed a similar magnitude of efficacy, a similar 
safety/tolerability profile, a similar exposure and dose intensity of mFOLFOX6 (19). This is in 
contrast to multiple prior trials of small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR-2 with demonstrated 
increased toxicity and, as a result, decreased efficacy(20).
A Phase  III study is going to start in late 2014 to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib in patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of previous treatment with standard 
chemotherapy and biological agents (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).
For more details please refer to the investigator drug brochure for nintedanib (BIBF1120).
1.5 Correlative Studies
1.5.1 Tissue  biomarkers
1.5.1.1 Fibroblast  Growth Factors (FGFs)
The family of  fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulates a variety of developmental processes 
and the 18 mammalial FGFs are grouped into 6 subgroups based on sequence homology and 
phylogeny(21). The FGF ligands carry out their diverse functions by binding and activating FGFR 
family tyrosine kinase receptors. Investigators from our group at Roswell Park recently found 
that response to another FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib correlated with FRS2 phosphorylation, 
FGFR2 mRNA levels and FGFR2 IIIb expression but not phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and 
PDGFRβ in pancreatic xenografts(22). Using FGFR2 mRNA levels tumor sensitivity to FGFR 
inhibition among the tumor xenografts was able to be identified.  The intracellular kinase domain 
of FGFRs is structurally similar to VEGFR2 and PDGFR. The extracellular domains II and III of 
FGFRs constitute the binding site for FGF ligands (23). Alternative splicing in domain III in 
FGFR1–3, not FGFR4, creates isoforms (IIIb and IIIc) with varying binding affinity to various 
FGF ligands. Response to FGFR inhibition with dovitinib correlated with FGFR IIIb isoform but 
not FGFR2IIIc in our studies. This may be because isoform IIIc is associated with epithelial to 
mesenchymal transformation(24). This forms the rationale for our hypothesis that high FGFR IIIb 
to IIIc ratio in tumors along with proliferative index (Ki-67) and microvessel density that are 
known predictors of biology in this tumor will predict benefit from nintedanib.
We hypothesize  that a high FGFR IIIb/IIIc ratio (quantified using an image analyzer) and low 
Ki-67, microvessel density at baseline measured by IHC using validated methods in formalin-
fixed paraffin embedded biopsy tissue will correlate with improved response to nintedanib(25, 26).
1.5.1.2 mTOR  Pathway Mutations
We hypothesize  that mutations along the mTOR pathway may predict response and/or resistance 
to nintedanib therapy. To test this hypothesis, we propose to determine mutations and copy 
number alterations in 341 cancer associated genes using a novel technology called IMPACT 
(Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets conducted in the Berger Laboratory 
at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).
APPROVED RPCI IRB
5/3/2018
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study No.: I 259114
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 23 of 83In addition,  given the mutation alterations identified in the AKT1 or AKT2 genes, we also 
hypothesize that Akt activation may predict response and/or resistance to treatment. Pre-archived 
and post-treatment biopsies will be assessed for activity and will be determined by blotting for 
the phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets including p-Foxo, p-GSK3, p-PRAS40. IHC 
analysis of total AKT, p-Akt Ser473, PTEN, total 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1Thr70, p-eIF-4G Ser1108 
(peIF-4G), total S6, p-S6 Ser235/236 and Ser240/244, and proliferation marker Ki-67 will also 
be performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from the tumor samples.
We will  send all samples to MSKCC for testing. In patients with a partial response by RECIST 
i.e., “outliers” (pre-archived and post-treatment biopsies) will be assessed for activity and will be 
determined by blotting for the phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets. This will also be done 
in those with long PFS (>/= 6 months). There they will extract DNA from core tissue and 
cytology specimens (and patient-matched normal tissue) using Qiagen nucleic acid extraction 
kits. They will prepare barcoded sequence libraries (New England Biolabs, Kapa Biosystems) 
and perform exon capture on barcoded pools by hybridization (Nimblegen SeqCap) using custom 
oligonucleotides to capture all exons and select introns of 341 cancer genes. DNA will 
subsequently be sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 to 500-1000X coverage in order to 
maximize sensitivity for detecting mutations.
DNA samples  will be prepped and captured for sequencing, libraries will be sequenced, and 
FASTQ sequence files will be prepared all through MSKCC Diagnostic Molecular Pathology. 
Sequence data will be analyzed through MSKCC Diagnostic Molecular Pathology.
1.5.2 Plasma  Markers/Modeling
Elevated plasma cytokine  levels (e.g., Serum VEGF) often correlate with poor prognosis and 
changes in these markers have not been predictive of clinical outcomes to any anti-angiogenic 
agent. (27). Our group evaluated sunitinib PK and modeled change in soluble VEGFR2 and this 
PK/PD model was able to successfully predict clinical benefit (PFS) to potent anti-VEGF 
therapy.
Using the  previously developed PK/PD model (see Section 13.1), it will be determined if using 
decrease in circulating cytokines such as soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
(sVEGFR), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and FGFR by ELISA before treatment and at week 8 
(± 3 days) with steady state PK done in the same sample drawn at week 8 will correlate with 
drug level following start of therapy, with changes in cytokines post therapy compared to pre 
therapy in the model to see if it correlates with clinical benefit and has the potential to be a 
biomarker. We hypothesize that drug exposure combined with FGF and FGFR levels measured 
by ELISA and sVEGFr2- a pharmacodynamic marker validated prospectively may yield a 
noninvasive biomarker of response to this agent (28).
1.5.3 Immune  Biomarkers
Carcinoid tumors are  well known to have a variable biology and reasons for this are poorly 
understood. We have comprehensively studied and shown that immune dysfunction is a hallmark 
of cancer in peripheral blood samples taken from patients with liver cancer (29). In two ongoing 
NCCN funded trials we are prospectively validating our preliminary data that antiangiogenic 
therapy results in immune changes that may have a functional impact on patient’s anti-tumor 
immunity. We have successfully conducted these studies in banked frozen PBMCs and propose

(CD3+CD4+Foxp3+CD127− cells) on outcomes with nintedanib therapy and may provide insight 
into the patients biology. Banked specimens will allow future comprehensive assessment and 
given that immunotherapy is now a real option for treatment of some cancers, and will be the 
next frontier and major focus of oncology research, it may allow selection of patients who may 
benefit from other therapies in development.
1.5.4 Quality  of Life
The EORTC QLQ –  GI.NET21 questionnaire is intended for use among patients with G.I. 
related neuroendocrine tumors, who vary in disease stage and treatments. The module comprises 
21 questions assessing disease symptoms, side effects of treatment, body image, disease related 
worries, social functioning, communication and sexuality.
The module  has been found to be a valid and responsive tool for assessing quality of life in gut, 
pancreas and liver neuroendocrine tumors (30).
1.6 Risks  and/or Benefits
The risks of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in adult patients are primarily related to:
the  gastro-intestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain-including upper 
and lower abdominal pain)
increases  in liver enzymes (AST, ALT, γ-GT)
fatigue  or asthenia
decreased  appetite, dehydration due to gastrointestinal side effects
Liver enzymes must be followed closely during treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120).
Therapy with the trial  drugs must be interrupted in the event of relevant hepatic toxicity and 
further treatment is to be withheld until recovery of the abnormal laboratory parameters.
Impairment of  immune and of kidney function, thromboembolic events and GI perforations are 
considered possible side effects of treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) as they have been 
reported for some other drugs in the class of angiogenesis inhibitors. Thus far these side effects 
have been observed in the trials conducted with nintedanib (BIBF1120), but not to a relevant 
degree. Hypertension is also supposed to be a possible side effect of VEGFR inhibitors and a 
slightly increased frequency of hypertension has been observed in the trials with nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) to a mild to moderate degree and only few cases of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 
hypertension have been observed. With respect to bleeding as one of the potentially serious side 
effects of antiangiogenesis agents in the LUME –Lung 1 trial involving 1314 patients more 
bleeding events were reported for nintedanib-treated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients 
(all grades: 17.1% vs. 10.9%; grade ≥3: 2.9% vs. 1.3%) than for those with adenocarcinoma (all 
grades: 10.9% vs. 11.1%; grade ≥3: 1.5% vs. 1.3%). Fatal bleeding events, serious skin 
reactions, thrombosis, and perforations occurred at a low frequency and were balanced between 
both arms regardless of histology.
Based upon  a non-clinical safety study in vitro, nintedanib (BIBF1120) may have a potential risk 
of phototoxicity (skin and eyes) in vivo. Few cases of photosensitivity reactions (less than 1 %) 
and of CTCAE grade 1 intensity only, have been reported from the clinical studies to date. If

spectrum sunscreen and sunglasses), treatment with nintedanib (BIBF1120) is considered safe.
2 RATIONALE
Patients with progressing metastatic carcinoid tumors  have no approved options and are a 
population with a clear unmet need. Targeting angiogenesis and the mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTor) pathways has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with pancreatic 
NETs but have not proven to be beneficial in carcinoids.  Studies, suggest, however that a subset 
of carcinoid patients may be sensitive to these therapies. Therapy is palliative and intended to 
improve quality of life (QOL).
Furthermore, this is  an area of unmet need as there are no approved anti-tumor agents for 
patients with carcinoids that are not of pancreatic origin. Octreotide is shown to improve 
symptoms and frequently used in these patients. Recently in a phase 3 trial, therapy with 
everolimus and octreotide was shown to prolong PFS compared to placebo (7). Results from 
RADIANT-4 may confirm PFS with everolimus in this population of ~11 months but given the 
long overall survival of these patients and morbidity from symptoms, clearly there remains a 
need for newer tolerable agents to continue to offer symptom and tumor control. Carcinoids are 
highly vascular and VEGF, PDGF and FGF are all also thought to drive disease with the 
additional serotonin mediated fibroblast proliferation driving symptom progression. Nintedanib 
is a promising new orally bioavailable targeted agent that targeted VEGFR1-3, FGFR 1/3 and 
PDGFR. Several agents targeting VEGF and PDGF have shown promising activity in pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumors. However response rates for patients with non-pancreatic carcinoid 
tumors have been low. We hypothesize, that since fibroblast proliferation is a major driver of 
disease and clinical progression in non-pancreatic carcinoids that is shown in animal models to 
be driven by serotonin (5-HT) through FGFR2 that targeting angiogenesis and FGFR merits 
study in this tumor. There are no prospectively validated predictors of response to FGFR 
inhibitor, and in lung NET patient samples, FGFR1 amplification was seen in 52% of small cell 
neuroendocrine cancer and 19% of bronchial carcinoids.  These expression data are much higher 
than those reported in breast, lung or bladder cancers and make it much more likely to see 
activity with FGF inhibition. As progression free survival is a valid endpoint in this disease given 
the long overall survival, we hypothesize that:
1. Targeting angiogenesis  and the fibroblast growth factor pathway with nintedanib will result 
in clinical benefit measured as progression free survival (PFS) and radiographic response or 
stable disease in patients with carcinoid tumors progressing within the 12 months prior to 
study entry.
2. This  therapy will be safe and tolerable in combination with octreotide. This will also lead to 
improved QOL measured using the EORTC QLQ – GI.NET21 questionnaire.
These data  form the background and rationale for our hypothesis that the combination of 
nintedanib with octreotide LAR may offer disease control and clinical benefit in patients with 
carcinoid tumors and PNETs.

3.1 Primary  Objective
To  assess progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time interval from initiation of 
therapy, to its cessation for documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death.
3.2 Secondary  Objectives
To  assess the clinical response (complete response + partial response) in all patients with 
measurable disease (using standard RECISTv1.1 criteria).
To  assess overall survival (OS) in all patients.
Assess  changes in QOL throughout treatment using the EORTC QLQ – GI.NET21 
questionnaire for carcinoid patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, in all 
patients who have filled out at least two QOL questionnaires and, will be reported by 
groups based on response (response, stable disease or progressive disease).
Steady-state PK  of Nintedanib, biomarkers, Treg and cytokine expression and growth 
factors will be analyzed for all patients and reported in groups based on response.
Gene  mutations and copy number alterations analysis in the mTOR pathway (will be 
performed only on the first 10 patients), protein expression of activation of Akt (as well 
as other downstream targets).
Toxicity  (graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0) will be closely monitored and all 
toxicities will be tabulated.
4 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Study Design
This is  an open label, multi-center phase II study in all patients with advanced low and 
intermediate grade neuroendocrine cancers (carcinoids), excluding PNETS.
Therapy will consist  of Nintedanib (BIBF1120) 200 mg PO BID + Octreotide (or lanreotide) q 4 
weeks.
CT (chest, abdomen, & pelvis) scan restaging q 8 weeks x 24 weeks and then q12 weeks. 
In a  subset of patients (10 total), post treatment biopsy samples for tissue studies to understand 
mechanisms of resistance will be done  at progression if they are willing to have a second biopsy.
Quality of life  questionnaires using the EORTC QLQ – GI.NET21 questionnaire (Appendix K ) 
will be completed at baseline and at the same time points as imaging studies while on study. 
Treat until progression/ unacceptable toxicity.
Formalin-fixed paraffin  embedded tumor biopsy samples from patients enrolled at the 
participating institutions will be sent to RPCI Core Pathology Laboratory for IHC studies. This is 
to be done in all patients accrued at all sites who may have additional studies for the gene 
expression studies described in the protocol.

030818 Page 29 of 836 TREATMENT  PLAN
6.1 Dosing  and Administration
Treatment will  be administered on an outpatient basis. Reported adverse events (AEs) and 
potential risks are described in Section 1.6. Appropriate dose modifications are described in 
Section 6.2.
All patients have  to be on octreotide LAR or lanreotide, and dose has to be stable for 3 months 
prior to study enrolment. Nintedanib 200 mg PO BID will be given as an outpatient in 28 day 
cycles. The pills are to be swallowed, un-chewed, with a glass of water of about 250 mL with a 
dose interval of approximately 12 hours at the same times every day, at least 30 minutes after a 
meal. If a patient misses a dose he/she will be instructed to skip that dose and take their next dose 
at their scheduled time.
Reported adverse events  (AEs) and potential risks are described in Section 1.6. Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 6.2. No other investigational or commercial drugs or 
therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the 
patient. Patients will continue nintedanib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
investigator’s decision to remove patient from the study, patient refusal to continue, or 
alternative treatment.
Throughout the  study, all patients will still continue on their scheduled dose of either Octreotide 
or Lanreotide: dosing information about Octreotide or Lanreotide should be tracked in the drug 
administration eCRF.
6.2 Dose Modifications
As initial  measure for the management of side effects (Table 2 ) treatment with Nintedanib 
should be temporarily interrupted until the specific adverse reaction has resolved to levels that 
allow continuation of therapy. Nintedanib treatment may be resumed at a reduced dose. Dose 
adjustments in 100 mg steps per day (i.e. a 50 mg reduction per dosing) based on individual 
safety and tolerability are recommended as described in Table 3. In case of further persistence of 
the adverse reaction(s), i.e. if a patient does not tolerate 100 mg twice daily, treatment with 
Nintedanib should be discontinued and the patient will be taken off study.
*Nintedanib, maybe  held per physician discretion for 2-4 weeks. Any extension beyond this 
duration will be on a case by case basis per primary investigator discretion.

*Please refer to table 4 for management of diarrhea.
6.2.1 Management  of Diarrhea
For the disease  population in this study, frequency of bowel movements may already be an issue 
with some patients prior to initiation of nintedanib treatment. Therefore, for this population, 
number/frequency of bowel movements will be documented at baseline prior to initiation of 
nintedanib and subsequent CTCAE grading of diarrhea will be evaluated relative to the patient’s 
baseline evaluation.
Guidelines for the management of diarrhea are found in Table 4.

6.4 General  Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care
6.4.1 Additional precautions and supportive care
Diarrhea
Diarrhea was the  most frequently reported gastro-intestinal event and appeared in close 
temporal relationship with the administration of docetaxel in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. 
The majority of patients had mild to moderate diarrhea. 6.3 % of the patients had diarrhea of 
grade ≥3 in combination treatment compared to 3.6 % treated with docetaxel alone. Diarrhea 
should be treated at first signs with adequate hydration and antidiarrheal medicinal products, 
e.g. loperamide, and may require interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy 
with nintedanib (see Section 6.2.1).
Nausea  and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting, mostly  of mild to moderate severity, were frequently reported 
gastrointestinal adverse events in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. Interruption, dose 
reduction or discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) may be required despite 
appropriate supportive care. Supportive care for nausea and vomiting may include medicinal 
products with anti-emetic properties, e.g. glucocorticoids, anti-histamines or 5-HT3 receptor 
antagonists and adequate hydration.
In the event  of dehydration, administration of electrolytes and fluids is required. Plasma 
levels of electrolytes should be monitored, if relevant gastrointestinal adverse events occur.
Neutropenia  and Sepsis
A higher  frequency of neutropenia of CTCAE grade > 3 was observed in patients treated 
with nintedanib (BIBF1120) in combination with docetaxel as compared to treatment with 
docetaxel alone in the clinical trial LUME-Lung 1. Subsequent complications such as sepsis 
or febrile neutropenia have been observed.
Hepatic  Function
The safety  and efficacy of nintedanib has not been studied in patients with moderate (Child 
Pugh B) or severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment. Therefore treatment with nintedanib 
(BIBF1120) is not recommended in such patients. Administration of nintedanib was 
associated with an elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALKP (alkaline phosphatase), and 
bilirubin, with a potentially higher risk for female patients.
These increases were  reversible in the majority of cases and not associated with clinically 
manifest liver disorders. Hepatic transaminases, ALKP and bilirubin levels are recommended 
to be closely monitored after start of therapy with nintedanib (BIBF1120) (periodically, i.e. 
in the combination phase with docetaxel at the beginning of each treatment cycle). If relevant

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 33 of 83liver enzyme  elevations are measured, interruption, dose reduction or discontinuation of the 
therapy with nintedanib may be required (see Appendix E  for procedures for follow-up for 
potential drug-induced liver injury).
Participants may be pretreated for nausea and vomiting with appropriate anti-emetics.
6.4.2 Concomitant  medications
Additional chemo-,  immuno-, hormone- or radiotherapies are not allowed during the active 
treatment period of this trial. Palliative radiotherapy may be permitted for symptomatic control 
of pain from bone metastases in extremities after discussion with the Principle Investigator, 
provided that the radiotherapy does not affect target lesions, and the reason for the radiotherapy 
does not reflect progressive disease.
Metabolism of  nintedanib by CYP450 enzymes plays only a minor role (5%). Additionally, 
nintedanib did not show relevant induction or inhibition of the major drug metabolizing 
cytochrome P450 enzymes and specifically no irreversible CYP3A4 inhibition. However, if co-
administered with nintedanib, strong P-gp inhibitors may increase exposure to nintedanib (e.g. 
ketoconazole or erythromycin. Thus, such medications are to be avoided unless deemed to be 
absolutely necessary. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of 
nintedanib. Management of side effects may require interruption, dose reduction or 
discontinuation of therapy with nintedanib.
Strong P-gp  inducers, e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort, may 
decrease exposure to nintedanib. Co-administration with Nintedanib and potential alternative 
therapies should be carefully considered.
See Appendix J  for additional examples of in vivo inhibitors and inducers of the P-gp 
transporter.
Because there  is a potential for interaction of drug with other concomitantly administered drugs, 
the electronic case report form (eCRF) must capture the concurrent use of all other drugs, over-
the-counter medications, or alternative therapies. The Investigator should be alerted by the 
Research Coordinator if the participant is taking any agent known to affect, or with the potential 
to affect, selected CYP450 isoenzymes, P-gp inducers or inhibitors.
Participants may be pretreated for nausea and vomiting with appropriate anti-emetics.
Rescue medication  to reverse the actions of nintedanib (BIBF1120) is not available. Potential 
side effects of nintedanib (BIBF1120) have to be treated symptomatically.
6.5 Duration  of Treatment
Participants may  remain on study and continue to receive treatment in the absence of: disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from study, intercurrent illness that prevents 
further administration of treatment, participant demonstrates an inability/refusal to comply with 
oral medication regime, or participant withdraws from study.
6.6 Treatment Discontinuation
Upon treatment  discontinuation all end of treatment evaluations and tests will be conducted. All 
participants who discontinue due to an AE must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes.

030818 Page 42 of 838.10 Plasma Biomarker/Steady-State PK Blood Sample Collection and Processing
Whole blood  samples for correlative cytokine levels will be collected via venipuncture using 1, 
10 mL purple top EDTA collection tube
Sample collection will be obtained at Baseline and at Week 8 prior to nintedanib dosing.
Samples for  the correlative analyses will be collected in the Phlebotomy Laboratory and sent to 
the Hematological Procurement Facility for processing.
The steady-state  pharmacokinetic analysis for Nintedanib will be done on the plasma samples 
obtained at week 8 (Bioanalytics, Metabolomics & Pharmacokinetic Core Facility , see below).
Plasma will be separated from whole blood within 60 minutes following the extraction.
NOTE: Any samples that have been hemolyzed should be re-drawn if possible.
Nintedanib is  degraded by plasma esterases; therefore, whole blood samples should be 
immediately maintained in an ice bath until centrifuged. Centrifugation for separation of plasma 
should be done within 60 min after sampling: 
Centrifuge  whole blood samples as soon as possible at 4°C using a refrigerated centrifuge 
at approximately 3000 rpm for about 10 min.
Transfer  at least 500 µL of the supernatant plasma into polypropylene vials (e.g., Nunc 
cryo-tubes, 1.8 mL).
NOTE: Strictly  avoid contamination with erythrocytes: If this occurs, the specimen must be 
centrifuged again.
 Plasma will  be aliquoted into 2 cryovials per time-point. The screw cap polypropylene 
cryogenic tube will be labeled with the participant’s MR number,(for RPCI participants) 
participant’s initials, participant’s study number, clinical study number, protocol time point, 
dose, and protocol day. The samples will immediately be frozen at -70ºC or below until 
analyzed. Frozen samples will then be analyzed in RPCI’s Bioanalytics, Metabolomics & 
Pharmacokinetic Core Facility.
Samples collected  at RPCI will be processed and stored at RPCI’s Hematological Procurement 
Facility. Frozen samples will then be analyzed in RPCI’s Bioanalytics, Metabolomics &

9 EFFICACY  EVALUATIONS
9.1 Objective  Tumor Response
All protocol-defined imaging  studies must be performed at the investigative site or sponsor-
approved facility using protocol-defined parameters. The same method of assessment and the 
same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow-up. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess objective tumor response.
9.2 Target  Lesions
All measurable  lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, will be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size. Lesions with the 
longest diameter (short axis for lymph nodes) and are ≥ 10 mm (CT and MRI), ≥ 15 mm lymph 
nodes, > 20 mm CXR and are for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically) will be chosen. A sum of the longest diameter (short axis for lymph 
nodes) of all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. This 
will be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable 
dimension of the disease.
Complete  Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any lymph nodes must 
have a reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for response 
are first met.
Partial  Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by repeat studies performed no less than 6 weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met.
Progressive  Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as references the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered progression.
Stable  Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter while on study. 
Participants having a documented response with no confirmation of the response will be 
listed with stable disease.
9.3 Non-Target  Lesions
All other  small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or lymph nodes ≥ 10 mm to < 15 mm short 
axis) and non-measurable lesions (i.e., leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, blastic bone 
lesions, or abdominal masses / abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not

source documents at baseline. The general location will also be documented on the images 
drawing a regularly-shaped Region of Interest. Measurements of the non-target lesions will not 
be performed, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up and 
evaluation.
Complete  Response: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level, if applicable. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm 
short axis).
Non-Complete  Response/Non-Progressive Disease: Persistence of 1 or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the upper limits of normal.
Progressive  Disease: Appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of non-target 
lesions is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should 
prevail and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time.
9.4 Evaluation  of Response
Time point  response assessments will be performed every 8 weeks for 24 weeks, followed by 
assessments at every 12 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) with a confirmatory 
assessment (required for non-randomized trials) no less than 6 weeks after a PR or CR is 
deemed. To determine time point response, refer to Table 7 and Table 8 below.

efficacy in trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised.
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until the 
end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation. In general, the 
participant’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria and will be determined by combining the participant’s status of target 
lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesions.
Residual  Disease: Provide the appropriate information that pertains to this study.
Symptomatic  Deterioration: Participants with global deterioration of health status 
requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression 
at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be 
reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should 
be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration that may lead to discontinuation of 
treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:
oWeight  loss > 10% of body weight.
oWorsening  of disease-related symptoms (e.g., worsening dyspnea, increasing 
pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).
oDecline  in performance status of > 1 level on ECOG scale.
9.5 Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements  should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same  method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.
Clinical  Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 48 of 83Chest  x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable.
Conventional  CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body 
scans).
Use of  MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI 
is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. 
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over 
time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound  is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised. If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor  Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.
Cytology,  Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 49 of 83The cytological  confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
FDG-PET:  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis 
of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:
Negative  FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
No  FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG-PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
FDG-PET  may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by disease-specific medical literature for the indication. 
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG-PET  scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
9.6 Retrospective  Review of Disease status
Due to  indolent biology of neuroendocrine tumors, disease status prior to enrollment onto this 
clinical trial can help further inform primary endpoint of the study. Treating physician and/or PI 
at respective site are to review images on patients enrolled on study to determine disease status 
prior to enrollment on trial. All imaging modalities utilized prior to enrollment onto study are 
acceptable and RECIST evaluations are not required. Clinician/PI are to review images and 
clinical evaluations prior to being enrolled on this trial and determine disease status. Progressive 
disease can be captured as “radiographic progression”, “clinical progression”, or “clinical and 
radiographic progression”. If in the year prior to enrollment the patient had radiographic stable 
disease, please note “stable disease” and comment further on reason for change in treatment. 
Furthermore, imaging modalities utilized for above retrospective review are to be captured. Date 
for scan and/or clinical evaluation where progression is noted are to be entered in EDC.

humans, whether or not considered drug related (i.e., the event does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with the treatment). Therefore, an AE can be ANY unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, 
‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’). In addition, each study site will also be responsible for 
reporting causality of AEs to Boehringer Ingelheim as per Section 10.2.1.
An AE  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
in other study-related documents.
10.1.1.1 Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known,  a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information.
10.1.1.2 Adverse  Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general,  AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
However, clinically  significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on 
the CRF.
10.1.1.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically  significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
030818 Page 51 of 83cholecystitis), only  the diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event 
CRF.
If the  clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or 
SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as 
“hyperkalemia”
Observations of the same  clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes.
10.1.1.4 Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting  medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on 
an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has 
changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
10.1.1.5 Vital  Signs, ECG and Physical Examination Results
Changes in  vital signs, ECG and physical examination test results will be recorded as an AE in 
the CRF, if they are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
10.2 Adverse Events of Special Interests (AESI)
The following events are considered as Protocol-specified events of special interests:
Any  gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal perforation, leakage, fistula formation, or 
abscess.
In such  cases the following additional information will need to be collected, documented in the 
respective comment field of the CRF page and the respective narratives of the SAE, and be 
forwarded to Boehringer Ingelheim:
oLocation  of perforation, leakage, fistula, abscess
oLocation/extent  of abdominal tumor manifestations
oImaging  & reports (CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, pathology, etc.)
oPrior  surgery (location, wound healing complications)
oConcomitant diseases  with GI involvement (e.g., M Crohn, vasculitis, tuberculosis, 
diverticulitis)
oThromboembolic  events (or predisposition)
Drug-induced  liver injury.
Drug-induced liver  injury is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators and is 
considered a protocol-specified adverse event of special interest (AESI). Timely detection, 
evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to

and for the medical and scientific interpretation of the finding.
The following are considered as protocol-specified AESI:
oAn  elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in 
the same blood draw sample
oAn  elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.5 fold ULN combined with an elevation of 
bilirubin to >1.5 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample
oPatients  showing the above laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up until the 
protocol specific retreatment criteria have been met and according to Appendix E  
[Boehringer Ingelheim: Procedures for the follow-up of drug-induced liver injury 
(DILI)].
Protocol-specified AESI  are to be reported to Boehringer Ingelheim an expedited manner similar 
to Serious Adverse Events (Section 10.2), even if they do not meet any of the seriousness 
criteria.
10.2.1 Grading and Relationship to Drug
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version 4 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP
Version 4 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm.
AEs not  covered by specific terminology listed should be reported with common medical 
terminology, and documented according to the grading scales provided in the CTCAE Version 4.
The relationship of event to study drug will be documented by the Investigator as follows:
Unrelated:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.
Unlikely:  The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.
Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by other factors such as the participant’s 
clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot 
be reasonably explained by other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, 
therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Definite:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by other factors such as the participant’s condition, therapeutic interventions or 
concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following study drug administration, 
improves upon stopping the drug, or reappears on re-exposure.

The  severity of the AE should be judged based on the following:
The  severity of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the eCRF according 
to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) CTEP Version 4 of 
the NCI CTCAE located at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm Causal 
relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be  used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history. Assessment of causal relationship must be recorded for each adverse event.
Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”:
Yes: There  is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE (“Yes” is equivalent to: Possible, Probable or, Definite).
No:  There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE (“No” is equivalent to Unrelated or Unlikely).

10.3 Serious  Adverse Events
10.3.1 Definition
A serious adverse  event (SAE) is any adverse event (experience) that in the opinion of either the 
investigator or sponsor results in ANY of the following:
Death.
A  life-threatening adverse event (experience). Any AE that places a participant or 
participants, in the view of the Investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from

severe form, might have caused death.
Inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for > 24 hours).
A  persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.
A  congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Important  Medical Event (IME) that, based upon medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.
Patients may  be hospitalized for administrative or social reasons during the trial (e.g. days on 
which infusion takes place, long distance from home to site). These and other hospitalizations 
planned at the beginning of the trial do not need to be reported as an SAE.
10.3.2 Reporting  Serious Adverse Events 
Network Sites follow Appendix A: Instructions for Network Sites
All new  SAEs occurring from the date the participant signs the study consent until 30 days after 
the last intervention or a new treatment is started, whichever comes first, will be reported. The 
RPCI SAE Source Form is to be completed with all available information, including a brief 
narrative describing the SAE and any other relevant information. 
SAEs occurring  after the 30 day follow-up period that the investigator determines to be possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the study intervention should be reported.
SAEs identified  as an Unanticipated Problem by the Investigator must be reported. Please refer 
to Section 10.6 for details on reporting Unanticipated Problems.
10.4 Investigator  Reporting: Notifying Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and NCCN
The investigator  will report all SAEs and non-serious AEs which are relevant to a reported SAEs 
and AESIs by fax using BI IIS SAE form, or MedWatch 3500A, with the completed BI Fax 
Cover Sheet to BI Unique Entry Point and NCCN, as detailed below in accordance with the 
following timelines:
Within  5 calendar days upon receipt of initial and follow-up SAEs containing at least 
one fatal or immediately life-threatening event.
Within  10 calendar days  upon receipt of any other initial and follow-up SAEs.

For each adverse event,  the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity, treatment 
required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The investigator 
will determine the relationship and expectedness with the investigational drug to all AEs as 
defined in the listed adverse event section of Boehringer Ingelheim’s (BI’s) Investigator 
Brochure for the Product. 
The investigator  does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical 
trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the 
patient has completed the clinical trial (including any protocol specified follow-up period), it 
should be reported to BI if considered relevant by the investigator.
10.5 Follow-Up  for Serious Adverse Events
All related  SAEs should be followed to their resolution, until the study participant is lost to 
follow-up, the start of a new treatment, or until the study investigator assesses the event(s) as 
stable or irreversible. New information will be reported when it is received.
10.6 Unanticipated  Problems
10.6.1 Definition
An Unanticipated  Problem (UP) is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:
Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:
a) The  research procedures that are described in the study-related documents, including 
study deviations, as well as issues related to compromise of participant privacy or 
confidentiality of data.
b) The  characteristics of the participant population being studied.
oRelated  or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by the procedures involved in the research).
oSuggests  that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized and if in relation to an AE is also deemed Serious per 
Section 10.3.
10.6.2 Reporting  Unanticipated Problems
Unanticipated problem  reporting will begin at the time of participant consent. The Reportable 
New Information (RNI) Form will be submitted to the CRS Compliance Office within 1 business 
day of becoming aware of the Unanticipated Problem.

11 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
The RPCI  Data and Safety Monitoring Board will assess the progress of the study, the safety 
data, and critical efficacy endpoints. The DSMB will review the study annually and will make 
recommendations that include but not limited to; (a) continuation of the study, (b) modifications 
to the design (c) or termination of the study. Per request, all annual DSMB study outcomes will 
be made available to NCCN and BI.
12 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
12.1 Endpoints
12.1.1 Primary
The primary  endpoint is PFS, defined as the time interval from initiation of therapy, to its 
cessation for documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death. Disease progression will be 
determined by radiographic assessment every 8 weeks for first 24 weeks and then q 12 weeks 
thereafter.
12.1.2 Secondary
Clinical response  (complete response + partial response) measured using standard RECISTv1.1 
criteria will be reported in all patients with measurable disease. Median overall survival will be 
reported in all patients. Change in QOL throughout treatment using the EORTC QLQ – 
GI.NET21 questionnaire will be analyzed in all patients who have filled out at least two QOL 
questionnaires and reported in three groups based on response (response, stable disease or 
progressive disease). The circulating marker levels (Steady state PK, FGF and FGFR and 
sVEGFR2) and with dynamic contrast enhanced CT parameters will be reported and predictive 
value assessed using the PK/PD model previously developed by our group to explore association 
with PFS, clinical response, QOL and overall survival. The ratio of FGFR IIIb/IIIc and Ki-67, 
MVD scores will be obtained to investigate association with PFS, clinical response, QOL and 
survival. Gene mutations and copy number alterations in the several pathways particularly 
mTOR pathway will be evaluated as exploratory endpoints, and will be analyzed for all patients 
and correlated with clinical outcomes. Biomarkers, Treg and cytokine expression and growth 
factors will be analyzed for all patients and reported in groups based on response.
12.2 Sample  Size Determination
Two participating  institutions will enroll maximum of 30 evaluable patients over a 24 month 
period.
The sample  size calculation is based on testing the hypotheses concerning the PFS rate at 16 
weeks in patients treated under the proposed therapy: H0: p ≤ p 0 versus HA: p > p 0. This single-
stage design requires a total of n patients in order to achieve approximately 1-β power to detect

030818 Page 57 of 83differences of  ∆ percentage points (p 0 versus p0 +∆).  For this study α = 0.10 and 1-β =0.90; with 
p0=0.40 and =0.24 for this population of carcinoid patients. 
12.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics  (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics.
12.4 Efficacy  Analysis
The primary  objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the investigational agent 
nintedanib in carcinoid patients. Let p represent the PFS rate at 16 weeks. A true PFS rate at 16 
weeks of less than p0 =0.40 is considered unacceptable in carcinoid, and evidence of such will 
deem the treatment not worthy of further study.
The null  and alternative hypotheses to be tested are H0: p ≤ p 0 versus HA: p > p 0. A one-sided 
exact binomial test (at a nominal α=0.10) and corresponding decision rules will be used to 
evaluate these hypotheses:
If  15 patients or less have not progressed at 16 weeks, then it is concluded that the 
therapy is not promising.
If  16patients or more have not progressed at 16 weeks, then it will be concluded that the 
therapy is promising.
Additionally, a confidence  interval for the 16-week PFS rate will be obtained using Jeffrey’s 
prior method.
Secondary Analysis : The time-to-event outcomes (PFS and OS) will be reported using standard 
Kaplan-Meier methods.  Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the median PFS and OS will 
be calculated using Greenwood's formula. Exact 90% confidence interval estimates using the 
Clopper-Pearson method will be given for the response and toxicity rates. An exact 90% 
confidence interval will be given for the rate of improved QOL. Changes in pre- and post- 
treatment cytokine expression and growth factors will be analyzed using permutation paired t-
tests. Dichotomous variables, such as response and QOL, will be analyzed using the logistic 
regression to investigate their association with quantified variables, such as biomarker expression 
and gene mutation. The association between survival and quantified variables will be 
investigated using the Cox-proportional hazard model.
12.4.1 Adverse  Event
The frequency of toxicities  will be tabulated by grade across all dose levels and cycles. All 
participants who receive any study treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity.
Toxicity (graded  using the NCI CTC version 4.0) will be closely monitored and all toxicities will 
be tabulated. The PI, Data Safety Monitoring Board and IRB will monitor toxicities and close the 
study if the therapy appears too toxic.
12.5 Replacement
Patients that  do not have a response assessment completed by 16-weeks are considered 
unevaluable for the primary end-point and will be replaced.

13 CORRELATIVE  DATA ANALYSIS
Preliminary Data
Thalidomide is believed  to be an inhibitor of FGF2 induced angiogenesis and Dr. Shah and 
others (31, 32) have shown in phase 2 trials that thalidomide has activity in neuroendocrine cancers. 
The cytokine assays are commercially available and the PK/PD model proposed to be used (see 
below) has already been developed and validated. The rationally selected IHC assays have been 
previously standardized by our group.
Recently our  colleagues at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC determined the exomic sequences of 10 
nonfamilial pNETs and then screened the most commonly mutated genes in 58 additional 
pNETs. The most frequently mutated genes specify proteins implicated in chromatin remodeling: 
44% of the tumors had somatic inactivating mutations in MEN1, which encodes menin, a 
component of a histone methyltransferase complex, and 43% had mutations in genes encoding 
either of the two subunits of a transcription/chromatin remodeling complex consisting of DAXX 
(death-domain–associated protein) and ATRX (α thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-
linked). They also found mutations in genes in the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) 
pathway in 14% of the tumors, a finding that could potentially be used to stratify patients for 
treatment with mTOR inhibitors. These findings were provocative. However, clinical 
descriptions of these patients are unavailable. In addition, none of these tumors were 
resequenced at another point in time to better understand the evolution of these tumors. Indeed, 
most of the tumors were in patients that had early stage disease that was resected.
In addition, researchers at  the Mayo clinic recently performed whole genome sequencing in 
small bowel carcinoids.
Our group  has established assays for assessment of several immune subsets (29) showing T reg 
frequency and number in HCC patients being prospectively studied in another NCCN funded 
trial.
13.1 Plasma Biomarker PK/PD Modeling
A mechanistic  PK/PD model will be developed to characterize the time course of nintedanib 
concentrations in relation to target decreases in sVEGFR-2, FGF23, along with cytokine 
modulation.  Subsequently, diagnostic plots will be created to ascertain whether a trend exists 
among sVEGFR-2 levels, FGF23, immunological response, and progression free survival (PFS). 
 If trends exist, these endpoints will also be included in the PK/PD model.  A variety of 
compartmental population PK models will be evaluated using a nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling approach. The PK models explored will be described by the estimation of mean 
structural parameters (e.g., plasma volumes of distribution and clearances), the magnitude of 
inter-individual variability (IIV) in these parameters, and residual variability (RV). The model 
for IIV will be assumed that the variance is proportional with respect to the typical value of the 
PK parameter. This analysis will include evaluation of the influence of a limited number of 
patient covariates, such as demographics along with other cofactors, on the variability in select 
PK/PD parameters. Based on our sparse sampling approach, prior information on PK parameters 
and variances can be used with a Bayesian estimation method.  For comparisons of hierarchical

030818 Page 59 of 83models, the  change in the minimum value of the objective function (MVOF), a statistic that is 
proportional to minus twice the log likelihood of the data, will be examined. A change in the 
MVOF of greater than 7.88 between two hierarchical models represents a statistical difference at 
a p-level of 0.005 for the addition of one parameter (df = 1). The goodness-of-fit analyses will be 
additionally assessed by: (1) scatterplots of measured concentrations and weighted residuals 
versus population predicted concentrations, and weighted residuals versus time since first and 
last dose; (2) scatterplots of measured concentrations, individual weighted residuals, and 
absolute individual weighted residuals versus individual predicted concentrations; (3) the 
precisions of the parameter estimates as measured by the percent standard error of the mean 
(%SEM = standard error/parameter estimate * 100% ); (4) changes in the estimates of IIV and 
RV; and (5) histograms, boxplots, and plots of quantiles of individual and population weighted 
residuals versus quantiles of the normal distribution (QQ plots).
13.2 IMPACT  Assay
These assays  will be done in the first 10 patients who have adequate pre-treatment tumor tissue 
and, will have post treatment biopsies. Ideally patients with good response (aka the “outliers) 
will be chosen for biopsy upon disease progression.
Akt activity  will be determined by blotting for the phosphorylation of Akt downstream targets 
including p-Foxo, p-GSK3, p-PRAS40. IHC analysis of total AKT, p-Akt Ser473, PTEN, total 
4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1Thr70, p-eIF-4G Ser1108 (peIF-4G), total S6, p-S6 Ser235/236 and 
Ser240/244, and proliferation marker Ki-67 will also be performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded sections from the tumor samples (Refer to Appendix D) .

15 STUDY  RESPONSIBILITIES
15.1 Data Collection
Data entry into  the database is to be completed in a timely fashion (within 30 days) after the 
participant’s clinic visit. If an AE is considered serious it is captured on both the Adverse Event 
page and the Serious Adverse Event Source Form (as well as the BI SEA form), which is 
handled in an expedited fashion.
Data management  activities will be performed using eClinical. eClinical is a suite of software 
tools that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data 
management will design the study-specific database and facilitate its development by the 
eClinical Information Technology team. Once the database design is approved by the Principal 
Investigator, Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the database will be put into 
production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by those with the 
rights to do so into the eCRFs (via the EXPeRT Module). eClinical is compliant with all relevant 
technical aspects of relevant GCP guidelines.

MSK-IMPACT is  a NGS platform that was recently developed at MSKCC and uses massively 
parallel sequencing and solution-phase exon capture to perform NGS.(33-35) The platform screens 
341 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes commonly altered across tumor types, and provides a 
comprehensive analysis of multiple genes in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, including PIK3CA, 
AKT1/2/3, PTEN, TSC1/2, and mTOR, as well as SMAD family genes, AURKA, EGFR, 
HSP90, and PDGFR that were identified in the small bowel sequencing project.  The platform 
successfully identifies sequence variants, small insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, 
loss of heterozygosity, and select rearrangements. We will use MSK-IMPACT to perform NGS 
in pre-treatment and drug-resistant tumor with germ-line DNA (whole blood) as a reference.
After MSK-IMPACT  sequencing has been performed in both pre-treatment and drug-resistant 
tumor, Dr Raj and Dr. Reidy will work with the genetics experts in the MSKCC Center for 
Molecular Oncology to clinically translate our findings, reviewing and interpreting the results for 
biologic and clinical significance. In particular, they will look at changes in the mTOR pathway 
(AKT) to investigate if any observed mutations may confer resistance to nintedanib. All 
IMPACT Assay Samples can be sent to the following address below along with site name and

Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) Biopsy Samples
Any  target tumor tissue can be collected per discretion of the PI, providing physician, 
and/or surgical/ radiology team members.
At  minimum, adequate tissue should be collected for 20 unstained and one (1)H&E 
stained slide that are 4-5µm thick and on positively charged slides. Tissue should be 
formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FPPE). 
Ideally,  biopsy should be performed prior to introduction of new chemo/radiation; 
however, this is not required.
Blood Sample Collection and Processing
Germline DNA is required for comparison with tumor tissue. Patients will be asked to provide 
whole blood samples via venipuncture using one (1) 10 mL lavender top EDTA collection tubes. 
Samples will be labeled as “Post Treatment IMPACT Assay Blood Samples” along with date of 
collection, protocol number, and study participant identification number. Sample will be kept in 
ambient temperature and shipped overnight to MSK.
Ideally, the blood sample should be obtained on the same day and prior to the IMPACT biopsy. 
However, this blood sample can be collected any time after the patient is taken off nintedanib. 
Results of the IMPACT assay will not be made available to the patient.

Procedures for the follow-up of a potential DILI case 
(Hy`s
 Law case) in IIS with nintedanib (BIBF 1120)
______________________________________________________________________________
Introduction
Drug-induced liver injury
Drug-induced liver  injury (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safety-related drug 
marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g., iproniazid), continuing to the present (e.g., 
ticrynafen, benoxaprofen, bromfenac, troglitazone, nefazodone). Accordingly, detection of drug-
induced liver injury of an investigational compound has become an important aspect of patient´s 
safety guarding in drug development.
The US-FDA has published a Guidance for Industry entitled, “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: 
Premarketing Clinical Evaluation” 
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf ) which outlines the 
detection, evaluation, follow-up and reporting of drug-induced liver injury in clinical trials. 
Drugs that have the potential for inducing severe liver injury may be identified by marked peak 
aminotransferase elevations (10x-, 15xULN), or the combination of hepatocellular injury 
(aminotransferase elevation ≥3xULN) and altered liver function (hyperbilirubinemia ≥2xULN) 
which is defined as potential “Hy´s law case” if not explained by other causes including evidence 
of biliary obstruction (i.e., significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase, ALP, >2X ULN) or some 
other explanation of the injury (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcohol hepatitis, concomitant use of other known 
hepatotoxic drugs). This constellation predicts a poor outcome and although very rare, these 
potential cases have to be well characterized as soon as being identified as other confounding 
conditions may be the cause.
In further  consideration of this FDA Guidance, any potential “Hy’s Law case” has to be reported 
in an expedited manner to the FDA (i.e., even before all other possible causes of liver injury have 
been excluded) and be followed-up appropriately. The follow-up includes a detailed clinical 
evaluation and identification of possible alternative etiologies for the “Hy´s Law case” 
constellation such as concomitant diseases (e.g. Hepatitis B) and/or other concomitant therapies 
that might potentially be hepatotoxic.
Although rare, a  potential for drug-induced liver injury is under constant surveillance by 
sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-
up of laboratory alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients´ safety.
The concept  below has been worked out by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) in order to guard patient´s 
safety and  to respond to regulatory requirements. It is the basis for all clinical studies and should 
be applied as appropriate.

030818 Page 70 of 83Definition
The following  changes in the laboratory values are considered to be a protocol-specific 
significant adverse event for all patients with normal values for ALT/AST at baseline:
an  elevation of ALT and / or AST > 5x ULN without bilirubin elevation measured in the 
same blood draw sample
an  elevation of AST and/or ALT >2.5 fold ULN combined with an elevation of bilirubin 
to >1.5 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample
These definitions  are in line with the current dose reduction recommendations as outlined in all 
study protocols for BIBF 1120.
Patients showing  these laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up until the protocol 
specific retreatment criteria have been met.
For patients  with elevated ALT/AST values at baseline special considerations apply, if they are 
eligible for inclusion into the trial, e.g. if liver metastasis are present and do not qualify as 
exclusion criterion. For those special cases the BI contact person should be involved.
Procedures
1. Protocol-specified  significant events are to be reported in an expedited manner similar as 
Serious Adverse Events, even if they do not meet any of the seriousness criteria and 
documented in the eCRF.
2. Replication  of the following laboratory tests for confirmation within 48 hours:
AST,  ALT
Bilirubin  measurement (total and direct bilirubin)
Alkaline  Phosphatase
Haptoglobin
Complete blood count and cell morphology
Reticulocyte count
CK
LDH
The results  of these repeated laboratory tests must be documented on the eCRF /CRF forms and 
reported immediately via the SAE form to BI.

1. Obtain  at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24-hour urine)
2. Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)
3. Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
4. Divide  #2 by #3 above: urine protein / creatinine ratio = protein concentration (mg /dL) /
Creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
The UPC  directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hr (i.e., a 
UPC of 1 should be equivalent to 1 g protein in a 24 hr urine collection)
Protein and  creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not 
dipsticks. If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, 
their measurements and reports may need to be requested.

030818 Page 75 of 83Appendix H Isolation of Mononuclear Cells
Protocol for Isolation of Mononuclear cells by Density Gradient Separation
Principle
This procedure  describes a method for isolation of mononuclear cells from circulating blood.  
Histopaque®-1077 is a solution of polysucrose and sodium diatrizoate, adjusted to a density of 
1.077 +0.001 g/mL. This medium facilitates rapid recovery of viable mononuclear cells from 
small volumes of blood.
Anticoagulated blood  is layered onto Histopaque®-1077.  During centrifugation, erythrocytes 
and granulocytes are aggregated by polysucrose and rapidly sediment; whereas, lymphocytes and 
other mononuclear cells remain at the plasma-Histopaque®-1077 interface.  Erythrocyte 
contamination is negligible.  Most extraneous platelets are removed by low speed centrifugation 
during the washing steps.
Reagents and Supplies
Histopaque®-1077”Ficoll” (Sigma Aldrich cat#10771)
RPMI 1640
Hanks balanced salt Solution (HBSS)
Phosphate Buffered Solution (PBS)
Fetal calf serum (FCS)
15 or 50mL polypropylene tubes
Procedure
1 Dilute  blood in a 1:1 dilution with either HBSS or PBS. Calculate the amount of Ficoll to 
be used; it will be half of the volume of diluted blood (e.g., for 8ml diluted blood you will 
need 4ml of Ficoll).
2 Place  the Ficoll in the bottom of the polypropylene tube.
3 Carefully  layer sample over the tube of Ficoll. Do not pipette the sample too quickly as 
mixing will occur.
4 Centrifuge  the sample for 30 minutes at 400g, 25˚C and most importantly without the 
brake.
5 After  the centrifuge has stopped, the cells need to be removed from the Ficoll 
immediately and washed because the Ficoll solution is toxic to cells. The mononuclear 
layer should be visible as a cloudy white disk at the interface of the plasma-Ficoll layers, 
roughly in the middle of the tube.  Carefully remove and discard the top layer of plasma 
and media until there is only a small amount left above the cell layer.
6 Next,  remove the mononuclear layer (the cloudy disk) taking care not to disturb the red 
cell layer below, and place in a sterile tube.

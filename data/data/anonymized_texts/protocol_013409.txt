 Abstract  
 
Background: Antidepressants are commonly prescribed by primary care providers  for treating 
depression, anxiety , and other conditions . A trial and error  approach is typically used to identify 
effective therapy. Treatment efficacy and safety of many antidepressants can vary based on 
the presence of certain disease s and metabolism gene types. Pharmacogenomic  (PGx) testing 
provides phenotypic classification of individuals as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultra -
rapid CYP450 metabolizers. This allows  more accura te drug selection for efficacy and dosing 
to minimize toxicity.  
 
Objective: To determine the preliminary effectiveness of PGx testin g for selection of effective 
antidepressant, medication adherence, depressive symptoms, and healthcare utilization. To 
determine acceptability of PGx testing in primary care among patients and providers.  
 
Methods : This is a 6 -month randomized, wait -listed,  controlled pilot trial conducted in 6 
department of family medicine (DFM) clinics at the University of Michigan (UM). We will enroll 
physicians pract icing at a UM DFM clinical site  who are willing to utilize PGx test results in 
conjunction with treating p atients prescribed  certain antidepressant s. We will also enroll 
patients of these DFM physicians who are adult s with  a new prescription for an antidepressant  
(within the past 4 weeks) including patients who have switched to a new antidepressant from 
anothe r antidepressant or have added on a new antidepressant to current antidepressant 
therapy . Patients are excluded if taking an antidepressant for more than 4 weeks  and if they 
have had PGx testing in the past .  
 
Physician participants will complete a baselin e survey to assess demographics, and 
knowledge, acceptability and utility of PGx testing for this population. At the conclusion of the 
study, physician participants will complete a semi -structured interview to assess knowledge, 
satisfaction, feasibility, a cceptability, effectiveness, barriers to widespread adoption, and utility 
of PGx testing.  
 
All patients will complete a baseline, 3 -, and 6 -month assessment; control patients will have an 
additional 9 -month assessment. Data to be collected include reasons  for antidepressant  use, 
depression and anxiety symptoms and severity, functional health status (SF -12), PGx 
knowledge, work status changes, demographic information, physician and emergency 
department visits, adverse effects, and medication alterations and  adherence.

 2.0 Introduction  
According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , between 2011 and 2014, 10.7% of 
Americans reported taking at least one antidepressant in the past month. [1] Antidepressants 
were the third most commonly used medic ation after cholesterol and pain medications. 
Antidepressants are prescribed for the management of depression , anxiety , and other 
conditions . Given that the time from initiation of pharmacologic treatment to clinical effect takes 
two to four weeks,[ 2, 3] coupled with the fact that the initial medication may not be effective, 
thus necessitating adjustments to dosages or medications, treatment with an antidepressant 
can be a long and complicated process, during which patients still experienc e symptoms. 
Strategies to improve treatment often include switching patient s to a different antidepressant or 
prescribing an additional antidepressant.[ 4]  
One reason for poor response to antidepressants can be attributed to the drug metabolism 
process. Many of the most com monly prescribed antidepressants undergo phase one 
xenobiotic metabolism by a class of enzymes in the P450 superfamily. This family of enzymes 
exhibits a high degree of genetic polymorphism, resulting in variable  metaboli sm. Because of 
this variation  in P4 50, we can classify individuals as poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultra -
rapid metabolizers. The consequence of this population heterogeneity is that medications are 
metabolized at different rates and plasma concentrations of specific drugs can be outsi de of 
the optimal range, which may result in adverse drug events  or lack of therapeutic effect . 
Because of these two medication outcomes, treatment may be discontinued.  
Pharmacog enomic (PGx)  testing of several cytochrome P 450 genes and the most frequently 
described functional variants (CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2) can be used to 
predict the metabolic capacity of an individual . For example, it is estimated that 5 -10% of 
Caucasian individuals are poor metabolizers and  1-2% are ultra -rapid metabolizers based on 
CYP2D6 phenotypes.[ 5] By knowing a patient ’s genetic information and the drug’s major 
metabolic pathway, we can prospectively assess the appropriateness of specific medications, 
modifying the dosing or using enha nced monitoring. By identifying th e approximately 10% of 
individuals who will not metabolize antidepressants  properly  via the CYP2D6 pathway, we may 
be better able to identify effective treatment options and minimize adverse effects .  
While the promise of this personalized medicine approach has been high, clinical uptake of 
PGx testing has lagged behind due to a combination of factors, including but not limited to 
provider confusion , lack of expertise, lack of studies confirming clinical utility, cost of te sting, 
and a lack of an integrated approach.[ 6]  
3.0 Objectives  
PGx testing could greatly improve the use of antidepressants  by aiding prescribers in 
identifying proper medications for individual patients; thus potentially improving medication 
adherence, as we ll as reducing symptoms and a ntidepressant side  effects .  
This pilot study will explore the use  of PGx testing in prima ry care , and is guided by several 
specific aims:  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 6 of 16 
 Specific Aim 1: To determine the effect of PGx testing on the primary outcome of physici an 
treatment decisions, as measured by the change in the proportion of patients who are 
prescribed medications at baseline that are contraindicated according to the PGx test, 
compared to the proportion at six-month follow -up.  
Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of PGx testing on secondary outcomes measures of 
interest, including change in symptoms  and severity  and medication adherence from baseline 
to six -month follow -up.  
Specific Aim 3: To determine the acceptability of PGx testing in primary care am ong patients 
and physicians.   
4.0 Resources and Personnel  
4.1 Setting  
This study will be conducted with physicians and patients recruited from the University 
of Michigan (UM) Department of Family Medicine  (DFM) , which has six clinical sites; 
Briarwood (Ann Arbor), Domino’s Farms (Ann Arbor), Ypsilanti, Chelsea, Dexter, and 
Livonia.

 4.3 External Partners  
All blood specimens will be sent for analy sis to Progenity , a CLIA -accredited molecular 
diagnostics laboratory  in Ann Arbor, MI . Progenity will provide a report for each sample 
to the study staff  via MiShare  or other secure transmission method , who will in turn 
release the results to physicians , along with any treatm ent recommendations based on 
the test results,  via MiChart . The arrangement between UM and Progenity  is covered by 
a contract .  
5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
This study will include two different populations of participants; primary care physicians 
and their patients who have been recently prescribed and taking one of the following 
antidepressants: citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac , 
Prozac Weekly, Rapiflux, Sarafem, Selfemra ), fluvoxamine (Luvox , Luvox CR), 
paroxetine (Paxil , Paxil CR), sertraline (Zoloft), duloxetine (Cymbalta , Irenka ), 
venlafaxine (Effexor , Effexor XR), nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor), bupropion ( Forfivo, 
XL, Wellbutrin , Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL ), mirtazapine (Remeron ,  Remeron Soltab ), 
or vortioxetine ( Trintellix ). We will recruit and enroll approximately 30 UM DFM 
physicians to participate in this study. For physician participants, we will obtain consent 
and then conduct assessments of baseline PGx knowledge, as well as semi -structured 
interviews and surveys regarding their experiences at the conclusion of the study.  
Please see Figure 1 for  physician participant study flow.  
From those participating physicians , we will recruit 100 of their adult patients who have 
been newly prescribed one of the antidepressants listed above . These patient 
participants will be enrolled in a s ix-month randomized wait-listed control pilot study .  
Patient participants will meet with study staff for consent and baseline data collection  at 
a Michigan Clinical Research Unit (MCRU) in either Domino’s Farms or the 
Cardiovascular Center . Once consent and baseline data collection are complete, 
participants  will have their blood drawn by  MCRU laboratory staff . A single 4 mL 
Lavender  top EDTA tube of blood will be drawn. Once the blood draw is complete, 
study staff will send the sample to Progenity for analysis. After the baseline assessment 
is complete, patient participants will be random ized equally to either have their test 
results sent immediately to their participating primary care physicians  once available , or 
to have their test results sent in three months.  Randomization  will be stratified by 
physician  in ten block units to ensure ba lance by physician. PharmDs on the research 
team (Ellingrod and M itrzyk ) will be available to consult with physician participants at 
any time during the study; however, our study PharmDs will meet with each 
participating physician at least once, when their  first patient PGx test results are 
available  to provide general , as well as patient specific education about the PGX test 
and results . These consultations will help physicians to interpret PGx test results, and 
may help to guide treatment decisions , if necessary. Study pharmacists or staff will not 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 8 of 16 
 provide PGx results to patients; it is up to the patient’s physician to provide this 
information if he/she feels it is appropriate. Likewise, although study pharmacists may 
make treatment recommendations based o n the PGx test results, it is up to the treating 
physician to decide whether to act on those recommendations. All intervention patient 
participants will be followed for a total of 6 months , with phone -based follow -up 
assessments occurring at 3 - and 6 -month s. All c ontrol patients will be followed for 9 
months , with phone -based follow -up assessments occurring at  3-, 6-, and 9 -months. 
Please see Figure 2 for  patient participant study flow.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 9 of 16 
 Figure 2: Patient Participant Study Flow  
 
Physicians  and patients  enrolled in this study will be exposed to minimal risk . 
Participants in both arms of the study will undergo PGx testing. Physicians for 
intervention group participants will receive PGx test  results as soon as the y are 
available, whereas those participants in the waitlisted control group will receive their 
test results three months after enrollment. Because the current standard of care does 
not involve the use of PGx testing, our waitlisted c ontrol group is not exposed to any 
additional risk above and beyond usual care. To clarify, the intervention under 
investigation in this study is the PGx test. We will not  directly  intervene in the clinical 
care of a patient, as all clinical decision makin g is at the discretion of the physician 
managing a patient’s care. All participants in this study  may benefit because their 
antidepressant medi cation may be  tailored to their pharmacogenomic profile. Although 
both populations of participants run risks asso ciated with breaches of privacy due to 
electronic storage of study data, every effort will be made to minimize these risks.  
5.2 Recruitment Methods  
To conduct this pilot RCT, we will recruit from two populations of participants; primary 
care physicians, a nd 100 patients of those physicians who have been newly  prescribed 
a certain antidepressant .  
5.2.1 Physician Participants  
Physician participants will be recruited through presentation s of the study at UM 
DFM Grand Rounds  and faculty business meetings , clinical site staff meetings, 
and targeted emails and letters to all UM DFM physicians who treat patients. 

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 10 of 16 
 Study staff may also call providers who have not responded to recruitment 
letters /emails  up to two times. In the even t that a potential participant is eligible 
to participate in the study, except for the fact that their primary care provider is 
not yet participating, we will attempt to recruit the provider through up to two 
additional emails and two additional phone call s. Any provider who indicates that 
they are not interested in participating will not be contacted further.  Provider 
participants will receive no incentives for their participation in this study.  
5.2.2 Patient  Participants  
For patient participant recruitmen t, once UM DFM physicians have been 
consented and enrolled, we will recruit their patient s who have new prescription 
for an antidepressant (with the past 4 weeks  prior to screening ) from the 
following list: citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluox etine (Prozac , 
Prozac Weekly, Rapiflux, Sarafem, Selfemra ), fluvoxamine (Luvox , Luvox CR), 
paroxetine (Paxil , Paxil CR), sertraline (Zoloft), duloxetine (Cymbalta , Irenka ), 
venlafaxine (Effexor , Effexor XR), nortriptyline ( Aventyl, Pamelor), bupropion 
(Forfivo, XL, Wellbutrin , Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL ), mirtazapine (Remeron , 
Remeron Soltab ), or vortioxetine ( Trintellix) . These potential patient participants 
will be identified through direct provider referral  via flags to providers in MiChart 
and patient brochure s, signs and brochures  posted  in the UM DFM clinical sites,  
and targeted recruitment letters , followed by recruitment phone calls,  to patients 
who meet eligibility cr iteria as identified in MiChart .  
To fac ilitate the delivery of targeted recruitment letters to potential patient 
participants, we will obtain lists of potentially eligible participants from the Data  
Office  on a rolling basis. L etters will be batched and sent in waves.  
To thank patient particip ants for their participation in this study, we will provide a 
$20 check after each data collection assessment ( up to $60 for intervention 
group participants, and up to $80 for waitlisted control group participants) . All 
incentives will be pro -rated for par tial study completion. Incentives will be 
distributed by the UM Treasurer’s office through the Hum an Subjects Incentive 
Program.  
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
We will obtain written informed consent from both groups of  participants in this study  
(physic ians and their patients ). First, research staff (including project coordinators and 
research assistants) will describe the study to phys ician participants  and obtain written 
informed consent . Once physician participants are consented and enrolled, we will then 
recruit patients of those physicians who are newly prescribed a certain antidepressant . 
Research staff (including project coordinators and research assistants) will explain the 
study to  patient participants and written informed consent will be obtai ned. Any 
participant who is un able t o provide consent for himself/herself  will be excluded from 
this study.  Whenever possible, study staff will seek to conduct consent and baseline 
data collec tion at the MCRU site in order reduce burden on participants.

5.5 Study Evaluations  
5.5.1 Physician Participants  
Physician participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to 
consent and enrollment. After enrollment, all physician participants will complete 
a baseline survey that assesses demographics and participant characteristics, 
knowledge of PGx testing, as well as perceptions of the acceptability and utility 
of PGx testing in primary care. At the conclusion of the study, physician 
participants will complete a semi -structured interview and survey that will assess 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Page 12 of 16 
 knowledge of PGx testing, whet her they recommended PGx testing to other 
physicians, or ordered PGx testing on patients not included in this study; as well 
as perceptions of the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness , and utility of PGx 
testing in primary care , including barriers to widespread adoption, as well as 
satisfaction . Surveys/interviews will be audio recorded  when permitted by 
participants . Please see Table 1  for physician participant measures and timing 
of assessment.

5.5.2 Patient Participants  
Patient participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to 
consent and enrollment . After enrollment, all patient participants will complete a 
baseline , 3-, and 6 -month  assessment . Control patients will have a n additional  
9-month assess ment of the previously mentioned items. All baseline data will be 
collected via paper forms and then transferred into REDCap, whereas 3 -, 6-, 
and 9 -month assessments will be conducted via phone and entered directly into 
REDCap by study personnel. The const ructs, measures , and data collection 
times are shown in Table 2. In addition to these measures collected during data 
collection visits, data will be extracted from MiChart to document treatment , 
including medication changes, and healthcare utilization for patient participants 
during the study. We will also extract any available PHQ -9 and GAD -7 data, 
which is now collected as a part of routine clinical practice. Surveys/interviews 
will be audio recorded  when permitted by participants .

 5.6 Data A nalys es 
In this study, w e expect to enroll up to 30 physician participants and expect a retention 
rate of 90 -100%. We also expect to enroll about 100 patient participants and expect a 
retention rate of 80% at the completion of this study.  
Data from this study will be analyzed by the study statistician.  Survey data will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics. Multiple -choice questions will be analyzed using 
standard quantitative techniques including Chi square and t -test. Open -ended 
responses will be independently coded using qualitative methods, includi ng any 
transcripts that result from the recorded survey responses.  
Independent sample t -tests will be used to compare outcomes  between 
intervention and control groups at each time point, as well as at similar time 
points after test results were released to physicians (i.e. bas eline for intervention 
vs. 3 mo nth for control group). Linear mixed models will assess the change in 
outcomes, as well as whether the change is similar between groups. This will be 
done by including time, study  group, and a time by study  group interaction as 
predictors of each outcome. Time will be considered in two ways, first as the 
time in study, and secondly as time since test results were released to 
physicians. In the latter, only data from 3 -month to 9 -month will be in cluded for 
the control group, and baseline to 6 -month for intervention group, due to timing 
of test result release. Models will be adjusted for patient demographics.   
 
5.7 Withdrawal  of Subjects  
Participants may be withdrawn from the study without their consent if the PI feels that it 
is unsafe for the participant to continue to participate , or if they refuse the blood draw . 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time by contacting study staff  either in 
writing or by calling the study hotline .

 7.0 Reporting  
Participants  will be requested to call the study hotline to report any adverse events (AEs) or 
unanticipated problems . All staff will be directed to report any serious ( SAEs ), protocol 
deviations, and unanticipated problems to the Project Coordinator as soo n as possible.  The 
Project Coordinator or the PI will submit the appropriate documentation to the UM IRB or other 
department as required.  
8.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
This study will utilize PHI including the following elements: name, date of birth, full mailing 
address , clinic dates, phone numbers, email addresses, social security nu mbers, medical 
record numbers. All study staff -generated electronic study data including participant identifiers 
will be securely maintained in REDCap, or a UM restricted server, in an access -limited folder, 
with access given only to specified project staff.  All participants will be ass igned a study ID, 
which will be associated with their survey data. Although we will maintain a file that links patient 
MRN  and study ID, this will be kept separate from other study data, in a manner consistent with 
UM policies for PHI. The results of the P rogenity Informed PGx tests will be transmitted back to 
study staff via secure means such as MiShare and stored  securely in access -limited folders . All 
paper records and audio recordings and equipment with patient identifiers will be kept in a 
locked office, in locked file cabinets . Access to the file cabinets will be restricted to approved 
study personnel.   
 
PHI sent to Progenity as part of ordering the PGx test is protected as required by the contract.  
9.0 Communication Plan  
Prior to the start of this study, the research team will complete the process for obtaining 
approval to recruit participants from UM DFM clinical sites, which includes obtaining permission 
from the UM DFM Associate Chair for Research (Dr. Caroline Richardson), as well as clinical 
site medi cal directors.  
Any proposed changes to the study protocol which would change the role of the recruitment 
sites will be communicated via email to UM DFM Associate Chair for Research  and the  clinical

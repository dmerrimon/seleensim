Study Design
 
& Summary of Visit Schedule
:
 
This Phase 3 study will evaluate APP13007 
in comparison to
 
the matching vehicle placebo in a 
randomized, parallel
-
group, double
-
masked fashion. 
The 
subject
s
 
will have
 
undergone
 
routine cataract 
surgery on Day 0 of the study and will be assessed the next day (POD1) after uncomplicated surgery for 
eligibility 
for
 
r
andomization to study treatment.
 
Subject
s
 
who experience postoperative inflammation on POD1 and who meet all other eligibility criteria 
will be randomized to one of two study treatments (either Treatment 1 or Treatment 2)
 
at 
a 1:1
 
ratio
:
  
 

 
Treatment 1:  
1 drop APP13007 twice daily (BID) (morning and evening) for 14 days 
instilled 
to 
the operated study eye
 

 
Treatment 2:  
1 drop matching vehicle placebo BID (morning and evening) for 14 days 
instilled 
to 
the operated study eye

Protocol Synopsis
 
Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
 
Study Drugs (APP13007
 
or matching vehicle placebo) will be supplied in an eye drop bottle. The 
formulations are preserved with benzalkonium chloride filled in a multi
-
dose opaque low density 
polyethylene (LDPE) 5 mL round dropper bottle with a LDPE tip and tightly closed with 
a 
pink 
high 
density polyethylene (HDPE) cap. The bottle will be labelled in accordance with FDA regulations for an 
investigational product. 
 
One bottle of study drug will be dispensed to each 
randomized 
subject
 
in the trial. Study drug will be 
administered
 
twice daily (morning and evening) by instilling one drop 
at each dosing time
 
into the 
conjunctival sac of the study eye. If the 
subject
 
misses his/her eye during instillation, then a second drop 
will be instilled and this will be documented in the dosing 
diary.
 
Randomization:  
Subject
s
 
who meet all eligibility criteria on POD1 will be randomized to one of the 
two study treatments 
at
 
a 1:1 ratio (
APP13007
:pl
acebo).

Statistical Methods:
 
All analysis variables will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. Summary statistics for 
continuous measures will include the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range. Categorical measures will be s
ummarized by the number and percent of subjects. 
 
Analyses of Primary Efficacy Endpoints:
 
The primary efficacy analyses to compare APP13007
 
against placebo will be conducted on the Intent
-
To
-
Treat (ITT) population using the Pearson Chi
-
square statistic. Fixed sequence testing will be 
employed to maintain the 2
-
sided alpha = 0.05. The primary analyses will first test the difference in the 
prop
ortion of subjects with ACC count = 0 (Grade = 0) at POD8 (Visit 4) maintained through POD15 
(Visit 5)
 
between treatment groups. If the test is statistically significant at the 2
-
sided alpha = 0.05 level 
in favor of APP13007, the difference in the proporti
on of subjects with Ocular Pain Grade = 0 at POD4 
(Visit 3) maintained through POD15 (Visit 5) between treatment groups will be tested at the two
-
sided 
alpha = 0.05 level. 
 
Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
 
Mean 
change
-
from
-
baseline in ACC Grade, O
cular Pain Grade, ACF Grade and visual acuity at PODs 4, 
8 and 15 will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model will 
include treatment as 
a 
fixed effect and baseline as a covariate. The rest of secondary efficacy endpoints 
wil
l be analyzed using the same method described for the primary efficacy endpoints. 
Rescued subjects 
will be considered to be treatment failures.
 
Safety Analysis:
 
The safety analysi
s will summarize ocular treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) in the study eye and o
cular 
AEs for the non
-
study eye. Ocular and non
-
ocular TEAEs will be summarized similarly. 
 
 
The other safety endpoints will be summarized as discussed in the Statistical Considerations section of 
the protocol.

INTRODUCTION
 
1.1
 
Overview
 
APP13007 is an ophthalmic nanosuspension that is prepared by dispersing nanomilled 
 
, a corticosteroid, with a mixture of excipients in a multi
-
dose preserved aqueous 
 
1.2
 
Background
 
1.2.1
 
 
Corticosteroids regulate cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation and protein synthesis, 
and like other corticosteroids, CP has anti
-
inflammatory and vasoconstrictive properties. The 
mechanism of the anti
-
inflammatory activity of CP is unclear, but it is thought to act by inducing 
lipocortins, proteins that inhibit phospholipase A2, an enzyme 
that releases arachidonic acid 
from membrane phospholipids. By inhibiting phospholipase A2, lipocortins control the 
biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
 
CP is an analog of prednisolone with a very high d
egree of activity at the glucocorticoid receptor 
and only slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity

Pain and Inflammation Following Cataract Surgery
 
Despite modern advances in surgical technique, trauma that 
occurs during cataract removal and 
intraocular lens placement regularly leads to some degree of inflammation. The cellular damage 
on the surface of the cornea activates an inflammatory process that manifests initially as 
hyperemia, corneal edema, and incre
ased anterior chamber cells and flare. More serious 
complications such as corneal edema, increases in intraocular pressure (IOP), cystoid macular 
edema (CME), and posterior capsule opacification may result if the inflammatory process is not 
managed appropr

or this purpose, a post

regimen of anti

inflammatory agents (such as corticosteroi
ds) is typically prescribed because it 
reverses inflammation, pain and discomfort and reduces the risk of further complications. When 
administered at the time of surgery and during the immediate postoperative period,

Rationale for Development of 
APP13007
 
Topical ocular 
administration of corticosteroids is a well
-
established therapy for the treatment of 
inflammation and pain after ocular surgery
 
(
Aptel 2017
)
, 
and several marketed products are 
currently available th
at contain active ingredients such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, 
loteprednol etabonate and difluprednate. 
 
CP has been used for over 30 years in the US, Europe and Japan to treat the inflammatory and 
pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive d
ermatoses such as psoriasis, eczema and 
atopic dermatitis. CP has not been previously developed for ophthalmic use, presumably due to 
its lack of aqueous solubility. Nevertheless, given its increased potency, an aqueous ophthalmic 
formulation of CP has the
 
potential to produce rapid clearance of anterior chamber cells (ACC), 
return of visual acuity and relief of pain after ocular surgery, surpassing the effectiveness of 
corticosteroids currently on the market. 
 
APP13007 is an ophthalmic nanosuspension that 
is prepared by dispersing nanomilled CP with a 
mixture of excipients. The proprietary nanomilling technology allows CP to be formulated as an 
aqueous suspension. This suspension of CP nanoparticles in APP13007 is designed to promote 
efficient penetration o
f CP into the eye upon ocular surface instillation, thus delivering 
therapeutically relevant concentrations of CP to the target tissues within the eye.

growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward 
effects. It is not known whether ocular administration of APP13007 could result in 
sufficient systemic absorption of CP to produce detectable concentrations
 
in human milk.

Potential Class
-
Related Ocular Risks Associated with Corticosteroid Therapies 
for the Treatment of Ocular Inflammation and Pain after Ocular Surgery
 
The active ingredient in APP13007, 
 is a po
tent corticosteroid so it has the following 
anticipated ocular risks associated with the corticosteroid class:
 

 
Intraocular pressure (IOP) increase 
–
 
prolonged use may result in glaucoma with damage to 
the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and field of 
vision. 
 

 
Cataracts 
–
 
Prolonged use 
 may result in posterior subcapsular cataract 
formation in the non
-
operated eye.


 
Delayed healing 
–
 
Use 
 after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase 
the incidence of bleb formation. In thos
e diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, 
perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical corticosteroids. 
 

 
Risk of Infection
 
o
 
Bacterial infections 
–
 
Prolonged use 
 may suppress the host immune 
response and thus increase 
the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent 
conditions, corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.
 
o
 
Viral infections 
–
 
Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may 
exacerbate the severity of many viral
 
infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). 
 
o
 
Fungal Infections 
–
 
Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop 
coincidentally with long
-
term local corticosteroid application. Fungus invasion must be 
considered in any persistent c
orneal ulceration while a 
subject
 
is participating in this 
clinical trial.
 
In clinical studies evaluating the use of corticosteroids after ocular surgery, ocular adverse 
reactions that occurred in 5% to 15% of 
subject
s included corneal edema, ciliary and 
c
onjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, photophobia, posterior capsule opacification, anterior chamber 
cells, anterior chamber flare, conjunctival edema, and blepharitis. Other ocular adverse reactions 
occurring in 1% to 5% of 
subject
s included reduced visual acu
ity, punctate keratitis, eye 
inflammation, and iritis. Ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of 
subject
s included 
application site discomfort or irritation, corneal pigmentation and striae, episcleritis, eye pruritus, 
eyelid irritation and cru
sting, foreign body sensation, increased lacrimation, macular edema, 
sclera hyperemia, and uveitis. Most of these reactions may have been the consequence of the 
surgical procedure.

Topical ocular administration of corticosteroids is a well
-
established therapy for the treatment of 
inflammation and pain 
after ocular surgery, with multiple marketed products currently available 
that utilize corticosteroids as the active ingredient such as dexamethasone (Maxidex
®
), 
prednisolone (PredForte®), loteprednol etabonate (Lotemax
®
, Inveltys
®
, Lotemax SM
®
),
 
and 
diflu

In all clinical trials, corticosteroid therapies were dosed at a frequency 
of twice daily or more frequently.

ocular surgery that a proportion of 
subject
s randomized to placebo improve in the days following 
surgery (Lo

Subject

proportion of 
subject
s receiving placebo may 
show improvement of inflammation
 
in the days 
following surgery. Furthermore, the risks to 
subject
s randomized to placebo in this study are 
mitigated as much as possible. Specifically, the protocol contains instructions for careful 
monitoring of safety and efficacy endpoints during the tr

minimal improvement or worsening of the clinical conditions so that appropriate mitigation steps 
can be taken, including, but not limited to, withdrawal from study treatment and commencement

viral or fungal infections are excluded 
from the study.
 
Ocular infections occurring during the 
study should be as
sessed and treated 
appropriately. 
 
The Investigator should discuss with the 
Study Medical Monitor whether to stop 
study drug if ocular infection occurs.
 
Use of APP13007 may suppress the 
host immune response and increase 
the hazard of ocular infections. Thi
s 
risk is likely to be low based on 
data from studies of other steroids 
products approved for the treatment 
of inflammation and pain after 
ocular surgery.
 
Hypothalamic

Pituitary
-
Adrenal Axis (HPA) 
Suppression
 
Monitor for symptoms and signs of 
reduced adre
nal function (including 
fatigue, muscle weakness, loss of appetite 
and weight, abdominal pain, nausea and 
diarrhea, low blood pressure, depression 
and irritability, salt craving and 
hypoglycemia).
 
The Investigator should discuss with the 
Study 
Medical Monitor who will then 
discuss with the Sponsor whether to stop 
study drug.
 
While s
ystemic absorption of 
topical corticosteroids can produce 
reversible HPA axis suppression 
with the potential for glucocorticoid 
insufficiency after withdrawal from 
tr
eatment
, this risk is likely to be 
very low 
 
 
 
-
 
 
 
-
 
Nevertheless
, 
I
nvestigators should 
be aware that the symptoms and 
signs of reduced adrenal function 
can be nonspecific and they should 
remain alert to the possibility that 
this may occur. 
 
Effects related to 
excessive corticosteroid 
pharmacology
 
Monitor for symptoms 
and signs of 
excess corticosteroid pharmacology such 
as Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, 
and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus.
 
The Investigator should discuss with the 
Study Medical Monitor who will then 
discuss with the Sponsor whether to stop 
stud
y drug.
 
These effects have been reported 
after dermal use of CP and result 
from systemic absorption of topical 
CP.
 
T
he risk is likely to be 
very 
small

Dispensing and Replacing Study Drug
 
Study drug will be dispensed by personnel assigned to do so at the study site as indicated on the 
Site Delegation Log. One bottle will be dispensed 
to each 
subject
 
for the duration of the study 
treatment period. If the 
subject
 
discontinues study drug, the study drug bottle should be collected 
at the next 
clinic 
visit.
 
If a 
subject
 
loses the single bottle of study drug or if it becomes compromised (e.g
., 
damaged or 
dropped into the toilet) prior to the POD15 visit, the bottle of study drug should be replaced as 
soon as possible. The site should use the IWRS system to identify a replacement bottle. 
Subject
s 
are instructed to notify the study site as soon
 
as the study drug bottle is lost or compromised, so 
that the site can arrange for the replacement bottle to be provided as soon as possible. Any 
missed doses due to loss of study drug bottle will be documented in the diary and eCRF.

Subject
 
Diaries
 
A study diary will be given to each 
subject
 
at the visits indicated on the Schedule of Events 
(
Table

). The 
subject
 
will record the date and time of each dose of study drug as well as the 
total number of drops applied (including missed drops) and the number of drop(s) instilled 
correctly into the conjunctival sac of 
the 
study eye
 
at each dosing time
. 
The 
diary will remind the 
subject
 
to
 
instill
 
the study drug 
a minimum of 5 minutes prior to administration of other ey
e 
medications
 
in the study eye.
 
 
At each study visit noted in the Schedule of Events, site personnel will collect the diary and 
dispense a new diary to the 
subject
. Site personnel will review the diary to ensure compliance 
with drug dosing and diary recording procedures. Diary data will b
e entered into the eCRF. If 
there is an issue with dosing or recording compliance, site personnel will instruct the 
subject
 
again on correct procedures at each visit. If the 
subject
 
is unable to comply with required dosing 
procedures, the 
subject
 
may be di
scontinued from the study. However, site personnel must 
contact the Study Medical Monitor prior to discontinuing a 
subject
 
for compliance

This will 
include the number of drop(s) applied in the study eye, date/time of application and verification 
that no other drugs were administered within 5 minutes of study drug application in the study 
eye. If 
patient states 
that other drugs were administ
ered in the study eye within 5 minutes of 
instillation of study drug, this will be 
recorded in the eCRF as a protocol deviation. 
Instillation of 
the study drug in the non

Study Treatments
 
The treatments a
re as follows: 
 

 
Treatment 1:  1 drop APP13007 twice daily (BID) (morning and evening) for 
14
 
days 
instilled 
to the operated 
study 
eye
 

 
Treatment 2:  1 drop matching vehicle placebo BID (morning and evening) for 
14
 
days 
instilled 
to the operated 
study 
eye
 
 
5.1.2.5
 
S
tudy Drug Dosing
 
Study drug (APP13007 
or 
matching vehicle placebo) will be supplied in an eye drop bottle with 
a drop tip, and the bottle is labeled in accordance with FDA regulations for 
investigational 
drug. 
One bottle will be dispensed to each 
subject
 
t
hroughout the study. Study drug will be self
-
administered twice daily as indicated per protocol by instilling one drop into the conjunctival sac 
near the medial corner of the operated (study) eye. 
 
If the 
subject
 
misses the conjunctival cul
-
de
-
sac when dosing the first drop of study drug, the 
subject
 
should use a tissue to wipe away the study drug around the eye, and then instill a second 
drop into the conjunctival cul
-
de
-
sac so that at least one drop of study dru
g is administered into 
the study eye. If the second drop also misses the conjunctival sac, then the 
subject
 
should record 
the missed dose in the diary, but should not instill a 
third
 
drop.
 
Study drug should be administered twice daily. If other concomitant
 
eye drops/drugs are to be 
instilled into the study eye, the study drug should be instilled first followed by a minimum of a 
5
 
minute lag time before any other ocular medications are applied to the study eye.
 
After randomization, t
he first dose of study dr
ug should be 
administered 
in the clinic on POD1 
so that the site personnel can ensure the 
subject
 
is able to apply study drug correctly. The second 
drop of the study drug on POD1 should be 
administered 
by the 
subject
 
a minimum of 6 hours 
later. For all oth
er days the first dose should be 
instilled
 
in the morning and the second dose 
instilled
 
a minimum of 6 hours, but preferably 8 to 12 hours, later. The number of drops 
instilled
 
and the date/time of instillation of each dose must be recorded by the 
subject
 
in the

S
tudy Drug Return and Accountability
 
Study m
onitors 
 will conduct accountability of 
APP13007
 
and matching vehicle placebo. Accountability will be ascertained by performing reconciliation 
between the number of bottles of study drug, along with bottle ID numbers, 
sent to the site and 
the number of bottles 
dispensed (used), 
unused or un
-
dispensed (along with bottle ID numbers) 
at the time of reconciliation. In addition, the number of bottles of study drug (along with bottle 
ID numbers) dispensed and returned will al
so be accounted for.
 
Clinical trial materials
 
will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions
 
with a 
temperature tracking device
. Study drugs shipment records will be verified by comparing the 
shipment inventory sheet to the actual qua
ntity of study drug (number of bottles and bottle ID 
numbers) received at the site. Accurate records of receipt and disposition of the study drug (e.g., 
dates, number of bottle
s 
and each bottle ID number 
received, 
dispensed, lost or compromised, 
and return
ed) 
and subject number associated with the bottle ID number 
must be maintained by 
the Investigator or his/her designee. 
 
 
 
At the end of th
e study, all study materials, including any used (and returned) and unused study 
drugs bottles, even if empty, will be returned to the drug packaging and distribution vendor in 
accordance with Sponsor or designee’s standard operations procedures (SOPs), fo
llowing 
approval by the Sponsor. All returns of study drugs will be documented. The study monitor or 
designee will verify drug accountability. All drug accounting procedures must be completed 
before the study is considered complete.

stician independent 
of the study conduct 
and management 
and 
will be 
uploaded into the EDC system
 
by a 
designated 
person not involved in the study conduct, data collection or management
. The EDC/IWRS 
system will be used for randomization and unmasking of tr
eatment assignment when necessary. 
 
In case of a medical emergency or occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator will treat each 
subject
 
as needed and should contact the Study Medical Monitor, if required, to discuss whether it is 
appropriate to unmask the 
sub
ject
 
to reveal the 
subject
’s treatment assignment. If deemed 
necessary, the Investigator will log into the EDC system to obtain unmasking information. The 
Investigator must use their individual login information to gain access to the unmasking 
information.
 
The Investigator will also notify the IRB and the CRO managing and monitoring 
this study when treatment assignment for a particular 
subject
 
is unmasked. The Study Medical 
Monitor will notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor when treatment assignment for a part
icular 
subject
 
is unmasked due to 
a medical emergency or 
SAE. It is important to note that the study 
treatment assignment will be revealed only on a 
subject

basis and the treatment 
assignment of the other 
subject
s in the study, as described abov
e, will remain masked until the 
final database is locked. Once the treatment assignment for a specific 
subject
 
is unmasked, it will 
be made available to the Investigator and the Sponsor. Other personnel involved in the 
monitoring or conduct of this study w
ill remain masked.

Prior to surgery, the surgeon’s routine medication list shou
ld be reviewed 
to exclude
 
prohibited 
medications
 
(
Table 
4
,
 
Section 
5.4.2
)
. Surgery should preferably be scheduled in the morning to 
accommodate BID dosing on POD1. 
However, if surgery has to be scheduled in the afternoon, 
subjects should still instill two doses of 
study drug on POD1 at least 6 hours apart.
 
On Day 0, the surgeon will perform his/her routine cataract surgical procedure using 
phacoemulsification and implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens in the operated eye 
following the surgeon’s usual p
re
-
operative, operative, and post
-
operative procedures (with the 
exception of avoiding use of prohibited medications). 
Aqueous release procedures are not 
permitted.
 
Following surgery, the following should be performed:
 

 
Give the 
subject
 
instructions regardi
ng routine post
-
surgical care and instructions regarding 
the use of concomitant medications and restricted medications during the study.
 

 
Record surgery parameters (surgery time, phaecoemulsion energy and an assessment of 
surgery difficulty) in the source d
ocuments and eCRF.
 

 
Record the m
edications routinely administered 
for 
cataract surgery in the source documents
.
 
These medications will be 
reported as being used for 
routine cataract surgery
.
 

 
If a medication is administered due to an AE, the medication must 
be entered 
in the source 
documents, indicating that the medication was used to treat an AE
. 
 

 
If a non
-
prostaglandin medication is used to lower IOP, the medication must be entered in the 
source documents and in the ConMeds page of the eCRF.
 

 
AEs and ConMeds
 
associated with an AE 
should only be recorded 
in the source
 
document
 
on 
Day 0 if they result in screen failure of the 
subject
. If a subject is not a screen failure on Day 
0
, the AEs and ConMeds applicable to Day 0 should be recorded 
in the source document

cular complaint 
will
 
be 
recorded in the eCRF

ETDRS Best Corrected Visual Acuity Measurement by Pinhole Method
 
Best corrected visual acuity measurement will be pe
rformed using the ETDRS eye chart at a 
preferred (but not required) distance of 4 meters. The testing should be conducted under 
standardized lighting conditions using the pinhole method for 
the 
study visits 
indicated
 
in
 
Table 
1
. Other testing distances may be used as long as it is consistent with the recommendations 
provided for the ETDRS chart being used and will be used 
consistently 
at each visit. 
 
The 
subject
 
starts at the top of the chart and reads down until the 
subject
 
reaches a row where the 
subject
 
is unable to correctly read any letters on that line. 
 
The ETDRS Acuity Log Score was calculated as follows:
 
1.
 
Determine the last row where the subject can corre
ctly identify at least one (1) letter in 
that row. This is the Base Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) 
line.
 
2.
 
Determine the log score for the Base logMAR line.
 
3.
 
Add 0.02 (T=0.02) log units for every letter that is incorrectly identified up
 
to and 
including the Base logMAR line.
 
The results will be recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF.

e
 
the 
severity of a nuclear, cortical or posterior subcapsular cataract in the non

study eye at Visit 1 (Screening), the Investigator should 
make an assessment wh
ether there has been a change in the size or composition of the cataract at 
Visit 6 (POD22) or at Early Termination/Withdrawal and record this in the source document and 
eCRF. It is recommended that (i) the cataract grading is performed by the same Investi
gator at 
Screening and Visit 6 (POD22) or at Early Termination/Withdrawal, and (ii) the Investigator 
refers to the documentation of the non
-
study eye at Visit 1 (Screening) when making the 
assessment of change in the lens status.

8.1
 
Definition of Adverse Events (AE
s
)
 
Adverse event means any 
untoward medical occurrence in a 
subject
 
or clinical investigation 
subject
 
administered a pharmaceutical product and
 
which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment (21CFR312.32 (a); ICF E6 Section 1). An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable sign and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally assoc
iated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
 
In addition to the considerations in
 
Sections 
8.2
 
to
 
8.4
, AEs
 
will be re
ported
 
in the source 
document 
from the time of signature of the informed consent form as indicated in 
Section 
8.1.1
 
and 
Section 
8.1.2
.
 
 
8.1.1
 
Subjects who are 
Randomized
 

 
An AE 
related to
 
catar
act surgery will be recorded in 
the 
Surgical AE log 
table
 
in the
 
source 
documents 
and
 
in the eCRF
.
 

 
AEs occurring prior to study drug administration will be recorded in the source documents 
only.
 

 
AEs 
occurring from the start of study drug administration 
wil
l be reported in the source 
documents and eCRF.
 

 
Rescued subjects are considered to be treatment failures, and 
being 
rescue
d
 
itself is not 
considered 
to be 
an AE.
 

 
Adverse events occurring in rescued subjects 
will
 
be reported in the 
source documents and 
eC
R
F. 
 

 
An IOP > 30 mmHg 
after
 
Randomization 
will
 
be reported as an AE
 
i
n 
the source documents 
and 
eCRF
.
 

 
An IOP 
≥ 
21 mmHg 
AND
 
an IOP increase 
>
 
10 mmHg from pre
-
dose baseline 
will
 
be 
reported as an AE
 
i
n 
the source documents and 
eCRF
.
 

 
S
erious Adverse Events will be collected from the time of signature of the informed consent 
form and reported in the source documents and eCRF.
 
 
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself could be of 
relatively minor clin
ical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ headache). This is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome of an AE and usually associated with events that 
pose a threat to a 
subject
’s life or functioning.

8.2
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events
 
(SAE
s
)
 
An AE is considered "serious" if the event results in any of the following outcomes: 
 

 
death, 
 

 
a life
-
threatening adverse event (i.e. the 
subject
 
is, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs), 
 

 
s
ubject
 
hospitaliza
tion or prolongation of existing hospitalization, 
 

 
a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions, or 
 

 
a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, but may be life
-
threatening, or require 
hospit
alization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical event
s include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or conv
ulsions that do not result in 
subject
 
hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
 
A s
erious
 
and 
unexpected s
usp
ected
 
adverse reaction (SUSAR) is defined as a serious adverse 
reaction 
or suspected serious adverse reaction 
that is not listed in the 
APP13007
 
Investigator’s 
Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed, or that is ment
ioned 
in the
 
APP13007
 
Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the study drug, but is not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation (See

vent
 
Assessment of severity of an AE will be rated according to the definitions 
below in 
Table 
5
 
and
 
the worst grade documented.
 
Table 
5
:
 
Definitions of AE Severity
 
Mild
 
Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activi
ties.
 
Moderate
 
Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning.
 
Severe
 
Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually 
potentially life
-
threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious”.
 
 
8.3.2
 
Relationship to Ocular Surgical Procedure o
r
 
Study Drug
 
Determination of the relationship (if any) between the AE and the study drug will be made using 
the guidelines presented in 
Table 
6
 
and 
Table 
7
.
 
Table 
6
:
 
Guidelines for Determining the Relationship (if any) between an Adverse 
Event and the Ocular Surgical Procedure
 
Related
 
This causal relationship is 
assigned if the AE starts at a reasonable time during 
or after the surgical intervention and could reasonably be explained by the 
known characteristics of the surgical intervention.
 
Not 
Related
 
This causal relationship is assigned when the time association or the 
subject
’s 
clinical state is such that the surgical intervention was not likely to have had an 
association with the observed AE.

Guidelines for Determin
ing the Relationship (if any) between an Adverse 
Event and the Study Drug
 
Definite
 
This causal relationship is assigned if the AE starts a reasonable time after the 
administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is stopped, 
and could 
reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the study drug.
 
Probable
 
This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after 
the administration of study drug, stops/improves when the study drug is 
stopped, and could not be 
reasonably explained by known characteristics of the 
subject
’s clinical state.
 
Possible
 
This causal relationship is assigned when the AE starts a reasonable time after 
the administration of study drug, but could be produced by the 
subject
’s clinical 
state
 
or other modes of therapy administered to the 
subject
.
 
Not Related
 
This causal relationship is assigned when the time association or the 
subject
’s 
clinical state is such that the study drug was not likely to have had an 
association with the observed AE.
 
 
The attributability (relatedness) of an AE to the surgical procedure or to the study drug will be 
reported in the source documents and in the eCRF as described in 
Section 
8.1.1
 
and
 
Section 
8.1.2

8.3.3
 
Expectedness
 
An AE or a suspected adverse 
reaction
 
(SAR) is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
APP13007
 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed. Expected events for APP13007 administration include those events described in the 
APP13007 Investigator’s Brochure.
 
8.3.4
 
Action Taken with Study drug
 
The action to 
be taken in response to an AE will be to either discontinue or continue study drug. 
 
Subject
s will be permitted to restart study drug if there is a temporary interruption of study drug 
dosing not more than 1 day due to an AE. 
 
Decrease in the dosing freque
ncy
 
or dosing duration
 
of 
the 
study drug is not allowed in this 
study.

or have a 
negative urine pregnancy test on POD1 prior to randomization
 
(and agree to
 
abstain from sexual 
activity or use an effective method of contraception)
. Therefore, no pregnancies should occur. 
A 
urine pregnancy test will also be 
performed at Visit 5 (POD15) or Early Termination
/Withdrawal
 
visit
 
prior to POD15
.  
If there is an unexpected pregnancy, it will be handled on a case
-
by
-
case 
basis by discussing with the Study Medical Monitor and then the Sponsor Medical Monitor.
 
Additiona
lly, the Investigator should report the information to the Sponsor 
in a Pregnancy
-
specific CRF 
as per the procedures to be followed for an SAE. Although a pregnancy itself is not 
an SAE, it has potentially serious consequences in 
subject
s exposed to invest
igational drugs that 
can result in an SAE.
 
The pregnancy and follow
-
up of the pregnancy must be reported on the appropriate pregnancy 
CRF and Pregnancy Reporting Form. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end 
of the pregnancy, last menstru
ation, estimated fertility date, pregnancy result and neonatal data 
etc., should be included in this information.
 
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome
 
to the Sponsor. Follow
-
up visits must continue 
until the end of the pregnancy, even if that lasts beyond the end of the study.
 
When the outcome of the pregnancy falls under the criteria for SAEs 
(
spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death o
f newborn, congenital anomaly 
[
includin
g anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus])
, the investigator should respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAEs. Additional information regarding the outcomes of a pregnancy which are categorized as 
an SAE is ment
ioned below:
 

 
"Spontaneous abortion" includes abortion and missed abortion.
 

 
Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of its 
relationship with the study drug.

investigator.
 

 
In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the "normality" of the infant is evaluated at 
birth.

It is the responsibility of the Investigators or th
eir designees to report any event of this nature to 
the Sponsor or a designee within 24 hours of the event being brought to the Investigators’ or 
their staffs’ attention. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to report all SAEs reported at 
thei
r site to the IRB, as required. The Investigator should make every attempt to follow all SAEs 
to resolution. 
 
All SAEs have to be reported
 
on a separate SAE Report Form
, whether or not considered 
causally related to the 
study
 
drug, or to the study procedur
e(s). 
All SAEs will be recorded in the 
eCRF
. SAEs will be recorded from the time 
the 
informed consent
 
form is signed
. 
 
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all SAEs to regulatory authorities and 
the 
Investigator is responsible for reporting all SA
Es to the 
IRB
 
(see NOTE below) in accordance 
with I
RB guidelines
 
and 
FDA
 
regulations. As soon as the Investigator is aware of a potential 
SAE he/she should contact 
 
 
and in any case no later than 24 hours after the 
knowledge of such a case. At the time of initial reporting the Investigator must provide as a 
minimum requirement, 
subject
 
number, birth date, description of the SAE and a preliminary 
assessment of causality
. 
 
For fatal or life
-
threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, 
active follow
-
up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform the 
Study Medical Monitor, the Sponsor, and the CRO for Study Manag
ement and Monitoring of 
any follow
-
up information on a previously reported SAE immediately but no later than within 
24
 
hours of when the Investigator becomes aware of it. The Study Medical Monitor or Sponsor 
Medical Monitor will advise the Investigator/stu
dy site personnel how to proceed.
 
The 
Investigator will immediately follow
-
up events deemed by the Sponsor to be Serious and 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) or possible SUSAR events needing 
immediate follow
-
up in order to meet the 15 calend

Initiation of rescue medication is at the discretion of the Investigator
. 
However, i
t is 
recommended that the Investigator uses the above 
guidance
 
to determine when to 
rescue a
 
subject
. 
If the quantit
ative ACC count or ACF grade criteria are 
not
 
met, t
he Investigator 
should 
discuss the 
qualitative 
reason(s) for rescue w
ith the Study Medical Monitor
 
for consistency

.
 
 
9.4.2
 
Management
 
Investigators will use clinical judgment to determine 
when 
to rescue a 
subject
 
using the guidance 
provided in 
Section 
9.4.1
 
and the 
appropriate rescue medication to use
. All rescued subjects will 
stop 
study drug 
at the time of rescue
 
and will 
continue in the study through completion of the 
Visit 6 (POD22) assessments
 
(
Table 
1
).
 
If a s
ubject needs to be rescued at Visit 5 (POD15), the Visit 5 (POD15) assessments (
Table 
1
) 
should be completed before the subject is administered rescue medication.
 
Rescu
ed 
subject
s will be considered treatment failures, 
and
 
the need for rescue medication will 
not be considered as an AE. 
 
An 
AE
 
occurring at the time of rescue
 
will be recorded in the eCRF and 
will be followed by the 
Investigator to stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever comes 
last). 
 
If a 
subject
 
is rescued, this event will be 
recorded 
in the eCRF
 
(not as an AE)
. Medications used 
for rescue will be recorded in 
the ConMeds section of the eCRF
, indicating that they were used 
for rescue
.

lowering medication. 
 
9.5.2
 
Management
 
Investi
gator will use clinical judgment to determine the appropriate IOP
-
lowering medication to 
use and when to withdraw study drug and procedures, in consultation with the Study Medical 
Monitor.
 
 
It is important to note that prostaglandin
-
based 
IOP lowering 
medi
cations are prohibited in this 
study.
 

 
After randomization and start of study drug, if a 
subject
 
has an IOP > 30 mmHg the 
Investigator may commence 
non

based
 
IOP
-
lowering medication while 
continuing the study drug, with appropriate follow
-
up a
t the next planned visit or at an 
unscheduled visit. 
The subject may require assessment at an unscheduled visit at the 
investigator’s discretion.
 
o
 
If 
the 
IOP is < 30 mmHg at the next visit, the 
subject
 
may continue on study drug. 
 
o
 
If at the next visit, the IOP remains > 30 mmHg while on IOP
-
lowering medication, then 
the study drug may be discontinued and alternative IOP
-
lowering medication may be 
started, after consultation with the Study Medical Monito
r
. The subject should continue 
in the study and 
complete 
the assessments indicated in 
Table 
1
 
through Visit 6 (POD22). 
The Study Medical Monitor should 
discuss the persistent elevation of IOP with the 
Sponsor
 
Medical Monitor. 
 

 
After randomization and start of study drug, an IOP of 
≥

AND
 
an increase 
>
 
10
 
mmHg from the 
Visit 
2 
(

/pre
-
dose baseline (both criteria must be met) is 
considered clinic
ally significant and the Investigator should consider starting 
non
-
prostaglandin

based
 
IOP
-
lowering medication while continuing the study drug, with 
appropriate follow
-
up at the next planned visit or at an unscheduled visit. 
 
o
 
If the IOP reduction is 
satisf
actory at the next visit, the 
subject
 
may continue on study 
drug.
 
o
 
If 
the IOP 
reduction of IOP 
is not satisfactory 
at the next visit,
 
then the study drug may

Analyses of Primary Efficacy 
Endpoints:
 
The primary efficacy analyses to compare APP13007 against placebo will be conducted on the 
ITT population using the Pearson Chi
-
square statistic. Fixed sequence testing will be employed 
to maintain the 2
-
sided alpha = 0.05. The primary analyses 
will first test the difference 
between 
treatments 
in the proportion of 
subject
s with ACC count = 0 (Grade = 0) at POD8 (Visit 4) 
maintained through POD15 (Visit 5). If the test is statistically significant at the 2
-
sided alpha = 
0.05 level in favor of APP1
3007, the difference 
between treatments 
in the proportion of 
subject
s 
with Ocular Pain grade = 0 at POD4 (Visit 3) maintained through POD15 (Visit 5) will be tested 
at the two
-
sided alpha = 0.05 level. 
 
To confirm the robustness
 
of primary analysis results
, sensitivity analyse

Sample Size Estimation
 
The assumption for the sample size determination was estimated using the Package Inserts of 
Durezol
®
, Lotemax
®
 
and Inveltys
®
 
and results from the APP13007 
P
hase 
2
 
study (CPN
-
201). 
The sample size for ACC 
count 
primary efficacy endpoint is based on the assumption of 26% of 
subjects in APP13007 group with ACC Count = 0 at POD8 and maintained through POD15 and 
12% of subjects in matching vehicle placebo group. The two
-
group chi
-
square test, with a two
-
sided significance level of 5% and 92% power, requires 175 subjects per treatment group to 
detect the difference between APP13007 and placebo.
 
The same sample size using the assumption of 57% of subjects with Ocular Pain 
Grade = 0 at 
POD4 and maintained through POD15 in APP13007 group and 38% of subjects in placebo group 
will provide 95% power to detect the treatment difference.
 
With an estimated 5% dropout rate, this study will randomize approximately 185 subjects per 
tre
atment group for a total of approximately 370 subjects.
 
 
10.5
 
Level of Significance
 
Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be two
-
sided and the statistical significance 
will be tested at the 5% level.
 
 
The primary 
efficacy endpoints
 
will be eval
uated using the 
f
ixed sequence testing described in
 
S
ection 
10.3.2.1
. 
 
10.6
 
Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, or Spurious Data
 
If more than 5% of data points are missing 
at POD15 
in any treatment group, a tipping point 
analysis will be 
performed
 
to assess the sensitivity of the 
primary efficacy 
results to the 
distribution of the allocation of treatment success and failure to 
the missing data points.
 
Other 
missing data 
imputations 
will be 
detai
l
ed in the

CONTINGENCY PLANS RELATED TO THE COV
ID
-
19 
PANDEMIC
 
In
 
March 2020 
the 
FDA 
issued the 
Guidance: “Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products 
during COVID
-
19 Pandemic”. 
 
Based on
 
the stated goal in th
is
 
FDA Guidance, the following plans 
may be 
implemented:
 
1.
 
When a clinical site 
plans to 
or has to 
close operations and visits c
annot
 
be 
scheduled 
per protocol
: 
 

 
If possible, s
chedule a
n Early Termination
/Withdrawal
 
visi
t before the clinical site close
s
.
 
o
 
Ask subject to s
top
 
the
 
study 
drug
, if 
before Visit 5 (POD15
)
.
 
o
 
Collect
ed
 
study drug and 
dosing 
diary.
 
o
 
Conduct 
the Visit 6 (
POD22
)
 
assessments.
 

 
A
 
Protocol Deviation 
is documented 
as “
Early Termination
/Withdrawal
 
visit performed 
because the study site closed for operations prior to 
completion of the study visits 
due 
to 
COVID
-
19 infection
-
control requirements”.
 
2.
 
When a subject 
c
annot
 
or d
oes
 
not 
want to return for an in
-
person visit:
 
 

 
The clinical site 
coordinator 
contact
s
 
the subject by telephone (or alternative method of 
communication) and ask
s
 
the subject to stop the study drug
, if before Visit 5 (POD15),
 
and 
collect
s
 
AE and concomitant medication information. 
 
o
 
The available information is entered in the Early Terminatio
n
/Withdrawal
 
section of the 
eCRF.
 
 
o
 
If 
before Visit 5 (POD15), the study coordinator
 
request
s
 
the subject to send the study 
drug bottle and dosing diar
y 
to the study coordinator at the clinical site.
 

 
The Investigator withdraws the subject
 
from the study and
 
consider
s
 
alternative methods of 
assessing the subject.
 

 
A 
Protocol Deviation 
is documented as “Subject withdrawn early (Early Termination) and 
the assessments for Visits X, Y and Z
 
were 
not performed because the subject could not or 
did not want to return
 
for an in
-
person visit due to COVID
-
19 infection
-
control 
requirements”.

Minimal Changes 
in nuclear zone
 
In the nuclear zone, 
the anterior and 
posterior embryonal 
nuclei are distinctly 
more opalescent 
(more visible) than 
normally seen, but 
the central clear zone 
is still easily 
distinguishable in its 
entirety
 
The nuclea
r zone is 
more uniformly 
opaque and the 
central clear zone 
between the anterior 
and posterior nuclei 
is not clearly visible. 
The posterior part of 
the zone is often 
more opaque.
 
The nuclear zone is 
densely opaque with 
more or less uniform 
nuclear opacity 
e
xtending to the 
edge of the nuclear 
zone; nuclear 
features are only 
partially visible, if at 
all.

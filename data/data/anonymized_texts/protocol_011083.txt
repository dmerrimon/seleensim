PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 2: 
RATIONALE 
Protocol ML29543 has been amended to include optional tests at screening, Month 6, 
and Month 12.  These tests include a serum sample to test CBC at screening (if results are not available within 12 months prior to informed consent) and serum samples for insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which can be drawn at the discretion of the investigator at Month 6 and 12.  Optional tests also include X-ray to determine bone age eligibility at screening only if results are not available within 12 months prior to the enrollment date. 
Screening specifications were updated to allow patients who do not meet eligibility 
criteria to be re-screened once.  However, it was clarified that patients who have an abnormal CBC may have a repeat test done at the discretion of the investigator and may be enrolled if the investigator deems the results and clinical presentation of the patient are normal. 
In addition to change in body weight, change in IGF-1 was added as a reason for dose 
adjustment of study drug at Month 6 to be consistent with real-world standard clinical practice.  
Study assessments were updated to include clarification on CBC and bone age testing 
at screening.  Specifically, if a patient does not have on record a CBC and bone age result within 12 months prior to informed consent date (for CBC) and enrollment date (for bone age), they will be asked to undergo a blood draw and an X-ray for determination of bone age.   
Additional changes to the protocol included updates to the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as follows: 
• The inclusion criterion regarding bone age for females ≤
 9 years and males 
≤ 11 years, as determined by X-ray of the left hand and wrist using Greulich and 
Pyle method, was changed to reflect that this can now be obtained up to 12 months 
prior to enrollment instead of up to 6 months prior to enrollment. 
• The inclusion criterion regarding normal CBC within 6 months was changed to within 
12 months prior to informed consent/assent. 
• The exclusion criterion stating that patients with multiple pituitary hormone 
deficiencies (secondary/tertiary hypothyro idism, central adrenal insufficiency, 
diabetes insipidus) not associated with an intracranial tumor or central nervous 
system irradiation must be controlled on replacement medications for ≥ 6 months 
prior to study entry was updated to specify that hormonal treatments, such as 
androgens and estrogens to initiate puberty, are not permitted during the study.

The protocol has also been updated to reflect the most current Genentech model 
document changes.  Reference to safety reporting requirements for events, such as drug-induced liver injury and neutropenia (Section 5) reflect new template language requirements for all Genentech protocols, and do not necessarily reflect events known to be related to treatment with growth hormone therapy.  
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency, and to 
adhere to protocol template standards.  Substantive new information appears in italics.  This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol.

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 2: 
SUMMARY OF CHANGES 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
1.1   BACKGROUND ON GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY 
Human growth hormone (hGH) is the most abundant and one of the most extensively studied pituitary hormones.  Because 
hGH,  and later recombinant human growth 
hormones (rhGH) have been available for use in humans for mo re than 40 years  decades , 
and therefore much is known about the its physiology and mechanism of action (Franklin 
and Geffner 2009).  …  
1.3   STUDY RATIONALE 
Nutropin was approved by the FDA in 1994 for the treatment of GHD.  In the ensuing 20
 years, many technical advances have been made in large-scale manufacturing 
methods for recombinant DNA products. 
3.1   DECRIPTION OF STUDY 
…   Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. and 
will be treated with daily SC injections of Nutropin AQ v1.1 at a dose of up to 
0.043 mg/kg/day  (0.3 mg/kg/week, which is the approved and indicated dosage  for 
pediatric GHD ; refer to the USPI for Nutropin AQ) for 12 months.  Dose adjustments for 
weight may be made at the Month 6 visit  for changes in weight and insulin growth 
factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, if measured . 
Screening will be performed within 28 days prior to Day 1 unless otherwise specified, after which eligible patients will initiate study treatment.   Patients who do not meet 
eligibility criteria may be re-screened once for this study.  If during screening a subject 
is found to have an abnormal CBC, this test may be repeated within the same screening period at the discretion of the investigator and the subject may be enrolled if the second result is found to be normal per investigator assessment.  
…  Study assessments will be scheduled at 3-month intervals following the baseline visit 
with an additional visit for the Month 1 blood draw, which can be conducted at home with 
the help of a home health nurse .  … 
Patients who discontinue from the study early will be asked to return to the clinic within 
28 days (
± 3 days) after the last dose of study drug for an early discontinuation visit, 
which will include the collection of serum samples for serum drug concentration and 
immunogenicity assessments. 
…  The annualized 6- and 12-month growth velocities for prepubertal patients who are 
antiGH antibody positive will be analyzed.  …

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
353/CSR ML29543
3.3.2  Rationale for Patient Population  
The prepubertal GHD population was chosen for this study because healthy, prepubertal 
GHD children have well-characterized growth responses to rhGH.  Other pediatric populations for which Nutropin AQ is appr oved (Turner syndrome, chronic kidney 
disease, and idiopathic short stature) may show variant responses due to co-existing conditions and concomitant medications.  Since there is almost no difference in the 
responses between prepubertal girls and boys, stratification for gender was not 
considered.    
3.3.3  Rationale for Antibody Assay Assessments  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  In the case of GH, antibodies with GH binding capacities below 2 mg/L have not been associated with 
growth attenuation  (refer to the USPI for Nutropin AQ) .  …  In clinical studies of 
pediatric patients who were treated with Nutropin or Nutropin AQ for the first time, 
antibodies with binding capacities ≥
 2 mg/L were not observed in any patients at 
6 months and or 15 months for Nutropin and Nutropin AQ, respectively (refer to the 
USPI for Nutropin AQ). 
…  Any samples positive for anti-GH antibody with a titer > 2.4 mg/L  will also then be 
analyzed in an anti-GH neutralizing antibody assay and an anti-GH antibody binding 
capacity assay.  … 
3.4.1  Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measure for this study is the occurrence of anti-GH antibodies in 
rhGH -naïve , prepubertal GHD children treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1. 
3.4.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
The occurrence of anti GH antibodies during this study will be compared to historical 
data from earlier studies (L0368g and L2762g).    
4.1.1  Inclusion Criteria  
• Male or female patients age ≥  3 years and < ≤ 14 years .  The patient may be 14 
years old exactly on the day of the first dose of study treatment.   
• Bone age ≤  9 years (females) or ≤  11 years (males) as determined by X-ray of the 
left hand and wrist using Greulich and Pyle method and obtained within the 
6 12 months prior to enrollment 
• Normal CBC within the 126 months prior to informed consent/assent 
 
4.1.2  Exclusion Criteria  
• Short stature etiologies other than GHD (e.g., untreated hypothyroidism, short 
stature associated with GH encoding gene mutations, chromosomal defect 
associated with short stature) 
– Patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (secondary/tertiary 
hypothyroidism, central adrenal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus) not associated

with an intracranial tumor or CNS irradiation must be controlled on replacement 
medications for ≥ 6 months prior to study entry.   Hormonal treatments, such as 
androgens and estrogens to initiate puberty, are not permitted during the 
study.  
 
4.2   METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING  
This is unblinded, open-label, single-arm study.  After written informed consent/assent 
has been obtained and eligibility has been established, the study site will obtain the 
patient’s unique identification number.  Approximately 80  patients will be enrolled in this 
unblinded, open label, single arm study.  
4.3.2  Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Nutropin AQ v1.1 will be provided to the patient and administered at a dose of up to 
0.043 mg/kg/day  (0.3 mg/kg/week).   and The dose may be adjusted at the Month 6 visit 
per investigator assessment for:  1) a change in body weight of at least  ± 2 kg from 
baseline at the Month  6 study visit, if appropriate  OR 2) a change in IGF-1 level (if 
tested and the investigator deems a change in dose is clinically indicated) .   
Missed doses or drug holidays are discouraged.  Information on study treatment 
discontinuation and adverse events that may lead to discontinuation of treatment Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are
 is 
provided in Section s 4.6.2 and  5.1.1, respectively.  
…  The solution may be used for SC administration for 28 days after initial use when 
stored in the pen device at 2− 8°C/2 36−46°F (under refrigeration).  …  Once study drug 
is assigned and dispensed to patients, they will be provided with containers for 
transport of the drug from the investigative sites to their homes for refrigerated storage.   
…  If the solution is cloudy, the contents must not be injected administered and the 
affected pens should be returned to the site . 
4.3.3  Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion of this study 
(Nutropin AQ v1.1) will be provided by the Sponsor.  The investigational study site will 
acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the Interactive Voice and Web Response System 
(IXWRS) to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will 
be replaced.  
4.4   CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
Careful monitoring is advisable when Nutropin AQ v1.1 is administered in 
combination with insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, other drugs metabolized by 
CYP450 liver enzymes,  or other hormone replacement therapy.

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
355/CSR ML29543
4.4.2  Permitted Therapy   
Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter 
drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements, m edications to manage  
multiple pituitary hormone deficits as well  as other chronic medications ) used by a 
patient from 7 days prior to dosing to the study completion/early discontinuation visit.  All such medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF.  
Medications to manage multiple pituitary-h ormone deficits or other chronic conditions 
should also be recorded as concomitant medications. 
Careful monitoring is advisable when Nutropin AQ v1.1 is administered in combination 
with insulin or other hypoglycemic agents, othe r drugs metabolized by CYP450 liver 
enzymes, or other hormone replacement therapy.    
4.5.1  Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
If a patient does not have on record a CBC and bone age result within 12 months prior 
to informed consent (for CBC) or enrollment (for bone age), they will be asked to 
undergo a blood draw (to be analyzed at local laboratory for CBC) and an X-ray for determination of bone age to determine eligibility for the study. 
Patients who fail screening may be re-screened once for this study.  However, patients 
who are found to have an abnormal CBC may have a repeat test done within the same 
screening period at the discretion of the investigator and may be enrolled if the investigator deems the results and clinical presentation of the patient are normal. 
4.5.5  Laborat ory Assessments  
At screening, patients may be required to provide a blood sample to check for CBC, which will be analyzed at the local laboratory.  
At Month 6 and 12 study visits, optional sam ples may be drawn to  check IGF-1 levels, 
which will also be analyzed at the local laboratory. 
For assessment of immunogenicity, samples will be drawn at each study visit The 
following laboratory tests are to be performed during the study, according to the 
schedule of assessments (see Appendix 1)  and will be sent to the central laboratory to 
assess the following : 
• Samples for s Serum drug concentration .   and immunogenicity assessments will be 
collected at specified study visits.  GH concentration levels are necessary to 
interpret anti-GH antibody status and titers.  
• Immunogenicity , will be assessed utilizing the following assays, which will test for 
the presence of specific antibodies in patient serum : 
– anti-GH antibody screening assay 
– anti-GH neutralizing antibody assay

7/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
356/CSR ML29543
– anti-GH antibody binding capacity assay 
 
During the study treatment period, blood samples for immunogenicity should be drawn 
at least 12 hours after the last administration of Nutropin AQ v1.1 and prior to the next 
scheduled dose. 
The last blood sample for immunogenicity at Month 12 must be drawn at least 12 hours 
after the last dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1.  … 
4.6.3  Study and Si te Discontinuation  
• No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed and all obligations have been 
fulfilled) 
5.2.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
Hy’s law (see Section 5.3.5.7)  
 
5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period  
… After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, 
only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be 
reported (see Section 5.4.2  for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  
5.3.5.1  Injection Reactions 
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug injection should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g.,
 "injection reaction")  on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous 
terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded 
on the dedicated Injection Reaction eCRF.   
If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction (e.g., generalized injection reaction and localized injection site reaction) to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and 
symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Injection Reaction eCRF . 
5.3.5.3  Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
357/CSR ML29543
5.3.5.7  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination wi th clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse even t or a non-serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2).  
5.3.5.11 Adverse Events in Individua ls Not Enrolled in the Study  
If an adverse event inadvertently occurs in an individual not enrolled in the study  
(e.g.,  injury to the healthcare provider or caregiver  during administration of study drug), 
the Adverse Event Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to 
Roche or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the 
fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
5.4.4  Reporting Requirements for NuSpin Device Complaints  
In this study, NuSpin is considered a medical device.  The investigator must report all 
NuSpin device complaints to the Sponsor.  The investigator should document as much 
information as possible on the Device Complaint eCRF IMP Deviation Form , including 
the product batch number,  and forward the form to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no 
more than 24 hours after learning of the event) (refer to the site pharmacy manual for further details).  and expiration date.  
If the medical device complaint results in an 
adverse event to the study patient , the event must be reported on the Adverse Event 
eCRF and submitted through the EDC system the Comp laint eCRF must be completed 
and submitted through the EDC immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning 
of the event) .  The adverse event must be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
event is serious, the Adverse Event eCRF must be completed and submitted through the 
EDC immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as outlined in 
Section 5.4.2.  If the medical device results in an adverse event to an individual other 
than the study patient, the event should be rep orted as described in Section 0.

Objectives  
The primary objective for this study is to characterize the immunogenicity profile of 
Nutropin AQ v1.1 when administered as a daily subcutaneous (SC) injection for 12 months 
(per the U.S. Prescribing Inform ation [USPI] for Nutropin AQ). 
The clinical impact of immunogenicity will also be assessed during the course of the study by 
evaluating patients for functional growth attenuat ion in association with the development of 
anti-growth hormone (GH) antibodies.  
Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of somatropin (rDNA origin) 
(Nutropin AQ v1.1) in naïve prepubertal childre n with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).   
Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. and will be 
treated with daily SC injections of  Nutropin AQ v1.1 at a dose of up to 0.043 mg/kg/day ( 0.3 
mg/kg/week, which is the approved and indicated dosage for pediatric GHD ; refer to the USPI 
for Nutropin AQ) for 12 months.  Dose adjus tments may be made at the Month 6 visit for 
changes in weight and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels,  if measured . 
Screening will be performed within 28 days prior to Day 1 unless otherwise specified, after 
which eligible patients will initiate study treatment.  Patients who do not meet eligibility criteria 
may be re-screened once for this study.  If during screening a subject is found to have an 
abnormal CBC, this test may be repeated within the same screening period at the discretion of 
the investigator and the subject may be enrolled if the second result is found to be normal per 
investigator assessment.  
Historical laboratory and radiographic tests w ill be reviewed prior to obtaining informed consent 
and initiation of study drug.  Study assessments will be scheduled at 3-month intervals following 
the baseline visit with an additional visit for the Month 1 blood draw , which can be conducted at 
home with the help of a home health nurse .  Study assessments will include physical 
examinations, height and weight measurements, assessment of pubertal status, and collection 
of serum samples for study-specific laboratory assessments (serum drug concentration and 
immunogenicity assessments).  Patients will otherwise be treated and followed as determined 
by their health care provider.

Patients who complete the Month 12 visit will be considered to have completed the study. 
Patients will be contacted by phone 28 (±  3) days after the Month 12 visit to collect adverse 
events.  
Patients who discontinue from the study early will be asked to retu rn to the clinic within 28 (± 3 
days) days after the last dose of study drug for an early discontinuation visit, which will include 
the collection of serum samples for serum drug concentration and immunogenicity assessments. 
Growth response will be monitored throughout the study.  The annualized 6- and 12-month 
growth velocities for prepubertal patients will be analyzed.  Growth velo cities of patients who 
enter puberty during the study will not be included in the 6- and 12-month velocity analyses.  However, these patients will remain in the st udy and their antibody data will be assessed.   
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all serious and non-serious 
adverse events as outlined in Section 5.2. 
Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments performed during the study. 
Number of Patients 
Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in the study in the U.S.

Outcome Measures  
Primary Outcome Measure 
The primary outcome measure for this study is  the occurrence of anti-GH antibodies in 
rhGH -naïve , prepubertal GHD children treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1. 
Secondary Outcome Measures 
The secondary outcome measures for this study are to assess: 
• The occurrence of functional growth impair ment in association with positive antibody 
formation in patients treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1  
This will be considered in any patient who demonstrates an initial growth response greater 
than pretreatment velocity after treatment with Nutropin AQ v1.1, but then slows to below 
pretreatment velocity in the ensui ng 6- to 12-month period (or reaches ≤ 2 cm per year) 
• The difference between the annualized 6- and 12-month growth velocities for patients who 
were anti-GH antibody-positive at any post-baseline visit and those who were anti-GH 
antibody-negative at all visits (including baseline)  
• The formation of neutralizing antibodies, and the association between the presence of 
neutralizing anti-GH antibodies and growth attenuation

Safety Outcome Measures 
No specific safety assessments are planned for this study.  However, analysis of all safety 
events will be performed (see Section 6.4).  
Investigational Medicinal Product  
Test Product 
Nutropin AQ v1.1 will be supplied by the Sponsor as labeled study drug using the 
Nutropin AQ v1.1 NuSpin™  10 device for the 1-year duration of this study.  For information on 
the formulation, packaging, and handling of Nutropin AQ v1.1, see the pharmacy manual and the USPI for Nutropin AQ. 
Nutropin AQ v1.1 will be provided to the patient and administered at a dose of up to 
0.043 mg/kg/day (0.3 mg/kg/week).  The dose may be adjusted at the Month 6 visit per 
investigator assessment for:  1) a change in body weight of  at least  ±
 2 kg from baseline OR 
2) a change in IGF-1 level (if tested and the investigator deems a change in dose is clinically 
indicated) .  The dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1 will be administered via SC injections by the patient 
or caregiver. 
Statistical Methods  
Outcomes Analysis 
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the proportion of patients who develop anti-GH antibodies 
after initiating treatment with Nutropin AQ v1.1.  
Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Proportion of patients who exhibit growth att enuation (defined as initial growth response 
greater than pretreatment velocity followed by reduction in growth response to below the 
pretreatment velocity in the subsequent 6- to 12-month treatment period or reaching  ≤ 2 cm 
per year) 
– Cross tabulation between growth attenuation st atus (i.e., with or without) and anti-GH 
antibody status (i.e., positive or negative)  will be provided for any antibody and for 
neutralizing anti-GH antibody, respectively, at each visit.  Similar tables will also be 
provided for patients who had at least one positive anti-GH antibody (anti-GH antibody 
and neutralizing antibody, respectively) at any follow-up visit against those who never 
developed antibody after treatment.  
• Proportion of patients with neutralizing antibody among those who had positive anti-GH 
antibody  
– This analysis will be summar ized by visit, as well as cumulatively , for patients who had 
detectible anti-GH antibody at any post- baseline visit, as well as those who remained 
negative throughout the study .   
• Annualized 6- and 12-month growth velocities and height SDS will be summarized 
separately for patients who were anti-GH antib ody-positive at any post-baseline follow-up 
visit and those who were anti-GH antibody-negat ive at all visits (including baseline).  
Graphic displays of the individual patient growth patterns along with the longitudinal 
antibody profile over the course of the study will be prepared.  Patients who enter puberty 
during the study period will be included up to the la st visit at which they were determined to 
be prepubertal. 
Additional analyses deemed appropriate for assessing immunogenicity will be described in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Safety Analysis 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized by mapped te rm, appropriate thesaurus level, and toxicity 
grade.  Summaries (or listings, if appropriate), including investigator assessments of 
relationship to study drug, will also  be produced for each of the following: 
• Serious adverse events

20/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
369/CSR ML29543
 
• All events leading to the withdrawal of treatment 
• All events by severity 
• All events possibly indicative of hypersensitivity  
Determination of Sample Size   
A target enrollment of 80 patients wa s chosen to allow for a projected 10 −15% dropout rate and 
exclusion of growth data for an estimated 10%  of patients who might enter puberty during the 
study period and leave sufficient patient numbe rs to compare to previous studies of 
immunogenicity.  This target enrollment was based on enrollment in a previous study (L0368) 
which planned to enroll 60 patients for the assessme nt of growth rate and change in height SDS.  
An initial sample size was chosen to ensure that at least 50 patients would complete the study (L0368 FR 30SEP97; Sec 4.8.4). 
This study is expected to yield a minimum of 50 evaluable patients.  Given a sample size of 50, 
and an assumed 50% of patients developing anti-G H antibodies, the 95% confidence interval 
around this proportion will be (35.53%, 64.47% ).  This interval was calculated using 
Clopper-Pearson methodology.  Fluctuations in the proportion of patients developing anti-GH 
antibodies and the increase of evaluable patients will result in more precise confidence intervals.  
The exact confidence intervals for the scenarios for sample size of 50 and 60 in combination with the proportion of patients who are anti-GH antibody positive of 50% and 20% are listed in 
the table below.

1. BACKGROUND  
1.1 BACKGROUND ON GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY  
Human growth hormone (hGH) is the most abundant and one of the most extensively 
studied pituitary hormones.  hGH and recombinant human growth hormones (rhGH) 
have been available for use in humans for decades , and therefore much is known about 
the physiology and mechanism of action ( Franklin and Geffner 2009).  This knowledge 
base has been further enhanced by the study of the naturally occurring clinical 
syndromes of growth hormone def iciency (GHD) and excess.   
GHD, as defined by inadequate endogenous secretion of hGH, results in proportionate dwarfism in children, who are usually mo re than two standard deviations below average 
height.  The etiologies can be genetic or developmental and present from birth or manifested during growth; organic from c entral nervous system (CNS) tumors, head 
trauma, radiation, and infection; or idiopathic ( Procter et al. 1998 ).  The development of 
sensitive immunoassays to measure hGH in blood has enabled physicians to diagnose this syndrome in children whose serum hGH level does not increase substantially after administration of arginine, L-dopa, clonidine, glucagon, or the induction of hypoglycemia.  
When given a growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), many patients with idiopathic GHD release hGH.  This indicates that in some patients the fundamental abnormality lies not in the pituitary itself, but rather in the inability of the hypothalamus and higher centers to induce normal hGH release ( Procter et al. 1998 ). 
Treatment with exogenous GH began in the 1960s and 1970s with human pituitary extracted GH injected intramuscularly three times a week, and progressed to rhGH in the mid-1980s, first with subcutaneous (SC) injections three times a week, and then with daily SC injections.  
1.2 BACKGROUND ON NUTROPIN AQ® [SOMATROPIN 
(rDNA ORIGIN) INJECTION] 
Nutropin [somatropin (rDNA origin) for injection] is a lyophilized form of hGH produced by recombinant DNA technology.  Nutropin has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 Daltons.  The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of pituitary-derived 22kD hGH.  Nutropin AQ [somatropin (rDNA origin) injection] is a liquid formulation with the chemical structure of somatropin identical to lyophilized Nutropin. 
In vitro and in vivo nonclinical and clinical testing has demonstrated that Nutropin is 
therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH.

Nutropin AQ is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is 
indicated for: 
• Pediatric patients:  Treatment of children with growth failure due to GHD, idiopathic 
short stature, Turner syndrome, and chronic kidney disease up to the time of renal 
transplantation 
• Adult patients:  Treatment of adults with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD 
 
See the Nutropin AQ Investigator’s Brochure and the U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI) 
for Nutropin AQ for details on nonclinical and c linical studies, dosage, and safety profile. 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE 
Nutropin was approved by the FDA in 1994 for the treatment of GHD.  In the ensuing years, many technical advances have been made in large-scale manufacturing methods 
for recombinant DNA products. 
To use the most advanced methodology and equipment to ensure a continued supply of 
Nutropin AQ, Genentech has updated its manufacturing process while continuing to use the same Escherichia coli GH production system.  Chemical and biological 
characterization (including potency) has demonstrated comparability of drug substance produced by the original and updated manufacturing processes and, based on this, the new manufacturing process that is used to produce Nutropin AQ v1.1 has been approved by FDA. 
This study, performed in children with GHD,  will assess the immunogenicity profile of 
Nutropin AQ produced by the new manufacturing process. 
2. OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective for this study is to characterize the immunogenicity profile of 
Nutropin AQ v1.1 when administered as a daily SC injection for 12 months (per the USPI for Nutropin AQ). 
The clinical impact of immunogenicity will also be assessed during the course of the 
study by evaluating patients for functional growth attenuation in association with the development of anti-GH antibodies.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY 
This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of somatropin (rDNA origin) 
(Nutropin AQ v1.1) in naïve prepubertal children with GHD.   Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in the U.S. and will be treated with daily SC 
injections of Nutropin AQ v1.1 at a dose of up to 0.043 mg/kg/day  (0.3 mg/kg/week, 
which is the approved and indicated dosage  for pediatric GHD ; refer to the USPI for 
Nutropin AQ ) for 12 months.  Dose adjustments may be made at the Month 6 visit for 
changes in weight and insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, if measured . 
Screening will be performed within 28 days prior to Day 1 unless otherwise specified, after which eligible patients will initiate study treatment.   Patients who do not meet 
eligibility criteria may be re-screened once for this study.  If during screening a subject 
is found to have an abnormal CBC, this test may be repeated within the same screening period at the discretion of the investigator and the subject may be enrolled if the second result is found to be normal per investigator assessment.  
Historical laboratory and radiographic tests will be reviewed prior to obtaining informed consent and initiation of study drug.  Study assessments will be scheduled at 3-month 
intervals following the baseline visit with an additional visit for the Month 1 blood draw , 
which can be conducted at home with the help of a home health nurse.  Study 
assessments will include physical examinations, height and weight measurements, 
assessment of pubertal status, and collection of serum samples for study-specific laboratory assessments (serum drug conc entration and immunogenicity assessments).  
Patients will otherwise be treated and followed as determined by their health care provider.  
Patients who complete the Month 12 visit will be considered to have completed the study.  
Patients will be contacted by phone 28
 ± 3 days after the Month 12 visit to collect 
adverse events. 
Patients who discontinue from the study early will be asked to return to the clinic within 
28 days (± 3 days) after the last dose of study drug for an early discontinuation visit, 
which will include the collection of serum samples for serum drug concentration and 
immunogenicity assessments. 
Growth response will be monitored throughout the study.  The annualized 6- and 
12-month growth velocities for prepubertal patients will be analyzed.  Growth velocities of patients who enter puberty during the study will not be included in the 6- and 12-month velocity analyses.  However, these patients will remain in the study and their antibody data will be assessed.

The end of the study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs.  
LPLV is expected to occur approximately 12 months after the last patient is enrolled and receives the first Nutropin AQ v1.1 injection. 
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1 Rationale for Nutropi n AQ v1.1 Dose and Schedule  
The Nutropin AQ v1.1 treatment route, dose, and dosing regimen used in this study are 
consistent with what is approved for treatment of children with GHD (refer to the USPI for Nutropin AQ). 
3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population  
The prepubertal GHD population was chosen for this study because healthy, prepubertal GHD children have well-characterized growth responses to rhGH.  Other pediatric populations for which Nutropin AQ is appr oved (Turner syndrome, chronic kidney 
disease, and idiopathic short stature) may show variant responses due to co-existing conditions and concomitant medications.   
3.3.3 Rationale for Antibody Assay Assessments  
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity.  In the case of GH, antibodies with GH binding capacities below 2 mg/L have not been associated with 
growth attenuation  (refer to the USPI for Nutropin AQ) .  In a very small number of 
patients treated with Nutropin AQ, where binding capacity was above 2 mg/L, 
interference with growth response was observed.  In clinical studies of pediatric patients who were treated with Nutropin or Nutropin AQ for the first time, antibodies with binding 
capacities ≥
 2 mg/L were not observed in any patients at 6 months or 15 months for 
Nutropin and Nutropin AQ, respectively (refer to the USPI for Nutropin AQ). 
In this study, all serum samples taken for immunogenicity assessments will be analyzed 
in an anti-GH antibody screening assay.  Any samples positive for anti-GH antibody with 
a titer >  2.4 mg/L  will then be analyzed in an anti-GH neutralizing antibody assay and an 
anti-GH antibody binding capacity assay.  Neutralizing antibody assays are an additional 
method for assessing anti-therapeutic antibodies that can result in changes in the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals.  Growth attenuation due to the development of neutralizing anti-GH antibodies is rare and, when reported, usually occurs in patients with mutations in the GH encoding gene (Schwarz et al. 1987 ; Cogan and Phillips 2006 ).  When this rare event occurs, the 
growth response in the first 3 −6 months is followed by a rapid decline in annualized

growth velocity to below pretreatment rate s.  Conversely, in those patients without a 
genetic mutation who develop antibodies, the binding capacity is usually low, and a 
functional effect on growth has very rarely been detected ( Buzi et al. 1989 ;             
Pirazzoli et al. 1995 ).  GH-1 mutation testing may be performed at the discretion of the 
investigator and will not be conducted as part of the protocol.  Data from this study will be used to determine if the immunogenicity profile of Nutropin AQ v1.1 produced by the new manufacturing process is different from the original product.  This study will also 
include outcome measures to evaluate the growth of GHD children being treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1 to determine if any variations in growth are associated with antibody development. 
3.4 OUTCOME MEASURES  
3.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary outcome measure for this study is the occurrence of anti-GH antibodies in 
rhGH-naïve , prepubertal GHD children treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1. 
3.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measures  
The secondary outcome measures for this study are to assess: 
• The occurrence of functional growth attenuation in association with positive antibody 
formation in patients treated with Nutropin AQ v1.1  This will be considered in any patient who demonstrates an initial growth response 
greater than pretreatment velocity after treatment with Nutropin AQ v1.1, but then slows to below pretreatment velocity in the ensuing 6- to 12-month period (or 
reaches ≤
 2 cm per year). 
• The difference between the annualized 6- and 12-month growth velocities for 
patients who were anti-GH antibody-positive at any post-baseline visit and those 
who were anti-GH antibody-negative at all visits (including baseline)  
• The formation of neutralizing antibodies, and the association between the presence 
of neutralizing anti-GH antibodies and growth attenuation 
 
3.4.3 Safety Outcome Measures  
No specific safety assessments are planned for this study.  However, analysis of all 
safety events will be performed (see Section 6.4).

4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Please see Appendix 1  for the schedule of assessments performed during the study. 
4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log  
Written informed consent from the parent(s) or a legally authorized representative of the 
child, and patient assent, if applicable, for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study-specific screening tests or evaluations.  Informed Consent 
Forms and Assent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before the first dose of study drug.  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
If a patient does not have on record a CBC and bone age result within 12 months prior 
to informed consent (for CBC) or enrollment (for bone age), they will be asked to undergo a blood draw (to be analyzed at local laboratory for CBC) and an X-ray for determination of bone age to determine eligibility for the study. 
Patients who fail screening may be re-screened once for this study.  However, patients 
who are found to have an abnormal CBC may have a repeat test done within the same 
screening period at the discretion of the investigator and may be enrolled if the investigator deems the results and clinical presentation of the patient are normal. 
4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, prior height and weight measurements, and all prescription medications used by the patient in the 30 days prior to the screening visit. 
Demographic data will include date of birth, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
4.5.3 Physical Examinations  
Limited physical examinations should be performed as per the standard of care 
guidelines for a child with GHD undergoing GH therapy.  Pubertal status and confirmation of prepubertal status, presence of hip or knee pain, appearance of spine (i.e., appearance of significant scoliosis), and routine fundoscopic examination for absence of signs of intracranial pressure must be recorded.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities after baseline should be recorded as adverse events, if applicable.

381/CSR ML29543
 
4.5.4 Height and Weight  
Height (three measurements at the same visit with a stadiometer or equivalently fixed 
measuring device) and weight will be recorded.   
4.5.5 Laborator y Assessments  
At screening, patients may be required to provide a blood sample to check for CBC, which will be analyzed at the local laboratory.  
At Month 6 and 12 study visits, optional sam ples may be drawn to  check IGF-1 levels, 
which will also be analyzed at the local laboratory. 
For assessment of immunogenicity, samples will be drawn at each study visit (see 
Appendix 1 ) and will be sent to the central laboratory to assess the following : 
• Serum drug concentration .  GH concentration levels are necessary to interpret 
anti-GH antibody status and titers.  
• Immunogenicity , utilizing the following assays: 
– anti-GH antibody screening assay 
– anti-GH neutralizing antibody assay 
– anti-GH antibody binding capacity assay 
 
During the study treatment period, blood samples for immunogenicity should be drawn 
at least 12 hours after the last administration of Nutropin AQ v1.1 and prior to the next 
scheduled dose. 
The last blood sample for immunogenicity at Month 12 must be drawn at least 12 hours 
after the last dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1.  In the event of early discontinuation, an early 
discontinuation visit should be scheduled within 28 days after the last dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1 and a blood sample will be collected for a final assessment of serum drug concentration and immunogenicity. 
4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUD Y, AND SITE DISCONTINUATION 
4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
5.1 SAFETY PLAN 
Patient safety will be monitored through physical exams and incidence or severity of 
adverse events and serious adverse events.  
5.1.1 Adverse Events That May Lead to Discontinuation of Treatment 
with Nutropin AQ v1.1  
Management of specific adverse events shoul d follow the information provided in the 
USPI for Nutropin AQ, published guidelines, and standard of care practices in the monitoring of patients receiving rhGH therapy. 
Events that may lead to discontinuation of Nutropin AQ v1.1 include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
• Papilledema by fundoscopy  
• Somatropin-induced intracranial hypertension   
• Evidence of recurrent or new malignancy 
• New or recurrent event of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or avascular 
necrosis (AVN) 
• Diabetes mellitus • Pancreatitis 
• New scoliosis or significant scoliosis progression 
• Anaphylactic reactions/severe hypersensitivity • Acute critical illness requiring intensive care hospitalization  
 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS 
Safety assessments will consist of monito ring and recording adverse events, including 
serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events.   
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
5.2.1 Adverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical  investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
Nutropin AQ (Somatropin [rDNA origin])—Genentech, Inc. 
35/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
384/CSR ML29543
 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.9 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
 
5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death) – This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) 
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening; 
see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings). 
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
385/CSR ML29543
 
5.2.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events of  Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by the 
investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  Those adverse events of special 
interest for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST 
in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
Hy’s law (see Section  5.3.5.7)  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below 
– Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an 
infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies only
 
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.4, 5.5, and 5.6 .  
The investigator is also responsible for reporting medical device complaints (see Section 5.4.4). 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity 
(see Section 5.3.3), and causality (see Section 5.3.4).   
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , 
only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention should be 
reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug, all serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported until 28 days after the last dose of study drug as provided in this study.   After this period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.6).

5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Exam ples of non-directive questions include the 
following: 
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?" 
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
Table 1  provides guidance for assessing adverse event severity.  
Table 1 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale  
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; transient or mild discomfort ( < 48 hours); no medical intervention or 
therapy required 
2 Moderate; mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required 
3 Severe; marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention or therapy required; hospitalization possible 
4 Life-threatening; extreme limitation in activity; significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervention or therap y required, hospitalization or hospice 
care probable 
Notes:  Developed by the Division of Microbiology  and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
Regardless of severity, some events may also meet  seriousness criteria.  Refer to definition of a 
serious adverse event (see Section 5.2.2 ).   
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 2 ): 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study 
• Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event

38/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
387/CSR ML29543
 
• Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 2 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapies; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the cr iteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after 
first dose of study drug). 
  
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
5.3.5.1 Injection Reactions 
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug injection should be captured as a diagnosis on the Adverse Event eCRF.   
If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction (e.g., generalized injection 
reaction and localized injection site reaction) to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
Nutropin AQ (Somatropin [rDNA origin])—Genentech, Inc. 
39/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
388/CSR ML29543
 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by one adverse event 
report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A m edically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult 
patient, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.  
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Details regarding any increases or decreases in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF.  If the event becomes serious, it 
should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  
The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from "non-serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. 
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.

5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory 
abnormality observed during physician’s caring for the patient should be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5
 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] associated 
with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia." 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
Nutropin AQ (Somatropin [rDNA origin])—Genentech, Inc. 
41/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
390/CSR ML29543
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an 
elevated total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST 
> 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination wi th clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1 ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse even t or a non-serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2  ). 
5.3.5.8 Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).     
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should be used only for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by the established cause of death.

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
391/CSR ML29543
 
5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., "more frequent headaches").   
5.3.5.10 Hospitalization or  Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalizat ion (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenarios are not
 considered to be adverse events: 
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
– The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the 
study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected 
normal progression of the disease 
– The patient has not experienced an adverse event 
 
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events, 
but should be reported as adverse events instead: 
• Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours 
 
5.3.5.11 Adverse Events As sociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.   
All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug 
should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
Short-term overdose could lead initially to hypoglycemia and subsequently to hyperglycemia.  Furthermore, overdose with somatropin is likely to cause fluid retention.

Long-term overdose could result in signs and symptoms of gigantism and/or acromegaly 
consistent with the known effects of excess GH. 
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPONSOR 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events  (see Sections 5.2.2 and 5.4.2 for further details)  
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest (see Sections 5.2.3 and  5.4.2 for 
further details)  
• Pregnancies  (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)  
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
• Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery • Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/Ethics Committee (EC).

5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation 
After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events (see Section 5.2.2 ) and non-serious 
adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.2.3) will be reported until 28 days after 
the last dose of study drug.  Investigators should record all case details that can be 
gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system.  A report will be generated and sent to Safe ty Risk Management by the EDC system. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to Roche or its designee (Genentech) immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either  by faxing or by scanning and emailing the 
form using the fax number or email address provided below.  Once the EDC system is 
available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.

5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
Should patients enter puberty during the study and become pregnant, the following 
information will apply. 
5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study drug.  A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by the investigator immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the EDC system.  A pregnancy report will automatically be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to Roche or its designee (Genentech) immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
Nutropin AQ (Somatropin [rDNA origin])—Genentech, Inc. 
45/Protocol ML29543, Version 2

pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number 
or email address provided in Section 5.4.2.  Once the EDC system is available, all 
information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. 
5.4.3.2 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).  Any abortion should be reported in the same 
fashion (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant). 
5.4.4 Reporting Requirements for NuSpin Device Complaints  
In this study, NuSpin is considered a medical device.  The investigator must report all 
NuSpin device complaints to the Sponsor.  The investigator should document as much 
information as possible on the IMP Deviation Form , including the product batch number , 
and forward the form to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event) (refer to the site pharmacy manual for further details).  If the 
medical device results in an adverse event  to the study patient, the event must be 
reported on the Adverse Event eCRF and submitted through the EDC system .  If the 
event is serious, the Adverse Event eCRF must be completed immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), as outlined in Section 5.4.2 . 
5.5 FOLLOW-UP OF PATIEN TS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1 Investigator Follow-Up  
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilit ate source data 
verification.    
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow-Up  
For serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.

Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
395/CSR ML29543
 
5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 28 days after the last dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.  
The investigator should report these events directly to Roche or its designee 
(Genentech), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided in Section 5.4.2 . 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and non-serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the USPI for Nutropin AQ. 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
A target enrollment of 80 patients was chosen to allow for a projected 10 −15% dropout 
rate and exclusion of growth data for an estimated 10% of patients who might enter puberty during the study period and leave suffi cient patient numbers to compare to 
previous studies of immunogenicity.  This target enrollment was based on enrollment in a previous study (L0368) which planned to enroll 60 patients for the assessment of growth rate and change in height SDS.  An initial sample size was chosen to ensure that at least 50 patients would complete the study (L0368 FR 30SEP97; Sec 4.8.4). 
This study is expected to yield a minimum of 50 evaluable patients.  Given a sample size 
of 50, and an assumed 50% of patients developing anti-GH antibodies, the 95% 
confidence interval around this proportion will be (35.53%, 64.47%).  This interval was 
calculated using Clopper-Pearson methodology.  Fluctuations in the proportion of

47/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
396/CSR ML29543
 
patients developing anti-GH antibodies and the increase of evaluable patients will result 
in more precise confidence intervals.  The exact confidence intervals for the scenarios 
for sample size of 50 and 60 in combination with the proportion of patients who are anti-
GH antibody positive of 50% and 20% are listed in Table 3 .

6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY 
Patients enrolled, visit completion, and reasons for study termination/study withdrawal 
will be summarized.  The baseline variables for all enrolled patients to be summarized include, but are not limited to, demographic and physical characteristics (sex, height, 
and weight), pubertal status, historical laboratory test results, and all other entry criteria.  Antibody status at baseline will also be summarized.  All enrolled patients will be included in these summaries as the intent-to-treat population.  The primary and secondary analyses will include all treated patients as described below, except as noted for patients who enter puberty.  
6.3 OUTCOMES ANALYSES 
Descriptive statistics and graphic displays will be provided to summarize data from this 
study.  There are no formal statistical hypothesis tests planned. 
6.3.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the proportion of patients who develop anti-GH antibodies after initiating treatment with Nutropin AQ v1.1.  
6.3.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints for this study are as follows: 
• Proportion of patients who exhibit growth attenuation (defined as initial growth 
response greater than pretreatment velocity followed by reduction in growth 
response to below the pretreatment velocity in the subsequent 6-  to 12-month treatment period or reaching 
 ≤ 2 cm per year) 
– Cross tabulation between growth attenuation status (i.e., with or without) and anti-GH antibody status (i.e., positiv e or negative) will be provided for any 
Nutropin AQ (Somatropin [rDNA origin])—Genentech, Inc. 
48/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.

antibody and for neutralizing anti-GH antibody, respectively, at each visit.  
Similar tables will also be provided for patients who had at least one positive 
anti-GH antibody (anti-GH antibody and neutralizing antibody, respectively) at 
any follow-up visit against those who never developed antibody after treatment.  
• Proportion of patients with neutralizing antibody among those who had positive 
anti-GH antibody  
– This analysis will be summarized by visit, as well as cumulatively , for patients 
who had detectible anti-GH antibody at any post-baseline visit, as well as those 
who remained negative throughout the study.    
• Annualized 6- and 12-month growth velocities and height SDS will be summarized 
separately for patients who were anti-GH antibody-positive at any post-baseline 
follow-up visit and those who were anti-GH antibody-negative at all visits (including 
baseline).  Graphic displays of the individual patient growth patterns along with the longitudinal antibody profile over the course of the study will be prepared.  Patients 
who enter puberty during the study period will be included up to the last visit at 
which they were determined to be prepubertal. 
 
Additional analyses deemed appropriate for assessing immunogenicity will be described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
6.4 SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety analyses will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus level, and 
toxicity grade.  Summaries (or listings, if appropriate), including investigator assessments of relationship to study drug, will also be produced for each of the following: 
• Serious adverse events 
• All events leading to the withdrawal of treatment 
• All events by severity • All events possibly indicative of hypersensitivity  
 
6.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 
Missing data will not be imputed.  All ava ilable assessments will be reported with 
associated number of observations.  If a patient discontinues study drug before the end 
of the 1-year treatment period, growth rate will be computed for the last 3-month interval visit and used in the calculation of mean growth for that time interval only. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
The Sponsor will supply eCRF specifications for this study.  A contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through

use of eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the event 
of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. 
The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data. 
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including 
approval of the CRO’s data management pl ans and specifications.  Data will be 
periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data.   
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor-designated EDC system.  Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor. 
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. 
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded 
and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial.

50/Protocol ML29543, Version 2 
Clinical Study Report:  Nutropin AQ (Somatropin)—Genentech, Inc.
399/CSR ML29543
 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. 
To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational study site’s computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS 
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, ePRO data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location.

Studies conducted in the European Union (E.U.) or European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC). 
8.2 INFORMED CONSENT 
The Sponsor’s sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as a Child’s Informed Assent Form or Home Nursing  Informed Consent 
Form, if applicable) will be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a 
certified translation of the local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC submission.  The final IRB/EC −approved Consent Forms must be 
provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements. 
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever  there are changes to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC-approved Consent Forms must be provided to the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes. 
Patients must be re-consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study.  For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study. 
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
Each Consent Form may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure 
of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  If the site utilizes a separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information

c The patient will be contacted by phone 28  ± 3 days after the Month 12 visit to collect adverse events. 
d Patients who discontinue from  the study early will be asked to re turn to the clinic within 28 da ys after the last dose of study  drug. 
e Written informed consent/assent must be obtained and documented before any study-specific screening  procedure is performed. 
f Includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, prior height  and weight measurements, and all prescription medications use d by the patient in 
the 30 days prior to the screening visit. 
g Historical laboratory tests include two GH stimulation tests with GH response < 10 ng/mL (obtained up to 12 months prior to informed 
consent/assent; see Section 4.1.1  for acceptable tests); thyroid function testing (obtained within 12 months prior to informed consent/assent); 
complete blood counts (obtained within 12 months prior to informed consent/assent); and for females, karyotype or SHOX analysis to exclude 
the diagnosis of Turner syndrome (obtained any time prior to in formed consent/assent).  Historic al radiographic test includes b one age obtained 
within 12 months prior to enrollment .  If results are not available within a specified time frame, the tests that may be done as part of the 
screening process are CBC and X-ray for bone age. All other tests should be done as part of standard care.  
h Demographic data will include date of birth, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
i Limited physical examinations should be performed as per the st andard of care guidelines for a child with GHD undergoing GH th erapy.  
Pubertal status and confirmation of prepube rtal status, presence of hip or knee pain, appearance of spine (i.e., appearance of significant 
scoliosis), and routine fundoscopic examination for absence of sign s of intracranial pressure must be recorded.  New or worsene d clinically 
significant abnormalities after baseline should be  recorded as adverse events, if applicable. 
j Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription dr ugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements, medications to manage multiple pituitary-hormone defici ts as well as other chronic medications) used by a patient from 7 days 
prior to dosing  to the study completion/early discontinuation visit. 
k A single blood sample will be collected at  each visit during the treatment period  for immunogenicity and drug concentrations.  Process each 
sample for serum and split into four separate tubes for serum drug concentration and immunogenici ty assessments (anti-GH antibody screening 
assay, anti-GH neutralizing antibody assay,  and anti-GH antibody binding capacity assay).  After baseline, blood samples for immunogenicity 
and serum drug concentration should be taken at least 12 hours after the last dose  of Nutropin AQ v1.1 and prior to the next dose.   
l The last blood sample at Month 12 must be drawn at least 12 hours  after the last dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1.  In the event of ear ly discontinuation, 
an early discontinuation visit should be scheduled within 28 days a fter the last dose of Nutropin AQ v1.1 and a blood sample wi ll be collected for 
a final assessment of serum drug concentration and immunogenicity. 
m Optional tests include a serum sample to test CBC at screening (if results are not available within 12 months prior to informed  consent) and 
serum samples for IGF-1, which can be drawn at the discretion of the investigator at Month 6 and 12.  All optional samples will  be analyzed 
at the local laboratory.  Optional tests also include an X-ray to determine bone age eligibilit y at screening only if the resul ts are not available 
within 12 months prior to the enrollment date. 
n Nutropin AQ v1.1 will be administered via daily SC injections by the patient or caregiver.  Instruction and training on Nutrop in AQ v1.1 
administration with the NuSpin device will be provided by a trained st udy nurse coordinator.

Schedule of Assessments 
o The first dose (Day 1, baseline visit) should occur after the patient receives dosing administration instruction in the clinic and after the initial blood 
sample is drawn.  Blood samples scheduled after baseline (Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and Month 12 or early discontinuation) should be t aken at least 
12 hours after the last dose of Nutropin v1.1 and prior to the next dose.  
p Assess compliance with daily dosing at each visit after baseline.  Reinstruct patients and caregivers, as needed. 
q After initiation of study drug, all seriou s adverse events and non-serious adverse event s, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported 
until 28 days after the last dose of study drug as provided in this study.  After this period, the investigator should report a ny serious adverse 
events that are believed to be related to study drug.  The Sponsor should be notified if  the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse 
event that occurs after the end of the advers e event reporting period (defined as 28 day s after the last dose of study drug), if the event is 
believed to be related to prior study drug treatment. The investi gator should follow each adverse event until the event has res olved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow-up, or the patient withdraw s consent.  Every effort 
should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to  be related to study drug or trial-related procedures until a final outcome can 
be reported.

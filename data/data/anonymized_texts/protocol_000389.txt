Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Definition of Key Study Terms
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline Assessments of subjects as they enter a trial before they receive any treatment . 
Baseline Diary Run -
In7-day period in which subject completes numerical rating scale ( NRS )and 
Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary ( FMSD )on handheld device daily beginning at 
Day -7 through Day -1.
Double -Blind The study subjects, i nvestigator(s) , site staff and Astellas study team will be 
blinded to treatment.
Early
Discont inuation
(ED)The act of concluding participation prior to completion of all protocol -required 
eleme nts in a trial by an enrolled subject . Four categories of discontinuation 
are distinguished as follows : a) dropout: Active discontinuation by a subject 
(also a noun referring to such a discontinued subject); b) Investigator -initiated 
discontinuation (e.g., for cause); c) loss to follow -up: cessation of participation 
without notice or action by the subject; d) Sponsor -initiated discontinuation. 
Note that subje ct discontinuation does not necessarily imply exclusion of 
subject data from analysis. “Termination” has a history of synonymous use, 
but it is now considered non -standard.
Endpoint Variable that pertains to the efficacy or safety evaluations of a trial.
Enroll The process of registering or enter inga subject into a clinical trial. NOTE: 
Once a subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF) , the clinical trial 
protocol applies to the subject. 
End of Study
(EOS)End of study for each subject has occurred when the final protocol -defined 
assessment has been completed. In this study, the last protocol defined 
assessment is approximately 4week safter last study drug dose.
End of Treatment 
(EOT)The date the last dos e of study drug was taken by the enrolled subject.
Electronic Patient
Reported Outcomes
(ePRO)An ePRO is a patient -reported outcome that is collected by electronic methods.
Follow -up Period The week sfollowing the final dose of study drug for all subjects . This includes 
a Follow -upvisit and an End of Study Phone Call.
Independent Data 
Monitoring
Committee
(IDMC)The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is responsible for the 
interim futility evaluation of efficacy data defined in the IDMC Charter. 
Participants in the IDMC include, but may not be limited to an Independent 
Astellas Statistici an who is not on the study team and does not communicate 
with study team or Site staff. The IDMC will ev aluate unblinded data and 
provide conclusion of futility analysis to Astellas Management.
Intervention The drug, device, therapy or process under investigation in a clinical study that 
is believed to have an effect on outcomes of interest in a study. (e.g ., health -
related quality of life, efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics). 
Randomization The process of assigning trial subjects to treatment or control groups using an 
element of chance to determine assignments in order to reduce bias.
Randomization will occur after predose assessments and eligibility criteria 
have been confirmed at Visit 3.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Terms Definition of terms
Screening A process of active consideration of potential subjects for enrollment in a trial.
Screen failure Potential subject who did not meet 1 or more criteria required for participation 
in a trial.
Screening period Period of time before entering the treatment period, usually from the time 
when a subject signs the ICFuntil just before the test drug or comparative drug 
is given to a subject .
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Treatment Period Time from Day 1, after first study drug administration and through time of last 
study drug dose .Period of time where major interests of protocol objectives 
are observed, and where the test drug or placebo is given to a subject, and 
continues until the last assessment after completing administration of the test 
drug or placebo.
Washout Time (post review of safety laboratory assessments) when a subject 
discontinues use of prohibited medications , as medically indicated and based 
upon the Investigator’s recommendation, to allow for medication to be 
eliminated from the body. Completed prior to Diary Run-In.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Study Design Overview :  
This is a phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled parallel group study to assess 
analgesic efficacy and safety of ASP0819 in subjects with fibromyalgia. 
The study will consist of the following study periods:
Screening period (Day -42 to Day -1) 
Up to 42 days, which includes the completion of screening procedures ( Visit 1), wash -out of 
prohibited medications (if applicable), and a 7 -day Baseline Diary Run -In. The wash -out of 
prohibited medications should be completed prior to the initiation of the Baseline Diary 
Run-In. The Baseline Diary Run -Inmay be extended up to 2 days if necessary in the 
Investigator ’s opinion. In general, the Screening period should not exceed 42 days. The 
Investigator should contact the medical monitor if there are circumstances that would cause 
the subject to exceed 42 days.
Double -blind randomized treatment period (Day 1 to Day 57 [End of Treatment (EOT)]) 
Eight -weeks of treatment with study drug and site visits at Day 1,15, 29 and 57.
Follow -up period (Day 58 to Day 85 [End of Study (EOS)]) 
Includes a follow -up site visit on Day 71 and an (EOS) phone call on Day 85.
Screening Period: 
After signing the informed consent, screening procedures for the subject will start ( Visit 1). 
Subjects will be required to meet both the 1990 and 2010 American College of Rheumatology 
(ACR) criteria for fibromyalgia. T he Investigator or other qualified individual at the site will 
confirm the diagnosis of fibromyalgia. 
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria [see Section 3.2Inclusion Criteria] will be instructed , if 
medically appropriate, to wash -out of any prohibited medications via phone call. At Visit 2 all 
subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria w ill be provided with an electronic diary (e -
diary). Subjects will enter a 1 -week Baseline Diary Run -In, and during this period ,they will 
record their daily average pain score (0 -10Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]) and sleep quality 
information with the Fib romyalgia Sleep Diary (FMSD) in the e -diary. They will receive 
instructions regarding its use and begin entering daily scores. Upon awakening, subjects are to rate 
their sleep quality during the previous night using the e -diary. Each evening before bed, su bjects 
are to rate their average pain during the previous 24 hours using the e -diary. Subjects will need to 
have a mean daily average pain score ≥ 4 and ≤ 9, and meeting pre -specified criteria for daily 
average pain scores.
A subject who does not meet the required mean daily average pain score or who is not compliant 
with e -diary entries by completing at least 5 of 7 days in the baseline run -in, will be considered a 
screen failure and will not be allowed to repeat the pain assessments nor rescreen for the s tudy.
After confirmation of eligibility at Visit 3 (Randomization ), subject s who meet the mean daily 
average pain score eligibility requirements at this visit will be randomized. For subjects that meet 
the entry criteria at Visit 3 (Randomization ), additio nal baseline assessments will be obtained (see 
Schedule of Assessments). 
Double -Blind Randomized Treatment Period (treatment period):
Subjects will enter the treatment period and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ASP0819 or placebo once per day for a period of 8 weeks. Acetaminophen may be used as rescue 
therapy for intolerable pain due to fibromyalgia during the baseli ne period and in all subsequent 
study periods (see rescue medication section). Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
may be used (with the exception of celecoxib) as needed for non -fibromyalgia pain (e.g., 
headache ).

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Throughout the treatment period, beginning on Day 1 (Randomization ) through Visit 6/Week 8, 
subject s will record all daily average pain scores (NRS) and any acetaminophen use in the e -diary. 
Sleep quality scores (FMSD) will be recorded through Visit 6/Week8. Subjects will take study 
drug once per day ( qd). Subject s randomized to ASP0819 will receive 15 mg (3 capsules of 5 mg 
each) .In order to maintain the study blind, ASP0819 andplacebo treated subject s will receive 
matching capsules . 
During the treatment period, subject s will return to the clinic per schedule for safety and efficacy 
procedures (see Schedule of A ssessments for details). Subject s who do not complete the treatment 
period will be requested to complete EOT visit procedures.
Follow -up Period:
Subject s areencouraged to abstain from any concomitant medications for the treatment of pain 
prior to Visit 7/Week 10. Rescue medication is allowed duri ng the follow -up period. Subject s will 
continue to enter their daily average pain sc ore (NRS) , sleep quality scores (FMSD) and 
acetaminophen use into their e -diary and return diaries at Visit 7/Week 10. All subjects will return 
to the site for a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2weeks following the EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up 
safety phone call will take place approximately 4 weeks post study drug discontinuation 
(Day 85/EOS).

to Week 8 in mean daily average pain NRS. A meta -analysis of the change from baseline in mean 
daily average pain NRS for pregabalin or duloxetine vsplacebo in studies for fibromyalgia 
indicated an effec t size of approximately 0.30.
Using an effect size of 0.39 (30% larger than the meta -analysis result) for the primary efficacy 
endpoint for the comparison of ASP0819 vsplacebo, 84 subject s in the ASP0819 and placebo 
groups would be required to provide 80% power to demonstrate statistical significance using a 
1-sided 5% significance level (based on the assumption of normally distributed data, and taking 
into account the interim analysis for futility).
The total number of subject s required for the analysis would be 168 (84:84 subject s in ASP0819 : 
placebo) . Assuming approximately 5% of randomized subject s will not contribute to the analysis, 
and then a total of 178 subject s would be required for randomization using a 1:1 randomization 
ratio (89:89) subject s for the ASP0819 group and placebo group.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Efficacy:
The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean daily average pain NRS. 
The baseline mean daily average pain score will be derived from the daily average pain scores 
(based on the daily NRS recorded in the 7 days before the first day of dosing ). The primary 
analysis population will be the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which will include all randomized 
subject s who received at least 1dose of study medication. Unless otherwise stated, all assessments 
of statistical significance will be one -sided at the 5% significance level, and as such one -sided p -
values will be shown.
The primary analysis for the primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 8 in the mean 
daily average pain NRS will use a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, where the 
model will include the effects for treatment group, center (pooled where necessary), time (study 
Week 1 to 8) and treatment -by-time interaction, as well as the covariates of baseline mean daily 
average pain NRS and baseline pain -by-treatment interaction and subject as a random effect. The 
unconstrained between -time-point covariance structure will be used. This analysis will utilize 
observed data, a nd there will be no imputation for missing data. Least squares estimates for the 
primary endpoint will be shown for both treatment group s, and for the treatment comparisons of 
ASP0819 vsplacebo (together with 2 -sided 90% confidence intervals [CI]). A one -sided 5% 
significance level will be u sed for the comparison of ASP0819 vsplacebo. This analysis will also 
display the same estimates for the exploratory endpoints of change from baseline to each Week
from Week 1 to 7 in the mean daily average pain NRS. Th e analysis of change from baseline to 
EOT in mean daily average pain will use analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ), with covariates of 
baseline average pain NRS score and center (pooled where necessary).
A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will use the same MMRM model as described 
previously. However, for this secondary analysis, multiple imputation will be used for imputation 
of any missing data, using the ‘Jump to Reference’ algorithm (where placebo is the reference 
group) for subjects who discontinue due to lack of efficacy or AEs and standard regression -based 
multiple imputation for subject s with missing data for other reasons. An additional sensitivity 
analysis for the primary endpoint will use modified baseline observation carried forward 
(mBOCF) for missing data with analysis using ANCOVA, with covariates of baseline mean daily 
average pain NRS score and center (pooled where necessary) .mBOCF is defined as imputation by 
baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) for subjects who d iscontinue due to lack of efficacy 
or AEs, and imputation by last observation carried forward ( LOCF )for subjects with missing dat a 
at Week 8 for other reasons.
The primary analysis for the secondary endpoints, of mean daily average pain response (≥ 30% 
and 50% reduction from baseline to Week 8 and to EOT) will be carried out with the Fisher’s 
Exact Test (with one -sided p -value). In addition the percentage of subject s who meet cumulative 
response levels of > 0% to = 100% will be shown. For the Week 8 analysis subject s with missing 
data will be classified as non -responders (BOCF) , and an additional analysis will use mBOCF .For 
the EOT analysis, LOCF will be used.
The primary analysis for the change from baseline to Week s 2, 4 and 8 for the FIQR subscale s of 
Physical Function , Symptoms and Overall Impact will use the same MMRM analysis as described 
above for the mean daily average pain score . 
The primary analysis for the change from baseline to EOT for the FIQR subscales will use the 
same ANCOVA model as described above.
The primary analysis for the PGIC secondary endpoint will use the proportional odds model for 
ordinal data, with model term for treatment group. In addition, the percentage of subjects who 
achieve PGIC response ( Improved , Very Much Improv ed) will be carried out with the Fisher’s 
Exact Test (with one -sided p -value) for binary data.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Safety:   
The safety variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics.
Interim analyses:
Two interim analyses for futility based on the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted. The 
timing of these analyses will be at approximately 35% and 55% of all subjects with Week 8/EOT 
data. The plan for the interim analysis may be modified based on s peed of recruitment. These 
analyses will be conducted by an Astellas statistician, with results reviewed by a n Astellas IDMC . 
The Astellas statistician and other members of the Astellas IDMC are external to the study team. 
No one within the study team will be unblinded to the treatment allocation or interim results. 
Details of the interim analysis procedure, steps to maintain treatment blind in the study team and 
criteria for stopping the study will be described in an Interim Analysis Plan (IAP).

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11 INTRODUCTION
Protocol 0819 -CL-0201 is a proof -of-concept study  to examine the effects of ASP0819 for 
the treatment of pain in subject s with fibromy algia .
1.1 Back ground
Background on Target Indication
Fibrom yalgia is a complex sy ndrome characterized by  chronic widespread musculoskeletal 
pain often occurring with sy mptoms of depression, fatigue, sleep disturbances and/or cognitive 
complaints. Fibromy algia pain ty picall y includes deep musculoskeletal pain with tender points 
in the shoulder, girdle, torso, hips and extremities. Fibrom yalgia may include various somatic 
symptoms, such as headache and irritable bowel sy ndrome. The core diagnostic criteria for 
fibromy algia are defined by  the 1990 American College of Rheumatology  (ACR) [Wolfe et al, 
1990]. While the ACR has published new, as well as subsequent amended criteria [Wolfe et al, 
2011; Wolfe et al, 2010], the 1990 version is still commonly  utilized in clinical trials. The 
overall prevalence of fibromy algia in the general population was estimated to be 2. 2% in the 
United States (3.4% and 0.5% in females and males, respectively ) [Queiroz, 2013].
Drugs used to treat fibromy algia (e.g., pregabalin andduloxetine) provide, at best, only  
modest relief of s ymptoms and are accompanied by  various side effects including sedation, 
dizziness, cognitive complaints, weight gain, edema and headaches. The approved 
medications for the treatment of fibromy algia (United States [ US]:pregabalin, duloxetine
andmilnacipran; Japan: pregabalin) result in only an incremental increase in the percent of 
subject s (~8% to 13%) with a 30% pain reduction compared to 28% to 34% of subject s with 
a similar level of improvement on p lacebo in randomized clinical trials [Häuser et al, 2014]. 
Despite the available approved medications, novel medications to treat pain, fatigue, sleep 
disturbances and impaired cognition without intolerable AEs are required to address an 
unmet medical need for subject s with fibromy algia .
A pathophy siological mechanism for fibrom yalgia has not y et been established . The concept 
of altered central processing of nociceptive information has dominated the fibromy algia 
literature [Woolf, 2011; Staud, 2011] . Howeve r, accumulating evidence suggests an 
abnormality  in both peripheral nerve fibers, as well as central pain processing in subject s 
with fibromy algia [Serra et al, 2014; Staud & Smitherman, 2002] . Studies have suggested 
that peripheral abnormalities in sensor y nerves may be important in contributing to and/or 
possibly  maintaining fibromy algia symptoms [Staud, 2006] . Increased spontaneous and 
evoked firing was observed in fibromy algia subject s [Serra et al, 2014] ;while lidocaine was 
shown to improve hy peralges ia in fibrom yalgia subject s [Staud et al, 2014] . Abnormal 
(increased) peripheral sensory  afferent input may  be amplified in the presence of central 
sensitization (decreased inhibition) [Staud et al, 2014; Staud, 2006].
Furthermore, specific C -fiber abnorma lities have been reported in fibrom yalgia subject s. 
Skin biopsies obtained from fibromy algia subject s showed distinct ultrastructural 
abnormalities in C -fibers including ballooned Schwann cells (concentrated in tender areas)

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1and peripheralized small axons of Remak bundles [Kim et al, 2008] . Serra et al. [2014] 
reported h yperexcitability , as well as structural changes in peripheral nociceptive C -fibers of 
fibromy algia subject s, suggesting abnormal peripheral C nociceptor ongoing activity  and 
increased mechan ical sensitivity  could contribute to the pain and tenderness suffered by  
fibromy algia subject s [Serra et al, 2014].
In addition, studies have reported that small -fiber pathology  is a contributor to the widespread 
pain in fibromy algia subject s [Oaklander et al, 2013; Üçey ler et al, 2013] . Oaklander et al 
[2013] demonstrated that subject s diagnosed with fibromy algia have evidence of a neurological 
cause of their chronic pain and other s ymptoms, specificall y small -fiber poly neuropathy . 
Further, Üçey ler et al [ 2013] challenged the concept of fibromy algia being a form of depression 
or a ps ychological disorder, illustrating small -fiber impairment on a ps ychophysical, 
neuroph ysiological and morphological level in fibromy algia and postulating that small -fiber 
pathol ogy may  be a peripheral nervous sy stem contributor to the complex pathophy siology  of 
pain in fibromy algia .
Taken together, these findings suggest that some fibromy algia subject s may  have underl ying 
peripheral nerve damage that may  contribute to pain sy mpto ms. Given the significant unmet 
medical need and emerging understanding of peripheral pathoph ysiology , targeting 
peripheral mechanisms may  be helpful in the treatment of fibrom yalgia.
Background on Pharmacological Concept
Ca2+-activated K+channels are cla ssified according to their single channel conductance: large 
conductance channel (K+large conductance Ca2+-activated channel, subfamily  M, alpha 1 
[KCNMA1]), intermediate conductance channel (K Ca3.1) and small conductance channel 
(SK) . KCa3.1 is voltage -insensitive and requires only  a small increase in intracellular Ca2+to 
open, subsequentl y maintaining a negative membrane potential through K+ efflux [Bradding 
andWulff, 2009] . Opening of K Ca3.1 results in a period of reduced excitability  after each 
actio n potential called afterhy perpolarization . The phy siological role of K Ca3.1 is considered 
to be regulation of cellular excitability , which suggests it is a potential therapeutic target for 
various diseases associated with abnormal nerve excitation [Wulff e t al, 2007] . For example, 
the activation of K Ca3.1 appears not onl y to have an analgesic effect on visceral 
hypersensitivity  [McHugh et al, 2008], but also to be involved in the analgesic action of 
peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor agonists [L oVer me et al, 2006]. The channel is 
represented in A -delta and C -fiber dorsal root ganglion and axons [Tsantoulas and
McMahon, 2014] . Thus, the regulation of K Ca3.1 may  be a novel target for the treatment of 
painful disorders associated with neuronal hyperactivity .
Rationale for Clinical Trial with ASP0819
ASP0819 is predicted to lead to hyperpolarization of primary  sensory  afferent nerves and 
subsequent decreased firing . This pharmacological action of ASP0819 should reduce 
peripheral nerve h yperexcita bility , thus normalizing the frequency  of action potentials and 
reducing the pain experienced b y fibrom yalgia subject s.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data
ASP0819 is an orally  available, new molecular entity  discovered b yAstellas Pharma Inc. 
ASP0819 has KCa3.1 opening activity that targets peripheral sensory nerves. 
ASP0819 pharmacokinetics have been assessed across single doses (1 to 55 mg) and 14 -days 
of multiple once- daily dose (1 to 18 mg) in the same tablet formulation as that tested in the 
current stud y. ASP0819 was rapidl y absorbed with median t maxranging from 1.03 to 
3.03 hours postdose following single and multiple doses. C max, AUC infand AUC tauincreased 
in a dose -proportional manner showing a low to moderate between -subject variability  (12.3% 
to 41 .5%). The average terminal elimination half -life ranged from 38.9 to 54.5 hours with a 
mean apparent oral clearance vary ing from 0.196 to 0.285 L /h. Drug accumulation was on 
average 2.82- to 3.45-fold higher (AUC tau) at steady-state compared to single dose with no 
clear differences across dose levels . Most of the subjects with once dail y doses of ASP0819 
appeared to be at stead y-state after 8 to 10 day s of dosing. The peak to trough ratio was low 
(1.57 - 1.87 on average) ,thus suggesting a low degree of flu ctuation in the plasma 
concentrations over the dosing period. The anal ysis of urine concentrations collected at 
steady -state showed, that after repeat dosing, ASP0819 excretion in urine was very  low 
(≤2%) and not dose dependent . Overall, no sex effect cou ld be observed and the effect of 
food was clinicall y insignificant (approximately 20 -36% lower following a high- fat meal) .
In the phase 1 stud y, , where single and multiple ascending doses of ASP0819 
were assessed, ASP0819 was well tolerated in healthy  males and females. There were no 
deaths, other serious treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ), or TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation during the study . In general, the most commonly  reported adverse events 
(AEs) observed across the single ascendin g dose and multiple ascending dose parts of the 
study , were constipation and other Gastrointestinal Disorder SOC events; the majority  of 
these events were mild. There were no clinicall y significant abnormalities in any  of the liver 
or hematologic parameter s or other clinical laboratory  test results considered related to 
ASP0819. There were no clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs or 
electrocardiograms ( ECGs) ; there were no cardiac repolarization ( QTcF )intervals greater 
than 450 msec and no change greater than 30 msec from baseline. There were no clinically  
significant abnormalities on orthostatic blood pressure changes, with the exception of 1
report of a single brief, mild presy ncope following a 55 mgsingle dose ,which was 
accompanied b y a positive orthostatic challenge test (at 18:00 h our, a decrease in DBP of 
10.3 mmHg after 3 min standing, and approximately  8 hourspost-dosing). Based on a 
concentration vs change from baseline anal ysis, ASP0819 sho wed no clinically  significant 
effects on QTcF.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 11.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
Given the early  stage of development, there are currentl y no expected AEs for ASP0819.
ASP0819 may  be associated with TEAEs based on the nonclinical studies . The following 
were key  nonclinical observations: signs of liver abnormality ; gastrointestinal atroph y, 
inflammation; changes in hemoglobin, hematocrit and other red blood cell parameters (Refer 
to the IB for detailed information) . 
1.4 Risk Benefit Assessment
No clinical efficacy  studies have been conducted to evaluate ASP0819 in the treatment of pain 
associated with fibrom yalgia;therefore, the actual benefit of ASP0819 in the treatment of pain 
associated with fibrom yalgia is unknown . There are no known risks identified with this 
mechanism of action , as ASP0819 is a first -in-class compound . Based on the safet y profile 
from the phase 1 clinical data, the risks appear to be ju stified from a risk benefit assessment. 
An overview of the risk benefit of ASP0819 can be found in the IB , including monitoring and 
mitigation steps taken to maintain safet y of the subjects while on study treatment . Routine risk 
minimization procedures areplanned in this study .Overall, the fibrom yalgia subjects that will 
meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be relatively  healthy ;therefore increased risk is 
not expected in this population. [See Section 2.2.2 Dose Rational efor safety  margins relative 
to non-clinical toxicology ].

2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This is a phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled parallel group study to 
assess analgesic efficacy  and safet y of ASP0819 in subject s with fibromy algia . 
The study  will be conducted in the US in up to approximately  35 sites . Approximately  323 
subject s are planned to be screened for 178 randomized subject s (89/arm) (45% screen fail 
rate).
The study  will consist of the following study  periods:
Screening period (Day -42 to Day -1) 
Up to 42 day s, which includes the completion of screening proced ures ( Visit 1), wash -out 
of prohibited medications (if applicable), and a 7 -day Baseline Diary  Run -In. The wash -
out of prohibited medications should be completed prior to the initiation of the Baseline 
Diary  Run -In. The Baseline Diary  Run -Inmay be extende d up to 2 day s if necessary  in 
the investigator ’s opinion. I n general, the Screening period should not exceed 42 day s. 
The investigator should contact the medical monitor if there are circumstances that would 
cause the subject to exceed 42 day s.
Double -blind randomized treatment period (Day 1 to Day 57 [End of Treatment (EOT)]) 
Eight -weeks of treatment with study  drug and site visits at Day 1, 15, 29 and 57.
Follow -up period (Day 58 to Day 85 [End of Study  (EOS)]) 
Includes a follow -up site visit on Day 71, and an (EOS) phone call on Day 85.
Screening Period: 
After signing the ICF, screening procedures for the subject will start ( Visit 1). Subjects will 
be required to meet both the 1990 and 2010 ACR criteria for fibrom yalgia. T he investigator
or other qualified individual at the site will confirm the diagnosis of fibromy algia . 
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, stud y site personnel will 
check that potential subjects have not alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed 
screening or have been randomized into this study , or another clinical trial, using an 
independent subject participation database.  Independent subject participation databases seek 
to reduce duplicate enrollment by  identify ing duplicates before t hey randomize into the study , 
and this measure is consistent with exclusion requirement of not participating in another 
interventional clinical trial during the conduct of the study  (inclusion criterion 17).  I n order 
to complete this check and per the inf ormed consent, study  personnel will request that the 
subject present a valid picture identification (e.g. driver’s license, passport, state issued ID 
card, etc.) and stud y personnel may be required to provide certain authorized information

etc.) so that the match algorithms can be r un. 
Subjects that meet the inclu sion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not identified 
as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainl y, possible, probably), will be enrolled into the study . 
Appropriate documentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility  according to these criteria w ill 
be reflective in the subject’s source documents.
Subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be instructed , if medicall y appropriate , towash -
out of an y prohibited medications via phone call from the site . At Visit 2,all subject s who 
continue to m eet eligibility  criteria will be provided with an electronic diary (e -diary ). 
Subjects will enter a 1 -week Baseline Diary  Run -In, and during this period ,they will record 
their daily  average pain score (0 –10 Numerical Rating Scale [NRS]) and sleep qualit y 
information with the Fibromy algia Sleep Diary  (FMSD) in the e -diary . They  will receive 
instructions regarding its use and begin entering daily  scores. Upon awakening, subject s are 
to rate their sleep quality  during the previous night using the e -diary . Each evening before 
bed, subject s are to rate their average pain during the previous 24 hours using the e -diary . 
Subjects will need to have a mean daily  average pain score ≥ 4 and ≤ 9 (0 -10 NRS), and meet
pre-specified criteria for daily  average pain scores . 
A subject who does not meet the required mean daily  average pain score or who is not 
compliant with e -diary  entries by  completing at least 5 of 7 day s in the baseline run -in, will 
be considered a screen failure and will not be allowed to repeat the pain assessments nor 
rescreen for the stud y.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1Acetaminophen may  be used as rescue therapy  for intolerable pain due to fibromy algia 
during the baseline period and in all subsequent study  periods [see Section 4.1.3 Rescue 
Medication ]. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs) will be allowed (with the 
exception of celecoxib), as needed, for non -fibromy algia pain, such as headache .
Throughout the treatment period, beginning on Day 1 (Randomization ) through 
Visit6/Week 8, subject s will record all dail y average pain scor es (NRS) and any  
acetaminophen use in the e -diary . FMSD sle ep quality  scores will be recorded through 
Visit 6/Week 8. Subject s will take study  drug once per day  (qd). Subjec ts randomized to 
ASP0819 will receive 15 mg (3capsules of 5 mg each) .In order to maintain the study  blind,
placebo treated subject s will receive matching capsules . 
During the treatment period, subject s will return to the clinic per schedule for safet y and 
efficacy  procedures (see Schedule of Assessments for details). Subjects who do not complete 
the treatment period will be requested to complete EOT visit procedures.
Follow -up Period:
Subjects areencouraged to abstain from any  concomitant medications for the treatment of 
fibromy algia pain prior to Visit 7/Week 10. Rescue medicati on is allowed during the follow -
up period. Subjects will continue to enter their daily  average pain score (NRS) , FMSD sleep 
quality  scores and acetaminophen use into their e -diary  and return diaries at Visit 7/Week 10. 
All subject s will return to the site for a follow -upvisit at Day 71, 2weeks following the 
EOT visit ( Day 57). A follow -up safet y phone call will take place approximately 4 weeks 
post study  drug discontinuation ( Day 85/EOS).
Interim Analys es:
Two interim anal yses for futility  based on the p rimary  efficacy  endpoint will be conducted. 
The timing of these anal yses will be at approximately 35% and 55% of allsubject s with 
Week 8/EOT data [see Section 7.7Interim Anal ysis]. The plan for the interim analy sis may  
be modified based on the speed of recruitment.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
The analgesic efficacy  of ASP0819 w ill be assessed at a dose of 15 mg qdover a period of 
8weeks.
Target exposures assessed in this proof -of -concept study  are based on efficacious exposures 
from the rat vagotom y model,which showed significant signs of analgesia with an EC50 (C eff) 
at 119 ng/mL , and rat reserpine induced m yalgia nerve firing model ,which showed significant 
signs of pharmacology  at tested ex posures ranging from approx imately 90ng/mL to 
5000 ng/mL . Based on the Phase 1 human PK data, the predicted mean C trough (95% Prediction 
Interval [PI ]) following 15mg qdis 2610 ng/mL  (1450 -3850 ng/mL) . All subject s are 
predicted to have C trough concentrations above the target efficacious exposure (C eff119 ng/mL).
The predicted mean C max(95%PI) and AUC tau(95%PI) for a 15 mg qd dose of ASP0819 
insubject s are 4380 ng/mL (2790 –6090 ng/mL) a nd 76200 ng*hr/mL

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1(44700 -109800 ng*hr /mL), respectivel y. These predicted mean exposures are below the 
previously  established mean exposure limits; and they  are approximately  3-fold or m ore below 
the 13 -wk rat and dog no -observed -advers e-effect -level Cmaxand AUC 24.
The 13 -wklowest -observed -adverse -effect level (LOAELs ; 10 mg/kg/day  in rat and dog 
studies) are based on the observations of atroph y in mucosal epithelium in both rats and dogs 
and necrosis or degeneration in parietal cells in dogs. All findings were reversible. There is 
approximately  a 9-fold safet y margin based on the LOAELs from the 13 -wk rat and dog 
toxicology  studies to the predicted upper 95% PI for C maxand AUC 24 from a 15 mg qddose.
Thus, a dose of 15 mgqd should provide exposure within an efficacious target range and 
below exposures associated with toxicity  in nonclinical studies.

4.4 Blinding
4.4.1 Blinding Method 
This is a double blind study . Subjects will be randomized to receive AS P0819 or Placebo in a 
blinded fashion such that neither the investigator, Sponsor’s study  management team, clinical 
staff, nor the subject will know which agent is being administered. The randomization
number will be assigned based on information obtained from the Interactive Response 
Technology  (IRT).
4.4.2 Confirmation of the Indistinguishability of the Study Drugs 
The appearance and the form of both the drug and packaging are identical to those of their 
matching placebo. 
4.4.3 Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Treatment Code 
Breaking 
The randomization list and study  medication blind will be maintained by  theInteractive 
Response Technology  (IRT) sy stem. Details of steps to maintain treatm ent blind in the study  
team during the interim analy sis will be described in an I nterim Anal ysis Plan (IAP).
4.4.4 Breaking the Treatment Code for Emergency 
The treatment code for each randomized subject will be provided by  the IRT in the event of a
medical eme rgency  requiring knowledge of the treatment assigned to the subject . The time,
date, subject number and reason for obtaining any of these codes, and therefore breaking the
blind, must be documented in the study  file. They must only  be requested by  the inve stigator
or other persons designated as sub -investigators. No subject s or other study  personnel will be
made aware of the treatment given to an y subject unless a medical emergency  necessitates
such disclosure. Unblinding of the stud y drug should only  be co nsidered for subject safet y or 
when critical therapeutic decisions are contingent upon knowing the blinded study  drug 
assignment. An yunblinding by  the investigational staff must be reported immediately  to the 
Sponsor and must include an explanation of wh ythe study  drug was unblinded. If possible, 
the Sponsor should be contacted prior to unblinding of the stud y drug.
4.4.5 Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sponsor
The Sponsor may  break the treatment code for subjects who experience a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), in order to determine if the individual case 
or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting. Individual Emergency  Cod es will

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1be provided to the limited staff who are responsible to break the codes for all SUSAR cases 
for reporting purposes.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
All subject numbers will be assigned using the IRTstarting at Screening . Randomization will 
be stratified by site. Allsubjects will have a unique, 10 -digit subject number. The first 
5digits of this number will be the investigator’s site number. The second 5 digits assigned 
will represent the subject’s accession number. This will be the number that identifie s a 
subject during the course of the study .
All subjects who meet the eligibility  criteria will be randomized. Subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to ASP0819 or placebo according to the randomization schedule through IRT. 
The site person al will disp ense the treatment according to the IRT s ystem’s assignment .
If a subject is assigned a randomization number, but does not receive study  drug, the 
randomization number will not be used again. The randomization schedules that determine 
subject treatment wil l be computer -generated b y IRT before the beginning of the study .
Specific procedures for randomization through the I RT are contained in the study -specific 
IRTmanual.
5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION
5.1 Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other 
Medication(s)
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
Subjects randomized to the ASP081 9 group will receive ASP0819 15 mg (3 capsules of 
5mg) qdfor the duration of 8 weeks. Subject randomized to the placebo group will receive 
placebo to match ASP0819 (3 capsules) qdfor the duration of 8 weeks. 
Doses should be taken in the morning with or without food. In case a subject forgets a dose, 
the dose should be taken as soon as they  remember but prior to bedtime that day . The next 
day's dose should still be taken as planned. Two doses should not be taken in the same day .
At Randomization and at Visit 4(Week 2),subjects will receive the assigned treatment 
sufficient for a period of 2 weeks (including morning dose on the day  of the next visit). At 
Visit 5(Week 4)subjects will receive the assigned treatment sufficient for a period of 4 weeks. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur on Day 1 in the clinic at approximately  1 to 4 hour(s) 
after dosing and once (anytime during the visit) at Week s 2, 4 and 8. There are no fasting 
requirements for the pharmacokinetic samples but date and time of the dose taken prior to 
collecting the pharmacokinetic sample, as well as the date and time of the last meal in 
relation to that dose will be capture din the eCRF.

case report .
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study  drug . 
Investigator or designee should ensure that study  subjects meet this goal throughout the study  
period . Compliance will be verified b y the accounti ng of stud y drug at each visit after 
Randomization . When study  drug is administered at the research facility , it will be 
administered under the supervision of study  personnel.
Compliance of the study  drug will be monitored by  the accounting of unused medication 
returned b y the subject at visits. Compliance will be documented.
If compliance is less than 80%, or over 100%, the investigator or designee is to counsel the 
subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. 
5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
5.2.1 Demographics
Date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity ,height ,weight , and BMI will be recorded at Screening
(Visit 1). Height will be measured at Screening only. Weight will also be collected prior to 
Randomization and at Week 8/EOT .
5.2.2 Medical History
A detailed medical history (including ps ychiatric history )for each subject will be obtained at 
Screening , including prio rmedication and contraception use. All relevant past and present 
conditions, as well as prior surgical procedures will be recorded. Presence of current and/or 
pastmajor depressive disorder will be captured in the eCRF. Any history  of diagnosis of the 
following disorders will be captured in the eCRF: temporomandibular disorders, irritable 
bowel sy ndrome, chronic tension ty pe headache, migraine, chronic low back pain, my algic

in the eCRF . 
The number of tender points, WPI and SS score will be completed by  the clinician on a tablet 
device during the Screening visit. Subjects should have a WPI  ≥7 and SS score ≥ 5 or WPI 
of 3 to 6 and SS scale score ≥ 9. Tender point examination training of the princip al
investigator and/or designated site study  physician must be documented.
Severity  of pain due to fibromy algia will be assessed through the PGI S and the FIQR and 
subjects will use a tablet device for completion .Subjects should have a FIQR pain score of 
≥4 at Visit 1 to be eligible for participation in this study . In addition, the NPSI  will be used 
to characterize the presence of neuropathic pain sy mptoms.
In order to be eligible for Randomization (Visit 3), subjects will be required to have a mean 
daily  average pain score of ≥ 4 and ≤9on the NRS during th e Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod 
and meeting pre -specified criteria for dail y average pain scores. 
The Complex Medical Symptoms Inventory  (CMSI ) is designed to aid clinicians in 
collecting information from fibromy algia patients regarding their disease -specific s ymptoms 
and to characterize th e diagnosis . The inventory  contains 2parts: a sy mptom checklist to be 
completed b y patients, and a diagnostic inventory completed b y the clinician . In this study , 
only the s ymptom checklist will be utilized.
The sy mptom checklist contains 39 items (males) or 41 items (females) . For each s ymptom 
question, patients mark a box to indicate if the s ymptom: 1) h as occurred for at least 
3months in the past y ear, and/or 2) has occurred for a 3 -month period during their lifetime . 
Only the boxes that apply  should be checked . 
The CMSI  will be completed on the tablet device by  the subject at Baseline Diary  Run -In
(Visit 2).
5.2.4 Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The M.I.N.I. International Neurops ychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. 7.0) is a short, structured 
diagnos tic interview administered by  trained personnel . The instrument captures the major 
Axis I  psychiatric disorders in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM -V)and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems ( ICD-10), and has demonstrated equivalent reliability , validit y, and decreased 
interview time when compared to the Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM diagnoses 
(SCI D-P). Each module begins with screening questions that are answered y es or no. A
negative response in the screening algorithm advances the interview to the next module, 
whereas a positive response will prompt additional questions that ask patients to characterize 
behavior with “y es” or “no” responses . Some questions contain a recall p eriod (e.g., “Past 
Two Weeks ,”“Past Episode” and “Current Episode”) . After completion of the additional 
questions, the clinician indicates whether or not the diagnostic criteria have been met, based 
on the instrument scoring criteria [Sheehan et al, 1998; Amorim et al, 1998; Sheehan et al, 
1997; L ecrubier et al, 1997] .

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1The M.I.N.I .7.0 will be completed at Screening by trained site personnel, in accordance with 
the structured interview requirements.
5.2.5 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
HADS is a 14-item self-report scale developed for the assessme nt of anxiety  and depression 
in non-psychiatric populations . Each item is rated on a 4 -point L ikert-type scale with vary ing 
level descriptors specific to each item. For the pur poses of this study , only the 7 -item 
depression subscale will be administered to monitor subjects for moderate to severe 
symptoms of depression [Snaith, 2003; White et al, 1999; Hermann, 1997; Zigmond & 
Snaith, 1983].
The HADS depression subscale will be recorded on a tablet device at Screeni ng and at
Randomization before dosing. Subjects will be excluded in case they have a score of > 14 at
Screening or Randomization. The HADS depression subscale will also be administered at
Week 8/EOT.
5.3 Efficacy andPharmacokinetics Assessment s
The subject s will use a handheld device, e -diary , to report dail y average pain NRS scores , 
enter FMSD data and to capture rescue medication use. Data will be automatically  
transmitted to a central database.
The questionnaires on efficacy  to be performed during the clin ic visits ( FIQR, PGIC, PGIS, 
EQ-5D-5Land mIBS-D Symptoms Diary) will be reported on a tablet device [see also 
Appendix 12.6].Efficacy will also be assessed using the HADS depression subscale [see 
Section 5.2.5Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale].
Subjec ts will receive instructions on how to complete the e-diary /tablet and will be counseled
on the importance of completing the e -diary  daily and should be retrained on the use of the 
diary  as needed. During the start of Baseline Diary Run -In(Visit 2),the subject will be given 
sufficient time to practice e -diary completion, supervised b y trained site personnel.
Questionnaires need to be completed b y the subject prior to an y other study assessment.
During the Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod, subjects must record dail y average pain ratings on
a minimum of 5 of 7 days in order to be randomized in the study .
5.3.1 Daily Average Pain Numerical Rating Scale
TheNRS is a generic instrument for the assessment of pain, consisting of a single question 
that asks subjects to record their dail y average pain on an 11 -point scale, where 0 anchors 
“no pain ”and 10 “pain as bad as you can imagine .”The recall period is the last 24 hours. To 
be eligible for the stud y subjects should be compliant with daily  pain recordings during the 
Baseline Diary  Run -Inperiod, as defined by  the comp letion of a minimum of 5 of 7 dail y 
average pain ratings and agrees to complete dail y diaries throughout the duration of the 
study .
The NRS should be completed by  the subject daily  for the duration of the study , in the 
evening and at a consistent time each day. Throughout the study , the subject s should be

The NRS will be collected from the start of the base line run -in period through Week 10.
5.3.2 Fibromyalgia Sleep Diary
The Fibrom yalgia Sleep Diary  (FMSD) is an 8 -item patient reported outcome (PRO ) measure 
of sleep disturbance specific to fibromy algia patients, covering the hy pothesized domains of 
Falling Asleep, Stay ing Asleep, and Sufficient Sle ep. Each item is rated on an 11 -pt NRS
anchored b y “0-not at all” and “10 –extremel y.”The subject completes the FMSD to rate 
their quality  of sleep during the previous night. The instrument has completed qualitative 
development in accordance with the Federal Drug Administration ( FDA )PRO guidance and 
ISPOR recommendations, and has established content validity  [Kleinman et al, 2014] . 
The FMSD will be completed on the electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO )device b y 
the subject, daily  upon awakening, starting at Baseline Diary  Run -In(Visit 2)until Week 10 
(Visit 7).
5.3.3 Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised
FIQRwas d eveloped to capture the total spectrum of problems related to fibromy algia and 
the responses to therap y. The original FIQ and FIQR have been extensively  used as an index 
of disease activity  and therapeutic efficacy . The 21 -item FIQR contains 3domains: activities 
of daily  living, overall impact, and s ymptoms . Subjects answer each question on an 11 -pt 
NRS , with anchors appropriate to e ach question . The recall period is the last 7 day s or, for 
the physical function domain, the last time the activity  was performed if not within the 7 day  
recall period [Bennett et al, 2009] .
The FIQR will be completed b y the subject on the tablet device atRandomization and at the 
Week 2, 4, 8/EOT and Week 10 visit. At Screening ,the subject only completes the pain item 
of the FIQR. 
5.3.4 Patient Global Impression of Change and Patient Global Impression of 
Severity
PGIC and PGI Sare adaptable global indices that capture the patient’s perspective on a 
defined condition. The PGI C is a self -administered 7 -pt Likert scale that asks subjects to 
evaluate their fibrom yalgiarelative to baseline . The PGICis anchored b y “very much 
improv ed” and “very  much worse.” The PGIS is a self-administered 6 -ptLikert scale that 
asks subjects to evaluate how their fibrom yalgia is now . The PGISis anchored b y “no 
symptoms” to “very  severe”. 
Both the PGIC and the PGISwill be completed by  the subject on the tablet device at the site . 
The PGICwill be completed at Week s 2, 4, 8 and 10 . The PGISwill be completed at 
Randomization , Week s 2, 4, 8 and 10 .

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 15.3.5 Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory
The NPSI  is a self -report questionnaire specifically  designed to evaluate the different
symptoms of neuropathic pain [ Bouhassira et al , 2004] . The questionnaire comprises a list of 
10 descriptors (plus 2 temporal items) reflecting spontaneous, parox ysmal and evoked pain 
(i.e., mechanical and thermal allody nia/hy peralges ia) and paresthesia/d ysesthesia. Each of 
these items is quantified on a (0 –10) numerical scale, with 0 = none and 10 = worst 
imaginable. The NPSI discriminates and quantifies 5 distinct clinically  relevant dimensions 
of neuropathic pain syndromes. The inst rument is being used to understand neuropathic pain 
symptoms that the subjects may  have at study  entry , and to evaluate any  change in s ymptoms 
during the stud y.
The NPSI  will be completed by  the subject on the tablet device at the site at Randomization 
andWeek 8/EOT.
5.3.6 European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions -5 Levels Questionnaire
The subject s’ general health status will be assessed by  theEQ-5D-5L. The EQ -5D-5L is an 
international and standardized nondisease specific (i.e., generic) instrument for describing 
and valuing health status. I t is a multidimensional measure of Health -Related Quality  of Life , 
capable of being expressed as a single index value and specificall y designed to complement 
other health status measures. The EQ -5D-5L has 5 dimensions: Mobility , Self -Care, Usual 
Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety /Depression. I n the newest version, each dimension 
has 5 response levels (e. g., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems and unable to perform the activity ). In addition, it has a vertical visual analog scale 
that elicits a self -rating by  the respondent of his/her health status on a scale from 0 (bottom: 
“The worst health y ou can imagine”) to 100 (top: “The best health y ou can imagine”).
The EQ -5D-5L will be completed on the tablet device by  the subject at Randomization
(predose), Week 8 and Week 10.
5.3.7 Modified Irritable Bowel Syndrome -Diarrhea Predominant
ThemIBS-D is a 5-item questionnaire that assesses the predominant s ymptoms of IBS -D 
(abdominal pain, stomach pain, abdominal pressure, bloating , abdominal cramping) on an 11 -
ptNRS (0 -absence of sy mptoms to 10 -severe sy mptoms) . The items in the mIBS -D are
derived from the 7 -item IBS -D. The instrument is being used to understand IBS-like 
symptoms that the subject s may  have at study  entry , and toevaluate any change in s ymptoms 
during the study [Delgado -Herrera et al, 2016; Rosa et al, 2016 ; Marquis et al, 2 014].
Subject s will be asked to complete the questionnaire items while considering 2distinct recall 
periods (previous 24 hours and last 7 day s).
The mIBS-D Symptoms D iary (5 items) will be completed by  the subject on the tablet device 
at Randomization and at Week s 2, 4 and 8/EOT.

following pressure ≤ 4 kg. 
The medical doctor will conduct the exam, determine findings and assess any  abnormalities 
as to clinical significance and whether an y exclusion criter ia have been met . After stud y drug 
administration, new abnormal findings or a worsening of an ongoing abnormal condition 
must be recorded as an AE.
5.4.5 Electrocardiogram 
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening , Randomization , EOT and FU visits . All 
ECGs should be taken before an y scheduled blood draws. ECGs will be recorded with the 
subject in the supine position, after the subject has been l yingdown for approximately  5 
minutes. There should be at least 5 minutes between ECG measurements in case a repeat is 
needed. Any clinicall y significant adverse changes on the ECG will be reported as AEs.
Printouts of all ECGs, marked with the subject number and initials, visit date and visit 
number should be stored in the subject ’s source data.
5.4.6 Colombia Suicide Sever ity Rating Scale
The C-SSRS was developed as a screening tool to identify  suicide risk . The interview asks 
subjects detailed questions regarding suicidal ideation, behaviors, intensity of ideation, and 
attempts . Response options and recall periods vary in accordance with the nature of the 
question . The scale requires training to ensure appropriate administration . 
The C -SSRS will be performed by  train ed site staff via interview at Screening , 
Randomization , and at Week s 2, 4, 8 and 10 . At Screening , the “ Screening /baseline” version 
is to be used to determine eligibility . During all subsequent visits, the “Since last visit” 
version is used to monitor on -study  suicidal ideation and behavior after the initial assessment. 
Responses will be reported on the tab let device . 
Subjects who have a history  of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior within the last 12 months, 
or has suicidal ideation within the last 12 months (a response of “y es” to questions 4 or 5 on 
the suicidal ideation domain), will be excluded.
5.5 Adve rse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporall y associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE 
can theref ore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal product.
In order to identify  any events that may  be associated with study  procedures and could lead 
to a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not 
received treatment. AE collection begins after the signing of the informed consent and will be 
collected until 4 weeks after the last dose of study  drug.

19Dec 2016 Astellas Page 60of 103
Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical examination) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets 1 of 
the following criteria:
Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
Requires active intervention
Requires interruption or discontinuation of study  drug
The abnormalit y or test value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the investigator.
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An AEis considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the following outcomes: 
Results in death
Is life -threatening (an AEis considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study )or 
leads to prolongation of hospitalization (hospitalization for 
treatment/observat ion/examination caused by  AE is to be considered as serious) 
Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below)
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the 
subject or may  require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above. These events, incl uding those that may  result in disability /incapacity , should also 
usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that 
do not result i n hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. 
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events . If an AEis 
reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “alway s serious ,” 
additional information on the event may  be requested . 
5.5.3 Special Situations
Special Situations observed in association with the study  drug(s) (e.g., test drug, comparator, or 
background therap y) administered to the subject as part of the stud y are collected as described 
in the table below. These Special Situations are not considered AEs but can be associated with 
or result in an AE. An AE that may  be associated with or result from a Special Situation is to 
be assessed separatel y from the Special Situation and captured in the eCRF or electronic data 
source. If the AE meets the definition of serious, these SAEs are to be collected via the

5.5.4 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
AEs that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as " AEs whose 
relationship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out" .
Causal relationship
to the study drugCriteria for ca usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal  relationship to study  drug administration ,which makes a 
causal relationship improbable, and /orin which other drugs, 
chemicals or underl ying disease provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the study  drug, but 
which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or 
unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the study  drug, 
unlikely  to be attributed to concurrent disease or  other drugs or 
chemicals, and which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -
administration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).
5.5.5 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event
The investigato r will use the following definitions to rate the severity  of each AE:
Mild: No disruption of normal daily  activities
Moderate: Affect snormal dail y activities
Severe: Inability  to perform daily  activities

5.5.7 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
All AEs occurring during or after the sub ject has discontinued the study are to be followed up 
until resolved or judged to be no longer clinicall y significant, or until they  become chronic to 
the extent that they  can be fully  characterized by the investigator . 
If during AEfollow -up, the AEprogresse sto an"SAE ," or if a subject experiences a new 
SAE , the investigator must immediately  report the information to the Sponsor . 
Please refer to [Appendix 12.3 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment ]fordetailed 
instructions on Drug -Induced Liver Injury .
5.5.8 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
No common SAEs have been identified at this time. Common SAEs are SAEs commonly  
anticipated to occur in the study  populatio n independent of drug exposure. SAEs classified as 
“common” are provided in [Appendix 12.4 Common Serious Adverse Events ]for reference. 
The list does NOT change the investigator’s reporting obligations or prevent the need to 
report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detaile d above. The purpose of this list is to 
alert the investigator that some events reported as SAEs may  not require expedited reporting 
to the regulatory  authorities based on the classification of “common SAEs ” as specified in 
[Appendix 12.4 Common Serious Adverse Events ]. The Sponsor will monitor these events 
throughout the course of the stu dy for any  change in frequency . Any changes to this list will 
be communicated to the participating investigational sites. Investigator s must report 
individual occurrences of these events as stated in [Section 5.5.6 Reporting of Serious 
Adverse Events ]. 
5.5.9 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If a female subject becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 28days from 
the discontinuation of dosing, the investigator is to report the information to the Sponsor
according to the timelines in [Section 5.5.6 Reporting of a Serious Adverse Event ]using the 
pregnancy  reporting form and the SAE/Special Situation Worksheet . 
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy  information on any  female partner of a 
male subject who becomes pregnant during the study  dosing period or within 28days from 
the discontinuation of dosing and report the information to Sponsor according to the 
timelines in [Section 5.5.6 Reporting of a Serious Advers e Event ]using the pregnancy

information.
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s (spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [includin g anomaly  in a 
miscarried fetus ]), the investigator shou ld respond in accordance with [Section 5.5.6
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event ]. Additional information regarding the outcome of a 
pregnancy  (which is categorized as an SAE ) is mentioned as follows:
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes misc arriage, abortion and missed abortion .
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
its relationship with the study  drug .
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationsh ip 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible" by  
the investigator .
●In the case of a delivery  of a living newborn, the "normalit y" of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth .
●Unless a congenital anomaly  isidentified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination .
5.5.10 Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
No information on overdose with ASP0819 in humans is available. Following a s uspected 
overdose, stud y subjects should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care and 
observed in a controlled medical setting according to the current standard of care. The 
Medical Monitor/Expert sho uld be contacted when appropriate .
5.5.11 Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study
When new information becomes available necessary  for conducting the clinical study  
properl y, the Sponsor will inform all investigators involved in the clinical study ,as well as 
the regulatory  authorit ies. Investigator s should inform the I RBof such information when 
needed. 
The investigator will also inform the subjects, who will be required to sign an updated 
informed consent form (ICF) in order to continue in the clinical study .
5.6 Test Drug Concentrati on
Test drug concentration will be measured to evaluate clinical pharmacokinetics of ASP0819 
and an y metabolites (if applicable) . Pharmacokinetic blood sampling will occur on Day 1 in 
the clinic at approximately 1 to 4 hour(s) after dosing and once (any time during the visit) at 
Week s 2, 4 and 8. Date and time of the dose taken prior to collecting the PK sample, as well 
as the date and time of the last meal in relation to that dose will be captured in the eCRF.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 16 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s) 
A discontinuation from treatment is a subject who enrolled in the study  and for whom study  
treatment is permanently  discontinued for any  reason . 
The subject is free to withdraw from the study  treat ment and/or study  for any  reason and at 
any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty  or prejudice. The 
investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from study  treatment or toterminate a 
subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the subject 's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing AEor an unresolved laboratory  
result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to 
provide follow -upuntil the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically  significant. 
Discontinuation Criteria from Treatment for Individual Subjects :
1.Subject develops unacceptable toxicity
2.Subject is lost to follow -updespite reasonable efforts by  the investigator to locate the 
subject
3.Subject withdraws consent for further treatment
4.Female subject becomes pregnant
5.Monitoring of liver safety is done to address the potential for liver toxicity  (see 
[Appendix 12.3] for details).
If an individual subject has an ALT or AST result > 3 x UL N or total bilirubin level 
(TBL )> 2 x UL N, testing should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours of notification of the 
test results ; and then twice weekl yliver safet y tests will be performed until normalization 
or study  discontinuation.
Any subject that meets the following criteria below [outlined in the FDA Guidance for
Industry , Drug -Induced Liver Injury : Pre-marketing Clinical Evaluation (July  2009)] 
should be considered for discontinuation from treatment.
●ALT or AST > 8 x ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 x ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and (TBL > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio 
[INR] > 1.5)
●ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)
Even if a subject discontinues treatment the subject should be asked to continue completion 
of the EOT, follow -upand EOS visits.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 16.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination .Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the Sponsor will immediately notify the 
investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of Astella s 
Pharma Global Development -United States ( APGD -US). A Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) 
will be written to provide details of the anal ysis, along with specifications for tables, listings 
and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before the first interim lock at the 
latest. Any  changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be justified in the Clinical Study  
Report (CSR).
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
SD, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and frequency and 
percentage for categorical endpoints.
7.1 Sample Size
The sample size calculations are based on the primary  efficacy  endpoint of change from 
baseline to Week 8 in mean daily  average pain NRS . A meta -analysis of the change from 
baseline in mean dail y average pain NRS for pregabalin or duloxetine vsplacebo in studies 
for fibrom yalgia indicated an effect size of approximately  0.30 . 
Using an effect size of 0.39 (30% larger than the meta -analysis result) for the primary  
efficacy  endpoint for the comparison of ASP0819 vsplacebo, 84 subject s in the ASP0819
and placebo groups would be required to provide 80% power to demonstrate statistical 
significance using a 1-sided 5% significance level (based on the assumption of normally  
distributed data, and taking into account the interim analy sis for futility ).
The total number of subject s required for the analy sis would be 168 (84:84 subject s in 
ASP0819 :placebo groups ). Assuming approximately  5% of randomize d subject s will not 
contribute to the anal ysis, then a total of 178 subject s would be required for randomization 
using a 1:1 randomization ratio (89:89) subject s for the ASP0819 :placebo groups.
7.2 Analysis Sets
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in Classification Specifications and for the 
allocation of subjects to analy sis sets, except Pharmacokinetic Anal ysis Set (PKAS), will be 
determined prior to database hard -lock. The allocation of subject s to PKAS will be 
determined after database hard lock.

least 1 dose of stud y drug. This will be the anal ysis set for demographic and baseline 
summaries and all efficacy  anal yses.
When the FAS is utilized in an anal ysis, subject s will be presented by  the randomized 
treatment group, even if the treatment they  received was different. 
7.2.2 Per Protocol Set
The per protocol set (PPS) will consist of asubset of subjects from the FAS who meet criteria 
based on adherence to the protocol ,which may  affect the primary  efficacy  endpoint or select 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints. The PPS criteria will be defined in the SAP .
The PPS will beused for demographic and baseline characteristic summaries an d for 
sensitivity  anal yses of the primary  endpoint and select secondary  efficacy  endpoints .
7.2.3 Safety Analysis Set
The safet y analysis set (SAF) willconsist of all randomized subjects who took at least 1 dose 
of study  drug . The SAF will be used for demograph ic and baseline characteristic summaries 
and all safet y analyses.

score assessed b y NRS (0 to 10 scale) in the subject ’s daily  e-diary . 
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary  analysis for the primary  endpoint of c hange from baseline to Week 8 in the 
mean dail y average pain NRS will use a MMRM analysis, where the model will include the 
effects for treatment group, center (pooled where nec essary ), time (stud y Week 1 to 8 ) and 
treatment -by-time interaction, as well as the covariates of baseline mean daily  average pain 
NRS and baseline pain -by-treatment interaction and subject as a random effect . The 
unconstrained between -time-point covariance structure will be used. If this is not feasible, 
additional covariance structures will be considered and details will be provided in the SAP. 
This analy sis w ill utilize observed data, and there will be no imputation for missing data. The 
treatment group contrast for change from baseline to Week 8 will be the primary  statistical 
inference obtained from the MMRM analy sis. Least squares estimates for the primary  
endpoint will be shown for each treatment group, and for the treatment comparisons of 
ASP0819 vsplacebo with 2 -sided 90% CIs. A one -sided 5% significance level will be used 
for the comparison involving ASP0819 vsplacebo .

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 112.3 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment 
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases to > 3 × ULN or bilirubin > 2 × ULN should undergo detailed 
testing for liver enzy mes(including at least ALT, AST, AL P, and TBL) . Testing should be 
repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for which a central 
laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated by  the central lab oratory regarding moderate and 
severe liver abnormality  to inform the investigator, study  monitor and study team. S ubjects 
should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3×ULN or > 2×ULN
Severe* > 3×ULN and > 2×ULN
In addi tion, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of 
the following:
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
ALT or AST > 5× ULN for more than 2 weeks . 
ALT or AST > 3× ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinoph ilia (> 5%). 
The investigator may  determine that abnor mal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring 
and follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thor oughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , 
physical examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the liver abnormalit y 
case report form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globall y and can be activated for an y 
study or an appropriate document . Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing 
should be followed as described below.
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly  then weekl y 
or less if abnormalitie s stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic . 
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another 
etiology , may beconsidered an important medical event and may be reported as a SA E. The 
Sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver 
function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the investigator is expected to do the 
following :
Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases . Symptoms 
and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” within the(e)CRF. Illnesses and 
conditions such as hy potensive events and decompensated cardiac disease t hatmay lead to 
secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in obese 
hyperlipoproteinemic and/or diabetic patients and may  be associated with fluctuating AT 
levels .The investigator should ensure that the me dical history  form captures any  illness 
that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing hepatic function. 
Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use and special 
diets . Medications, including dose, is to be entered inthe (e)CRF . Information on alcohol, 
other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document .
Obtain a history  of exposure to envi ronmental chemical agents .
Based on the subject ’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including the following : 
oacute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents) ,
oultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease,
oother laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin .
Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document .
Subject S tudy Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or 
acute liver disease ,or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, the subject may  
be discontinued from the study . The investigator may  determine that it is not in t he subject’s 
best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered 
ifthe LFT results are as follows :
ALT or AST > 8 × ULN .
ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks .
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5) (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated) .
ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.
*Hy’s Law Definition : Drug -induced jaundice caused by  hepatocellular injury , without a 
significant obstructive component, has a high rate of bad outcomes, from 10 to50% mortality  
(or transplant). The 2“requirements” for Hy ’s Law are: 1) Evidence that a drug can cause

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 112.5 Retrospective Pharmacogenomics Sub-Study 
INTRODUCTION
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment 
options are best suited for the subject . Through investigation of PGx by  technolog ies such as 
genot yping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies , the 
relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  be better 
understood. As man y diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic variations, PGx 
research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a subject may  or may  
not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The object ive of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATION
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may participate in this PGx sub -
study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y 
blood samples that m ay be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide 1approximately 6 mL tube 
of whole blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by the uni que 
subject number (first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO 
either directly  from site or via a central laboratory  as directed b y Astellas.
PHARMACOGENOMICS ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established yet. Astellas may initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the drug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and/or safety. 
DISPOSAL OF PHARMACOGEMONICS SAMPLES / DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database hardlock. If there is no requirement for analy sis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw co nsent at 
any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed. The results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely .

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 113 ATTACHMENT 1:  SUBST ANTIAL AMENDMENT 1
I.  The purpose of this amendment is:
Substantial Change
1.PoC Fibromyalgia studies  0819 -CL-0201 and  (see separate 
submission to PAC) are pilot for including duplicate subject check
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
New screening assessment added to section 2.2.1 : after signing informed consent and 
during the screening period, study  site personnel will check that potential subjects have not 
alread y been pre -screened, initiated or completed screening or have been ran domized into 
this study , or another clinical trial, using an independent subject participation database.   
Independent subject participation databases seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by  
identify ing duplicates before they  randomize into the study , and th is measure is consistent 
with exclusion requirement of not participating in another interventional clinical trial during 
the conduct of the stud y.  
In order to complete this check and per the informed consent, study  personnel will request 
that the subject present a valid picture identification (e.g. driver’s license, passport, state 
issued ID card, etc.)  and study  personnel may  be required to provide certain authorized 
information that could potentially  be used to identify  study  subjects identifiers (e.g. date of 
birth, initials, etc.) so that the match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not identified 
as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainl y, possible, probably), will be enrolled into t he study .
Appropriate documentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility  according to these criteria will 
be reflective in the subject’s source documents.
Note : Protocol wording developed in collaboration with the legal department
RATIONALE:
Proliferating problem of professional patients (recognized for a.o. US trials) -Websites 
dedicated to train people on how to get into research studies (e.g. 
Finance. youngmoney.com)
6-11% who seek entry  are, on another trial, in a lock out period or are att empting to enter 
at another facility
Incidence of dual enrollment per trial ranges from 2% to 10% according to the 
therapeutic area and the phase of the stud y
Certain indications attract “repeat” subjects 
Recent study  (3662 -CL-0049) demonstrated that 3% o f subjects were within study  
duplicates (screened only) at two different sites in a small POC study
Fibrom yalgia is a very  heterogeneous disease, lacks rigorous standardized and objective 
diagnostic criteria and relies on patient reported medical history
Implement checking prospectivel y in new (CNS) clinical trials to maximize the signal to 
noise ratio and increase chance of detecting effect size.A third party  vendor will be used

Subjects will provide informed consent for this verification in the study ’s ICF.
Non-Substantial Changes
1.Minor Administrative -type changes
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: 
Wording changes for 8062 protocol also implemented here in the 0819 protocol to align the 2 
FM PoC Ph2 studies.
RATIONALE:
To align with the  study .
2.Clarification of  the number of tender point sites
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
Clarify  the expectation that the patient will be eligible if she/he has pain in ‘at least’ 11 of the 
18 tender point sites.
RATIONALE:
The expectation is that a patient is eligible for study participation if he/she has pain in at least 
11 of the 18 tender point sites. The wording is only mentioning that the patient has pain in 11 
of 18 tende r point sites.
3.Update collection of tender points on site tablet instead of CRF 
DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE:
The FM diagnosis is confirmed using the ACR criteria: Widespread Pain Index, Sy mptoms 
Severity  Scale and the Tender Points. WPI  and SSS are captured by  the investigator on the 
site tablet. We want to include the tender point assessment here as well instead of capturing it 
separately  in the CRF.  
RATIONALE:
Decreasing complexity  forthe site in keeping the 3 assessments together.

Version 2.0 Incorporating Substantial Amendment 1II  Amendment Summary of Changes :
2.1 Study Design and Dose Rationale
Section 2.2.1, Study Design
ADDED :
After signing informed consent and during the screening period, study site personnel 
will check that potential subjects have not already been pre -screened, initiated or 
completed screening or have been randomized into this study, or another clinical trial, 
using an inde pendent subject participation database.  Independent subject 
participation databases seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by identifying duplicates 
before they randomize into the study, and this measure is consistent with exclusion 
requirement of not partic ipating in another interventional clinical trial during the 
conduct of the study ( inclusion criterion 17).  In order to complete this check and per 
the informed consent, study personnel will request that the subject present a valid 
picture identification ( e.g. driver’s license, passport, state issued ID card, etc.)  and 
study personnel may be required to provide certain authorized information that could 
potentially be used to identify study subjects identifiers (e.g. date of birth, initials, etc.) 
so that t he match algorithms can be run. 
Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, and are not 
identified as a duplicate subject (e.g. certainly, possible, probably), will be enrolled 
into the study. Appropriate documentation reflecting the subject’s eligibility according 
to these criteria will be reflective in the subject’s source documents.

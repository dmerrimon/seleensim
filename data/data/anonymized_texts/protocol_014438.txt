 1. SYNOPSIS  
Name of sponsor/company:  Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   
Name of investigational product:  Pramlintide -insulin injection (PRAM9)   
Name of active ingredient:  Pramlintide acetate and recombinant human insulin  
Study title  A Phase 2, Single -Dose, Randomized, Open -Label, Active -Controlled, Crossover, 
Pharmacodynamic, and Pharmacokinetic Comparative Study of a Novel 
Pramlintide -Insulin Co -Formulation in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  
Protocol number  DPI-201 
No. of study centers  Up to 4 sites  in the United States (US)  
Clinical phase  Phase 2  
Study background  Most people with diabetes are still unable to achieve glycemic targets with sole 
insulin therapy alone, particularly after mealtime. Physiologic restoration of the 
hormonal responses during meals, via pramlintide and insulin, has been 
demonstrated to reduc e postprandial hyperglycemia and to improve blood glucose 
time in range.  
The synergy between insulin and pramlintide provides improved glucose control 
while reducing meal -time insulin requirements.  Reduced insulin utilization may 
also reduce the effects a ssociated with long -term insulin use such as weight gain 
and higher risks of hypoglycemia.  
A pramlintide -insulin co -formulation may help reduce the burden associated with 
co-administration (e g, reduce the number of injections per day). Additionally, co -
formulations of pramlintide and insulin may also improve treatment compliance 
and persistency.   
Study rationale  People with diabetes may have a significant loss of pancreatic beta cell function . 
This leads to a deficiency of 2 hormones: insulin and amylin. The combined effect 
of insulin and amylin is to regulate and normalize blood sugar levels.  
Pramlintide is an injectable drug that closely resembles amylin. Many clinical 
studies that add praml intide to insulin have demonstrated improved control of 
blood sugar.  
However, t he benefits of these products  used together also are associated with 
increase d risk of pramlintide -associated nausea  and vomiting; increased n umber of 
required injections; and t ailoring of insulin and pramlintide doses . 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals has developed a novel, liquid -stable, co -formulation of 
pramlintide plus regular insulin  (PRAM9) that can be delivered as a s ingle, 
subcutaneous (SC) injection. The fixed dose combination  product is expected to 
allow better manage ment of  patient glycemic c onditions through improved 
complianc e.   
Study objectives  Primary objective  
 Evaluate the pharmacodynamic  (PD)  properties  of a single dose of PRAM9 
compared to  single doses of regular insulin and regular insulin plus 
pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) in adult s with type 1 
diabetes mellitus  (T1D)

 Secondary objective s 
 Evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profiles of a single dose of 
PRAM9 compared to  single doses of regular insulin and regular insulin plus 
pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) in adult s with T1D  
Study endpoints  Primary  
The PD effect s upon plasma  glucose levels will be compared between the 
treatments as defined by the following primary endpoint:  
 Area under the curve area from administration to 180 minutes (AUC 0-180) 
(mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose >  180 mg/dL  
Secondary  
Safety:  
 Incidenc e of adverse events ( AEs), serious adverse events ( SAEs )  
 Change from baseline in c linical safety laboratory evaluations 
(hematology and serum chemistry ) 
 Change in  vital sign measurements (temperature, respiration, heart rate 
[HR], and blood pressure [BP])  
 Change from baseline in body weight  
 Local tolerability assessments (modified Draize  Scale  and injection site 
discomfort questionnaire s) 
PK/PD: 
Key secondary endpoints include  the following. The full lis t of secondary 
endpoint s is provided in Section 13.3.2.  
 Mean proportional time with plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL  for 
0-180 minutes after study drug administration  
 PK plasma levels ( AUC 0-90 min, AUC 0-180 min , AUC 0-360 min, C max, and T max) 
for both insulin and pramlintide  
 
 
Study design  This is a randomized, open -label, active -controlled, single -dose, 3-treatment, 
3-period, 3-way crossover , comparative PD, and PK inpatient study in adults with 
T1D.  
Methodology  The study comprises 5 visits:  Screening (Visit 1), Treatment Periods (Visits 2 − 
4), and Follow -Up (Visit 5).  
To determine eligibility, s ubjects will complete the Screening  procedures (Visit  1) 
up to 28  days before the first treatment visit (Visit 2) . Sub jects will be instructed to 
eat normally and take their usual medications, but to refrain from alcohol for 
24 hours prior to checking in for treatment visits.  
Treatment periods  
For Treatment Period Visits 2 through 4, eligible subjects will be instructed t o 
arrive for an overnight stay at the clinical research facility on the day prior to each 
treatment visit. At the clinic, subjects will be given a standardized dinner meal, and 
instructed to take their prescribed evening mealtime insulin regimen and basal 
insulin dose. The subjects will fast after midnight but will be allowed to drink ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 water ad libitum (ie, tap water, bottled water, distilled water, etc. [water without 
carbohydrates]) and take any prescribed medications.  
During each Treatment Period  Visit (Visits 2, 3, and 4) , eligible subjects will 
receive a single SC dose of PRAM9, regular insulin, or co -administered regular 
insulin plus pramlintide. On the morning of each treatment visit and prior to 
dosing, a fasting blood sample will be tested using a  blood glucose meter (BGM) 
to confirm that blood glucose is in the range of 80 to 150  mg/dL.   
 If the blood glucose is >  150 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator 
may treat with an intravenous (IV)  bolus dose of regular insulin, per 
discretion, to  bring the subject into the required blood glucose range. 
Before initiating study treatment, a t least 40 minutes should have passed 
from the last dose of administered insulin and the subject ’s glucose level 
should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the blood glucose is <  80 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator 
may treat with oral glucose tabs/solution or IV glucose , per discretion, to 
bring the subject into the required blood glucose range. Before initiating 
study treatment, at least 30 minutes should have passed from the last dose 
of administered glucose  and the subject’s  glucose level should be within 
the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL . 
 If the subject’s blood glucose  cannot be optimized  to 80 to  150 mg/dL 
within 2 hours , then the visit shoul d be rescheduled after a minimum 
24-hour wait, per investigator’s discretion.  
At Visit 2, once blood glucose is confirmed to be within the range of 80 to 
150 mg/dL, subjects will be randomized to their study drug treatment sequence.

Insulin -to-carbohydrate calculations will be used to identify subject doses . All 
subjects will get flexible doses of insulin, pramlintide, and PRAM9 . See 
Section  9.1 for complete information on study drug dosing . The dose of regular 
insulin will be  calculated to correspond to a ratio of 9 µg of pramlintide for every 
1 unit of insulin . Additionally, the dose of regular insulin will be calculated from 
the subject’s insulin -to-carbohydrate (I:C) ratio to match a 75 -gram carbohydrate 
challenge . Rule 450 will be used for carbohydrate counting and insulin dose 
calculation in this study (see Appendix  3). ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 Prior to study drug  administration, a peripheral catheter for blood sampling will be 
placed into a vein ideally located within the antecubital fossa. The hand of the arm 
used for blood sampling will be kept warm by use of a heated hand box to increase 
blood flow and achieve “arterialized” samples. The subject will remain supine and 
kept warm and be allowed to drink only water (ad libitum).  
Once the catheter and hand box are in place, study drug(s) will be administered SC 
over 1 to 3 seconds to the abdomen (around the umbilic us). Co -administered 
regular insulin plus pramlintide injections should be administered to opposite sides 
of the abdomen (ie, left and right peri -umbilicus , opposite quadrants ). Injection 
sites should be rotated to avoid injecting at a previously used site .  
To monitor for hypoglycemia, BGM will be performed in real time at each 
subject’s bedside at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes post dosing at 
Visit 2 through 4.  
To evaluate drug PD (plasma glucose response) and PK (plasma 
insulin/pramlint ide concentrations), blood samples are to be drawn at the time 
points described in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). 
Within 2 minutes  after the 30 minutes post -dose blood draw, a standardized 
75-gram oral glucose challenge should be ingested (within 5 to 10  minutes) by the 
subject.  
After the last blood coll ection (at 360 minutes post -study drug administration), 
subjects are to be provided a regular meal  and insulin  (per investigators’ 
discretion).  
Injection sites will be evaluated by the investigator using the modified Draize scale 
(Appendix  1) and subjects will complete injection site discomfort questionnaires 
(Appendix  2).  
A subject may be discharged from the clinic, per investigator’s criteria, when the 
following has occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen, including insulin  
 Subject’s capillary glucose concentration is confirmed to be >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any time during the visit if hypoglycemia  occurs  (ie, blood glucose < 70 mg/dL), 
the subject will be rescued with IV dextrose  using the followi ng formula to 
calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50% mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  
Where D50% = the dose of IV dextrose, mL = the volume of dextrose, BG = 
the subject’s hypoglycemic blood glucose value  
 
The dose of dextrose should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then blood glucose will be remeasured by blood glucose 
meter at 10, 20, and 30 minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose.  
Successful plasma glucose recovery should be confirmed (ie, glucose returns to  
≥ 70 mg/dL) and the subject medically stabilized . When the subject is medically 
stable, they can be discharged from the clinic (per criteria above) . 
After a first wash out period of  7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for 
Treatment Period  2 (Visit 3) and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 with each subject crossed over to the next randomized study drug treatment 
sequence. Upon check -in and completion of morning activities, the subject will 
receive their second administration of s tudy drug(s).  
After a second wash out period of 7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for 
Treatment Period 3  (Visit 4)  and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated 
with each subject crossed over to the last randomized study drug treatment  
sequence. Upon check -in and completion of morning activities, the subject will 
receive their third administration of study drug(s).  
During the Treatment Periods, subjects will undergo symptom -directed PEs, vital 
sign measurements, AE assessments, concomit ant medication assessments, and 
pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential .  
Follow -Up 
A Follow -up Visit (Visit 5) will be conducted 7 to 11  days after the subject’s last 
dose of study drug(s). Subjects will return to the clinic and undergo co mplete PE, 
vital sign measurements, weight measurements, sample collection for hematology 
and chemistry, AE assessments, concomitant medication assessments, and 
pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential.

of the relationship of the AE to study drug. All AEs are to  be followed until 
resolution or the subject is medically stable.  
Pharmacodynamics  At Visits 2, 3, and 4, samples will be drawn to measure plasma glucose levels. 
Venous blood samples will be drawn 10  ± 2 minutes before and immediately prior 
to dosing  (-2 to 0 minutes) , and then 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 
300, and 360  minutes post -dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) . 
Plasma glucose levels will be used to calculate the following PD parameters: C max, 
Tmax, area over the curve (AOC), and AUC  (see Section 13. 3.2). 
Pharmacokinetics  At Visits 2, 3, and 4, samples will be drawn to measure plasma insulin and 
pramlintide  levels. Venous blood samples will be drawn 10  ± 2 minutes before and 
immediately prior to dosing  (-2 to 0 minutes) , and then 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 
120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360  minutes post -dosing (window allowance of 
± 2 minutes) . 
Insulin and pramlintide concentrations will be used to calculate the following PK 
parameters: C max, Tmax, AUC 0-90, AUC 0-180, and AUC 0-360  
Statistical methods  Complete details for the statistical analyses are included in a separate  Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Medical Need  
The response of insulin and amylin to food intake is absent in patients with type 1 diabetes 
(T1D) due to autoimmune β -cell destruction [ Ludvik 1991, Koda 1992 , Herrmann 2016 ].  
Insulin therapy is the primary treatment option for patients with T1D. 
Despite considerable advances in insulin chemistry, delivery, and pharmacology, only a small 
percentage of diabetic patients achieve near normal glycemic levels with insulin replacem ent 
alone [ Klein 1996,  Whitehouse 2002 ].  The increased risk of severe hypoglycemia and undesired 
weight gain that usually accompany glycemic improvements with insulin therapy represent 
major obstacles toward achieving satisfactory glycemic control [ DCCT 1 997, DCCT 1988 , 
Purnell 1998 ].    
Pramlintide  [AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ], a soluble, nonaggregating, equipotent 
synthetic analog of amylin, is approved by the FDA and used to treat T1D  and T2D patients who 
are unable to obtain near -normoglycem ia with insulin therapy.   In a study conducted in subjects 
with T1D with a mean HbA1c of 8.1 (mean age=41  years, mean duration of diabetes=20  years, 
mean body mass index (BMI)=28  kg/m2), pramlintide (SYMLIN®) or placebo was administered 
at major meals as an add on to insulin therapy at a dose of 15  µg and titrated upward at weekly 
intervals of 15  µg to maintenance doses of 30  µg or 60  µg.  The insulin dose was reduced by 
30% to 50% in order to minimize the risk of developing hypoglycemia .  Those who receiv ed 
pramlintide had a mean percent reduction of 7.1% in the mealtime insulin dose at 6  months post 
study drug administration initiation compared with 2.4% reduction in the placebo group 
[AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
Many clinical studies that add  pramlintide to insulin have demonstrated improved control of 
blood sugar, lower hemoglobin A1c, and better patient satisfaction and well -being.  However, the 
benefits of these products used together also are associated with increased risk of pramlintide -
associated nausea and vomiting ; increased number of required injections; and tailoring of insulin 
and pramlintide doses  [AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
Although pramlintide does not cause hypoglycemia, when combined with insulin, the risk of 
severe  hypoglycemia is increased .  In subjects with T1D, in 6 -month controlled trials without 
insulin reduction at initiation, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 16.8% (0 to 3  months, 
n=716) in subjects receiving pramlintide and insulin , as compared with 1 0.8% (0 to 3  months, 
n=538)  in subjects receiving placebo and insulin  [AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, 2016 ]. 
In addition to the risk of hypoglycemia , separated administrations of insulin and amylin at 
distinct times before meals, varying doses, and multi ple injection sites are impediments to patient 
compliance that counter the known therapeutic benefits of pramlintide .  A fixed -ratio, single -
injection of a co -formulated insulin -pramlintide preparation would be desirable in mimicking 
physiological patterns  [Riddle 2015 , da Silva 2018 ].  
4.2. Xeris’ Pramlintide -Insulin Injection  
Xeris Pharmaceuticals has developed a liquid -stable , co-formulation  of a fixed -ratio combination 
of 9 µg pramlintide  per unit of regular insulin  (PRAM9) that can be delivered as a single SC ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0

 injection .  The fixed -dose combination is designed to reduce the treatment burden associated 
with concomitant insulin and pramlintide therapy, ie, reduce the number of daily aggregate 
injections because the pramlintide would not require separate mealtime injections.  
In nonclinical studies, the pharmacokinetic ( PK) and pharmacodynamic  (PD) characteristics  of 
pramlintide and Humulin ® (or regular insulin) or Humalog ® (lispro ins ulin) were studied in 
normal and streptozotocin -induced diabetic rats (ST Z; mimicking T1D) .  Treatments were given 
as separate injections of commercial products or as Xeris’ pramlintide -insulin combined dose 
single injection .  Consistent with pramlintide’s known pharmacological action, there was no 
glucose lowering with pramlin tide alone for either the commercial or Xeris formulation .  
Additionally , glycemic profiles for pramlintide were similar to saline or Xeris vehicle 
administered by SC injection in rats .  Xeris’ pramlintide -insulin formulation showed a longer 
duration of glucose lowering compared to separate injections of commercial pramlintide 
(Symlin®) and insulin (Humulin®).   
This clinical study has been designed to compare the PD, PK, and safety  of PRAM9 with regular 
insulin and regular insulin pl us pramlintide (co -administered as separate injections) when 
injected subcutaneously (SC) in the abdomen of fasted adult s with T1D.   A detailed description 
of, and rationale for the dosing regimen for this study is located in Section 9.1. ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, open -label, active -controlled,  single -dose, 3-treatment,  3-period, 3-way 
crossover , comparative PD  and PK inpatient study in adults with T1D .  The study  comprise s 
5 visits:  Screening (Visit 1), Treatment Period s (Visits 2 − 4), and Follow -Up (Visit 5).  
To determine eligibility, subjects will complete the Screening procedures (Visit  1) up to 28  days 
before the first treatment visit (Visit 2).  Subjects will be instructed to ea t normally and take their 
usual medications, but to refrain from alcohol for 24  hours prior to checking in for treatment 
visits.  
Treatment Periods  
For Treatment Period Visits 2 through 4, eligible subjects will be instructed to arrive for an 
overnight stay  at the clinical research facility on the day prior to each treatment visit.   At the 
clinic, subjects will be given a standardized dinner meal, and instructed to take their prescribed 
evening mealtime insulin regimen and basal insulin dose .  The subjects w ill fast after midnight 
but will be allowed to drink water ad libitum (ie, tap water, bottled water, distilled water, etc. 
[water without carbohydrates]) and take any prescribed medications.  
During each Treatment Period  Visit, subjects will receive a singl e SC dose of PRAM9, regular 
insulin, or co -administered regular insulin plus pramlintide.  On the morning of each treatment 
visit and prior to dosing, a fasting blood sample will be tested using a blood glucose meter  
(BGM)  to confirm that blood glucose is in the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.   
 If the blood glucose is >  150 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator may treat 
with a n intravenous ( IV) bolus dose of  regular insulin, per discretion, to bring the 
subject into the required blood glucose range .  Before initiating study treatment, at 
least 40 minutes should have passed from the last dose of administered insulin and the 
subject’s glucose level should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the blood glucose is < 80 mg/dL after repeat test, then t he investigator may treat 
with oral glucose tabs/solution or IV glucose, per discretion, to bring the subject into 
the required blood glucose range .  Before initiating study treatment, at least 
30 minutes should have passed from the last dose of administer ed glucose and the 
subject’s  glucose level should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
 If the subject’s blood glucose cannot be optimized to 80  to 150 mg/dL within 2  hours, 
then the visit should be rescheduled after a minimum 24 -hour wait, per investiga tor’s 
discretion .   
At Visit 2, once blood glucose is confirmed to be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL, subjects 
will be randomized to their study drug treatment sequence.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

Insulin -to-carbohydrate calculations will be used to identify subject doses.  All subjects will get 
flexible doses of insulin, pramlintide, and PRAM9.  See Section  9.1 for complete information on 
study drug dosing .  The dose of regular insulin is calculated to correspond to a ratio of 9 µg of 
pramlintide f or every 1 unit of insulin.  Additionally, the dose of regular insulin is calculated 
from the subject’s insulin -to-carbohydrate (I:C) ratio to match a 75 -gram carbohydrate challenge.  
Rule 450 will be used for carbohydrate counting and insulin dose calcula tion in this study (see 
Appendix  3).   
Prior to dose administration, a peripheral catheter for blood sampling  will be placed into a vein 
ideally located  within the antecubital fossa .  The hand of the arm used for blood sampling will be 
kept warm by use of a heated hand box to increase blood flow and achieve “arterialized” 
samples .  The subject will remain supine and kept warm and be allowed to drink only water  
(ad libitum).   
Once the catheter and hand box are in place, study drug(s) will be administered SC over 1 to 
3 seconds to the abdomen (around the umbilicus) .  Co-administered regular insulin plus 
pramlintide injections should be administered to oppos ite sides of the abdomen (ie, left and right 
peri-umbilicus, opposite quadrants) .  Injection sites should be rotated to avoid injecting at a 
previously used site.  
To monitor for hypoglycemia, BGM will be performed in real time at each subject’s bedside at  
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes post dosing  at Visit 2 through 4 . BGM 
measurements from the cool hand are allowed.  
To evaluate drug PD ( plasma glucose  response) , blood samples are to be drawn at 10  ± 2 minutes 
before and immediately (-2 to 0 minutes)  prior to study drug injection .  After study drug 
injection, blood samples also will be collected  at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 
300, and 360  minutes post -dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) . After the 60 -minute 
postdo se time point, the subject’s hand must be reinserted into the heated box for at least 
10 minutes prior to the next blood collection . ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 To evaluate drug PK  (plasma insulin/pramlintide concentrations ), blood samples are to be drawn 
at 10 ± 2 minutes before and  immediately  (-2 to 0 minutes)  prior to study drug injection .  After 
study drug injection , blood samples also will be collected at  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 
180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes post -dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) . 
Within 2 minutes after the 30  minutes post -dose blood draw, a standardized 75 -gram oral 
glucose challenge should be ingested (within 5 to 10  minutes) by the subject.  
After the last blood collection (at 360 minutes post -study drug administration), subjects are to b e 
provided a regular meal and insulin (per investigators’ discretion).  
At 30, 90, and 360 minutes  (± 2 minutes ) post-dose, injection sites will be evaluated by the 
investigator using the modified Draize scale ( Appendix  1).  Additionally, subjects will complete 
an injection site discomfort questionnaire at 10 and 30 minutes (± 2 minutes ) post-dose 
(Appendix  2).   
A subject may be discharged from the clinic , per investigator’s criteria, when  the following has 
occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen , including insulin  
 Subject’s capillary glucose concentration is confirmed to be >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any time  during the visit i f hypoglycemia  occurs  (ie, blood glucose < 70 mg/dL), the subject 
will be rescued with IV dextrose  using the  following formula to calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50%  mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  
Where D50% = the dose of IV dextrose, mL = the volume of dextrose, BG = the subject’s 
hypoglycemic blood glucose value  (ADA, 2008; Joslin Center, 2013 ) 
The dose of dextros e should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then blood glucose will be remeasured by blood glucose meter at 10, 
20, and 30  minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose.  
Successful plasma glucose recovery sho uld be confirmed (i e, glucose returns to ≥  70 mg/dL) and 
the subject medically stabilized .  When the subject is medically stable, they can be discharged 
from the clinic (per criteria above).   
After a first wash out period of 7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment 
Period  2 (Visit 3) and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated with each subject crossed 
over to the next randomized study drug treatment  sequence .  Upon check -in and completion  of 
morning acti vities, the subject will receive their second administration of study drug(s).   
After a second wash out period of 7 to 11 days, subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment 
Period 3 (Visit 4) and the treatment visit procedures will be repeated with each  subject crossed 
over to the last randomized study drug treatment  sequence .  Upon check -in and completion  of 
morning activities, the subject will receive their third administration of study drug(s).  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 7.4. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety, behav ioral, or 
administrative reasons.   
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the scheduled visit, and to 
reschedule the missed vis it.  This includes contacting subjects via email and telephone, including 
family members or emergency contacts .  If such efforts fail, a certified letter should be sent to 
the subject’s last known address requesting they contact study staff.  
In all circums tances, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, per the follow -
up.  Information regarding the reason for not completing the study will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  The investigator should inquire about the reason  for 
withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, and follow -up with the subject 
regarding any unresolved AEs.  It will be documented whether each subject completed the study.   
If a decision by the investigator or sponsor is made to with draw a subject, a final visit should be 
scheduled soon after the decision to withdraw is made.  The subject will be asked to return to site 
for the assessments listed in Section  10.3 (Follow -Up Visit).  
If the subject withdraws from the study and withdraws consent, no further evaluations should be 
performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to 
use any data co llected before such withdrawal of consent.   
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB  or Xeris.   
Circumstances that may warrant premature st udy termination include, but are not limited, to the 
following:  
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects  
 Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate  
 Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol  
 Insufficie nt provision of complete and evaluable data  
 Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug  
If the study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Xeris will promptly notify the 
investigators and document the reason for study termination.  Specific procedures for termination 
will be arranged by the sponsor in coordination with the investigators.  After notification, the 
investigators must contact all participating subjects within 7 days.  All study materials must be 
collected a nd all eCRFs completed to the greatest extent possible, and all study materials must be 
returned to Xeris or its designee within 28 days  of receiving notice of study termination from the 
sponsor .

 8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
8.1. Concomitant Medications  
All subjects will be questioned about concomitant medications at each visit.  Medications taken 
within 28 days before Day 1 , including insulin,  will be documented in the eCRF.  Any changes 
to a subject’s concomitant medication regimen after the first treat ment on Day 1 will also be 
documented in the eCRF.  
Ideally, subjects should be on a stable regimen of all concomitant medications except insulin for 
at least 28 days prior to Screening, and they will be encouraged to avoid making changes 
(excepting insulin ) to their concomitant medication regimen during participation in the study.   In 
addition, investigators are encouraged to avoid adding to or changing a participant’s medications 
during study participation unless deemed medically necessary.  
Diabetes Medica tion  
Subject diabetes medication will be recorded on the day of screening:  
 Total daily meal -time insulin  
o Type of insulin (regular insulin, lispro, or aspart)  
 Basal insulin  
o Type of insulin (glargine, detemir, or degludac)  
 Total daily dose of insulin  
 Gluca gon-like peptide -1 (GLP -1) analogue   
8.2. Randomization  
On the morning of Visit 2, subjects will be randomized into the appropriate treatment sequence 
order to receive each of the 3 study treatments ( PRAM9, regular insulin, and co-administered 
regular insulin plus pramlintide ).  The study statistician will create the randomization sequence 
using random permuted block methodology.    See Table 4 for study drug administration 
randomization sequence.  
8.3. Treatment Compliance  
Not applicable as study drug will be administered in an inpatient setting.  
8.4. Subject Replacements   
Subjects who are rando mized but do not receive the first study drug will be replaced .  Up to 
3 subjects may be replaced.  
8.5. Occurrence of Hypoglycemia  
If hypoglycemia occurs (ie, blood glucose <70 mg/dL), the subject will be rescued with IV 
dextrose  using the following formula to calculate the dose of dextrose:  
D50% mL = (100 minus BG ) × 0.4  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 34 of 78 
 Where D50 % = the dose of IV dextrose , mL = the volume of dextrose , BG = the subject’s 
hypoglycemic blood glucose value  (ADA, 2008; Jos lin Center, 2013 ) 
The dose of dextrose should be administered slowly, over 2 to 5 minutes.  
If D50% is administered, then b lood glucose will be remeasured by blood glucose meter at 10, 
20, and 30  minutes following the end of administration of IV dextrose . 
Successful plasma glucose recovery should be confi rmed (ie, glucose returns to ≥  70 mg/dL) and 
the subject medically stabilized .  When the subject is medically stable, they can be discharged 
from the clinic .  A subject may be discharged from the clinic , per investigator’s criteria, when  
the following has occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal  
 Subject has returned to their usual medication regimen , including insulin  
 Subject’s capillary glucose concentration is confirmed to be >  100 mg/dL  
 Subject is considered medically stable  
Any occurrence of hypoglyc emia must be recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) eCRF.   ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 9. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
9.1. Study Drug s and Doses  
PRAM9 , insulin, and pramlintide  will be supplied by the sponsor.  
9.1.1.  PRAM9  
PRAM9 is a stable, liquid, and ready -to-use co -formulation of pramlintide and regular insulin for 
SC injection.  
The pramlintide and insulin injection drug product is prepared as a sterile liquid for injection that 
is packaged as a 0.9 mg/mL pramlintide + 3 .5 mg/mL insulin solution for injection in a 3 -mL 
glass vial (2.5 mL fill volume).  
The dose of PRAM9 is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose (based 
upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  The historical insul in dose will be 
reduced by 50%  to derive the new insulin dose .  The associated pramlintide dose will be related 
to the dosage of insulin (eg, 9 µg pramlintide per 1  U of insulin).   
PRAM9 is to be administered SC (in the abdomen, peri -umbilicus).  
9.1.2.  Regular Insulin: Humulin® R (U -100) (regular insulin human injection)   
The dose of r egular insulin  is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose  
(based upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  Insulin is to be administered SC 
(in the abdomen , peri -umbilicus ). 
Note:  The calculated insulin dose should be rounded to the closest whole unit.  For rounding, if 
the digit to the right of the decimal is ≤ 4, round down (example 4.3 units = 4 units).  If the digit 
to the right of the  decimal is ≥ 5, round up (example 4.5 units = 5 units).  
9.1.3.  Regular Insulin Plus P ramlintide   
Regular insulin plus pramlintide is to be co -administered as separate injections.  
The n ew insulin dose is to be based upon the subject’s historical mealtime insulin dose (based 
upon the subject’s historical carbohydrate: insulin ratio) .  This historical dose will be reduced by 
50% to be the new insulin dose .  The associated pramlintide dose will be calculated from the new 
dosage of insulin (eg, 9 µg pramlintide per 1 U of insulin) .  The dosage of pramlintide will then 
be adjusted to the nearest increment on the Symlin ® pen (eg , nearest 15 µg increment) . 
Regular insulin plus pramlintide is to be administered SC (in the abdomen, peri -umbilicus).  The 
separate, co -adminis tered regular insulin and pramlintide injections should be given to opposite 
sides of the abdomen (ie, left and right peri -umbilicus , opposite quadrants ). 
 
9.1.4.  Study Drug  Doses 
All subjects will get flexible  doses of insulin, pramlintide , and PRAM9.   The dose of regular 
insulin is calculated to correspond to a ratio of 9 g of pramlintide for every 1 unit of insulin.  
Additionally, t he dose of regular insulin is calculated from the subject’s insulin -to-carbohydrate ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

c:  Each unit of PRAM9 contains 1 unit of insulin and 9 µg of pramlintide.  
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling  
PRAM9 will be labeled according to 21 CFR 312.6 investigational drug labeling regulatory 
requirements.  Study drug labels will include the protocol  number, lot number, description of the 
study drug , dosing and storage instructions, name of Sponsor and manu facturer, and a statement 
that it is for clinical trial use only.  
9.3. Administration  of Study Drugs  
Prior to administration, the intended injection sites should be cleansed with an alcohol swab and 
examined to ensure they have a normal appearance and are free from signs of inflammation or 
injury.  At Visits 3 and 4, i njection sites should be rotated to avoid injecting at a previously used 
site.   
Study drug(s) will be administered SC to the abdomen (around the umbilicus).  When applicable , 
the regular insulin a nd pramlintide injections should be given to opposite sides of the abdomen 
(ie, left and right peri -umbilicus , opposite quadrants ).  
Study drug(s) should be injected over 1 to 3 seconds .  Following injection, light pressure should 
be applied to the injection site, as the needle is withdrawn.  
9.4. Study Drug Storage  and Accountability  
PRAM9  must be stored in a freezer (-20°C) and thawed only once on the day of use (avoid 
repeated freeze -thaw cycles) .  On the morning of a dosing visit, the vial of PRAM9 sho uld be 
placed at room temperature for 1  hour to thaw.   Prior to use, the vial should be inverted 25  times 
to mix .  If thawed and not used,  then PRAM9  must be stored at a controlled temperature of 20°C 
to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) and discarded if not used within  30 days.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 The investigator or an approved study staff will ensure that the study drug is stored in a secure 
area under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The site will maintain appropriate documentatio n of continuous storage conditions and these 
records will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the monitor.  Any deviations in the storage 
conditions must be documented (including minimum and maximum temperature excursion as 
well as estimate of total durati on of storage outside the recommended storage conditions).  Such 
deviations must be communicated to the sponsor  as soon as identified by the site with 
appropriate course of action taken regarding the future use of the study drugs upon consultation 
with Xer is Pharmaceuticals.  
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other 
disposition of the investigational drug products and supplies.   
9.5. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
Unused PRAM9  will be returned to Xeris  at the  end of the study . 
Unused regular insulin and pramlintide will be destroyed per site standard operating procedures 
(SOP) .

 10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A schedule of procedures for this study is provided in  the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 2). 
10.1. Visit 1 – Screening  
Prior to completing any Screening  activities, the investigator or study team member will obtain 
informed consent from each su bject in accordance with the procedures described in  Section 16.3.   
Subjects will complete a Screening Visit at least 1 day (to allow for receipt of blood test results), 
and no more than 28 days prior to the anticipated date of the first treatment visit (Treatment 
Period 1, Study Day 1).  The following evaluations will be completed during the Screening Visit : 
 Collection of  medical history and demographic data  
 Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by a study investigator  
 Urine drug screen . Note: At the investigator’s discretion, subjects with a positive 
result for drugs other than THC (which is allowed at the investigat or’s discretion) will 
be allowed to participate if the subject reports use of a concomitant medication that 
explains the result ( eg, positive urine test for opiates in a subject reporting use of 
cough syrup containing dextromethorphan).  
 Full PE (excluding  breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourinary exams ); to include 
measurement of height and weight (no shoes, lightly clothed)  
 12-lead ECG (after the subject has completed a 5 -minute supine or seated rest; ECG 
to be obtained before assessment of BP and HR, and  prior to blood collections)  
 Assessment of vital signs, including temperature, respiration rate, HR, and BP , after a 
5-minute seated rest  
 Collection of venous blood for hematology, serum chemistry, and measurement of 
C-peptide and HbA1c (see Section 11.3.4  for complete listing of laboratory 
parameters)  
 Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and discussion about study 
requirements regarding contraception  
 Assessment of baseline concomitant medications , including diabetes medication:  
o Total daily meal -time insulin  
 Type of insulin (regular insulin, lispro, or aspart)  
o Basal insulin  
 Type of insulin (glargine, detemir, or degludac)  
o Total d aily dose of insulin  
o GLP analogue  
Once laboratory results are obtained and a final determination of eligibility is made, subjects 
should  be contacted to schedule the first treatment visit.  While immediate re -testing of 
laboratory results is not allowed, subjects failing to meet laboratory -based eligibility criteria may ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 39 of 78 
 be re -screened after a 30 -day wait.  A single re -screening is permitted , and this re -screening is 
only permissible if the reason for the prior screen failure was for laboratory measurements  or 
vital signs .  Blood for clinical laboratory tests can be redrawn after a 30 -day wait; however, other 
Screening  procedures do NOT need to be repeated.  Vital signs can be remeasured after a 24 -
hour wait and other screening procedures do not need to be r epeated if within the 28 -day 
window. If the new clinical laboratory test results  or vital signs  meet eligibility, the subject may 
be dosed .  Otherwise, the subject is not eligible for dosing or further re -screening.  
10.2. Visit s 2, 3, and 4   
10.2.1.  Clinic Arrival (Evening Before  Dosing ) 
Subjects will be instructed to eat normal meals during the day but to refrain from alcohol  (for 
24 hours prior to the visit ), and to follow their usual insulin regimen prior to their evening clinic 
arrival.  Subjects will be instruc ted to arrive at the clinic on the day prior to the visit .  
At the clinic, subjects will be given a standardized dinner meal  (per investigator’s discretion)  and 
instructed to take their prescribed evening mealtime insulin regimen and basal insulin dose .  The 
subjects will fast after midnight but will be allowed to drink water ad libitum (ie, tap water, 
bottled water, distilled water, etc. [water without carbohydrates]) and take any prescribed non -
diabetic medications .  Blood glucose concentrations  will be k ept in the range of 80  to 150 mg/dL 
per investigator discretion, via IV glucose and/or IV insulin infusion.  
10.2.2.  Day of Study Drug Administration  
The following procedures will be carried out on the day of dosing . 
 Symptom -directed PE  
 Assessment of vital signs.   Note:  HR and BP measurements are to be repeated 
30 ± 5 minutes , 180 ± 5 , and 360 ± 5 minutes after study drug administration  
 Women of childbearing potential will undergo  a urine pregnancy test, which must be 
negative before further participation is allowed  
 Prior to dosing, a capillary blood glucose measurement (BGM)  will be tested to 
confirm that blood glucose is in the range of 80 to 1 50 mg/dL   
o If the blood glucose is >  150 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator may 
treat with a bolus dose of  IV regular insulin, per discretion, to bring the subject 
into the required blood glucose range .  Before initiating study treatment, at least 
40 minutes should have passed from the last dose of administered insulin and the 
subject’s glucose level should  be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  
o If the blood glucose is < 80 mg/dL after repeat test, then the investigator may treat 
with oral glucose tabs/solution or IV glucose, per discretion, to bring the subject 
into the required blood glucose range .  Befor e initiating study treatment, at least 
30 minutes should have passed from the last dose of administered glucose and the 
subject’s  glucose level should be within the range of 80 to 150 mg/dL.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

modified Draize scale ( Appendix  1)  
 Subject injection site discomfort questionnaire at 10 and 30 minutes (± 2 minutes ) 
post-dose (Appendix  2). Question Q1c is to be answered at 360 mins post -study drug 
injection.   
 Within 2 minutes of the 30-minute  post-dose blood draw, a  standardized 75 -gram oral 
glucose challenge (eg, 75 grams of glucose syrup and  water) should be given to the 
subject and consumed within 5 to 10  minutes  
 After the last blood collection  (at 360 minutes post -study drug administration) , 
subjects are to be provided a regular  meal and insulin (per investigators’ discretion)  
 AE assessment  
 Concomitant medications assessment  
A subject may be discharged from the clinic , per the investigator’s criteria,  after the following 
has occurred:  
 Subject has consumed their meal

 11. ASSESSMENT S 
11.1. Pharmacodynamics  
At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Treatment Periods ), samples will be drawn to measure plasma glucose 
levels .  Venous blood samples will be drawn 10 ± 2 minutes before  and immedia tely prior to 
dosing  (-2 to 0 minutes) , and then at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 
360 minutes  post-dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) .   
Over the course of the study, approximately 15 blood samples (approximately 3 mL each) will be 
collected for each subject, for an approximate total volume of 45 mL per subject.  
Plasma glucose levels will be used to calculate the following PD parameters: Cmax, Tmax, area 
over the curves (AOCs) , and AUC s. 
Detailed instructions for sa mple collection and preparation will be provided in a separate 
laboratory manual.  
11.2. Pharmacokinetics  
At Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Treatment Periods ), samples will be collected for determination of plasma 
insulin  and pramlintide concentrations.  Venous blood sample s will be drawn 10 ± 2 minutes  
before  and immediately prior to dosing  (-2 to 0 minutes) , and then at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 
120, 150, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes post-dosing (window allowance of ±  2 minutes) .   
Over the course of the study, approximately 15 blood samples (approximately 4 mL each) will be 
collected for each subject, for an approximate total volume of 60 mL per subject.  
Insulin and pramlintide concentrations will be used to calculate the following PK parameters: 
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC 0-90, AUC 0-180, AUC 0-360. 
Detailed instructions for sample collection  and preparation will be provided in a separate 
laboratory manual.  
11.3. Safety Parameters  
11.3.1.  Vital Sign  Measurement s 
Vital signs, including measurements of tempe rature  (ºC), respiration  (breathes per minute) , HR 
(beats per minute) , and BP  (mmHg) will be measured  (after 5  minutes seated rest)  at the times 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments .  Additional or changes to collection times, or 
collection using automated devices is permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate subject’s 
safety.  
Vital signs will be measured according to standard of practice of the site and recorded in the 
eCRF.  
11.3.2.  Physical Examination

subject reporting use of cough syrup containing dextromethorphan).  
11.3.4.2.  Pregnancy Screen  
Female participants of childbearing potential require a negative urine  pregnancy test at Screening  
and Visits 2 through  5. 
11.3.5.  Local Tolerability  
Local tolerability will be assessed at Visits 2, 3, and 4 as follows:  
 The investigator will use the modified Draize scale  (Appendix  1) to assess erythema 
and edema formation at the injection site at 30, 90, and 360 minutes (± 2  minutes ) 
after injection of study drug(s).  If any scores remain > 1 at the 360-minute 
evaluation, the sub ject may leave the clinic but will be instructed to contact a study 
staff member if the condition fails to resolve.  Every effort should be made to ensure 
that the same investigator will assess the injection sites on the subject at each visit.  
 Subjects wil l complete a 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS ) questionnaire 
regarding injection site discomfort 10 and 30 minutes (± 2 minutes ) after injection of 
study drug  (Appendix  2). Question Q1c is to be answered at 360 mins post -study drug

 12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT (AE) REPORTING  
12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associ ated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered related to 
the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include:  
 Abnormal test findings  
 Clinically significant symptoms and signs  
 Changes in PE findings which are untoward and deemed clinically signif icant by the 
investigator  
 Allergy/hypersensitivity  
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding may be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms  
 Test result requires additional diagnos tic testing or medical/surgical intervention  
 Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other treatment  
 Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or s ponsor  
Repeat of a test based on an abnormal result in the absence of the above conditions does not 
constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result determined to be an error does not require reporting 
as an AE.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that eith er commenced following initiation of study 
treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following 
initiation of study treatment.  
Standard medical terminology should be used in describing AEs.  Informal descriptio ns should 
be avoided.  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid comm unication by the investigator to the sponsor could be appropriate. Such an event 
might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it (ICH E2F, 2008).  
AESIs for PRAM9 are as follows: hypoglycemia, nausea, and vomiting.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 46 of 78 
 12.2. Reporting Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the study treatment will be reported with 2 exceptions.  Injection site reactions will not be 
considered an AE unless a skin reaction or pain r equires medical intervention.   
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and attempt to obtain information adequate to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the FDA criteria for 
classification as an SAE, requiring immediate notifi cation to Xeris Pharmaceuticals.   
For all AEs, follow -up by the investigator is required until the event resolves or stabilizes at a 
level acceptable to the investigator to consider it resolved .  For unresolved AEs to be considered 
stable, the Xeris Medic al Monitor must concur with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the sponsor, any nonserious AE that is 
determined to be serious (according to the FDA definitions of an SAE) will be reported by the 
sponsor as an SAE.  To assist i n the determination of case seriousness, further information may 
be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the 
context of the clinical study.  
12.3. Reporting Period  
For all AEs, the reporting period to Xeris Pharmace uticals begins from the subject providing 
informed consent, through the Follow -Up Visit .  All AEs will be followed until resolution or the 
subject is medically stable.  
12.4. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose which:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event (IME)  
Medica l and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such an IME that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or ma y require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above .  These events should also 
usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions which do not 
result in hospitalization.  ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 47 of 78 
 12.5. Severity Assessment  
On the AE eCRF, the investigator will use the adjectives “mild,” “moderate,” or “severe” to 
describe the maximum intensity of the AE.  These intensity grades are  defined as follows in  
Table 7, which follows.  
Table 7: Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject’s usual function  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent (<  50%) with subject’s usual function  
Severe  Interferes significantly (≥  50%) with subject’s usual function  
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  The event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
subject/event outcome or action criteria.  Accordingly, a severe event is not necessarily a serious 
event.  
12.6. Causality Assessment  
The inve stigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an AE to the study 
drug, where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction: “Is there 
a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event?” A ‘‘reasonab le possibility’’ means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  The 
investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (related or unrelated).  The 
investigator must record the causal relationsh ip in the eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an 
assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable ( Section  12.9).  All 
investigator assessments of AEs must be documented in the source documentation.  
12.7. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response and 
recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  When a subject  withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements (see Section  12.9). 
12.8. Eliciting Adverse Event Information and Reporting  
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the 
study subject.  Each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  Each AE is to be assessed to 
determine if it meets the criteria fo r SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow the 
provisions of Section 12.9. 
12.9. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE o ccurs, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is to be notified within 24 hours of awareness of the 
event by the investigator.  If the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Xeris ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0
PRAM9 (p ramlintide -insulin injection ) 
Type 1 Diabetes  Protocol DPI -201 
Version 4.0 
 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc  Confidential  Page 48 of 78 
 Pharmaceuticals must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information.  This time frame also applies to follow -up on previously forwarded SAE reports.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (eg, a study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere),  the investigator is to report 
the event within 24 hours after learning of the event and document the time of first awareness of 
the AE.   
A death occurring during the study, during the study follow -up period, or within 14 days after 
stopping treatment wit h test drug must be reported to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee(s) 
immediately, whether  it is considered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports must be followed by 
detailed descriptions.  These should include copies of hospital case records and othe r documents 
when requested.  Telephone and email reports must be confirmed promptly either by facsimile or 
by overnight courier or mail.  
Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee(s) is required to notify FDA and 
all participating invest igators in an IND safety report (ie, 7 - or 15 -day expedited report) of 
potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no later 
than 15 calendar days after the safety information is received and a determination i s made that 
the information qualifies for reporting.  
12.10.  Nonserious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the eCRF.  AEs should be reported using concise 
medical terminology on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of the SAE information.  
12.11.  AE Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting by the sponsor, including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable regulations.  
The investigator mu st notify the IRB/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the occurrence of 
any SAE, in writing, as soon as is practicable and in accordance with local regulations.  A copy 
of this notification must be provided to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited reporting, an SAE report will be 
prepared for submission to the FDA and any other applicable authorities by Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
12.12.  Pregnancy   
The active pharmaceutical product s in Xeri s Pharmaceuticals’ PRAM9 pramlintide -insulin  are in 
Pregnancy Category B.  Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested (urine) for 
pregnancy at the Screening  Visit.  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is

 12.13.  Subject Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs throughout the study by the study unit staff.  The principal 
investigator or designated sub -investigator will be on site for drug administration and until 
6 hours after administration of study drug to the last subject.  The principal investigator or 
designated sub -investigator will also be available ( eg, “on call ”) for the remainder of the 
treatment visit.  If necessary, a physician,  either at the study site or in a nearby hospital, will 
administer treatment for any AEs.  
Safety parameters, including laboratory results, will be assessed by the principal investigator or 
his delegate using the site’s criteria for clinical laboratory  acceptance ranges as suggested 
guidelines in making the medical assessment.  
Scheduled safety measurements will be repeated according to appropriate SOPs  or upon request 
from a physician.  Any abnormal repeated measurement will be evaluated by a physician and 
repeated if judged necessary.  Further action may be taken on the physician’s request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professionals (eg, physician, dentist, and/or 
pharmacist) that they are participating in a clinical research study of  a drug called PRAM9 
before taking any medicines or undergoing any medical procedure.

 13. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. General Approach  
Detailed methodology for PK, PD, descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the data 
collected in this st udy will be documented in the S AP.   
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the clinical and laboratory data .  Continuous data 
will be represented by number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), and range, 
while categorical variable s will be presented by number and percentage of subjects .  Baseline 
values are determined by the last evaluable measurement before study drug injection in each 
treatment period .  Point estimates may be derived with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals .  An 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to evaluate effect of study treatment and 
period.  There is no reason to think that sequence will have an effect on the outcome.  
13.1.1.  Sample Size Calculation  
Up to 2 1 subjects will be qualified for the study and will complete the overnight stay as part of 
Visit 2 to ensure that 18 total subjects are randomized to a study treatment  sequence .  The target 
of 18 randomized  subjects is considered sufficient to allow an initial evaluation of PK/PD 
response and safety of these novel pramlintide -insulin formulations .  Formal sample sizes were 
not conducted.   
13.2. Primary Endpoint Analysis  
All PK/PD analyses will be performed using the PK/PD analysis population.  
The following variable will be compared among the treatments for PD purposes:  
 AUC 0-180 (mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL  
13.3. Secondary  Endpoint Analysis  
13.3.1.  Safety  Endpoints  
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population .  
The following variables will be compared between the treatments for safety purposes:  
 Incidence of AEs and SAEs  
 Change from baseline in l aboratory safety variables  
 Change from baseline in vital sign measurements  
 Change from baseline in b ody weight  
 Local tolerability  assessments , including:  
o Incidence of e rythema and or edema formation at site of injection assessed 
using the Draize scale (Appendix  1). 
o Subjective injection site discomfort as reported by subjects using a 11-point 
NRS   (Appendix  2). ***APPROVED COPY*** PRO-19-00045 Version 4.0

 13.3.2.  Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic  Endpoints  
All PK/PD analyses will be performed using the PK/PD analysis  population .  
The following variables will be compared between the treatments for PD and PK purposes:  
 Mean proportional time with plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL for 0 -180 minutes  
 Mean proportional time after glucose challenge for plasma glucose levels between 
126 to 180  mg/dL  
 Mean proportional time* for plasma glucose <  70 mg/dL  
 Mean proportional time* for p lasma glucose < 54 mg/dL  
 Mean proportional time* for plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL  
 Mean proportional time* for plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL  
 AUC 0-360 (mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose > 180 mg/dL  
 AUC 0-360 (mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose > 250 mg/dL  
 AOC 0-360 (mg/dL × minutes) for plasma glucose < 70  mg/dL

 17. PROCEDURES FOR MODIF YING THE PROTOCOL OR  
TERM INATING THE STUDY  
17.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The principal investigator must sign this protocol and its amendments (if any) before initiating 
the study at a particular site.  The investigator will make all reasonable efforts to comply with the 
written protocol.  Protocol modifications to ongoing studies that affect the safety of subjects or 
that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental 
design, dosing, study assessments, the number of subjects exp osed to test drug, or subject 
selection criteria must be made only after consultation between Xeris and the investigator.  All 
protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC before the revised 
protocol can be implemented.  Emergency re visions that eliminate an apparent hazard to subjects 
do not require preapproval by the IRB/IEC.  However, the IRB/IEC must be notified in writing 
as soon as possible after the modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be 
forwarded to Xeris.  All departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source 
documents and the eCRFs of the subjects involved .  Protocol deviations will be tracked in an 
electronic system implemented by the sponsor or designated representative.  
17.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the IRB/Ethics Committee, safety problems resulting in subject deaths, or at 
the discretion of Xeris Pharmaceuticals or the pr incipal Investigator.  
Circumstances that may warrant premature study termination include, but are not limited, to the 
following:  
 Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects,  
 Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate,  
 Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol,  
 Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data, or  
 Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Xeris Pharm aceuticals will promptly 
notify the Investigators and document the reason for study termination. Specific procedures for 
termination will be arranged by the Sponsor in coordination with the Investigators.  After 
notification, the Investigators must contact  all participating subjects within 7 days.  All study 
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible, and all study 
materials must be returned to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee within an additional 28 days.

 Appendix  2. INJECTION SITE DISCOMFORT ASSESSMENT  
Numeric Rating  Scale (NRS ) for Injection Site Discomfort  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the 11-point NRS  for Injection Site 
Discomfort at 10 and 30 minutes (± 2  minutes) after injection of study drug. The subject will complete 
the NRS by drawing a circle around the number  corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of 
discomfort according to the instructions below. The goal is for the subject to report the amount of 
discomfort, if any, remaining at each time point, as opposed to  reporting the transient pain associated with 
needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will indicate the number 
on the NRS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will circle i t. Documentation will be 
provided on each completed questionnaire as to who completed the form.  
Subject Instructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the needle, please draw a circle around the 
number on  the scale below that corresponds to the intensit y (severity) of any discomfort you are feeling 
right now  at the study drug injection site.  
For example,  if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the number “0” on the left end 
of scale. If you are currently feeling the worst discomfor t possible, you should circle number “10”  on the 
right end of the scale.

 APPENDIX  3. INSULIN TO CARBOHYDRATE RATIO  
Insulin -to-Carb Ratio  
This ratio tells you how many grams of carb are covered by one unit of bolus insulin.  
Use your insulin -to-carb ratio every time you eat a meal. You may use it with snacks if advised 
by your provider.  
The starting insulin to carb ratio is calculated by using the 450 Rule . Here’s how it works:  
 Determine your total daily dose (TDD) of insulin.  
o This includes both your meal time  and basal insulin  used within a day .  
o TDD  = _______   
 Divide 450 by the TDD to get your ratio.  
o Insulin Carbohydrate Ratio = 450/TDD = _______  
 To use the ratio, add up the  grams of carb that you plan to eat at your meal , and 
divide this number by your ratio to obtain your regular insulin dose .  
 
Example 1:  
Someone’s TDD = 45 units ( e.g., the total amount of say Humalog and Lente insulins they used 
per day).  450 divided by 45 = 10 . Therefore, 10  grams of carbohydrate are covered by each unit 
of regular insulin .  
 
The insulin to carbohydrate has a ratio of 1:10, meaning that 1 unit of regular  insulin “covers” 10 
grams of carbohydrate.  
 
If you will be eating 70 grams of carbohydrate, then divide 70 by 10, which equals 7. This means 
that you would take 7 units of insulin to cover the 70 grams of carb.  
 
Example 2:  
Someone’s  TDD = 50 units  (e.g., the total amount of say Humalog and Lente ins ulins they used 
per day).  450 divided by 50 equals 9. Therefore, 9 grams of carbohydrate are covered by each 
unit of regular insulin.  
 
The insulin to carbohydrate the starting insulin to carb ratio is 1:9,  meaning that 1 unit of regular 
insulin “covers” 9 grams of carbohydrate.  
 
If you will be eating 7 2 grams of carbohydrate, then divide 7 2 by 9, which equals 8. This means 
that you would take 8 units of insulin to cover the 7 2 grams of carb.  
 
Based upon your ratio, the accompanying table s may be helpful to estimate the regular insulin 
mealtime dose:

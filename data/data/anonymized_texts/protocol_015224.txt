 10 Statistic s The achievement of pregnancy after diagnosis of breast cancer will be 
the criteria used to distinguish between two cohorts of patients: women 
with no subsequent pregnancies afte r breast cancer diagnosis (“non -
pregnant cohort”), and women with one or more pregnancies any time 
after breast cancer diagnosis (“pregnant coho rt”). To evaluate the 
prognostic impact of pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis in 
BRCA  mutated survivors, three s urvival endpoints will be considered 
in the two cohorts: disease -free survival (DFS , as primary endpoint ) 
breast cancer specific survival (BCSS , as secondary endpoint ) and 
overall survival (OS , as secondary endpoint ). To reduce the impact of 
selection bia s (i.e. guaranteed time bias), two analy ses will be 
performed. In the extended Cox model analysis with occurrence of 
pregnancy as a time -varying covariate, all eligible patients included in 
the study will be considered . In the  “case-control” analysis , each patient 
in the pregnan t cohort (case)  will be matched with 3 patients from the 
non-pregnant cohort (controls) . Each nonpregnant control  should have  
a disease -free interval equal to or longer than the time  elapsing  between 
breast cancer d iagnosis and date of  pregnancy of the matched pregnant 
case. Patients who  became pregnant after the date of the DFS event will 
be dropped from th is analysis. The other matching factors will be  year 
at diagnosis ( ± 2.5 years), nodal status (negative v s. positive), hormone 
receptor status (positive v s. negative), and  type of BRCA mutation 
(BRCA1 v s. BRCA2).  Because all  included patients are aged ≤ 40 years 
at the time of diagnosis,  matching according to age will not be 
performed. The  matching will be  done centrally at the coordinating 
center . The prognostic impa ct (in terms of DFS, BCSS and OS) of 
pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis will be then evaluated in 
various subgroups of  BRCA  mutated survivors . Pregnancy rate will be 
computed according to the Kaplan -Meier method.

 11 1. BACKGROUND  AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
 
Breast cancer is the most common tumor type diagnosed in women of reproductive age  [1]. The 
inheritance of a mutation in one of the breast cancer susceptibility genes (i.e. BRCA1  or BRCA2 ) 
generates the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome [2]. For healthy women with BRCA1  
mutated gene (i.e. BRCA1  carriers), the average lifetime risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer 
is approximately 67% and 45%, respectively; for BRCA2  carriers, these average cumulative risks are 
66% and 12%, respectively [3]. 
 
Since y oung women with breast cancer , including those with BRCA  mutation,  are more likely to 
develop biologically aggressive tumors [4], the majority of them  are candidates to receive 
antineoplastic treatments that include chemotherapy. The use of cytotoxic therapy  in premenopausal 
patients may result in the occurrence of treatment -related premature ovarian failure (POF) [5]. BRCA  
mutations seem to negatively affect ovarian reserve with consequent accelerated ovarian aging [6]. 
Although very limited data are a vailable on this topic,  it has been suggested that BRCA  carriers may 
be more sensitive to the gonadotoxic effect of chemotherapy as compared to patients without 
mutations with subsequent higher risk of developing this side effect [6]. The impairment in  ovarian 
function negatively impacts on global health of young breast cancer survivors being associated with 
several side effects including  infertility  [7].  
 
Concerns about  fertility preservation and future chance of achieving a pregnancy  are prevalent issue s 
affecting young breast cancer patients  [8]. Hence, accordingly, major international guidelines 
recommend physicians to address with patients as part of informed consent before anticancer 
therapies the possibility of developing PO F and infertility , and then to  discuss fertility preservation 
options  in interested patients [9–11]. Specific issue s on this regard should be considered in patients 
with BRCA  mutation  in the context of their unique concerns [12]. For carriers, given the increasing 
risk of ovarian cancer with age, bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy  is generally recommended for both 
BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers between the ages of 35 and 40  years  and upon completion of childbearing  
[13]. Moreover, some carriers wish to eliminate the mutation from future offspring through pre -
implantation genetic diagnosis  [14]. Finally, given the increasing risk  of ovarian and breast cancer 
and the risk of developing long -term treatment -related POF [15], the window for fertility and 
pregnancy may be narrow in such young women . Of note, although, the last years have brought many 
safety and efficacy data on the available options  for fertility preservation increasing the chances of

 12 future offspring in cancer survivors , numerous challenges remain for young breast cancer patients 
considering fertility preservation  and to have a pregnan cy after the end of treatment s, especially for 
those with BRCA  mutations. Thus, further research is needed in the field; particularly, reproduction 
studies to address the specific issues of women with BRCA  mutations are lacking and should be 
considered a research priority.  
 
Approximately 40% to 50% of w omen in whom breast cancer is diagnosed during childbearing age 
wish to have a subsequent pregnancy  [16]. However, the percentage of breast cancer patients reported 
in the literature that has at least one full -term pregnancy after breast cancer diagnosis is very low . Of 
note, a mong can cer survivors, b reast cancer patients have the lowest pregnancy rate with an overall 
67% reduction in the chance of giving birth after cancer treatment as compared to the general 
population [17]. This observation reflects not only the damage to ovarian reserve due to the 
gonadotoxic treatments required, but also patient and provider concerns related to a possible negative 
impact of pregnancy on  the evolution of breast cancer  [18].  
 
Recent data support the statement that pregnancy in cancer survivors after adequate treatment and 
follow -up should not be discouraged including among patients  with breast cancer [19]. As shown in 
a meta -analysis of 14 retrospective co ntrol -matched studies, breast cancer patients who became 
pregnant following diagnosis and treatment had a 41% reduced risk of death compared to women 
who did not get pregnant (pooled relative risk  [PRR ], 0.59; 95% confidence intervals [ CI], 0.50-0.70) 
[20]. Furthermore, a  more recent multice nter retrospective cohort study confirmed  the safety of 
pregnancy after breast cancer even in patients with endocrine -sensitive disease [21]. Importantly, no 
impact of abortion on patient outcome was observed either [21]. Nevertheless, in the specific 
subgroup of patients with BRCA mutation s very limited data consisting in one single study are 
available on the impact of pregnancy on breast cancer survival [22]. In this study, out of the 128 
pregnant cases included, only 53 had a pregnancy following breast cancer; no difference in breast 
cancer specific mortality was observed between pregnant cases and matched non -pregnant control  
(adjusted hazard ratio [ HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.21 -2.68) [22]. However, due to the limited number of 
patients included in the analysis, no solid conclusion can be drawn from this study to  counsel  BRCA 
mutated su rvivo rs on the safety of  having a pregnancy after breast cancer diagnosis.  Furthermore, no 
information is available on the impact of breastfeeding in these  patients , and it remains not clear yet 
the ideal interval to wait between the end of anticancer trea tments and conception . Moreover, other

 13 highly relevant issues remain elusive pertai ning on subsequent pregnancy in BRCA  mutated breast 
cancer patients, including the safety of assisted reproductive technology (ART), pregnancy outcomes, 
risk of congenital malformations, breastfeeding patterns and many more.  
 
Thus , due to the lack of data on several issues on this regard , the present study aims at refining the 
understanding of th e effect of pregnancy on breast cancer outcome s in the specific population of 
BRCA  mutated patients with known history of breast cancer.

4. STATISTICS  
 
The achievement of pregnancy after diagnosis of breast cancer will be the criteria used to distinguish 
between two cohorts of patients: women with no subsequent pregnancies afte r breast cancer diagnosis 
(“non -pregnant cohort”), and women with one or more pregnancies any time after breast cancer 
diagnosis (“pregnant cohort”).  Pregnancies could have resulted in live births, therapeutic or 
spontaneous abortion s. 
 
More than 2000 non -pregnant BRCA  mutated breast cancer patients and more than 2 00 pregnant 
BRCA  mutated breast cancer patients are expected to be included in the present study (estimated 
numbers, considering an incidence of pregnancy of approximately 10%) . 
 
To evaluate the prognostic impact of pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis in BRCA  mutated 
survivors, three survival endpoints will be considered  in the two cohorts : DFS  (as primary endpoi nt) 
BCSS  (as secondary endpoint)  and OS  (as secondary endpoint) . DFS event is defined by the 
occurrence of one of the following  invasive events : local recurrence, distant metastases, contralater al 
or ipsilateral breast tumor , second primary malignancy, or death from any cause.  BCSS event is 
defined as death from breast cancer. OS event is defined as death from any  cause. For DFS, 
observation times of patients without the event will be censored on the date of their last contac t. Using 
individual patient data from all patients included in the study , survival outcomes of patients in the

 17 pregnant cohort  will be compared to those of patients in the non-pregnant cohort . To reduce the 
impact of selection bias (i.e. guaranteed time bi as), two analyses will be performed. In the extended 
Cox model analysis with occurrence of pregnancy as a time -varying covariate, all eligible patients 
included in the study will be considered.  In the  “case-control” analysis, each patient in the pregnan t 
cohort (case)  will be matched with 3 patients from the non -pregnant cohort (controls) . To adjust for 
guaranteed time bias, each patient in the non-pregnant cohort  should have a disease -free interval equal 
to or longer than the time elapsing between breast cancer diagnosis and date of pregnancy  of the 
matched patient in the pregnant cohort . Patients who  became pregnant after the date of the DFS event 
will be dropped from th is analysis. Patients will be also matched according to several variables 
including type of BRCA  mutation  (BRCA1 v s. BRCA2) , hormone receptor status  (positive v s. 
negative) , nodal status  (negative v s. positive) , and year at diagnosis  (± 2.5 years ). Because all  
included patients are aged ≤ 40 years at the time of diagnosis,  matching according to age will not be 
performed.  The matching will be done centrally at the coordinating center . Two data sets will be 
constituted: one for the cases and one for the potential controls. Cases will be sorted randomly and 
matching will be done starting for the first case until the last one. For each case, all possible controls 
will be extracted from the data set of potential  controls. If they are only 2 controls available, matching 
criteria will be relaxed one by one (starting from year of diagnosis, etc) until at least a third control 
is found. It is anticipated, given the expected low  rate of cases in the full data base, to reach matching 
for almos t each case. In these analyses, all survival endpoints will be calculated from  the date of 
pregnancy  until th e date of the event. In the non -pregnant cohort,  survival endpoints will be calculated 
from the date of diagnosis, adding the time  elapsing between diagnosis and pregnancy  of the matched 
pregnant  case.  
The prognostic impact (in terms of DFS, BCSS and OS) of pregnancy f ollowing breast cancer 
diagnosis  will be then evaluated  in various subgroups  of BRCA  mutated survivors  according to: t ype 
of BRCA  mutation ( BRCA1  vs. BRCA2 ), hormone receptor status ( positive vs. negative ), HER2 status  
(positive vs. negative ), exposure to chemotherapy  (prior exposure vs. no prior exposure ), exposure to 
endocrine therapy  (prior exposure vs. no prior exposure ), interval between diagnosis and pregnancy  
(≤ 2 years vs. > 2 years after diagnosis), outcome of pregnancy  (abortion vs. completed preg nancy), 
and breastfeeding status  (breastfeeding vs. no breastfeeding ). 
Considering a rate of pregnancy of approximately 10% , with 2000 non -pregnant and 200 pregnant 
BRCA  mutated breast cancer  patients , assuming a DFS rate of 65% at 5 years in the non -pregnant 
cohort  [21], the study will have a  power of 0.83 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 and a power of 0.62

 18 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.80 in favor of the pregnant cohort, at a two -sided significance level 0.05 
(accrual duration 2000 -2020, total study duration 2000 -2030). 
 
The rate of pregnancy following breast cancer diagnosis will be computed according to the Kaplan -
Meier method . A possible increasing or decreasing trend in rate of pregnancy following breast cancer 
over the years  will be also assessed . 
 
The statistical analysis to evaluate the pregnancy, fetal and obstetrical outcomes of the pregnancies 
following breast cancer diagnosis in BRCA  mutated survivors will be mainly descriptive and will 
include the following parameters:  
1. Gestational age at delivery ; 
2. Incidence of early pre -term ( < 34 weeks), late -preterm (34 -36 weeks) and ful l-term (≥ 
37 weeks) pregnancies;  
3. Number of pregnancies resulting in live birth and num ber of children born ; 
4. Incidence of induced and spontaneous abortion ; 
5. Incidence and nature of pregnancy complication s (if any) ; 
6. Incidence and nature of fetal complication and/or congenital malformations (if any) ; 
7. Incidence and nature of obstetrical complication s (if any) . 
 
To evaluate the safety of ART procedures following breast cancer diagnosis in BRCA  mutated 
survivors , two groups of patients within the pregnant cohort will be considered : patients who achieved 
pregnancy with the use of any ART pro cedure (i.e. “ART group”) and patients who achieved 
pregnancy without the use of any ART procedure (i.e. “no ART group”) . A subgroup analysis will 
be performed to evaluate the safety of controlled ovarian stimulation as part of ART within the ART 
group.  
 
In patients who underwent chemotherapy as part of (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy,  the impact of 
anticancer therapies (i.e. chemotherapy) on patients’ o varian function, in terms of incidence of 
treatment -induced POF and age at menopause  will be evaluated, if available . According to the World 
Health Organization definition of postmenopausal status [23], treatment -induced amenorrhea will be 
defined by the absence of menses for ≥ 12 months after the end of chemotherapy . Age at menopause 
will be defined as age in which patients had absence of menses for ≥ 12 months . For patients who

 19 developed treatment -induced amenorrhea but then had a reco very of menses more than 12 months 
after the end of chemotherapy  and with active me nstrual function within 12 months prior to the last 
follow -up visit, they will not be considered as having developed menopause. Subgroup analyses will 
be performed according to age at diagnosis, type of chemotherapy used (anthracycline - and taxane -
based regimens vs. anthracycline -based regimens vs . other regimens), and use of endocrine therapy 
(yes vs. no). These results will be co mpared to historical data in the  BRCA  wild-type breast cancer 
population.  
 
Considering the sample size and the uniqueness of the  young  cohort of BRCA  mutated patients 
expected to be included in the study, additional  analyses  will be conducted to describe b aseline, tumor 
and treatment characteristics as well as patterns of care including access to risk -reducing surgeries.  
Possible changes over time will be also assessed.  Moreover, similarly, the prognostic impact of 
baseline, tumor and treatment characteristics as well as of risk -reducing surgeries in BRCA  mutated 
patients  will be also evaluated . 
In order to conduct the evaluation of TILs in this cohort, there will be no need for new 
cutting/p reparation of tumor slides. The evaluation will be conducted on one archived diagnostic 
tumor -containing slide stained with hematoxylin and eosin  representative of the primary tumor . The 
TILs scoring will be performed  centrally. If available, a nonymized di gitally scanned images of the 
diagnostic hematoxylin and eosin -stained slide should be sent via email to Maria  Vittoria Dieci 
(mariavittoria.dieci@unipd.it ) at University of Padova -Istituto Oncologico Veneto  (Padova, Italy) . 
The University of Padova -Istituto Oncologico Veneto  will take care of costs related to TILs scoring  
and storage  support (hard disk).  The evaluation will be performed according to the TILs  working 
group recommendations [24].  
 
Patients demographic, clinical and pathologic bas eline characteristics will be compared by pregnancy 
status using chi -square  test or Fisher Exact test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank -sum test 
or t-test for continuous variables, as appropriate.  
Dichotomous outcomes will be compared using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models. 
Time -to-event outcomes will be estimated and plotted using Kaplan -Meier methods. Survival rates 
will be compared using log -rank test and Cox proportional hazards models for univariate and 
multivariate analysis, respectively.   
All tests will be two -sided and p -values of < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All

5. ETHICAL ASPECTS  
 
The study will be submitted by the investigator(s) or the Sponsor (or its legal representative) in 
accordance with local regulations to and approved by an appropriate Independent Ethical Review 
Committee / In stitutional Review Board and a Regulatory Authority if required by the national laws 
of the countries where the study will be conducted.  
 
The investigators and the Sponsor will ensure that the study is conducted in full conformance with 
the principles of t he “Declaration of Helsinki” 1964, as revised from time to time or with the laws 
and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the individual. For the study, the principal investigators will ensure compliance with the 
latest European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive or with local law especially if it affords greater 
protection to the patient.  
 
If required according to the national regulations and laws , it is the responsibility of the Investigator 
or a person designed by the Investigator (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain written informed 
consent from each potential subject prior any study data collection being carried out . However, when 
allowed by the national regulations and laws, the investigators of the present study will apply to the 
Independent Ethical Review Committee / Institutional Review Board for a waiver of the need to 
obtain informed consent. The reasons are:  
(i) it is a retrospective study that involves no interventions with human subjects. Medical records will 
be reviewed, but none of the patients will be contacted;  
(ii) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;   
(iii) the waiver will n ot adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; moreover, the research 
could not practicably be carried out without the waiver;  
(iv) the information collected does not include information that may be damaging to the individual 
should it be wron gfully disclosed; patients’ privacy will be protected throughout the study;  
(v) data will be anonymized and stored electronically in a restricted access network folder and will 
only be accessible to the research team.

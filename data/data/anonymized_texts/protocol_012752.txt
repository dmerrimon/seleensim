Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Surgical site infections (SSI)  are the second most common cause of nosocomial infections . In 
obstetric  patients, infectious morbidity ( i.e. SSI, end ometritis) occurs in 5 -10% of cesarean sections , 
which is 5 -fold higher than vaginal deliveries.  
Chlorhexidine, chemical antiseptic effective on gram positive and gram negative bacteria, reduces 
skin microflora/colonization but it is not clear if it decre ases the risk of SSI. Chlorhexidine has both 
bactericidal and bacteriostatic mechanisms causing membrane disruption and is useful against fungi 
and viruses.  
There are no randomized studies evaluating interventions to reduce SSI in patients who undergo 
cesarean sections.  
The study will be offered to women who present for a  scheduled primary or repeat  cesarean 
section at Mount Sinai Medical Center . The eligible women will be randomized  to use of a 2% 
chlorhex idine gluconate (C HG) cloth  or placebo cloth (a  fragrance free cleansing cloth)  the 
night before and the morning of their scheduled procedure . Participants will be blinded to 
the arm in which they have been assigned.  This study intends to show that the use of 2 C HG 
cloths  prior to cesarean section will reduce the rate of SSI.  
1) Objectives  
The objective of this study is to  determine  if the use of chlorhexidine gluconate  cloth s prior  to 
cesarean section reduce the rate of infectious morbidity (i.e. SSI, endometritis) . 
2) Background  
Surgical site infections (SSI)  are the second most common cause of nosocomial infections accounting 
for 15% of all nosocom ial infections among hospi talized patients and 38% of nosocomial infections in  
surgical patients.  In obstetric  patients, infectious morbidity ( i.e. SSI, end ometritis) occurs in 5 -10% of 
cesarean sections , which is 5 -fold higher than vaginal deliveries. SSI is costly,  as evidenced by a two -

fold increased risk of death from SSI.  Additionally,  there is increase d risk of SICU admission s and 
emergency room readmissions.   
Chlorhexidine  is a chemical antiseptic that is effective against  gram positive and gram negative 
bacteria  and has been shown to  reduce  skin microflora/colonization .  However, it is not clear if  it 
decreases the risk of SSI  and other postoperative morbidities . Chlorhexidine has both bactericidal 
and bacteriostatic mechanis ms causing membr ane disruption and is also useful  against fungi and 
viruses.  Further, c hlorhexidine  is thought to be more effective  than other antiseptic agents  because 
of its rapid action, persistent activity (even when exposed to bodily fluids  i.e. blood ), and residual  
lasting effect.  
Historically, c hlorhexidine  has been studied and used in orthopedic and cardiac implant surgeries . 
Research on the use of chlorhexidine for SSI prevention in cesarean sections is limited. The national 
average for birth by cesarean section is approximately 32 .8% of all birth s, and the number of 
deliveries by cesarean section at Mount Sinai Medical Center is comparable. This study in tends to 
evaluate the effectiveness of a preoperative  chlorhexidine g luconate (CHG) cloth application  and its 
potential effect in reducing SSI in patients undergoing cesarean section. Patients will be randomized 
to one of two groups: cloth application with a pre-operative CHG cloth  at home on the night before 
and the morning of surgery  (approxi mately 3 hours prior to the scheduled procedure)  or application 
of a placebo cloth ( a fragrance free  commercial  cleansing cloth ). 
3) Setting of the Human Research  
Research will take place at Mount Sinai Medical Center . Patients will be recruited 2 days 
before their scheduled cesarean section during their pre -admission appointment on labor 
and delivery,   of the Klingenstein Pavillion at 1176 Fifth Avenue.  
4) Resources Available to Conduct the Human Research  
Researc hers will have access to al l patients scheduled for a cesarean section  at Mount Sinai Medical 
Center . About  1800 deliveries by cesarean section occur each year at Mount Sinai . Of these, 
approximately  1000 are scheduled c esarean sections.  Accordingly,  there should be  approximately 
1000  eligible patients  per y ear. Based on our rate of  SSI (6%) and the objective of a 67 % decrease  in 
SSI rates and expected rate of eligible patients who do not consent at 10%, 683 patients should be in 
each grou p for a total of 1365  participants.   We aim to recruit 683patients  per group to account for 
patient drop out or non -compliance.  
 
Eligible study participants will be approached privately on the labor and delivery floor when they 
come to their pre-admission visit 2 days before their scheduled cesarean section. The nurse who 
sees patients at this visit will  ask if she is interested in participating in the study. If she agrees the

nurse will notify a study team member  to consent the patients and i s not involved in the cesarean 
section surgery.  
Sage Products Inc, a healthcare product manufacturing company, will be providing the CHG cloths 
and the placebo cloths, commercial cleansing cloths.  
Each research staff  member involved in this study has completed all training necessary to conduct 
human research and the research team has years of experience in clinical research and extensive 
experience conducting clinical research at Mount Sinai Medical Center.  
5) Study Design  
a) Recruitment Methods  
Eligible study participants will be approached for enrollment during their pre -admission testing 
visit at the Martha Stewart Center at MSH or the patient’s BPP visit at the MFM/OBGYN FPA 
practice at e E 98th Street.  
Once a patient is c onsented, she will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 arms of the study: the 
eligible women will be randomized to use of a 2% chlorhex idine  gluconate (C HG) cloth  or placebo 
cloth  (a fragrance free cleansing  cloth). Participants will be blinded to the arm  in which they have 
been assigned.   
b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
The study will be offered to women at > 24 weeks gestation  who are scheduled for a primary or 
repeat cesarean section . Exclusion criteria include allergy  to chlorhex idine  unplanned or 
emergency cesarean section .  
c) Number of Subjects  
We aim to enroll 1356 participants,  678 patients in each group . About 1800 deliveries by 
cesarean section occur each year at Mount Sinai. Of these, approximately 1000 are scheduled 
cesarean sections. Based on our rate of SSI (6%) and the objective of a 67% decrease in SSI rates 
and expected rate of eligible patients who do n ot consent at 10%, we plan to enroll 1356 patients 
in total to account for drop -outs or non -compliance. This number was modified last year based 
on our sponsor monitoring report in order to account for patients who delivered early or forgot 
to complete the  pre-op wipe treatment . We currently have 1,338 enrolled and need 18 more for 
recruitment completion.   
d) Study Timelines  
After informed consent has been obtained, t he duration of the subject 
participation will occur from the time they present for preoperati ve admission

testing until 6 weeks post procedure.  We expec t to complete enrollment by 
September 1, 2019 and complete data analysis by November 1, 2019.  
e) Endpoints  
The primary outcome will be SSI and postpartum endometritis . Secondary outcomes include 
other maternal complications or interventions, neonatal ICU admissions, maternal length of stay 
or readmissions.   
f) Procedures Involved in the Human Research  
This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 
shower in reducing SSI in patients undergoing cesarean section. Patients will be 
randomized to one of two groups: administration of a 2% CHG cloth  at home on the night 
befo re and approximately 3 hours prior to cesarean delivery on the  morning of the 
surgery or cloth  with the placebo  (commercial cleansing cloth ). Patients will receive a 
phone call, text message, and/or email reminder to apply the wipes (method of 
PrepCheck re minder will be decided by the patient).  Currently, there is no wash or cloth 
used prior to cesarean section as a standard of care.  
Sage Products Inc will be blinding the study groups. The study team will be provided with 
pre-prepared packages that contain a 4 digit number indicating the product. Only Sage 
Products Inc will know which number indicates which group. Patients, recruiters,  and 
statisticians will all be blinded. Once data has been analyzed, Sage Products Inc will 
inform the study teams as to which packages contain  the CHG product number and which 
contain the placebo.  
Each patient will be assigned a unique identification code . The code will be linked to the 
name and date of birth in an encrypted password -protected linking key code file which 
will be stored on the PI’s personal network folder in the Hospital IT server, accessible by 
the PI only. The data will be stored in a sep arate password -protected database by the 
unique identification code. The database will be stored on a secure desktop at Mount 
Sinai hospital.   
There is minimal risk associated with the use of CHG  in a surgical setting .  Use of CHG  in 
surgery has be en well  described in the litera ture as safe with minimal risks. Enrollment in 
this study does not place a patient at increased risk over other patients undergoing a 
cesarean section . The only potential unforeseeable  and minimal  risk is an allergic reaction 
to the chlorhexidine gluconate.

Data collec ted will include demographic variables such as age, parity, BMI, race will be 
collected, as well as gestational age, number of previous cesarean sections, time from 
incision to delive ry, type of anesthetic, and type of wound closure . Maternal outcomes 
including EBL, length of incision to delivery, length of opera tion, type of skin closure, type 
and use of prophylactic antibiotics, type of skin incision , type of skin closure, indication  
for cesarean, number of prior cesarean sections, and parity.  Charts will be reviewed 
through the 6 week post partum visit in order to determine how well the skin at the 
incision site is healing. If patients do not visit Mount Sinai Medical Center for thei r 2 week 
wound check, they will be called and asked the following questions: Were you treated for 
wound infection? Did you experience wound separation or any other wound 
complications?

N/A 
h) Data Management and Confidentiality  
No specimens will be sent out or received in this trial.  
All data is de -identified; patients are followed by subject number. Identifiable patient 
information (consent forms & consent documentation) are kept separately from any data 
collected. All consent docu mentation  is stored in a locked cabinet  at 5 East 98th Street, 2nd Floor . 
Identifiable enrollment statistics are kept in a password -protected computer (Excel) spreadsheet 
that is only accessible by members of the research team on a departmental J Drive.  
Data will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis. Statistical an alysis will be performed by SAS 
using X 2 test or Fisher exact test (categorical variables) and student t test or Mann -Whitney U 
test (continuous variables). Statistical significance will be  set at p<0.05.

Dr. Joanne Stone  has years of experience in research and clinical practice and is qualified to serve 
as the principal monitor to ensure the safety of participants.  All adverse events, subject 
compliance with the protocol, drop outs, and all study data will be closely monitored and 
reviewed on an annual basis.  
Standard of care and labor floor protocol will be followed in order to ensure  standard of care for 
all cesarean sections.  
If there is  a temporary or permanent suspension of the study, in addition to the PPHS, the FDA 
and clinicaltrials.org will be notified.  
j) Withdrawal of Subjects  
There are no anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn from the 
research without their consent.  
6) Risks to Subjects  
The risks to subjects are inherent to the cesarean section  process itself outside of the study. The only 
difference in care is use of chlorhexidine gluconate  in one arm of the study. This may result in a 
decreased rate of infection morbidity.  
If used as instructed, the only potential unforeseeable risk is an allergic reaction to the chlorhexidine 
gluconate. Allergic reaction could include itching or hives, swelling in your face or hands, swelling or 
tingling in your mouth or throat, chest tightness, and/or trouble breathing.  
The patien ts in our study are all scheduled for cesarean section by the patient’s physician.   The 
inherent nature of cesarean section  requires  an abdominal surg ery.  As standard of care, a ll women 
in this study will be provided with  analgesia.   In addition, enrollme nt in this study will not alter the 
current strategies regarding cesarean section . 
There is always the risk of loss of confidentiality; however, there are procedures in place to minimize 
this risk. To ensure confidentiality, the following system will be ad hered to: When subjects are 
enrolled in this study, they will be assigned a unique identification code.   Corresponding medical 
record numbers for each code (key  code) will be stored in a password locked document on the MFM 
server that can be accessed only by members of the research team. At the conclusion of the data 
extraction, the outcome variable will be assessed and the key codes to the medical record numbers 
will no longer be necessary and that information will be permanently erased from the key code  file. 
Electronic data with identifiers will be encrypted according to Data Security Standards .

7) Provisions for Research Related Harm/Injury  
The patients will receive standard obstetric care and have access to the obstetric staff (physicians, 
nursing )  as well as all of the resources on the labor floor including the use of the ORs, blood bank, 
continuous fetal monitoring. Any potential adverse events are inherent to the operative delivery  
itself and  regardless of the study.  Any complications that occur during cesarean section will be 
managed by the obstetricians and anesthesiologists. As standard of care, a physician is present 
during a cesarean section and is experience in managing complications. The patient is billed as per 
standard scheduled cesarean section regardless of complications due to the surgery.  
 
8) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Direct benefit to subject is unknown. However, t he potential benefit is that we may find a 
reduction in infectious morbidity related to the cesarean section surgery.  
9) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
The patients will be approached by the nurse during pre -operative appointment  to determine 
if they are willing to be included for randomization. The ir participation will not require any 
additional examin ations . All research -related discussions will be held in a private location . 
Any questions will be answered and fully discussed to  maximize patient comfort.  If they 
choose to participate they will be randomized and receive care within the accepted 
standards.   If a patient must be called to find out how the wound is healing, the research 
team members placing the class will not leave a message or speak to anyone except the 
patient herself. When called, she will be asked if she can discuss the research study at that 
time, ensuring patient privacy and comfort.  
 
10) Economic Impact on Subjects  
There are no foreseeable costs that subjects may incur through participation in the research.  
11) Payments to Subjects  
There will be no payment to subjects.  
12) Consent Process  
The patient will be consented during the pre -operative appointment and informed  consent will be 
obtained in a private location . As eligible  participants had been scheduled for cesarean section prior 
to arrival, t he patient ’s doctor has already decided that this procedure  is necessary and planned. A 
copy of the consent form will be av ailable in referring doctor’s offices and the OB clinic, so that 
subjects will have some information about the study ahead of time, although consent will be
